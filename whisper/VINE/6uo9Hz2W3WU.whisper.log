[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800]   Man, my name's Andrew.
[00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.960]   I'm one of the pastors here, and we are so grateful that you are here, whether you're
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.080]   in the room, whether you're online with us right now, whether you're in the overflow
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.640]   just outside or anywhere else in the building right now listening to this.
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.400]   We're so glad that you are a part of this, that you are here with us.
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.340]   I cannot be more excited about the journey that is ahead of us as we start the second
[00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.240]   half of our Exodus series here today.
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.960]   And I honestly believe, and I'm not just saying this, but if this is your home church, if
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.280]   this is where you fellowship, if this is the place where you're connected in community
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.080]   and you come here, I believe that the next 14 weeks of your life will truly be transformative
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.940]   to you.
[00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.640]   Because we're not here to play church, amen?
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.840]   Let me try that again one more time.
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.800]   We're not here to play church, amen?
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.400]   We're here to open our hearts and our lives to the transformative work of God's power.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.920]   And you know, I said the very first words that I said at the beginning of our Exodus
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.440]   series back in the middle of April are no more important than right now as we start
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.000]   the second half today.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.800]   And the words are this, that there is nothing more powerful than truly being set free.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.320]   Nothing more powerful for you, for your family, for your marriage, for your work, for your
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.800]   sphere of influence than you truly being set free.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.680]   Set free from the things that hold you bound to the patterns of this world.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.240]   Set free from the things that hold you enslaved to addictions and brokenness and hurt.
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.960]   Set free from the things that the enemy has done, is trying to do, and will do in your
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:36.960]   life.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.080]   Set free to live the kind of life that Christ has always created you to be.
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:47.640]   Over the next 14 weeks, we are unpacking what I believe is the most central spiritual journey
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.200]   that there is in our scriptures.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.760]   It's the journey of Israel going from their slavery in Egypt to their freedom in the desert,
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.000]   receiving the formation of their national identity in the desert and wilderness.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.480]   And then some 40 years later, walking with their freedom into the promised land, into
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.200]   all the things that God has for them.
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.600]   In the next 14 weeks, we're journeying with Israel through all of this.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.200]   But the next 14 weeks is not about Israel.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.560]   It's about you.
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.880]   It's honestly about you.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:19.960]   It's about your journey.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.360]   The book of Exodus is merely a backdrop to the journey that God actually has on his heart
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.080]   for you.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.760]   And that journey, as we've been talking about in this series, has five movements to it.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.160]   I talked about this in the first half of the series.
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.280]   Slavery, promise, liberation, identity, home.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.520]   And those five things are the ways that there are five kind of movements in the book of
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.160]   Exodus in those five things.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.680]   And what we're starting today and over the next 14 weeks is the final three of those.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.800]   Liberation, identity, and home.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.200]   And incorporated within the liberation, identity, and home, which is basically chapter 7 of
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.920]   Exodus onwards, what's capsulated in there are some of the deepest spiritual truths that
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.240]   there are for not only you getting freedom, but you being able to stay in your freedom.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.520]   Paul would write many years later, "You are free.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.520]   Now be free."
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:16.080]   In other words, we have a tendency as humans to receive freedom, but then fall back into
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.360]   our old habits.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.840]   You're going to see over the next 14 weeks that this was Israel's issue.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.580]   That they received freedom, and yet it was so hard for them to get Egypt out of themselves.
[00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.560]   And then they would fall back into patterns of old thinking and patterns of ways.
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.520]   But in the next 14 weeks, we're going to see some things that I believe will set you.
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.960]   If you hear them, if you apply them, if you think about them, pray about them, receive
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.920]   them, they're going to set you on a path not just to be free, but to truly be free.
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.520]   Are you with me, church?
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:52.000]   The word Exodus itself, as I said right at the start of this series, means a departure.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.960]   And one of the questions I asked right at the beginning of the series I wanted to ask
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.160]   you again as we start the second half of the series today, and that is, what is it that
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.740]   you need to depart from?
[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.480]   What is it that is in your heart that you're wanting to depart from?
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.160]   And our departure point, the slavery that we have that we want to leave and move away
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.080]   from will be different for every single one of us here.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.680]   Some of us it might be an addiction, an addictive behavior to something.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.560]   Some of us it might be some emotional, unhealthy emotional attachment to things.
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.240]   Some of us it might be mistakes that we've made in our businesses and in our marketplace
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.000]   work and that we've never really been able to forgive ourselves for.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.080]   For some it might be abusive relationships, whether in the past or currently, that you're
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.280]   struggling to be free from.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.160]   From some it's hurt.
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.480]   It's hurt that has been spoken to you, done to you, whatever that might have been that
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.720]   you've carried around for you for years and you've not been able to shake the reality
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.720]   of that hurt.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.520]   It'll be different for every single one of us.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.320]   But if you're anything like me, there is a point of departure for you.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.040]   There is something where you're saying, "I want to be free from this thing.
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.600]   I don't want this thing to hold around my heart, hold around my life anymore.
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.520]   I don't want this thing to be the thing that's going to direct my future.
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.640]   I want to be liberated into the identity that Christ has me in the home that he's called
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.640]   me to.
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.960]   And as I move in the trajectory of the Spirit of God, I want to feel that liberation so
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:23.840]   that I can not just be free, but so that I can be an instrument of liberation for others."
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:30.200]   And if this is your home church, then honestly the next 14 weeks, I believe, will be life
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.640]   transformative for you.
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.640]   I believe the whole…
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.640]   I can't express…
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.000]   It's so hard to express this in a way that really is my heart.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.200]   As your pastor here, my heart is that you would be free.
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.120]   My heart is so much that you would take a hold of everything we're going to be doing
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.720]   over these weeks with all the different speakers and all the different ways, with the devotional
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.800]   book that we're giving you, all the resources we're providing for you, so that you would
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.600]   taste and know that the Lord is good.
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.880]   Amen?
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.600]   That's Exodus.
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.600]   That's what Exodus is all about.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:10.400]   It's not a story about a nation in the past that we can learn some historically nice things.
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:16.240]   Exodus is a pattern of renewal and revival for today.
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.240]   And God is the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.920]   And what we see Him do for the Israelites, He is still doing for His people today, and
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.080]   He's going to do for you.
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.360]   So where are we?
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.440]   Where are we in the story?
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.560]   Where are we in the Exodus today as we step into the second half of what's ahead?
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.280]   Well, to help with that, let me give you a little bit of a recap of the journey that
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.040]   we've been on so far and all the things that we kind of sense that God has been teaching
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.040]   and informing us about in the first half of the series.
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.080]   We started back in mid-April in chapter one, and in chapter one, we're introduced to a
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.420]   couple of realities.
[00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:55.620]   There is this Egyptian authority structure around a person called Pharaoh.
[00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:59.440]   And Pharaoh has seen that this immigration group, this group of immigrants that have
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:04.020]   come into his nation over the last hundred years or so, have now grown to such a large
[00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:08.280]   size that he's afraid for his power.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:12.960]   In fact, we're introduced to the reality of the feeling of inadequacy and the feeling
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.360]   of kind of like, you know, sort of insecurity.
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.120]   Because Pharaoh is totally insecure, even though he's the most powerful figure in the
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:25.120]   world at that point with an empire that's stretched larger than any other empire in
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.120]   that moment.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.680]   He sees this immigrant group, and he's frozen in fear.
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.440]   The insecurities wreck him.
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:37.320]   And what we saw in week one is that insecurity is always the primary brokenness that drives
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.960]   the oppression of others.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.580]   Any oppression that you'll ever find in your life, anything that you ever find weighted
[00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:48.040]   down on, or any enslavery that ever comes to you, comes from this root of somebody's
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.400]   insecurity.
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.500]   Somebody who felt threatened, somebody who felt jealous, somebody who felt like they
[00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.360]   needed to do something to someone else to make those persons smaller so that they could
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.360]   be bigger.
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.880]   Insecurity is the primary brokenness that drives the oppressions of others.
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.280]   But what we saw in week one was this incredible thing.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:12.120]   Two brave Hebrew women who were midwives, who had been ordered by Pharaoh to kill all
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:17.400]   of the male Hebrew boys, refused to do it, drew a line in the sand, and said, "The only
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.880]   authority that we're going to stand under is the authority of God."
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:29.240]   And in the bravery of putting their own lives on the line, they start the Exodus journey.
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:33.320]   We see in the beginning of chapter two, two other women who come along.
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:37.680]   First we see Moses' mother, who now that the decree has gone beyond just killing the
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:43.960]   baby boys, it's now taking young Hebrew boys and drowning them in the river of the Nile.
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:50.480]   And so she takes her child, Moses, and places him in a basket, refusing to allow him to
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:56.960]   be drowned, and sets him off down the Nile River, letting him go in trust of God, knowing
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:02.040]   that if I place him in this ark, just like how Noah had placed the animals in the ark
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.960]   and let this go, God will do something amazing.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:09.320]   And so God then takes another brave woman, Pharaoh's daughter.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.880]   And Pharaoh's daughter sees this Hebrew baby in the basket in the Nile, and she knows that
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:18.960]   she should turn the basket upside down and drown the child, but instead she stands against
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:24.720]   the decree of her father, takes this child, and brings this child into her household in
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:28.080]   order to be raised as a prince of Egypt himself.
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.080]   And we learn in the second week something quite profound.
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:38.280]   Stories of redemption and freedom so often occur in the very same places where the worst
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:43.480]   acts of oppression have occurred.
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:46.440]   And Moses grows up in Pharaoh's household, conflicted.
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:51.240]   Oh man, he is so conflicted in his identity, because he knows that his skin and his blood
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:56.040]   is Hebrew, but his clothes and his household and his culture is Egyptian.
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:00.660]   And he's being raised, potentially, to take over the leadership of Egypt by Pharaoh himself.
[00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:05.400]   So he's being raised within a Pharaoh culture, knowing that he's wearing Hebrew skin.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.880]   And this conflict of identity is a difficult thing for Moses.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.200]   He doesn't know, am I an oppressor or am I one of the oppressed?
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.200]   And he's caught in the middle of that tension.
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:19.140]   And one day he sees an Egyptian beating up one of his fellow Hebrews, and he's so incensed
[00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:24.840]   in anger that he murders that Egyptian, and in doing that realizes he's crossed the line.
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:29.480]   And he needs to flee from Egypt, flee from all the identity and all the things he knew,
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.480]   and he has to run away.
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:35.320]   And we learned that week something very important, that the starting point of all of our Exodus
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:41.080]   is when we realize that we're all carrying broken identities around with us that cover
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:44.440]   up the real person that we truly are.
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:49.920]   And part of our freedom in Exodus is to deal with some of those broken identities, to enable
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.240]   them to shift and to change in our lives.
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:58.120]   And we see the end of chapter 2 how God begins to do that.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:03.240]   God shows up for the first time in the story, and he presents himself and he says, "Here's
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.240]   what I've seen.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:09.480]   I've seen the slavery and the misery of my people, and my heart is turned towards them."
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.560]   And he says, "I am in my compassion coming down to help them."
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:17.360]   And we learned something really important that week, that it's compassion, not judgment,
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.920]   that is the fuel for Exodus.
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.560]   And judgment is a reality in the process of Exodus, and we're going to see that actually
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.560]   today.
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.960]   But compassion is the fuel for Exodus.
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:28.960]   Compassion is the starting point.
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.840]   God didn't show up and go, "I'm going to judge."
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:35.000]   He shows up and says, "My heart is broken."
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.120]   So in order to respond to that, he then calls Moses.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.200]   In the middle of the desert, burning bush.
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:44.280]   And Moses draws over in chapter 3 towards this burning bush, and he recognizes that
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.520]   there's something behind the bush.
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:49.360]   And God speaks and says, "Remove your sandals, for the ground that you're standing on is
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.360]   holy ground."
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.720]   And what God is doing is saying, "I've moved in compassion."
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:58.200]   But the first point is to meet with Moses intimately on that broken level that he's
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:02.160]   in, and invite him to take his sandals off so the nakedness of his foot would touch the
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.140]   Spirit of God on the ground.
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.800]   God was calling his people back to intimacy with him.
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:15.800]   And we learned that week that all of our Exoduses, God doesn't call us to stand back and watch.
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:20.120]   He invites us to draw in and connect.
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:23.840]   God wants us to be close and intimate with him.
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:27.520]   Exodus is not something where we go, "Oh wow, that's cool."
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:31.920]   Exodus is an intimate, personal journey with God.
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:36.200]   Well not surprisingly, Moses in the rest of chapter 3 kind of freaks out a little bit.
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.640]   And he kind of comes before God and he says, "I don't know if I'm adequate to do this.
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.120]   I don't know if I've got the skills to do this.
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.360]   I can't talk properly.
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.120]   I'm not very much a good leader.
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.640]   I've actually killed somebody before.
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.840]   My resume is pretty bad."
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.560]   And God begins to speak to him and says, "It doesn't really matter about your resume.
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.920]   What actually matters is about what I'm about to do with you.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.400]   And here's the hard thing, Moses.
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:59.240]   I'm going to call you to go back to the very place that you fled from.
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.800]   I'm going to call you to go back to the very place of your brokenness.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:07.480]   Because unless you go back there, unless you go to the very root of the place of your brokenness,
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:08.480]   there will be no liberation.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.720]   There will be no freedom for you."
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:15.560]   And we learned something that week that I think is so important that we have to understand.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:19.080]   That our Exodus doesn't begin when we have it all sorted out.
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:23.680]   Our Exodus actually begins when we take the very things that we have and allow those things
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.680]   to be before God.
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:30.160]   When we actually go back to the very places of our greatest brokenness and have the strength
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.160]   to do so.
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:36.760]   Our Exodus actually begins when we're willing to break away from our comfort and step towards
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.000]   the unknown.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   That's how it starts.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.480]   You see, it would have been easy for them to stay in the place of comfort.
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.840]   But there was no Exodus for Moses in the place of comfort.
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.760]   His comfort was the desert where he had raised a new family.
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:52.920]   And God says, "No, you need to go back to Egypt and get into a place where you're uncomfortable,
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:57.360]   where you're going to have to deal with some of the stuff that is buried deep inside of
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.360]   you.
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.720]   Only then will you be truly free."
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.760]   And we learned that that has to be our journey too.
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:07.640]   As hard as it might be, we have to allow the Holy Spirit to uproot the deepest things in
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:11.320]   us if we truly want to be free.
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:16.480]   Well in chapter 4, Moses turns to God and says, "Well, how am I going to do this?"
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.120]   God says to Moses, "Well, what is in your hand?"
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:21.680]   And he realizes he's got a shepherd's staff in his hand and God begins to do all these
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.880]   crazy things with the shepherd's staff in his hands.
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:28.120]   And he's trying to teach Moses something that we learned that week.
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:31.480]   That it's not actually, again, about who we are having it all together.
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:36.880]   It's actually about this reality that in taking the things that God has given us, even the
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:43.360]   broken things in us, and relinquishing control of them, that's when God can step in and begin
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.360]   to do it.
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:48.480]   And we learned that week that some of us actually don't move into Exodus because we're trying
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:52.520]   to control, we're trying to establish that control for ourselves.
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:56.460]   And it's in the relinquishing of control, giving it to God, that we actually enable
[00:14:56.460 --> 00:15:02.760]   Him to show us what control truly looks like, being free with Him.
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.840]   Also in the confidence of this idea that God is with them.
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:10.120]   In chapter 5, Moses and Aaron, they actually go before Pharaoh for the first time and they
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.840]   say, "Let my people go."
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:16.760]   It's a bold, declarative statement and Pharaoh's like, "Who are you?
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.600]   Who are you?
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:19.600]   Who is this God?
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:20.720]   I don't know this God.
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.320]   I'm not going to let your people go.
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:26.640]   In fact, just because of your arrogance and asking that, I'm going to double down on my
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:27.800]   slavery for them.
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.080]   I'm going to make it even worse for them."
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:33.920]   And we learned that week that sometimes in our journeys of Exodus, it actually gets worse
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.920]   before it gets better.
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:39.360]   It's not always a straight path, that there are curves and there are twists and sometimes
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.800]   it's harder before it gets better.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:45.160]   And at the end of chapter 5, it's really difficult for Moses and Aaron because not only does
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.600]   Pharaoh hate them, but their own people start to hate them as well.
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:53.000]   "Oh, you've come here to try to help us, but now you're making it worse for us."
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.720]   At the beginning of chapter 6, there's this cry in Moses and Aaron.
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:01.080]   They feel disillusioned and they feel hated and they feel hurt and they feel like they've
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.400]   been a failure.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:07.200]   And God shows up again with His compassion and says, "Just you wait."
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:11.280]   He says, "You have to understand my heart and my nature.
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:15.960]   You have to understand who I am and how I stand with you.
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.960]   I'm going to do some things.
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:21.640]   And just because I call you into freedom, it doesn't mean the journey is going to be
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.480]   pain-free.
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:27.200]   Just because I call you into a place of freedom, it doesn't mean it's going to be easy, pain-free,
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.200]   suddenly like this.
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.200]   I'm not Santa Claus, I'm God.
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:33.400]   And I'm going to come and work in such a way that over time you're going to be rebuilt
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:37.720]   to the person that I want you to be, but it's going to require a submission to the journey
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:38.720]   that I have you on."
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:41.960]   And in chapter 6, he tells them what that journey is going to be like.
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:45.640]   He says, "I'm going to take you as my own children.
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:46.960]   I'm going to bless you.
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:50.640]   I'm going to break off the chains from you, and then I'm going to give you new life."
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:57.160]   And he lays out the process of Exodus, this idea of taking, blessing, breaking, and giving.
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.760]   And we saw that week that when Jesus is in the upper room just before he's about to get
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:06.480]   arrested and he's doing the Passover meal with his disciples, he picks up from Exodus
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:08.280]   chapter 6 that process.
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:13.920]   And he takes the bread in the cup, and he blesses it, and he breaks the bread, and he
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:18.000]   gives it to his disciples, saying, "This is the way that freedom and liberation always
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   come.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.560]   This is what the cross of Jesus is going to be about.
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:25.160]   The life, death, and resurrection of Jesus is an Exodus for everybody, because God takes,
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.960]   he blesses, he breaks, and he gives.
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:28.960]   Amen."
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:32.880]   Wow, that was about 10 weeks of teaching in 5 minutes.
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:36.200]   Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.200]   All right.
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.880]   You're caught up on Exodus.
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:43.680]   But the question is, what happens next?
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:48.960]   And as we step into chapter 7 today, we step into this moment where Aaron and Moses are
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:53.720]   called once again to go before Pharaoh and say, "Let my people go."
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.400]   Can you imagine how they must have felt?
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:01.360]   I mean, this must have been the worst thing for them.
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:04.800]   Because last time when they went before Pharaoh and said, "Let my people go," Pharaoh doubled
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.560]   down on his slavery on the Israelites.
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:10.600]   And now here they are, and God says, "Okay, it's time to go again.
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.120]   You're going to go in front of Pharaoh again."
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:16.400]   And you're probably thinking, Moses and Aaron, if you're Moses and Aaron, you're probably
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:20.560]   thinking this, "I don't know if this is going to work."
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.560]   Are you with me?
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:30.720]   And perhaps, as we start this 14-week journey ahead of us, and as I've been standing here
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:34.120]   telling you that this is going to be the most transformative thing in your life and that
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:37.920]   God is going to move you into new freedoms that you've never felt before, perhaps some
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:41.760]   of you, maybe you're into the Exodus and you've been following the series and everything's
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:46.960]   been great so far, but there's something in your mind where you're like, "I don't know
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:50.080]   if this is going to work.
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:54.760]   I don't know if God's really going to come through for me."
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:58.760]   And the same feeling that Moses and Aaron felt as they stepped before Pharaoh again
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:02.840]   is perhaps the same feeling that many of us in this room feel as we step into these 14
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:03.840]   weeks.
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:04.840]   "I don't know if God's really going to do this.
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.560]   I'd like to get freedom from my addiction.
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:09.840]   I'd like to leave those pains behind me, but I'm not even sure if I can do that.
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.040]   I'm not sure if God's going to do it.
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:12.480]   I'm not sure if He's going to come through."
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.840]   And we're filled with this questioning.
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:19.800]   And if that's you, I want you to know you're in a good place, because Moses and Aaron had
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:25.800]   no idea as they stepped towards Pharaoh in chapter 7 what was going to happen in 7, 8,
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:26.800]   9, and 10.
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:31.600]   They had no idea that the plagues were going to come, that the Passover would happen, that
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:37.440]   God would redeem them and release them, that they would see the waters of the Red Sea parted,
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.320]   that they would go to Sinai and receive the law.
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:43.920]   I mean, they had no idea about everything that we know is in the story ahead.
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:49.020]   And I want you to understand that you have no idea what God has reserved for your story
[00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:51.160]   in the next 14 weeks.
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.040]   He's got so much ahead.
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:57.240]   It's almost like if God could take you and plug you into His brain to see everything
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:01.600]   that's about to happen for you in the next 14 weeks, you'd be, "Woohoo!"
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:07.280]   But maybe right now you're like, "I'm not even sure if this is going to work."
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:08.280]   Anyone with me?
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:15.320]   So I want to pray as we open God's Word together today that God will make this work for you.
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:19.740]   Father, I just thank you so much for the people in this room online, the overflow, and anywhere
[00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:21.220]   else that they're listening.
[00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:24.940]   Father, we just are grateful that you are at work.
[00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:30.860]   And Lord, we come to you like Moses and Aaron, maybe with that question, "I don't know.
[00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:33.060]   I don't know if I can get free from this."
[00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:40.420]   But Lord, we come to you also in that faith, that little mustard seed of faith that Moses
[00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:47.980]   and Aaron had, knowing that you can do immeasurably more than we could ever ask or imagine.
[00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:48.980]   We thank you for this.
[00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:49.980]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:50.980]   Let me read this to you.
[00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:51.980]   Everybody okay?
[00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:53.300]   All right.
[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:57.340]   This is Exodus chapter 6, starting 28 into chapter 7.
[00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:01.780]   "Now when the Lord spoke to Moses in Egypt, he said to him, 'I am the Lord.
[00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:04.060]   Tell Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, everything I'm about to tell you.'
[00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:11.260]   But Moses said to the Lord, 'Since I speak with faltering lips, why would Pharaoh l-l-l-l-listen
[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:13.980]   to me?'"
[00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:16.780]   I added a little bit there, by the way, for dramatic effect.
[00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:21.900]   "Then the Lord said to Moses, 'See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh, and your brother
[00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.860]   Aaron will be your prophet.
[00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:26.800]   You are to say to him, 'Everything I command you and your brother Aaron is to tell Pharaoh
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.460]   to let the Israelites go out of his country.'
[00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:34.140]   But I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and though I multiply my miraculous signs and wonders
[00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:37.420]   in Egypt, he will not listen to you.
[00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:41.420]   Then I will lay my hand on Egypt, and with mighty acts of judgment I will bring out my
[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:46.900]   divisions, my people, the Israelites, and the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord.
[00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:53.300]   When I stretch out my hand against Egypt and bring the Israelites out of it, Moses and
[00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:58.020]   Aaron did just as the Lord commanded them."
[00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:00.300]   An amazing set of Scriptures here.
[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:04.180]   And in here is the starting point of the liberation phase of Exodus.
[00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:08.420]   Because in here we see some pretty interesting things.
[00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:13.180]   We see an idea of hardened hearts, and we see a man who has faltering lips and God telling
[00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:15.020]   him to do it anyway.
[00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:19.660]   We see judgment and justice, and we see things that maybe when we read it we're like, "That
[00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:20.700]   sounds a little harsh.
[00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.620]   How does that all work out?"
[00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:24.700]   And here's the crazy thing.
[00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:30.380]   The thing that actually unlocks this passage is not actually a deeper dive into God himself.
[00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:35.880]   The thing that actually unlocks this passage is a deeper dive into Pharaoh.
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:41.220]   Because so much of what God does in just these small verses right here is related to who
[00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:46.660]   Pharaoh was and the kind of culture in which Pharaoh operated.
[00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:50.300]   And so to understand these passages here, we have to actually understand a bit more
[00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:51.840]   about Pharaoh.
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:56.140]   And to help you with that, I want to take you back to Egypt now, back to the very land
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:57.380]   of the Pharaohs.
[00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:00.860]   And I want to take you to one of the most famous places in all the world so that you
[00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:05.620]   can understand a bit more about the culture that surrounded Pharaoh himself.
[00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:11.540]   Let's have a look.
[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:14.780]   Pharaoh.
[00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:19.220]   It was a title that demanded respect, power, and fear.
[00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:23.820]   Originally derived from the Egyptian compound, which means "great house," the title came
[00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:28.460]   to mean the "Great High One" or the ruler of the Great High House.
[00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:33.440]   It was used as early as the first dynasty and designated to the one person in Egyptian
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:38.340]   society who had all ruling power and authority over everyone else.
[00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:43.960]   He owned all the land in Egypt, enacted all the laws, collected all the taxes, and defended
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:47.600]   Egypt from invaders as the commander-in-chief of the army.
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:55.620]   In other words, he was the central figure to all Egyptian life, culture, and society.
[00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:58.060]   But importantly, he was more than that.
[00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:02.820]   You see, in Egyptian life, religion was central to absolutely everything.
[00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:07.260]   And one of the important roles that Pharaoh played was an intermediary between the gods
[00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:09.160]   and humans themselves.
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:14.820]   So for example, in any religious ceremony in ancient Egypt, Pharaoh deputized for the
[00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:15.820]   gods.
[00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:20.540]   And in this way, Pharaoh was not just in control of all of the practical life of Egypt.
[00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:24.660]   He was actually in control of all of the spiritual life as well.
[00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:29.300]   When Pharaoh acted, it was as if the gods themselves were acting.
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:41.940]   And in this way, Pharaoh was in control of the whole universe.
[00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:47.060]   So not surprisingly, the pharaohs lived in unparalleled grandeur and splendor.
[00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:51.000]   In life, their palaces were designed to project power and abundance.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.540]   And in death, their pyramids were designed to do so for all eternity.
[00:24:55.540 --> 00:25:00.380]   The pharaohs surrounded themselves with only what was fitting for one who was a god, and
[00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:05.460]   that was vast displays of glorious wealth and opulence.
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:09.300]   A simple case in point can be found right here near the Sphinx in Giza.
[00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:13.340]   Well, none of those ancient palaces are still intact today.
[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:16.700]   But throughout Egypt, you can actually discover elements of their wealth.
[00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:19.860]   And I want to show you one of those examples right here.
[00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:23.660]   This pillar is actually made of a red granite.
[00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:27.620]   And this red granite is not found in any quarries in Egypt at all.
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:32.500]   In fact, scholars believe that these pieces of granite were actually sourced from Southern
[00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:39.100]   Africa, placed on boats, sent up the Nile River, and then finally constructed here in
[00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:40.100]   Cairo.
[00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:44.580]   Now, get your head around that, because all of that is designed to communicate one simple
[00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:49.380]   thing, that anyone who ever comes into this place would know, that the person who owns
[00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:52.820]   it is really, really, really powerful.
[00:25:52.820 --> 00:26:13.300]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:19.780]   So a pharaoh who was god, and a palace outrageous in its opulence and wealth, all designed to
[00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:23.580]   communicate power, prestige, and authority.
[00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:28.140]   So stop for a moment and think what it would have been like for Aaron and Moses to receive
[00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:33.380]   the call of God to go to Pharaoh and command the Israelites to be let go.
[00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:37.060]   And then stop and think what it would have been like for them to walk into the actual
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:43.260]   palace, to be surrounded by all that power and wealth, and actually only being there
[00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:46.980]   with the clothes on their backs and those two staffs in their hands.
[00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:49.940]   Do you imagine how much fear they must have felt?
[00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:51.620]   But then here's the crazy thing.
[00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:54.260]   They're in that palace, and they're confident.
[00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:59.060]   They're putting their trust and their faith in God, that even in the place of Pharaoh's
[00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:03.900]   greatest comfort and authority, he would actually bend to their will.
[00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:07.120]   I mean, none of that actually makes sense.
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:12.460]   And I've come to think that faith often operates that way, often in a place where things don't
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:13.460]   make sense.
[00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:18.340]   I mean, I think you could actually define faith like this, "radical obedience amidst
[00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:20.860]   crazy overwhelming odds."
[00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:27.500]   Or put it in Moses and Aaron's terms, "two feeble shepherd's staffs against red granite
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:28.500]   pillars."
[00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:33.220]   Now, the question you have to ask yourself is simply this, "Would you have gone?"
[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:57.340]   It really is staggering to me, the faith that they must have had.
[00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:00.460]   Oh, thank you.
[00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:04.860]   It's really staggering to me how they must have felt walking into that place, believing
[00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:08.740]   that Pharaoh might respond, dressed in their shepherd's clothes with their little staffs
[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:12.340]   amongst all that opulence and power and wealth.
[00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:15.100]   And in fact, Moses, when he's telling you the story, he's honest about it.
[00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:16.420]   He says these things.
[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:18.740]   He says, "I'm a person of faltering lips.
[00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:20.200]   How am I going to be able to do this?"
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:23.180]   But then on the other side, God says, "I am the Lord.
[00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:25.740]   Go to Pharaoh and tell him what I'm about to tell you."
[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:31.940]   There's this tension in the passage between how Moses felt about himself and his own inadequacies
[00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:37.900]   and how God was, and how God was calling Moses not to focus on his resume, but to focus on
[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:40.820]   God, to focus on who he is.
[00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:45.020]   And he was saying, "When you go before Pharaoh, you don't go in the strength of your own power.
[00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:47.280]   You don't go in the strength of how smart you are.
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:50.420]   You don't go in the gifts and the talents that you have.
[00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:52.340]   You go literally in obedience.
[00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:53.980]   You go in faithfulness.
[00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:56.020]   And when you go, I am the Lord.
[00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:57.380]   I'm the one who's going to work.
[00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:58.820]   I'm the one who's going to be powerful.
[00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:01.100]   I'm the one who has all of that authority.
[00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:02.620]   You don't need any of that.
[00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:04.620]   You just need to be faithful."
[00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:08.140]   Which is crazy to me, because so often we don't think of it that way.
[00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:10.260]   We think it is about how strong we are.
[00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:14.420]   If I'm going to get my freedom, if God's going to give me Exodus, it's about how I deserve
[00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:15.420]   it.
[00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:18.320]   I need to prove that I deserve it to him, or I need to work really hard, or do more
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.460]   quiet times, or whatever it might be.
[00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:23.860]   We begin to think that it's defined by who we are.
[00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:26.260]   Oh, I'm a person of faltering lips.
[00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:28.140]   How could this ever happen?
[00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:32.600]   And God shows up and says, "It's not about you.
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:34.940]   It's not about your inadequacies."
[00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:39.900]   God never calls you to be adequate for the tasks that he puts before you.
[00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:42.340]   He calls you to be faithful.
[00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:47.840]   And being faithful, by its very definition, means you're not adequate.
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:50.540]   Because if you're adequate, you wouldn't need faith.
[00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:52.000]   You'd just do it.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.100]   And you'd do it because you were adequate to do it.
[00:29:54.100 --> 00:30:00.380]   See, God puts us in situations, circumstances, where our adequacy is not enough to achieve
[00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:01.380]   freedom.
[00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:04.500]   You will not get lasting freedom in your life through your own adequacy.
[00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:10.020]   It'll only come through your faithfulness to what God calls you to do, even when it's
[00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:12.220]   above and beyond what you think you can be able to do.
[00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:13.880]   Are you with me, church?
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:18.300]   What really blows my mind about this whole scenario is that then God, later on in the
[00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:22.900]   passage, actually tells Moses and Aaron that although they're going to go and speak what
[00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:25.100]   God asked them to speak, they're going to fail.
[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:28.260]   He says, "I'm going to harden Pharaoh's heart, and he's not going to listen to you."
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:32.060]   Can you imagine what this is like for Moses and Aaron?
[00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:34.420]   It's like, "Okay, all right, we'll go.
[00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:37.380]   We'll be obedient to what you're asking for us, and we're going to get there.
[00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:39.740]   And you've already told us that it's going to fail.
[00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:41.620]   What's the point in going?"
[00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:43.060]   Are you with me?
[00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:50.440]   But it's because we humans define success so differently to how God does.
[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:55.300]   We define success through achievement, through outcomes, through whether something works
[00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:59.180]   out or not, or we achieve something, or we win or not.
[00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:02.620]   And you can imagine Moses and Aaron going, "Well, if you told us this is going to fail,
[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:04.780]   why would we even bother going in the first place?"
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:08.820]   And God's like, "I define success differently."
[00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:15.700]   God does not define success by what you achieve, but how you obey.
[00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:19.340]   That's the definition of success in God's eyes.
[00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:26.260]   And the number one thing that will set you up in the next 14 weeks towards your freedom
[00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:35.340]   will be the small, simple moments of obedience that no one ever knows about.
[00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:39.620]   I know firsthand that the greatest moments that I've ever had as a pastor have been moments
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:47.540]   that no one has ever seen, moments where I made a simple decision to close that website,
[00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:55.220]   a simple decision to write that check, a simple decision to whatever it might be in the workplace,
[00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:58.500]   whatever it might be here in church, whatever spiritual thing, those simple things that
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:03.740]   I did in my heart that no one else saw, no one else knew about, those are the places
[00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:10.140]   that when I get into heaven, God's going to go, "Wow, Andrew, you did that," not, "Look
[00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:12.100]   at how big of a church you had."
[00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:14.260]   Are you with me?
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:18.420]   Your success is defined by the obedience of your heart, not by the achievements of your
[00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:19.420]   hands.
[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:22.980]   I'm going to say that again because I just made that up and it was pretty good.
[00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:27.620]   Your success is going to be defined by the obedience of your heart, not by the achievements
[00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:31.300]   of your hands in God's heart.
[00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:33.180]   Now notice what happens next.
[00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:37.940]   Chapter 7 verse 1, "Then the Lord said to Moses, 'See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh,
[00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:40.060]   and your brother Aaron will be your prophet.
[00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:44.220]   You are to say everything I command you, and your brother Aaron is to tell Pharaoh to let
[00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:46.180]   the Israelites go out of his country.'"
[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:50.340]   Now this sounds like it's contradicting everything I just said because I just said it's not about
[00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:55.420]   Aaron and Moses' resumes and God's going to do it all, but then in the very next verse,
[00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:59.700]   God says, "I'm going to make you like God before Pharaoh," which kind of sounds like
[00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:03.020]   suddenly Moses is going to look like a god to Pharaoh.
[00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:05.820]   It suddenly sounds like suddenly Moses is going to be mighty and powerful and have it
[00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:09.020]   all together and Pharaoh is going to see him and go, "Oh my gosh, there's a greater God
[00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:10.020]   here than me."
[00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:12.620]   That's not exactly what's happening at all.
[00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:17.700]   In fact, the way to unpack this is to understand the Egyptian culture that sits behind it.
[00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:23.020]   See, whenever anybody went into the palace of Pharaoh and went towards the throne room
[00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:28.460]   with Pharaoh and had an audience with Pharaoh, they would always address Pharaoh by the deity
[00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:34.440]   of the god that they worshipped because Pharaoh was the representation of all the deities
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:35.980]   on earth.
[00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:37.180]   That's what we saw in the film, right?
[00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:39.220]   He represented all the deities.
[00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:44.260]   So if an Egyptian servant went to Pharaoh in his court, he would say, "Oh, great and
[00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:46.300]   mighty Ra," which was the sun god.
[00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:50.660]   "Oh, great and mighty Ra, I would love for you to do this for me," or, "This is what
[00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:52.100]   I say to you," or whatever.
[00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:55.700]   So Pharaoh would always be addressed by the deity that was being worshipped.
[00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:57.180]   Are you with me?
[00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:59.220]   So what God's doing here is really fascinating.
[00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:06.420]   He says, "I'm going to send you in, and Moses, you're going to be like God in Pharaoh's presence,
[00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:08.740]   and Aaron is going to be your prophet."
[00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:13.740]   In other words, there's suddenly going to be another deity in Pharaoh's presence.
[00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:16.940]   And he's not used to that because he's the only deity in the land.
[00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:20.960]   But I'm going to make you like God, a deity before him.
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:22.900]   And here's the crazy thing.
[00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:25.860]   That's going to completely subvert his power.
[00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:28.420]   That's going to completely change everything for him.
[00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:31.540]   And he's not going to know how to respond or react to that.
[00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:33.780]   And here's even the most beautiful thing.
[00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:39.460]   You're going to go and do this dressed in smelly shepherd's clothes, and you're going
[00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:41.660]   to be like God to him.
[00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:48.860]   And he's going to look at you, and he's going to go, "How can an impoverished nomadic shepherd
[00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:51.540]   be a representative of a god?"
[00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:52.540]   That's what he's going to think.
[00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:56.980]   How can this one be a representative of God?
[00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:02.100]   Have you ever been in a situation where you feel completely overwhelmed and completely
[00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:03.100]   inadequate?
[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:05.060]   Recently, I was at this event.
[00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:08.020]   It was a small private fundraising event, and I was sitting on a table with eight people,
[00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:11.540]   and I had the responsibility of trying to raise some funds for a charity organization
[00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:12.860]   in the city.
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:16.380]   And around the table of eight people, three of them were US dollar billionaires.
[00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:18.500]   US dollar billionaires.
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:23.620]   I have never felt more insignificant in my life than sitting around a table with three
[00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:28.220]   US dollar billionaires who were incredibly powerful, incredibly successful, really nice
[00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:29.220]   people.
[00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:31.940]   I was hoping that they would be mean and angry and horrible, but they were really nice people
[00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:32.940]   too.
[00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:36.020]   Not only super wealthy, but nice.
[00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:39.340]   And I'm sitting there around this table, and I'm listening to their stories, and I'm feeling
[00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:42.780]   like I'm kind of like sliding under the table a little bit, you know, like.
[00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:47.460]   And as I'm sitting there, I honestly, I hear God's spirit whisper in my ear.
[00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:56.340]   How could an impoverished Hong Kong church shepherd be a representative of a God?
[00:35:56.340 --> 00:36:03.260]   And I felt like what God was saying is, do you understand where true power lies?
[00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:06.500]   And these were really nice people and great people, very successful people, which I really
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:07.500]   admire.
[00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:11.060]   But God was saying, true power does not lie in the things of this world.
[00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:17.700]   True power lies in salvation, redemption, and hope, and grace, and love.
[00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:23.820]   And I tell you, in this room, online, in the overflow, there are representatives of this
[00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:25.380]   God.
[00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:28.900]   You need to understand that when you're called into a situation where you feel inadequate,
[00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:32.900]   overwhelmed, when you're in a spirit of influence, where you feel like you don't have any power,
[00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:38.200]   the tendency naturally is for you to shrink away, but you need to rise up in those moments.
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:41.500]   You are a representative of the living God.
[00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:45.300]   Jesus has died and shed His blood so that you would know new life.
[00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:49.980]   The same spirit that was in Christ that raised Him from the dead is now in you.
[00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:52.860]   Take your stand.
[00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:56.940]   You're a representative of God's true hope.
[00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:01.140]   And I think Hong Kong more than ever needs people to go, "I am a representative of the
[00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:04.180]   one true God."
[00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:08.340]   That's not arrogant on our part, but that's us putting ourselves into a place where we
[00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:14.460]   can administer the hope of Christ, knowing that we are in Christ in the world.
[00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:16.260]   Are you with me?
[00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:21.220]   Now, very quickly, notice what happens next.
[00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:26.060]   Verse 3 says this, "But I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and I will multiply my miraculous signs
[00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:27.140]   in wonders in Egypt.
[00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:28.780]   He will not listen to you."
[00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:32.660]   This is weird because they've been called to bring freedom.
[00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:36.060]   They've been called to ask for the Israelites to go, and then God says, "I'm going to harden
[00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:38.620]   Pharaoh's heart, and he's not going to listen to you."
[00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:42.660]   And scholars have debated for years and years and years around what does it mean for God
[00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:44.140]   to harden someone's heart?
[00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:45.940]   How do we get our heads around?
[00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:51.860]   Because on the surface, what it sounds like is how can a just God harden someone's heart
[00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:54.020]   and then punish them?
[00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:55.020]   That doesn't seem like a just God.
[00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:58.580]   It doesn't kind of seem like a God we would want to worship.
[00:37:58.580 --> 00:37:59.980]   What is happening here?
[00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:04.620]   Well, what's sitting behind all of this is the reality of judgment and the judgment that's
[00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:05.620]   going to come.
[00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:09.060]   I said earlier that compassion was the fuel for Exodus, but that doesn't mean that there
[00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:11.020]   wasn't judgment within the Exodus story.
[00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:15.020]   And we're going to see this week, next week, and the week after what that judgment turns
[00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:16.740]   to look like, tends to look like.
[00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:21.140]   But in this moment, God says, "I'm going to harden Pharaoh's heart."
[00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:23.780]   It's important that you understand the word that Moses uses here.
[00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:24.980]   It's a Hebrew word, of course.
[00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:26.940]   It's the word k'cheh.
[00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:32.060]   The word literally means, or k'cheh, the word literally means to fasten a hold of or
[00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:34.940]   to strengthen something.
[00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:38.540]   Now what's really important about this is that you have to understand that for God to
[00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:44.140]   harden something with this word, what it means is that God strengthens the direction that
[00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:46.500]   something's already on.
[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:50.300]   In other words, that there's already been a decision, there's already been a turning
[00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:54.060]   of the heart, there's already been a posture of the heart, and God is going to come and
[00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:58.100]   fasten, strengthen that direction.
[00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:01.180]   The modern day equivalent would be the idea of doubling down.
[00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:04.020]   Somebody's made a decision, and now they're doubling down on that decision.
[00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:05.580]   Does that make sense to you?
[00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:09.820]   So when it says that God hardens Pharaoh's heart, what it's really teaching us here is
[00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:12.480]   that God sees the direction of Pharaoh's heart.
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:17.560]   He looks into Pharaoh's heart, and he sees that he's already decided never to let the
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:18.560]   Israelites go.
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:21.140]   We know that because we've seen that in chapter 5.
[00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:23.500]   In chapter 5 where he said, "I don't know this God.
[00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:24.780]   I'm not going to bow to this.
[00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:25.780]   This is not going to happen."
[00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:27.660]   He's already set the direction of his heart.
[00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:29.380]   It's really important that you understand this.
[00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:32.900]   When it says in the text that God hardens Pharaoh's heart, it's not saying that God
[00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:36.460]   is making Pharaoh do something he doesn't want to do.
[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:40.380]   It's not talking about God overtaking the free will of Pharaoh and suddenly taking a
[00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:45.720]   soft pliable loving heart and making it hard and nasty so that he can punish him.
[00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:49.460]   What it's saying is the direction of Pharaoh's heart had already been made up.
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:54.020]   The decision had already been made, and God's going to fasten that, strengthen that so that
[00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:56.300]   it'd be brought into a place of judgment.
[00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:59.540]   I want you to see the judgment element of this.
[00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:03.660]   Verse 4 onwards, "Then I will lay my hand on Egypt, and with mighty acts of judgment
[00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:07.380]   I will bring out my divisions, my people, the Israelites."
[00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:12.260]   Again, to understand this, you have to understand the Egyptian cultural context here.
[00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:17.000]   At the time that Moses is standing in front of Pharaoh, there was already in circulation
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.020]   what was called the Book of the Dead in Egypt.
[00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:23.840]   The Book of the Dead was a story of lots of different deities and how they interacted
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:24.840]   with humanity.
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:26.580]   One of those deities was Anubis.
[00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:33.300]   Anubis was the deity of the decision of the future, the eternal future of people.
[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:37.860]   In this story that's found in the Book of the Dead, this person called Ammi comes before
[00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:41.780]   Anubis, a little bit like in a throne room like Pharaoh.
[00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:46.140]   As Ammi comes before Anubis, Anubis is going to make a judgment as to whether Ammi will
[00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:49.140]   have eternal good life or eternal bad life.
[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:53.300]   The way that he judges, as you can see in this beautiful hieroglyphic, is he takes his
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:57.140]   heart and he places his heart on a scale.
[00:40:57.140 --> 00:41:00.120]   Then on the other side of the scale, there's a feather that's placed there.
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:01.620]   It's the feather of righteousness.
[00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:03.300]   That's what it's called in the Book of the Dead.
[00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:07.980]   There's this heart of Ammi on one side of the scale and the feather of righteousness
[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:09.020]   in the other.
[00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:14.300]   The idea is that Anubis is going to judge the heaviness of Ammi's heart.
[00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:18.140]   If that heart has any evil in it, if that heart has any evil actions in it, then the
[00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:23.620]   scales are going to tip in the wrong balance and then he'll be sentenced to a life of death.
[00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:27.020]   That's basically the way it worked within the Egyptian thinking.
[00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:33.180]   Now God knows all of this and he picks up on all of this and he says to Moses, "Aaron,
[00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:36.380]   you're going to go and I'm going to judge Pharaoh.
[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:39.100]   I'm going to harden his heart because he's already made a decision.
[00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:44.020]   The scales already are imbalanced and I'm going to show that the scales reveal that
[00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:45.980]   Pharaoh's heart is wanting."
[00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:50.620]   By whether you look at it through the Hebrew culture where they know that Pharaoh's heart
[00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:55.500]   is bad because of their slavery for so many years or if you look at it through the Egyptian
[00:41:55.500 --> 00:42:00.900]   culture which already understands that there's a scale of righteousness that has to be balanced,
[00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:04.740]   Pharaoh's heart is wanting.
[00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:10.900]   God is saying, "I'm going to judge that heart publicly in Egypt so that all the Egyptians
[00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:18.620]   will see exactly this, that there is an imbalance of the scales of Pharaoh's heart."
[00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:23.620]   Because actions are just, whether you look through the Hebrew lens or the Egyptian lens
[00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:26.780]   of the actions and thoughts that were in his heart.
[00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:27.780]   Is that helpful?
[00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:28.780]   Now, I want you…
[00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:29.780]   We're finally…
[00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:30.780]   We're finishing here.
[00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:31.780]   I know I'm almost done.
[00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:32.780]   Are we okay for five more minutes?
[00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:37.460]   This is the best five minutes so that's why I want you to be here.
[00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:43.900]   Says this, verse five, "And then the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord when I stretch
[00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:47.820]   out my hand against Egypt and bring the Israelites out of it."
[00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:49.620]   So why does God judge?
[00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:51.900]   Why is God going to judge the weight of Pharaoh's heart?
[00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:56.180]   Why does he harden the heart in order to show that judgment, to show the direction that
[00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:58.900]   Pharaoh had already decided in his own free will?
[00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:02.900]   It's so that Egypt would come to know that I'm God.
[00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:06.540]   Now when you read it like you see it on the screen here, it almost sounds like God's
[00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:10.340]   like, "I'm going to judge Pharaoh and all of Egypt so they will know that I am the
[00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:11.340]   mighty God."
[00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:17.660]   You know, like it almost has this kind of resonance of like that evil laugh to it, right?
[00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:20.380]   It's not what God is doing here.
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:25.940]   What's fascinating to me is that the word that Moses chooses for "will know" is
[00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:30.540]   the very same word that's used to speak of biblical marriage and the intimacy physically
[00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:32.900]   that's found in biblical marriage, to know someone.
[00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:37.160]   In other words, it's an incredibly intimate word.
[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:41.700]   It's a word that is defined by relationship and personal invitation.
[00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:46.220]   So God is not saying, "I'm going to judge Pharaoh in Egypt so that everybody will know
[00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:48.540]   how bad they are."
[00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:52.100]   He's saying, "I'm going to judge Pharaoh and I'm going to judge Egypt so through the
[00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:59.020]   judgment all will come to know, would know intimately, personally be available to come
[00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:00.300]   into relationship with me."
[00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:02.940]   This is Him offering grace.
[00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:05.580]   This is Him saying that there is this grace element to it.
[00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:09.200]   There is judgment, but mercy triumphs over judgment.
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:13.460]   We come to see that in its fullness in the work of Jesus Christ, but even here in the
[00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:17.060]   first Exodus, we see mercy triumphing over judgment.
[00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:18.580]   Yes, there will be judgment.
[00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:19.860]   Yes, the heart is hard.
[00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:23.860]   Yes, the heart needs to be dealt with, but there is mercy that is coming and that mercy
[00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:25.300]   is even for the Egyptians.
[00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:26.900]   And here's the crazy thing.
[00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:33.060]   In Exodus chapter 12, verse 38, a whole bunch of Egyptians go with Israel to the promised
[00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:40.900]   land of their own free choice because they had come to know, to see, and to taste that
[00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:43.580]   the Lord is good.
[00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:49.420]   So what does all this have to say to you as we start this second phase of our Exodus
[00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:51.740]   series?
[00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:57.180]   You need to understand that God indeed has the prerogative and the ability to take a
[00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:06.540]   hard heart and harden it, but He also has the power to take a hard heart and soften
[00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:08.980]   it.
[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:16.400]   He also is a God who is able to offer to the Egyptians themselves, the ones who had
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:26.240]   enslaved His people for close to 400 years, and say, "If there is a kernel, a mustard
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:32.800]   seed of your desire to turn towards me, I will soften your heart."
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:34.720]   Pharaoh's heart had been made up.
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:35.920]   His heart was already there.
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:40.920]   God had already perceived that there was no mustard seed of faith or hope or turn or change
[00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:44.640]   for Pharaoh, so He hardens His heart towards that aim.
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:51.080]   But for everybody else, everybody in Egypt, the offer was there.
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:56.200]   Would you allow me to soften your heart so that you would know that I am your God?
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:46:00.640]   As we start this second phase of Exodus, that's the call on us too.
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:05.360]   Because if you're anything like me, your heart has moments of great, beautiful softness and
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:09.880]   joy and it also has parts of hardness to it.
[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:13.720]   And perhaps you're here today and you recognize that there is some hardness in your heart
[00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:15.520]   too.
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:18.080]   This whole passage has been about God examining the heart.
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:19.080]   He doesn't look at the surface.
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:20.480]   He doesn't look at the resume.
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:22.660]   He doesn't look at the achievements.
[00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:24.880]   He looks constantly at the heart of humanity.
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:28.040]   And He looks at Pharaoh's heart and says, "Hmm."
[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:30.240]   But He looks at your heart.
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:34.060]   And He looks at even the hard parts of your heart.
[00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:38.840]   And He looks at your hope and your faith and your desire for His mercy.
[00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:43.720]   And He has the power to take even the hard things in you and soften them.
[00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:47.640]   For some of you, your hearts are hard because it's been years of pain and hurt from something
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:49.080]   that's happened to you in the past.
[00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:53.520]   For others, your heart's hard because you're continuing to make choices, habits and choices
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:56.920]   that bring you into sin and harden your heart.
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:04.220]   Whatever it might be for all of us, God's grace, His goodness can soften even the hardest
[00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:06.220]   parts of who we are.
[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:11.940]   And the number one thing that you begin the liberation phase of Exodus in is to bring
[00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:16.300]   your heart before God and say, "I want to know you.
[00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:18.280]   I really want to know you.
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:21.820]   And I know that in the work of judgment and justice, you take all the things in my heart
[00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:24.060]   and you judge them fairly.
[00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:27.260]   But your ultimate heart is to know.
[00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:30.300]   It's for me to know you and you to know me."
[00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:33.620]   And that's how I want to pray for you as we start this journey together.
[00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:41.620]   I wonder whether you'd stand with me and I'm going to pray for us.
[00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:46.140]   And if this has been helpful for you today, through all the things that we've looked at,
[00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:49.820]   I want to invite you just to open your hands with me.
[00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:54.460]   And Father, we come before you now in this moment.
[00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:58.260]   And Father, we come before you with our hearts.
[00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:05.620]   And Father, if the people in this room online, Overflow, or anything like me, there's parts
[00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:08.220]   of our hearts that are hard.
[00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:13.540]   And there might be lots of different reasons why that's the case, but the reality is there's
[00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:16.240]   hardness there.
[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:20.360]   As we were praying before the service, we particularly had the idea that some people's
[00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:26.140]   hearts are hard because of the way that they feel about family members.
[00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:30.500]   Maybe there's been an argument in your family or with your children or your spouse or with
[00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:34.900]   a relative in your wider circle of your family, and there's, maybe you haven't talked to them
[00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:38.220]   for years, maybe there's just something there and there's a hardness in your heart towards
[00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:39.220]   them.
[00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:43.260]   And again, maybe for some very good reason for some of you, but the hardness is still
[00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:46.540]   there.
[00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:52.180]   The Holy Spirit says, "If you really want to be free, allow me to come and weigh your
[00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:53.180]   heart."
[00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:58.380]   And you see, because of Jesus Christ, there's no feather of righteousness.
[00:48:58.380 --> 00:49:00.660]   We don't follow the book of dead.
[00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:04.180]   We follow Jesus Christ, his life, death, and resurrection.
[00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:11.060]   So no matter how heavy, how hard our hearts might be, his scales always balance in our
[00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:13.020]   favor.
[00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:15.780]   And the grace of Christ has been offered to you.
[00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:22.700]   The blood of Jesus shed for you so that you would always know the softness that comes
[00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:26.880]   by his Spirit, his forgiveness, and his grace.
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:31.820]   And so if you're here today and there's some hardness there, your starting point of Exodus
[00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:38.100]   in the second part of the series is just to invite God to come and soften you.
[00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:47.140]   Half the battle is just owning the hardness, to say, "There is this part of me that I struggle
[00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:48.140]   to deal with.
[00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:49.140]   I struggle to make soft."
[00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:58.700]   Holy Spirit, I come to you today, and I ask you, I confess, I recognize the hardness,
[00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:05.380]   and I ask you now to come and over the next 14 weeks, soften that hardness in me.
[00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:07.980]   I can't do it in my own strength.
[00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:14.460]   I'm not adequate enough for the task set before me, but you are God.
[00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:16.460]   You are God.
[00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:20.300]   You could do abundantly more than I could ever ask or imagine.
[00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:22.380]   Soften me, Lord.
[00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:27.540]   Soften me, Lord, because I want to be free.
[00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:30.860]   Take a moment just to bring that prayer before the Lord, and then we're going to close our
[00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:31.860]   time in some worship together.
[00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:33.860]   together.
