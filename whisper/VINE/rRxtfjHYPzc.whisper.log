[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   and meeting you.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   Lord, we pray all this in Jesus' name.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Everyone says, amen.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Amen.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Have a seat, have a seat.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   My name's Andrew.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   I'm one of the pastors here.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   If you've just joined the Vine or only been a part of us
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   for a little while, we're so glad that you are here with us.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   We're in a series on the Holy Spirit.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   We've been opening the scriptures around the Spirit each week.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   And I want to share out of a passage of the Apostle Paul writing
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   to the church in Ephesus.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   Paul was a prolific man of prayer, loved to pray for people,
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   loved to pray for his church.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   He was deeply pastoral.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   And in the book of Ephesians, he actually prays a number of times.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   Often when Paul prays, he's not just kind of like offering a prayer.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   He's not just like Lord Jesus, amen kind of thing.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   He's actually trying to communicate and teach something to the church.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   His prayers are some of the deepest theological things that are found
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   in his word.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   And we're going to unpack them and get a sense of how he wants
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   to pastor his church.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   And in the prayer I'm going to read you here this morning,
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   he says something about the Spirit.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   And what he says about the Spirit is one of these paradoxes
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   that we're going to be unpacking throughout our series,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   these both and elements of the Spirit.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   And this one is particularly key because this one draws us
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   into a deeper knowledge of God himself.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Let me read this to you from Ephesians 1, starting in verse 15.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   He says, "For this reason, ever since I heard about your faith
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   I have not stopped giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers."
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   And here's what I pray.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   "I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   the glorious Father, may give to you the Spirit,"
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   or in other translations, "that the Spirit would give to you
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   wisdom and revelation so that you may know him better."
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Father, our prayer this morning as we gather in this room
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   and the overflow online is that that would happen in us.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   That as you open your scriptures to us, as you speak a fresh word to us,
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   that we would come to know you deeper, better.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   And Lord, I believe that you have a personal thing
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   that you want to say to every person in this room here this morning.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   And just as Emma has so beautifully prepared us,
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   as we've brought that sacrifice of praise to you,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   as we've entered your gates with thanksgiving in our hearts,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Lord, we pray now that you would reveal the innermost sort of passions
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   and love that you have in your heart for each person in this room.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   We pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Everyone says.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   So a number of years ago, my wife and I, Christine,
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   we were in Bible school in Auckland in New Zealand.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   And my wife's from New Zealand, so when we decided to go to Bible school,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   we looked at lots of places we could have gone to.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   We decided New Zealand was the place.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Auckland was the Bible school that we wanted to go to.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   And it was a great place. We loved it.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   But we always wanted to get out of Auckland and explore New Zealand.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   So on one particular long weekend, we decided we were going to take
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   a four-hour drive up to the north of New Zealand.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Now, the further you go north in New Zealand, the less people there are.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   There's not a lot of people in New Zealand in general.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   But the further north you go, the less people there are.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   And a friend of ours had a house in a place called Russell,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   which is kind of northeast on the North Island.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   And so from where we were in Auckland to get there, it's about four hours.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   We had lectures all day, so we had to stay.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   But we decided to leave at around about six o'clock at night.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   About three hours in, around about nine o'clock,
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   we knew that we would enter into this village.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   And we had seen on the map that this village was the last,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   largest populated area before we would end up where we were going to go.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   And so if we needed to eat, if we were going to eat some food,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   we needed to stop in this particular village.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   On the map, it looked like a decent-sized village.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   And I've come to learn that New Zealand kind of exaggerates
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   the size of their towns on maps to make themselves feel a bit better.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   And so we arrive at this town at like nine o'clock at night,
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   and it literally was like way smaller than we were predicting.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   It only had like one little road where there were some restaurants.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   And we were there, like I say, about nine o'clock.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   And so most of the restaurants there were shut.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   In fact, there was only one restaurant that was open
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   at that particular time on that particular night.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Only one restaurant.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   I wonder if you could imagine with me what type of restaurant it was
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   that was open at nine o'clock at night in the middle of nowhere in New Zealand.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Anyone get it?
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   It was a Chinese takeaway restaurant.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Yes, it was.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   And not just a Chinese takeaway restaurant.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   It was a Hong Kong-style Chinese takeaway.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   I could tell right away this looked like a dai pai dong from Mongkok or something, right?
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Like it just reeked Hong Kong.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   And of course, we were homesick at the time,
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   and I was like, "Oh, my gosh, this is so amazing.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   There's a Hong Kong Chinese restaurant. It's open."
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   And it kind of, in the front of its door,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   it had like the beads that kind of go down to keep the flies out and stuff.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   And I said to Chris, I said, "I'm going to go in there,
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   and I'm going to whip out my best Cantonese."
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   You know, like I haven't spoken Cantonese for a while.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   This is going to be awesome.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   And so sure enough, I was like, "Wah, wah,"
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   and I jumped into this restaurant.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   I'm like, "Wah, ay-ya.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   What would I like to eat today?
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Wah, wah, wah, please, please, please.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   I don't want to eat char siu fan.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Please, quickly, quickly. It hurts so much."
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   So, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   So I whip out my amazing, immaculate, perfectly pronounced Cantonese.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   The man behind the counter, he's like 80 years old.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   He's like the kind of guy when you go into a restaurant here,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   has like a cigarette hanging out of their mouth, you know,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   like with the ash that's like, you know, going to fall into the thing.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Like he's 80 years old, the oldest Chinese guy I think I've seen in a while.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   He's like so wrinkled and stuff.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   But as he hears my Cantonese, his face, he starts to smile.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   Like this smile comes, literally years of youth enter his face.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   It's like he suddenly becomes a new man.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   He's so excited that there's somebody in his restaurant speaking Cantonese.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   It's almost like him and his wife must have decided
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   they're going to plant a restaurant in the middle of this Chinese village
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   or this village in New Zealand, and they get there,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   and they speak no Chinese for miles around, right?
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   He's never heard Cantonese for years.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Here's this white guy speaking Cantonese in his restaurant.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   He thinks this is the greatest thing that has ever happened to him.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   So he starts speaking Cantonese back at me.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   And I tell you, he was like...
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Little does he know that I've exhausted every piece of Cantonese I have ever spoken.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   But he doesn't know that. He's just going...
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   I'm like, "Hi, hi, hi."
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Pretending like I know what's going on, right?
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   At one point, he tells a joke. I'm assuming because he laughs.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   I'm like...
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   At one point, I know he asked me a question
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   because at the end of what he was saying, he's like, "Ah."
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   It's like...
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   And then he pauses and looks at me, and I'm like...
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   And then he just keeps going.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   This guy, like years washed off him
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   and somebody had entered in and spoken just a little bit,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   a little utterance of the native language that was in his heart.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   Every human being is made in the image of God.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   And every human being has the same singular heart language
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   embedded in their soul.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   And it's the heart language of the Spirit of God.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   And whether they know it or not,
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   whether they believe in God or not,
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   every single human being has a longing,
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   a crying, a desperation deep within their soul
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   to connect with the living God.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   And the Spirit of God speaks.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   And when the Spirit of God speaks into the person
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   whose heart has long not heard
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   the very language that brings them alive,
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   they can't help but be changed.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   I mean, that guy in that restaurant that night
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   hearing Cantonese changed him.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   He kind of came alive.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   But I tell you what, when the Spirit of God speaks,
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   when the Spirit of God speaks a word in season,
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   when the Spirit of God says something
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   or brings something in the Scriptures alive to us,
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   it literally comes and changes and transforms us.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   The work of the Spirit of God,
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   the voice of the Spirit in our lives
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   is designed to change us, to heal our hearts,
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   to make us anew.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   What I was teaching us in week one
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   about going from disorder to order,
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   that's the purpose of the reason why the Spirit speaks.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   I mean, think about that for a moment.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   The very reason that the Spirit speaks
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   is so that He can move His people
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   from a place of disorder into a place of order.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   The Spirit communicates in order to change us.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   He changes us by communicating to us.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Does that make sense?
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   And when that voice comes,
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   when we hear it deep within ourselves,
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   everything shifts, everything begins to change.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   And like I said in week one,
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   it's because the Holy Spirit is a person.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   And because the Holy Spirit is a person,
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   He longs to be in relationship with us,
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   that connection that we can have with the Spirit.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   We saw in week one that there was this idea
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   of the fellowship of the Spirit.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   So our connection point to the Spirit
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   is found in this kind of reciprocal relationship
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   we can have in communication.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Him communicating to us so that we are changed
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   and us communicating with Him
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   and deepening our relationship with God.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   And the reason why this is all taking place
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   is because God longs to bring into all of us
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   clarity and focus.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   He loves to bring into all of us wholeness.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   It's that order that the Spirit of God
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   is moving us towards.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   He wants you to be whole,
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   to be clear about life,
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   to move out of confusion.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   When the Spirit speaks,
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   it's never to bring confusion.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   It's always to turn confusion on its head.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   The Spirit always wants to bring clarity
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   and refreshment and newness and wholeness to you.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   That doesn't mean, though,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   that every time the Spirit speaks,
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   it's gonna be something you're gonna wanna hear.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   So often when the Spirit speaks,
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   the Spirit actually does the contrary.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   He actually says something that we don't want to hear,
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   but we need to hear.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   Doesn't mean always that the Spirit
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   has such nice things to say.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Sometimes the Word comes from the Spirit
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   that actually shapes and changes
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   'cause He needs to disrupt the disorder
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   in order to bring the order.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   But no matter how it happens,
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   the Spirit's Word changes all.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   If I was to summarize it,
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   I would put it like this.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   The Spirit's goal is to communicate to you
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   so that you would receive clarity,
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   wisdom, and understanding
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   so that you would be strengthened,
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   comforted, and changed.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   That's a good slide to take a photo of
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   if you wanna take a slide photo.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   This idea that He wants to bring clarity
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   and wisdom and understanding into us
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   so that we would be strengthened,
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   comforted, and changed
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   is the work of the Spirit.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   It's that native language that sits within all of us
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   and when we hear the Spirit,
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   something within us begins to shift,
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   something within us begins to change.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   And why do we change?
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   Because the Spirit leads us to the person of Jesus.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Remember, it's Jesus that changes everything.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   And the Spirit's role is to illuminate Jesus,
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   to help us to see Jesus clearer and better
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   so that in Jesus we can be transformed and renewed.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   In the same way that Jesus' role is to reveal the Father,
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   the Spirit's role is to reveal Jesus.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   You following?
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   So it's the Spirit speaks to us in that native language
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   that all of our souls are crying out for
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   so that we would see Jesus more clearly
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   so that we would ultimately come to know the Father.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   The Spirit into Jesus, Jesus into the Father,
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   the triune Godhead at work
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   because God's voice is at work.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   This is why when Paul picks up this prayer for the church,
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   he wants to help them to understand how the Spirit
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   connects us to Jesus so that we can know the Father.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   And he mentions this next kind of and/or paradox
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   that we're looking at,
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   or the both/and paradox that we're looking at in this series.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   And it's the idea of teaching and revelation.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   Let me read this to you from Ephesians 1 verse 17 again.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   "I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   the glorious Father, may give you the spirit of wisdom
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   and revelation," or in other translations,
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   "the spirit that brings wisdom and revelation
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   so that you may know Him better."
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   Now, that's not the Spirit of God.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   Now, before I break this down into its individual parts,
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   let me step you back for a moment
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   and you need to see the whole.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   It's so beautiful what Paul is saying here.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   He's praying to the church.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   His desire for them is to know God more.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   He wants them to know God better,
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   and he understands that the only way
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   that they're gonna know God better
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   is through the work of the Spirit in teaching and revelation.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   That teaching and revelation provides for us,
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   as Paul writes it here, "wisdom and revelation."
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   It provides for us the pathway
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   to be able to get to know Jesus better.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   An analogy might be to think of this
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   a little bit like Zacchaeus in Luke chapter 19.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   You'll be perhaps familiar with the story of Zacchaeus.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   Zacchaeus, we're told in the Scriptures, was a short person,
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   and because he was short, he didn't have the stature
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   to see over the crowd in order to capture
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   a good glimpse of Jesus.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   And on this one particular day, Jesus is walking by,
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   but Zacchaeus, being small, can't see him properly
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   through the crowd, and so Zacchaeus does a smart thing.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   He runs ahead, finds a tree.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   He climbs up this tree so he can get a clear view of Jesus.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   And then Jesus and him lock eyes together,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   and Zacchaeus invites Jesus to his house,
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   and Jesus transforms not just Zacchaeus' life,
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   but his whole family life.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   It's a beautiful part of Scripture.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   I think that's analogous to what Paul
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   is trying to communicate here.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   Every single one of us, if you will, we're short in stature
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   when it comes to being able to see Jesus.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   Our sin, our brokenness, and our flesh does not work
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   to help us to see Jesus more clearly.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   Our sin is a little bit like a crowd in front of us,
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   a crowd that's taller than we are,
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   so that we're not able to be able to connect and see Jesus,
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   but God has provided for us a way that we can move up
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   above that sin, above that brokenness,
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   to deal with it, if you will.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   It's a tree of his teaching and revelation by the Spirit.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   And as we go up that tree, we actually get a clearer view
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   of who Jesus is.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   That's what Paul says here.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   "I hope that the Spirit comes to bring you wisdom
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   "and revelation so you will see him better,
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   "know him better, engage with him better,
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   "so that you can lift yourself out of the crowd
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   "towards the vision of Jesus, who changes everything."
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   I wonder whether here this morning we might have
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   some time to climb that tree together.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   I want to unpack for you what this wisdom and revelation,
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   teaching and revelation, this two sides of this
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   both and paradox of the Spirit is all about for you.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   Paul begins with this idea of wisdom.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   He uses the word wisdom here.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   He's actually talking about this process
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   of the Spirit teaching.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   I'll connect the two of them together in a moment.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   But he starts out by saying, look,
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   he's gonna bring a spirit of wisdom
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   so you can know him better.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   The Greek word that Paul chooses here for wisdom,
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   somewhat unique in this part of the Scriptures,
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   and it's a word that has a lot of different things
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   that come together to help you understand it.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   But essentially it means to illuminate,
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   to make clear, to bring understanding,
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   to give clarity.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   So the idea of wisdom is to take something,
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   now this is really important, listen to this,
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   take something that is already known
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   and help us to understand it, illuminate,
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   shine a light on something that is already present,
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   already known, and help us to understand it
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   so we can then embrace it for our lives.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   This is the concept that Paul's trying to communicate
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   about how the Spirit works in us.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   It brings us understanding, illumination,
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   teaching of what has already been given to us.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   Now this is really important that you notice
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   that what it's emphasizing is something
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   that's already been given.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   The teaching side is like, hey, I've given you something,
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   whether that's my presence in the world
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   or particularly of course the Scriptures themselves,
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   the Word of God contained for us in the Bible,
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   and he's like, my Spirit will help you and teach you
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   so that he will illuminate so that you will come
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   to a better understanding, so that you will come
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   to see Jesus more clearly.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   The reality is these are just words on a page
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   without the work of the Spirit in our lives.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   And words on a page have never changed or transformed anyone.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   They might have given somebody some knowledge of something,
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   some understanding of it, but it's not transformative.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   And what Paul's saying is my prayer is that the Spirit
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   will come to teach you, to illuminate, to reveal,
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   to strengthen, to help you to see more clearly
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   the very thing that he's already given you.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   That make sense?
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   Now Jesus himself actually taught this.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   Let me show you Jesus speaking to the disciples
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   in chapter 14 of John.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   He puts it this way.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   He says, "But the counselor or the advocate,
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   "the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   "will," notice this, "teach you all things
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   "and remind you of everything I've said to you."
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   So this is Jesus kind of taking the same concept
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   that Paul's speaking about, and Jesus is saying,
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   look, here's what you need to understand.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   The Spirit is gonna come and the Spirit
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   will teach you all things, illuminate all things.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   And remind you of the things that I've already said to you.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   In other words, there's already stuff out there.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   There's my word that I've already communicated,
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   whether that's to you directly, audibly,
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   or whether it's written down in the Scriptures.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   For them it was, of course, the Old Testament.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   He said, "In all of that, the Spirit will illuminate it
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   "so you will know me better."
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   So he will remind you of all of the things
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   that I have said to you.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   This is how you begin to climb the tree.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   Anyone here ever open the Bible and fallen asleep?
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   Come on, church, let me see the hands, be honest.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   That's pretty much every single one of us, I know.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   I've been a Christian for 30 years, I understand, okay?
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   Even as a pastor, I open the Word sometimes
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   and I'm tempted to fall asleep.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   Here's a trick.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   If you ever wanna stay awake reading the Scriptures,
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   here's a trick.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   When you open the Scriptures, before you read it,
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   just pray a simple prayer.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   Holy Spirit, would you teach me?
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   I invite you to teach me your Word
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   so I could become more like Christ Jesus.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   If you pray that every single time you open God's Word,
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   you are aligning yourself to the Spirit of God.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   You are aligning yourself to the very thing
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   that the Spirit was designed to do,
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   which is to illuminate what has already been given,
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   to teach you, equip you in what has already been given.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   Does that make sense?
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   So that's an important prayer to pray
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   when you're coming to read Scripture.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   Now, this all then brings us back to why Paul writes wisdom here
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   rather than the word teaching,
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   because the whole point is to make us more and more like Christ Jesus.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   Notice what he says.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   He says, "So that you would gain wisdom,
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   so that you may know Him better."
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   Wisdom is this Hebrew concept
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   that is beyond just knowing something.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   When the Hebrews spoke about wisdom,
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   what it was was it was a lifestyle,
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   not just a mental information thing.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   In other words, for Paul, his prayer is
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   when the Spirit teaches us,
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   it doesn't just give us right information,
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   it also leads us towards right application.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   And this is really important for Paul
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   because he wants you to understand
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   that you are a fool, the opposite of wisdom,
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   if you allow the Spirit to give you understanding
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   and you do nothing with it.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   That if you get illuminated in the Scriptures,
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   you learn something about God
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   and you learn something about His character and His ways
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   and you walk away and don't change.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   He's like, "You're a fool if that's what you think."
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   Now, the Spirit is here to bring wisdom.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   And wisdom, the wise,
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   are ones who not only are illuminated by the Spirit
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   but then decide to put that into practice in their lives,
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   decide to live differently, act differently,
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   think differently under the power
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   and the leading and the guiding of the Spirit.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   Those are the ones that have actually been taught
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   by the Spirit, Paul is saying.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   And my prayer is that you would receive
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   the Spirit that teaches you to wisdom,
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   not teaches you to foolishness,
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   teaches you to wisdom.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   So, the first part of this paradox
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   is that the Spirit teaches us the things
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   that are already there
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   and helps us to be illuminated, to understand,
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   so we can apply that into our lives.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   But then there's the second side of this paradox.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   The word he uses here is revelation.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   Think of it this way.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   The Spirit does not just illuminate
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   the word that's already received.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   The Spirit also reveals the word that is yet to come.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   This idea of revelation,
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   the other side of the Spirit's work here,
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   is literally the Greek word for revelation
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   that Paul uses here,
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   is literally translated like this,
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   to kind of disclose or to reveal
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   something that was previously unknown.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   So, notice this, guys.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   Where teaching was about taking what was known
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   and helping it to be understood and applied.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   Does that make sense? Follow that?
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   Revelation is taking the things
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   that are not previously known
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   and bringing them to us.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   So there are both of these moments at work.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   And it's really important that you understand
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   that these never contradict themselves.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   They're all from the same source,
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   and that's the Father.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   And when the Father works in this world,
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   he works by illuminating the things
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   he's already given,
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   and he brings a fresh revelation,
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   a fresh perspective,
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   a fresh idea of perhaps things
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   that we had never even thought about before.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   And both of those things work together,
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   never contradict each other.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   In fact, that's how we test
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   whether revelation is really from the God or not.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   'Cause let's face it,
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   sometimes we can hear some pretty weird things.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   Sometimes we can eat a really spicy curry
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   and have a crazy thought afterwards
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   and think that that might be Jesus.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   The way that we take revelation
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   and know that it is from him
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   is we link it to scripture.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   It will never contradict it.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   It will always work together.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   But you need to know
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   that it's not just about discovering
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   the word that's here.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   There's also the spoken word of God
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   in the here and now.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   And those things are beautiful
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   because they're both the work of the Spirit,
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   and they both help us, the tree,
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   to climb to be able to see Jesus more clearly.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   I mean, just step back from this for a moment
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   and reflect on this.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   We don't have a God
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   who decided to speak to a bunch of people
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   2,000 years ago and then went silent.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   We do have a God who spoke to a bunch of people
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   2,000 years ago,
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   captured in the word of God,
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   which is a rich depository
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   of grace and goodness and life eternal.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   But we also have a God
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   who's still speaking today,
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   a God whose voice is still at work
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   so that those souls
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   who are crying out for connection
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   come alive,
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   so that like that man in the restaurant
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   whose literally ears
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   just dropped off his face
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   when he heard that language,
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   so people can still be caught up
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   in the wonder of a God
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   who speaks in this moment.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   And when God speaks,
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   he opens up for us this idea
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   of things that might be going on in our lives,
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   maybe things that nobody else knows,
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   only God knows.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   And God brings a word or a picture
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   or even illuminates a scripture
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   that helps to transform something within us.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   And we're like,
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   so many times when people listen
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   to people speak here at the Vine,
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   oftentimes when I'm talking to them afterwards,
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   they're like, "Well, it was just like
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   "that person was speaking directly to me."
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   And I'm like, "Yes, that's the Holy Spirit
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   "at work for you,
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   "bringing a revelation
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   "of something he wants you to be aware of
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   "that you previously were not aware of."
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   It's a wonder when he does that.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   Paul, writing just to the church in Corinth,
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   unpacks this concept a little bit more.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   So I want to dig into this
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   just a little bit more for you.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   So this is 1 Corinthians 2,
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   starting in verse 6.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   He writes to the church, he says,
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   "We do, however, speak a message of wisdom
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   "amongst the mature."
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   There again, he talks about wisdom,
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   the teaching and the application of God's word,
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   "but not the wisdom of this age
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   "or the rulers of this age,
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   "who are coming to nothing."
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   So Paul wants you to know
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   that there is not just God's wisdom,
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   there's also the wisdom of this age.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   And I tell you what,
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   you will always battle as a Christian
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   between which of those two things
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   you apply to your life.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   And if you're anything like me,
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   you apply that one,
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   sometimes almost as much as you apply this one.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   This one being the word of God, by the way,
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   the wisdom of God.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   Do you know what I'm saying?
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   I think we wrestle with this, don't we?
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   The wisdom of the world,
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   which seems so tempting
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   and seems so seductive to us,
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   and God's wisdom.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   Paul says there is wisdom out there,
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   the wisdom of the world,
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   but we have a different wisdom, he says,
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   one that's been spoken amongst the mature.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   Verse seven, "No, we speak of God's mystery,
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   "God's wisdom, a mystery that has been hidden,
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   "so therefore it wasn't known before,
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   "that God has destined for our glory before time began.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   "None of the rulers of this age understood it,
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   "for if they had, they would not have crucified
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   "the Lord of glory.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   "However, here's what's been written in the scriptures,
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   "no eye has seen, no ear has heard,
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   "no mind has conceived,
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   "what God has prepared for those who love him."
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   You need to know in this room today
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   that if you love Jesus,
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   God has a lot prepared for you.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   He's prepared things for you,
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   'cause he loves you.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   Things that he's set aside,
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   things that he's prepared in his written word
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   that are to be illuminated and brought alive in your life,
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   and things that he's prepared
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   that he wants to say to you directly
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   and personally by his spirit.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   How does this happen?
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   Notice verse 10.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   "But God has revealed it to us."
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   By what?
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   By his spirit.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   "The spirit searches all things,
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   "even the deep things of God,
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   "for who among people know the thoughts of a person
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   "except that person's spirit within them?
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   "In the same way, no one knows the thoughts of God,"
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   here it is,
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   "except the spirit of God.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   "We have not received the spirit of this world,
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   "but the spirit who is from God,
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   "that we may understand what God has freely given to us.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   "That is what we speak,
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   "not in words taught by human wisdom,
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   "but in words taught by the spirit."
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   Notice this,
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   "Explaining spiritual realities by spirit-taught words."
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   That's revelation, my friends.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   I don't know about you,
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   but that's what I want in my life.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   I wanna look out on this world
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   and not see physical reality,
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   but spiritual reality.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   I wanna see spiritual reality in my life.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   I want the Holy Spirit
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   to explain spiritual realities within me
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   and spiritual realities in my city of Hong Kong
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   with spirit-taught words.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   Not from the wisdom of this world,
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   but the wisdom that can only come
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   from the one who is still speaking today.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   When we hear spirit-taught words,
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   it brings us into spiritual reality.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   So Paul is saying,
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   "Look, you need to sit with this tension
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   "of the both and and.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   "It's not just the word,
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   "it's all about the word.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   "And it's not just revelation."
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   He's like, "It's both of these things working together.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   "The word that is illuminated by the spirit
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   "to great understanding and application
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   "and the revelation of the spiritual realities
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   "of this world and of our lives
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   "by spirit-taught words that can only come from God
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   "because only the spirit searches
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   "the innermost realms of God."
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   This was happening in the gatherings
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   that Paul's early church was in in those days.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   This was happening all over the place.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   In fact, actually in Corinth,
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   it was happening so much
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   that there was kind of disorder happening in the church.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   And remember, the spirit is here to take disorder to order.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   So Paul writes to the church
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   about this disorder that's happening in their gatherings
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   because there's so many kind of things happening,
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   particularly the abuse of tongues,
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   which maybe we'll get to in another week here.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   But in this moment, he writes them to understand,
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   "Look, there needs to be order,
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   "and there can be order if you quieten down
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   "and open your ears to hear what the spirit says."
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   Let me show you this in 1 Corinthians 14,
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   verses one to three.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   He says, "Follow the way of love
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   "and eagerly desire spiritual gifts."
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   Pastor Ellison's gonna preach on spiritual gifts
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   in a few weeks' time,
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   "especially the gift of prophecy.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   "For anyone who speaks in a tongue
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   "does not speak to people but to God.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   "Indeed, no one understands that person.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   "They utter mysteries within their spirit.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   "But everyone who prophesies speaks to people
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   "for their strengthening, encouragement, and comfort."
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   I love this.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   Paul's saying, "This is why I want you
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   "to eagerly desire prophecy in your midst,
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   "because when the spirit speaks, revelation comes,
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   "it is for the strengthening,
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   "it is for the encouragement,
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   "and it is for the comfort of the church."
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   And he's like, "Why would you not want that?"
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   Like he's like, "Embrace prophecy amongst you.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   "Embrace the work of the spirit amongst you."
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   'Cause yes, he's gonna illuminate and teach you
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   and apply the word so good,
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   but he's also gonna bring that life-changing moment word
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   that speaks in your life,
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   and you're like, "How did the spirit know
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   "about that work thing that's going on?
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   "Because I haven't told anyone about it."
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   And suddenly this word comes,
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   spiritual realities by spirit-taught words,
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   that changes everything for us,
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   and like that restaurant and that guy,
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   everything drops off us,
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   and we become the people that we were created to be.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   Understanding, revelation, teaching,
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   God's word coming together
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   and making us into the people
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   that we were designed to be, disorder into order.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   Over our time together, hopefully today,
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   I've done the best that I can
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   in the teaching part,
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   helping to illuminate the scriptures
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   so that we can both know and apply God better,
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   but we wanna now take some time on the revelation part.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   And during our service at our pre-service part time,
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   and during our worship time,
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   our pastors and our prayer ministers here at the Vine,
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   they've been praying and asking
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   for specifically spirit-taught words,
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   revelation, prophetic words,
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   that are spoken to us so that we can speak them to you,
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   so that we can begin to listen
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   to the word of God that way together.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   I'm so excited about this.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   Would you stand with me?
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   And as you stand, I want you to do two things.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   Number one, everybody look at me.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   Is everybody looking at me?
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   Good looking, right?
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   Okay, you're looking at me because here's the thing,
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   do not leave.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   Hear from your pastor, do not leave.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   The Lord has something he wants to say to you, amen?
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   That's the first thing.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   Second thing, I wanna encourage you just to open your hands,
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   because as we open our hands,
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   we're in a posture of receiving before the Holy Spirit.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   And I wanna pray for us,
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   and then we're gonna listen to some spirit-taught words.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   Holy Spirit, we thank you for the teaching and revelation
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   that you have poured out on your church
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   so that we could climb that tree and see you clearly.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   And Lord, in this moment, we ask you to speak.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   Holy Spirit, would you speak?
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   Lord, I believe that you have a word
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   for a lot of people in this room,
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   a word that doesn't come from human wisdom,
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   human strength,
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   but a word that comes from your spirit.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   So Lord, we pray that you would speak.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   And that in these words that are about to be spoken,
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   many people here would come alive.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   So just keep yourself in a posture of receiving.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   I'm gonna make space now for any of the pastors,
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   prayer ministers,
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   who have a word for people in this room
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   to come forward and share that word.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   (soft music)
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   I got the word tear, tears.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   In Psalm 56, eight, it says,
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   "You have taken account of my wanderings.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   "Put my tears in your bottle.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   "Are they not in your book?"
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   So if you're someone who's really tired of your tears,
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   pause for looking for answers, but just seek God.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   I wanna echo what Beth just shared.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   It's just for those of you
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   who are maybe struggling in silent grief,
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   and you feel like,
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   and we had a similar word at 9.15,
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   that you're in grief.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   And I think especially as today's Mother's Day
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   in the area of like motherhood
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   for our ladies out there,
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   women out there who are suffering in grief,
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   something to do with your role as a mother.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   Maybe it's the loss of a child,
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   or maybe it's a miscarriage
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   or a journey through infertility,
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   something like that.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   And you feel the grief of today.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   And so there's that side, you know.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   And others who are just walking in a grief
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   that they've been holding,
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   that they feel like nobody understands
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   and that it's a silly thing to grieve for,
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   and that, yeah, I just have to store up my tears
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   and hide it from everybody.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   The word of the Scripture says this,
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   "Praise to you God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   "the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort,
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   "who comforts us all in our troubles,
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   "so that we can comfort those who are in any trouble
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   "with the comfort ourselves have received from God."
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   And one of the blessings of having a bigger church,
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   at least in terms of numbers like this,
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   is that there are people, I believe,
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   who have walked through the path that you are currently going down.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   And there's a community here that are encouraged to comfort
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   with the comfort that you've received from Jesus as well.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   And so my prayer is that the Word for you is that
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   find those people who have walked through
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   and find that space where you can share the grief that you're holding
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   so that you don't have to--
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   you know that you're not in this alone.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   God is there to comfort you.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   But I believe that there's a family,
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   the body of Christ who wants to put their arms around you
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   and walk with you in this journey as well.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   I feel like the Lord's saying there are maybe many people here
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   struggling with a lack of identity.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   You don't know who you are.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   You're trying to figure that out.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   And because you don't know who you are,
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   you don't know what you're supposed to do in this world, in this life.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   Lack of identity and lack of purpose.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   And this is an invitation to you to come to Him.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   The Father would say to you today, "Come to Me.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   I am the one that put you together in your mother's womb.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   I am the one that wrote down every day of your life
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   before one of them came to pass in My books in heaven.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   If you want to know who you are and what you are to do,
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   you will find the answers in Me."
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   I have the sense that there's someone here, a wife perhaps,
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   and you're thinking of leaving your husband.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   And I feel the Lord say there is hope in him.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   He wants to restore your marriage, your family,
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   to go to God, seek his hope,
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   and also, as Alison shared, speak with others around you.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   Let others in. Let God in. Let others in.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   Let God fight for your family and your marriage.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   This is a wisdom of the Holy Spirit by a congregant sharing this morning.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   It's about, yes, you have been chasing a lot of goods.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   Yeah, a lot of good things, good suggestions, good ideas,
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   and you kept on fighting for this.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   But what about the right thing I've been calling you to do?
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   Something that you have to give up your time, give up your efforts,
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   even though that may not seem good for everybody,
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   but that's the right thing.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   That's the one that I require you to do.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   And would you follow me?
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   Would you put down the good stuff you think
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   and be ready for that?
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   I have two things.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   One, somebody here in their left ear, they have a ringing,
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   which is causing them not to be able to sleep properly.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   And the other thing I saw was a spotlight shining on somebody,
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   and the spotlight suddenly goes off.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   Somebody here, maybe a number of you,
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   you've been in the spotlight, you've enjoyed it.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   There's been a season where the light's been shining on you,
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   and it's gone dark, and you're wondering why it's gone dark,
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   and you're feeling alone, you're missing the spotlight,
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   you're missing what it brought to you.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   And the Lord has a word of encouragement to you
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   that it's not going to be dark forever.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   He's just changing the light bulb on the spotlight,
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   and a different color is about to shine on you.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   It's a new season He's moving into,
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   He's stopped the previous season,
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   and there's a time of waiting whilst He's changing,
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   and He's about to move you into a new season
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   with a new light shining on you.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   So when the Holy Spirit gives words, it's not to show off.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   When the Holy Spirit gives words, it's because He longs to act.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   This is what we see at the beginning of Genesis.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   He creates literally by His words.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   He speaks because He wants to act.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   And so if any of those words has connected with any of you in this room,
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   it's because He wants to act on you right now.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   He wants to bring that transformation, that new life,
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   He wants to take disorder into order, and we want to pray for you.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   So here's what we're going to do.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   We're going to ask you, Upper House, Lower House, Overflow,
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   we're going to ask you to be brave if any of those words,
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   and we're not going to go at them individually so that there's a bit of anonymity,
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   but if any of those words spoke to you,
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   we want you to be brave to put your hand in the air right now.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   Okay? Just put your hand up in the air nice and high.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   If it's any of those words, Upper House as well, Lower House here,
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   Overflow as well, put your hand up in the air nice and high.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   Okay? That's a lot of people with their hands in the air.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   Anyone else? All right.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   Okay, so here's what we're going to do now.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   So keep your hand in the air if one of those words spoke to you.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   If your hand's not in the air, you're part of our prayer team right now,
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   and you're going to have a chance to pray for the people around you
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   with their hands in the air.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   Upper House, Lower House, Overflow.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   So keep your hands high.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   Come on, don't be shy.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   If those words spoke to you and you want prayer today, keep the hand up.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   Everybody else, why don't you begin to look around right now
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   and begin to see if you see somebody with their hand raised near you.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   If their hand is raised near you, that means they would love prayer.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   You can either introduce yourself and ask how to pray for them,
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   or you can just start to pray for them.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   Just be respectful, maybe a hand on their shoulder, nothing more than that.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   But let's begin to pray for one another. Amen?
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   Because when God speaks, it's because He wants to ask.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   So keep your hands up in the air.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   Everybody else, turn around.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   Keep praying.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   Lots of people still being prayed for.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   If you're not praying for someone or receiving prayer,
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   open your hands.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   I want to just pray over you.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   Father, thank you for each person here in this room.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   Lord, I want to pray that you would open Scripture to them like never before.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   The Spirit of teaching would fall upon them.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   Lord, I pray this week that the Word of God would be more alive
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   than it has been at any time in their Christian life.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   And Lord, I want to pray for revelation for those to hear your voice,
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   to hear you fresh, to have the deep thoughts of yours revealed by the Spirit,
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   spiritual realities by Spirit-taught words, Lord.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   And we pray for this in your name.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   Please continue to pray for people if you are.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   If you need to leave, please do so quietly.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   But feel free to stay, receive more prayer.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   We have a prayer team, as always, here at the Vine that's happy to pray for you as well.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   But we'll make our time to pray for you.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   Please do leave quietly if you need to leave.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   Otherwise, continue to pray for the people around you
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   and allow the Spirit to continue to minister.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   Thanks, everyone.
