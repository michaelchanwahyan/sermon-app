1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
 Meet with us as we draw close to you.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,680
 We pray this in Jesus' name.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,720
 And the church says, amen.

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,320
 Thank you, worship team.

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,200
 That was beautiful.

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,040
 Let's go.

7
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,560
 Wow, okay.

8
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,240
 You can say hello to the person next to you.

9
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,000
 You know, it might be someone new.

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,540
 If you're online, hi.

11
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,600
 Good to see you as well.

12
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,760
 If you have some space next to you, let our host know.

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,800
 So if there's people outside who still need to come in,

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,260
 there might be a few seats scattered around.

15
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,680
 So host, if you see any hands being held up,

16
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,880
 overflow people, welcome as well.

17
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,600
 If you still wanna come in, there might be a few seats,

18
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,600
 excuse me, dotted around here and there.

19
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,540
 And so, yeah, welcome.

20
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,560
 All right, well, it's always an honor to be here

21
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,880
 sharing God's word with my church family.

22
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,280
 And today we come to the end

23
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,200
 of our Uncharted sermon series.

24
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,080
 You know, it's funny to think,

25
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,040
 who would have thought that God would work through

26
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,920
 a broken phone that Andrew had, right,

27
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,600
 to the journey that we've had in these past few weeks,

28
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,200
 walking through the season of being called

29
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,640
 into the Uncharted.

30
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,420
 Let me just give you a quick reminder

31
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,680
 of the different things that we've talked about

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,240
 in this journey so far.

33
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,280
 Now, we started off by being encouraged in obedience to God.

34
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,280
 If there was one word,

35
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,640
 maybe that summarizes everything so far.

36
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,880
 I think obedience might be quite a good one.

37
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,200
 But we're reminded at the start of this journey

38
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,880
 that there will be no map, right?

39
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,800
 There's no strategy, there's no map.

40
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,080
 We're going into areas and places

41
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,960
 and doing things that we've never done before.

42
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,740
 So of course, there can't be a plan for it,

43
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,920
 but we are in response, in obedience

44
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,840
 to what God has called us to do.

45
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,600
 Even if it's not comfortable,

46
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,520
 right, we were challenged to go and to obey.

47
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,240
 And then we talked about like shifting our perspective

48
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,400
 to the way we think, right, to put on God's perspective,

49
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,520
 to think about things from a kingdom

50
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,800
 of a heavenly perspective,

51
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,120
 instead of using our earthly human wisdom

52
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,440
 to judge why we do things.

53
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,620
 As we go on this journey,

54
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:11,460
 we're also reminded of the likelihood of facing persecution

55
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,040
 and the very real persecution

56
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,720
 that some of our brothers and sisters

57
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,000
 in different places of the world are facing today.

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,760
 And the challenge there was when we do face persecution,

59
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,160
 not to shrink back, not to shy away,

60
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,080
 maybe not even to pray for God to help you escape from it,

61
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,560
 but to stay faithful and allow God to work through you,

62
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,420
 even in times of persecution.

63
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,740
 And then we were also told, and similarly, right,

64
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,120
 that sometimes God will indeed call us

65
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,200
 into those really hard places,

66
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,440
 call us to do things that don't make sense

67
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,840
 from the worldly perspective,

68
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,920
 put us in difficult positions

69
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,240
 where we have to respond in faith and in obedience.

70
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,760
 But God works through those things

71
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,560
 and uses us in those ways to show his power

72
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,300
 and his glory and his wisdom.

73
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,400
 Last week, we talked about that.

74
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,720
 God also works through the consistent faithfulness

75
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,740
 of his people.

76
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,440
 And it's not always going to be a big,

77
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,640
 amazing fireworks of display of God's power at work,

78
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,920
 but often it's through the quiet,

79
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,680
 consistent faithfulness of his people.

80
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,080
 Again, just being obedient,

81
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,160
 being doing what God has called them to do,

82
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,920
 welcoming those God has called them to welcome,

83
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,760
 that his love and his power is at work.

84
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,340
 And today, as we close out the series,

85
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,360
 the theme we are talking about,

86
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,620
 the theme we're exploring is evangelism.

87
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,940
 Because yes, as we head into the uncharted,

88
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,320
 we might be doing all those things.

89
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,320
 We don't know where we're going.

90
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,920
 We don't have a plan of action.

91
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,200
 It's gonna be difficult.

92
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,600
 But the one thing we do know is who we're doing it for.

93
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,240
 This isn't a call to adventure

94
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,680
 like we were like Galileo or somewhere like that,

95
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,240
 going off into the uncharted,

96
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,000
 not knowing where we're gonna end up for our own purposes.

97
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,960
 That's not what this is about.

98
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,680
 Going into the uncharted has always been about

99
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,680
 going in the name of Jesus.

100
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,380
 We're not going for the sake of adventure,

101
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,260
 for our own name and our own fame.

102
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:12,240
 We're going to make known who Jesus is.

103
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,560
 To declare the gospel where it still needs to be heard,

104
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,280
 to teach and to make disciples,

105
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,960
 to testify near and far about who Jesus is.

106
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,320
 This is our mission.

107
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,440
 This has always been the mission of the church,

108
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,600
 of the people of God.

109
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,880
 But why else?

110
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,800
 Two things that Jesus said

111
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,400
 before he ascended into heaven, after his resurrection.

112
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,200
 Two main things he said was this.

113
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,840
 Therefore, go and make disciples of all nations,

114
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,720
 baptizing them in the name of the Father,

115
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,280
 of the Son and the Holy Spirit,

116
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,480
 and teaching them to obey everything I've commanded you.

117
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,960
 And surely I'm with you always to the very end of the age.

118
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,580
 Matthew 28, 19.

119
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,360
 Another version of this in Acts 1, 8 says this,

120
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,680
 but you will receive what?

121
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,120
 Power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you,

122
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,560
 and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem

123
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,960
 and in all Judea and Samaria and to the ends of the earth.

124
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,180
 So the scriptures are clear.

125
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,060
 For those of us who believe in Jesus,

126
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,240
 we have been told, we have been instructed,

127
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,360
 mandated, commanded even, to go and tell

128
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,320
 and teach and preach about Jesus.

129
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,920
 This is what I mean when we say evangelism.

130
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,160
 And this is something that every single Christian

131
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,020
 is called to be a part of.

132
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,320
 Now, but if we're honest,

133
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,880
 evangelism is one of those things

134
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,280
 that is sort of difficult and awkward to do, right?

135
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,560
 Let me tell you about one particular attempt of mine

136
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,120
 to evangelize, and you might be able to relate, all right?

137
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,120
 So I love talking to taxi drivers.

138
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,280
 You might think that's kind of weird, right?

139
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,080
 I love talking to taxi drivers, Uber drivers, whatever it is.

140
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,260
 I just love talking in general, I guess, right?

141
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,720
 But taxi drivers are amazing, right?

142
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,640
 I know in some countries you can call an Uber

143
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,440
 and you can request, right, like, don't chat to me, right?

144
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,920
 You're missing out, okay,

145
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,420
 if you don't talk to your driver, right?

146
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:09,840
 I think taxi drivers are the quintessential Hong Kong uncles,

147
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,440
 right, especially the ones in their 60s, okay, yeah.

148
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,080
 (audience laughing)

149
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,200
 That is, yeah, okay, right, you know,

150
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,000
 but they're like the quintessential Hong Kong man, okay?

151
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,960
 You get in the taxi, it smells like newspapers

152
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,280
 and cigarettes, right?

153
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,040
 Every single sentence that comes out of their mouth

154
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,640
 has to have a curse word, right?

155
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,640
 It doesn't matter what they're talking about,

156
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,680
 and it's not even swearing to them, right?

157
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,640
 It's just the way they talk, right?

158
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,760
 It's just, you know, the way they express themselves,

159
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,000
 and they'll talk about anything, right?

160
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,720
 They love talking about how, you know,

161
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,160
 (speaking in foreign language)

162
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,160
 you know, all this kind of stuff,

163
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,040
 like, Hong Kong wasn't like it used to be,

164
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,360
 you know, you young people, you're so blessed,

165
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,040
 or you don't know what you're doing,

166
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,720
 all these kind of life advice, you know,

167
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,720
 this is how you raise your children, you know,

168
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,340
 they love to talk about politics,

169
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,400
 and where you sit, and the whole spectrum of politics,

170
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,960
 anything they love to talk about, even religion.

171
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,940
 So for me, sometimes when I get into a taxi,

172
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,540
 I see it as the perfect time to evangelize,

173
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,140
 because you have a captive audience, right?

174
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,760
 Like, you're not going anywhere,

175
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,680
 he's not going anywhere, okay?

176
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,160
 And you have to pay them in the end,

177
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,120
 they're waiting for your money, and so, you know,

178
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,840
 what else are you gonna do with that conversation?

179
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,000
 And so one time I was with, this is quite a few years ago,

180
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,040
 I was with, I used to have lots of missionary friends

181
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,180
 that would come over to Hong Kong and do missionary work,

182
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,080
 so this guy was even more zealous,

183
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,440
 like, so on fire for telling people about Jesus.

184
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,800
 Big, you know, Southern American guy,

185
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,000
 he's probably about like six foot five, you know,

186
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,780
 imagine, I'm not sure if you're gonna get this reference,

187
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,800
 but Stone Cold Steve Austin, okay,

188
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,960
 he's like a big wrestler dude,

189
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,520
 looks like he'd be a biker gang, like, full of tattoos,

190
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,720
 right, in another life he might have been like a gang leader

191
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,920
 or a wrestler or something, not that wrestling's bad, okay,

192
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,440
 but like something like that, like a bad person, okay,

193
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,360
 but this guy loved Jesus,

194
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,240
 and loved telling other people about Jesus.

195
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,200
 And so we got into the taxi, and he was like,

196
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,280
 okay, let's talk to Jesus about this,

197
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,040
 to Jesus about this guy, so okay, yeah, okay, let's do it.

198
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,680
 And so, but he said, okay, translate for me,

199
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,200
 so okay, I'll be a translator,

200
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,440
 and he went with a classic question,

201
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,880
 he said, okay, tell him this,

202
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,560
 if you die today, where do you think you'd end up?

203
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,560
 I was like, oh, that's such a wild place

204
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,240
 to start a conversation, right, like,

205
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,080
 I was like, are you sure, man?

206
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,120
 He said, okay, so I said to the taxi,

207
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,320
 reluctantly a little bit, I said to the taxi driver,

208
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,320
 (speaking in foreign language)

209
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,440
 I just translated for him,

210
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,600
 and so the way his face changed was like,

211
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,160
 like he thought he was about to be robbed,

212
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,720
 'cause he said to me, he's like,

213
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,600
 true story, true story, okay,

214
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:46,600
 he said to me, (speaking in foreign language)

215
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,760
 He said, don't do anything stupid,

216
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,080
 tell your friend not to do anything stupid,

217
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,240
 I just started, I have no money, okay,

218
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,000
 so I had to explain, no, we're not,

219
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,480
 this isn't what this is about, okay, calm down,

220
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,240
 okay, we're here to give you life, actually, right, so.

221
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:05,560
 But how about you, okay, in your attempt to evangelize,

222
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,400
 maybe it's something you've tried before,

223
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,080
 maybe it's something you've never tried this before,

224
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,760
 precisely because your fear of getting yourselves

225
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,920
 in those sort of situations where it's awkward,

226
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,800
 it's weird, you might get scared, you might get nervous,

227
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,600
 you're not sure how the other person's gonna respond,

228
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,800
 and we live with this underlying guilt sometimes, right,

229
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,520
 we know this is something we're supposed to do,

230
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,560
 but we don't do it, but evangelism is something

231
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,720
 that we are meant to do, like we're saying,

232
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,840
 but I often feel like we're not doing a good enough job,

233
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,720
 but today, I hope we're gonna be encouraged in this, okay,

234
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,200
 because evangelism is something, like I said,

235
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,440
 for every single person who claims to be a Christian,

236
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,720
 to take part in, to actively do in their lives.

237
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,040
 We're gonna look through the book of Acts

238
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,600
 and see what the passage has to say about evangelism.

239
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,840
 So as the book of Acts begins, right,

240
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,400
 we see that the disciples,

241
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,640
 the world has just been turned upside down, right,

242
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,440
 they've seen their best friend, their mentor,

243
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,240
 their teacher, their savior, dying across,

244
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,600
 and then miraculously, through the power of God,

245
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,960
 he resurrects back to life,

246
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,680
 he spends about 40 days with them,

247
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,280
 walking, teaching, eating, hanging out again,

248
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,960
 before going back into heaven,

249
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,600
 and like I said, before going back into heaven,

250
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,560
 he leaves them with this gigantic task

251
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,920
 of telling the whole world about him,

252
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,200
 and then he just, poof, disappears into the sky,

253
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,480
 right, quite literally.

254
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,920
 Now, at this point, they're probably wondering,

255
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,440
 and understandably, right, a little bit nervous as well,

256
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,840
 like, how on earth are we supposed to do this?

257
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,680
 Or what's the plan, what's the strategy?

258
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,420
 And at this moment, they don't know,

259
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,520
 they don't really have one.

260
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,960
 So they go back to the one thing they do know what to do,

261
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,960
 and that is to gather together and to pray, and to wait,

262
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,280
 just like Emma was encouraging us,

263
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,840
 and Jethro was encouraging us to do just now.

264
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,640
 Acts 1:4 tells us this,

265
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,000
 they all, that is, all the disciples,

266
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,200
 joined together constantly in prayer,

267
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,920
 along with the woman and Mary,

268
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,720
 the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.

269
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,320
 So everybody who was following Jesus at the time,

270
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,120
 right, were gathered consistently,

271
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,760
 constantly in prayer together.

272
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,720
 And in our journey of evangelism,

273
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,640
 this passage reminded me of this, right,

274
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,960
 it has to start with prayer, right.

275
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,720
 They had no idea what all was about to happen, right.

276
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,880
 They didn't know how to complete this task

277
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,240
 that Jesus had given to them,

278
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,960
 to witness to the ends of the earth.

279
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,280
 But the one thing they did know that they could do,

280
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,120
 whilst figuring all this out, was to pray.

281
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,560
 You know, and often in evangelism,

282
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,960
 we immediately, right, we think of all these plans,

283
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,000
 and tactics, and strategies to win souls for Jesus, right.

284
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,280
 I've seen them all, and maybe you've seen them too,

285
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,080
 the Evangel-Cube, any of you ever had an Evangel-Cube?

286
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,320
 Right, there was this thing where, like,

287
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,280
 you would manipulate, it was like a Rubik's Cube,

288
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,000
 and you keep flipping it, and each picture

289
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,680
 tells a different version of the gospel story.

290
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,200
 Or maybe if you grew up in youth group,

291
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,440
 you made one of those bracelets,

292
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,760
 with like the red, some people are nodding, right,

293
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,640
 the red, the yellow, the black, the green,

294
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,840
 I can't remember the order,

295
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,880
 and each bead tells a different story about the gospel.

296
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,480
 Someone taught me this, it didn't work at all,

297
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,480
 but for many years as a teenager,

298
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,320
 I walked around with a,

299
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,560
 with tied to empty water bottle,

300
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,640
 hanging off the back of my backpack, right.

301
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,840
 And the idea was that people would see,

302
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,160
 that's kind of weird, like, why do you have a water bottle

303
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,800
 hanging off the back of your backpack?

304
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,480
 And then I would evangelize them, right,

305
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,640
 like I'd be like, well you see this bottle's empty, right,

306
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,720
 well let me tell you about living water,

307
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,800
 that could fill this up, you know,

308
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,720
 it's like so cheesy, right, like, it never worked, okay.

309
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,120
 So do these things kind of work, okay,

310
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,800
 I mean, yeah, sometimes, maybe not really,

311
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,920
 and I'm not saying there's no tactics,

312
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,960
 and there's no ways to, you know, learn how to evangelize,

313
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,680
 we'll talk about that a little bit more.

314
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,600
 But the point is this, right,

315
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,120
 before we go to tools and tactics,

316
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,800
 and all this kind of stuff, we need to start with prayer.

317
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,240
 So my first question for us this morning is this,

318
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,280
 are we praying?

319
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,760
 Are we gathering and devoting ourselves to prayer,

320
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,840
 as the disciples were, whilst we wait on God,

321
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:21,360
 are we actively listening to what He wants to say to us,

322
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,240
 and the best way to do that is through prayer.

323
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,640
 We pray for ourselves, for our courage,

324
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,400
 we pray for opportunities to present the gospel,

325
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,720
 we pray for the wisdom to know what to say

326
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,000
 when the opportunity presents itself.

327
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,200
 This is a reminder for us,

328
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,880
 it's not just evangelism, actually,

329
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,280
 anything we do, but especially with evangelism,

330
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,160
 has to start with prayer.

331
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,000
 And we see what happens,

332
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,600
 it's precisely during one of these prayer times

333
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,000
 that we're gathered together, praying together in one place,

334
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,200
 that suddenly, one of the most spectacular things

335
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,160
 we see in all through scripture happens.

336
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,040
 It tells us this, when the day of Pentecost came,

337
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,680
 they were all together in one place, presumably praying.

338
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,040
 Suddenly, a sound like the blowing of a violent wind

339
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,760
 came from heaven and filled the whole house

340
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,680
 where they were sitting.

341
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,320
 So just imagine the scene, right, you're sitting there,

342
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,960
 you're gathered with your friends, brothers and sisters,

343
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,240
 you're praying, and suddenly this loud swooshing sound

344
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,280
 just moves through the room, unmistakable,

345
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,280
 every body hears it.

346
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,400
 Right, it's like when we've been sat in buildings

347
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,200
 or maybe in your classroom, maybe at home,

348
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,240
 and there's a typhoon eight blowing outside,

349
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,160
 you can hear the wind just blowing through your doors,

350
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,680
 the windows are rattling, the doors are shaking,

351
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,720
 it's unmistakable what's happening.

352
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,760
 There's a huge sound of this wind

353
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,360
 that blows through this room.

354
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,360
 But this wasn't a typhoon, right,

355
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,360
 it wasn't an ordinary wind.

356
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,000
 Did you catch what Luke tells us?

357
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,240
 Okay, check it out, listen to this again.

358
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,920
 This was a wind that came from where?

359
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,760
 A blowing, a violent wind that came from heaven.

360
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,800
 Right, this was God at work.

361
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,800
 Just like when the Israelites were about to cross the Red Sea

362
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,640
 and the Lord drove the sea back to reveal dry land,

363
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,880
 what did he use?

364
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,520
 A strong east wind to guide his people into freedom.

365
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,720
 And what I think God's trying to say here is this,

366
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,040
 that through the wind of the Holy Spirit now,

367
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,680
 I'm gonna drive back your fears,

368
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,080
 I'm gonna drive back your worries,

369
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,080
 I'm gonna open up a new way

370
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,280
 for you to lead people into freedom.

371
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:39,240
 The Holy Spirit is here and everything is about to change.

372
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,440
 Now, the wind, of course, was just part one

373
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,320
 because watch this, right,

374
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,400
 then pay attention to what God does next.

375
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,960
 And then they saw what seemed to be tongues of fire

376
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,960
 that separated and came to rest on each of them.

377
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,760
 All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit

378
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,920
 and they began to speak in other tongues

379
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,120
 as the Spirit enabled them.

380
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,560
 Now, when we get to passages like this,

381
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,200
 I know, you know, maybe my imagination goes to like,

382
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,480
 what did this actually look like?

383
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,920
 Like tongues of fire?

384
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,520
 Was it like little candle wicks,

385
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,200
 flames like sitting on people's heads, right?

386
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,240
 That's the kind of image I get in my head.

387
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,360
 But again, it's a representation of God's presence.

388
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,680
 Think back in scripture.

389
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,960
 When fire shows up, especially in the Exodus story,

390
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,440
 Moses and the burning bush, right?

391
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,960
 The way that God used fire to guide the Israelites

392
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,160
 by a pillar of fire through the night

393
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,400
 when they were in the wilderness,

394
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,160
 giving them warmth and light

395
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,720
 as they were going through into the promised land.

396
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,960
 When they reached Sinai, it says,

397
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:41,960
 "God descended on the mountain in a great fire."

398
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:46,000
 Again, it's a confirmation of God's presence.

399
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 And it sounds weird, it sounds indescribable

400
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,080
 because it precisely is indescribable, right?

401
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,600
 This is human words trying to describe

402
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,560
 a supernatural occurrence.

403
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,120
 But the point is, it's undoubtedly the presence of God

404
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:05,120
 showing up in a very clear and obvious way, wind and fire.

405
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,880
 If our first step of evangelism is prayer,

406
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,000
 the second step is we have to be empowered

407
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,280
 by the Holy Spirit.

408
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,480
 Wind and fire coming together, sweeping through the place.

409
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,560
 Have you ever been filled with the Holy Spirit?

410
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,320
 If you received Jesus as your Savior,

411
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,840
 you have to be filled with the Spirit,

412
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,840
 to be filled with His presence.

413
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,040
 Have you experienced the presence of God?

414
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,640
 You know it's just resting on you like a consuming fire,

415
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,240
 burning away everything else,

416
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,920
 burning away anything that's not of Him.

417
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,160
 The wind of the Holy Spirit filling you up afresh and anew,

418
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,360
 just like what we're singing about just now.

419
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,960
 We see that when we've been soaked in prayer,

420
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,960
 empowered by the Holy Spirit,

421
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,200
 there's about to be a movement that happens

422
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,400
 that will not be stopped,

423
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,120
 that has not stopped until this very day.

424
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,920
 The powerful forces, untamable forces of wind and fire

425
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,280
 working together, sweeping through the disciples' lives,

426
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,200
 causing them to stop this unstoppable task

427
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,640
 of evangelizing the world in the name of Jesus.

428
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,600
 Look what happens next.

429
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,560
 They were staying there in Jerusalem,

430
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,720
 God-fearing Jews from every nation under,

431
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,920
 now they're staying there in Jerusalem,

432
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,680
 God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven.

433
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,080
 So this is the people from all over the world

434
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,560
 gathered together at Jerusalem because it was Pentecost,

435
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,160
 the Jewish festival of Pentecost.

436
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,360
 And when they heard this sound,

437
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,520
 the sound that the disciples heard just now,

438
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,520
 a crowd came together in bewilderment

439
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,160
 because each one heard their own language being spoken.

440
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,920
 "Atzalimeh," they asked,

441
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,440
 "Aren't all these who are speaking Galileans?

442
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,400
 Then how is it that each of us hears

443
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,520
 in our own native language?

444
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,600
 Parthians, Medes, Elamites,

445
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,960
 forgive my mispronunciations here,

446
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,880
 Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus,

447
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,080
 Asia, Pharisia, Pamphylia, Egypt,

448
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,320
 the parts of Libya, Cyrene, visitors from all over Rome,

449
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,720
 Cretans and Arabs, we hear them declaring," what?

450
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,560
 "The wonders of God in our own tongues."

451
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,560
 So I know sometimes it's a bit of controversy here

452
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,440
 as to what tongues is actually describing, right?

453
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,820
 Is it the ability to suddenly speak different languages

454
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,640
 or was it the charismatic, unintelligible,

455
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,600
 supernatural prayer language of tongues?

456
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,320
 The crowd reaction suggests that they were hearing

457
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,000
 their own languages being spoken, right?

458
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,640
 So this is a supernatural miracle that's happening on.

459
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,920
 People that don't know how to speak a language

460
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,800
 suddenly receive the ability to speak that language.

461
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,640
 But that's not the main point.

462
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,080
 What I wanna focus on is this,

463
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,240
 what the disciples were saying, okay?

464
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,760
 It says they were what?

465
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:01,240
 Declaring the wonders of God.

466
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,840
 Speaking out the wonders of God,

467
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:07,240
 telling the things that they have seen God do.

468
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,520
 Now, this is amazing to me, right?

469
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,960
 Think about it.

470
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,880
 The very first thing that happens to prove

471
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,160
 that God's spirit is alive,

472
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,440
 the very first thing that Jesus does through his disciples

473
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,560
 after his life, death and resurrection ascension to heaven,

474
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:27,480
 was not to perform miracles, right?

475
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,760
 In a very real way, right?

476
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,000
 Was not to go and heal the sick,

477
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,360
 was not going to feed the poor, right?

478
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,480
 It's not that they started a church.

479
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,680
 The very first sign of the disciples

480
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,240
 being filled with the Holy Spirit

481
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,840
 was that they were compelled to declare the wonders of God.

482
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:47,160
 Or in other words, they began to evangelize.

483
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,680
 They began to spread the gospel.

484
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:55,040
 Now, do you see how important evangelism is to Jesus' heart?

485
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,840
 And as this happens, right?

486
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,960
 As this amazing thing happens, right?

487
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,240
 There were a few different reactions.

488
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,840
 Some people had the reaction of this, right?

489
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,520
 Amazed and perplexed.

490
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,360
 They asked one another, scripture tells us,

491
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,000
 "What does this mean?"

492
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,280
 In other words, there was a big group of people

493
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,200
 that were curious, right?

494
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,120
 What's going on?

495
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,600
 We heard this sound, this wind,

496
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,960
 and now these people are speaking to us in languages

497
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,640
 that they should not be able to speak.

498
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,280
 They came to find out more.

499
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,440
 And you will find as you go on your journey of evangelizing,

500
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,520
 of telling people about the gospel,

501
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,200
 when the gospel is proclaimed,

502
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,280
 it does often pique curiosity.

503
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,720
 I think back when Jesus was teaching,

504
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,880
 huge crowds would gather, right?

505
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,200
 They would gather to come and listen to his parables,

506
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,240
 to his teaching, and they would be left thinking,

507
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,320
 it's like, "Who is this guy?

508
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,000
 "He teaches with such authority.

509
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,520
 "What do these parables mean?"

510
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,320
 Like, "This person is different, the way he speaks.

511
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,280
 "This message is like nothing I've ever heard.

512
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,240
 "We can't stop listening to it."

513
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,680
 However, at the same time, the scriptures also told us

514
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,640
 that some people made fun of them and said,

515
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,520
 "They've had too much wine."

516
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,760
 Now, I'm not sure if you've ever talked to someone

517
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,880
 who's had too much wine,

518
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,840
 probably not because we're good Christian people here.

519
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,480
 We've never been around people like that,

520
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,240
 but I've heard that when people have too much wine,

521
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,160
 they start talking in ways that don't make sense.

522
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:25,800
 And this is also gonna happen when you start to evangelize.

523
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,680
 There's gonna be people who laugh at us and sneer at us,

524
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,080
 and some people who will say things like,

525
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,680
 "This doesn't make sense.

526
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,400
 "You sound like a drunk person talking here.

527
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,560
 "This is just the blabbering of a drunken person."

528
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,960
 Maybe you've heard some of this before,

529
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,720
 as you've had some of these responses before.

530
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,240
 You believe in this nonsense?

531
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,600
 You really think a virgin could give birth to a baby?

532
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,320
 That's rubbish.

533
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,240
 You really think someone who was dead can be resurrected?

534
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,800
 You really believe out of all the powers out there

535
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,520
 that there's only one God?

536
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,320
 You really think that sex is something for marriage?

537
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,040
 You know, it's not just for relationships?

538
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,240
 You believe in this Bible that was written 2,000 years ago?

539
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,880
 Doesn't it contradict itself?

540
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,160
 It makes no sense?

541
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,680
 You believe in all that stuff?

542
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:20,040
 And yes, the accusation will be that the Christian message

543
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,640
 sounds like the ridiculous rants of a drunk.

544
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,200
 The first point of evangelism is we need to start with prayer.

545
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,640
 And the second thing is we need to go with the power

546
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,120
 of the Holy Spirit.

547
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,960
 The third thing that we've been saying

548
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,440
 is that we need to expect opposition.

549
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,080
 But look at how it happens.

550
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:43,720
 What will our reaction be is the question.

551
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:48,680
 'Cause when Peter faces all these accusations, right,

552
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,120
 now, he could have done a few things.

553
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,920
 He could have toned it down to, "Actually, you know what?

554
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,160
 "Yeah, it's a bit much.

555
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,000
 "Okay, come on, guys.

556
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 "Let's come and gather back.

557
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,200
 "Let's keep praying, and let's not cause too much trouble."

558
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,480
 And maybe that's what we wanna do as well.

559
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,520
 "Okay, yeah, I'll just shut up about it,

560
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,000
 "and I'm not gonna talk about it anymore."

561
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,320
 Or maybe we change the message to make it a bit more

562
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,840
 acceptable, a bit more palatable to the people

563
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,040
 that we're talking to.

564
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:15,360
 But that's not the kind of people we wanna be, right?

565
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,760
 That waters down the truth?

566
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:21,320
 That's not the type of church we've called to be, right?

567
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,000
 Do we really wanna be the kind of Christians

568
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,960
 that just fold under a little bit of ridicule,

569
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,200
 who are afraid to speak the whole truth?

570
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,120
 No, church.

571
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,240
 We wanna be the kind of followers of Jesus

572
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,920
 who are bold in the faith,

573
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,600
 willing to stand up to persecution and ridicule,

574
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,120
 as we were saying about in this past journey.

575
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,480
 And this is what we see in Peter, right?

576
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,840
 Peter isn't scared.

577
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,280
 He isn't intimidated.

578
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,720
 But he stands up and raises his voice, it says,

579
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,040
 and begins to preach the gospel, right?

580
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,960
 He begins to explain who Jesus was.

581
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,960
 What's happening actually does make sense.

582
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,240
 This is what's happening.

583
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,640
 And he begins to talk about Jesus,

584
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,520
 that he was the one that was sent from God

585
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,080
 through his signs and miracles that Jesus performed

586
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:11,800
 that proved this, that he was put to death on the cross.

587
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,200
 But then listen, let's go back to scripture.

588
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,080
 But God raised him from the dead,

589
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,000
 freeing him from the agony of death,

590
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,120
 because it was impossible for death to keep a hold on him.

591
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,840
 And now God has raised this Jesus to life,

592
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,520
 and we were all witnesses of it.

593
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,040
 Exalted to the right hand of God,

594
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,640
 he has received from the Father the promise, Holy Spirit,

595
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,080
 and has poured out what you now see and hear,

596
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,640
 that Jesus is both Lord and Messiah over all people,

597
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,480
 and everyone who calls on the name of the Lord

598
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,200
 will be saved.

599
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,760
 He doesn't hold back.

600
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,240
 He boldly declares what is happening,

601
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,720
 who Jesus is, what he was, that he came to this earth to do,

602
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:56,160
 and you, Christian, have been called to do the same.

603
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:01,400
 If you're sitting here right now, listening to this story,

604
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,280
 if you call yourself a follower of Jesus,

605
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,600
 the gospel is something that you've already received,

606
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,520
 you've already experienced.

607
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,480
 You know this story because you're living in it right now.

608
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,440
 But since we're talking about it, the gospel,

609
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,480
 just in case there's someone here right now listening

610
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,600
 who hasn't heard the gospel, maybe you're listening online,

611
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,520
 maybe a friend brought you to church today,

612
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,800
 and maybe for all the rest of us, it's just a reminder,

613
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,480
 what is this story?

614
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,560
 What is this amazing thing that we're talking about?

615
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:35,160
 Well, the gospel starts with recognizing

616
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,080
 that there is one God.

617
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:41,120
 This is the God who created the heavens and the earth,

618
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,160
 who sung every star and planet in the sky,

619
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,240
 yet he knows you by name.

620
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,800
 Because he created you.

621
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:53,800
 He created us, human beings, in love, in his image.

622
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:58,400
 And the Bible tells us he breathed his life into our lungs.

623
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,960
 And when he created this earth, everything was perfect,

624
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,400
 because our God is perfect.

625
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,960
 But we messed it up.

626
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,920
 We rebelled against God, we sinned against him,

627
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,400
 and into his perfect creation, we brought sin.

628
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,560
 And sin is this horrible mess

629
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,880
 that just keeps getting worse, right?

630
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,880
 The more we try to clean it up ourselves,

631
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,640
 the more we try to fix it, the worse it becomes.

632
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,800
 And sin is what binds us in darkness.

633
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:31,000
 Sin is what makes us commit and think evil thoughts.

634
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,960
 Sin is what brings death.

635
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,480
 Sin is what has now separated us

636
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,480
 from this God who created us.

637
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,160
 But yet he loved us.

638
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,320
 And he loved us so much,

639
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:47,160
 he refused to let us sit in sin and darkness.

640
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:51,480
 And so he begins this rescue plan to try to save us.

641
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:57,520
 And in this rescue plan, he sends his beloved son, Jesus.

642
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,880
 And Jesus comes down to earth to live amongst us.

643
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,240
 And Jesus is God, we know this,

644
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,760
 because whilst he was on this earth, as Peter was saying,

645
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,040
 he proved it time and time again

646
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,280
 in the way he taught with authority,

647
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,960
 in the way he loved people,

648
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,760
 in the signs and wonders that he performed.

649
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,280
 He proved it in fulfilling the many prophecies

650
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,000
 that the Old Testament proclaimed.

651
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 And ultimately, he proved it to us

652
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 by dying on the cross for our sins, paying that price.

653
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,720
 Not because we did anything to earn it,

654
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,640
 not because we did enough good things

655
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,320
 to capture his attention,

656
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,640
 not because we fixed ourselves up first.

657
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,560
 This was not our idea or our doing.

658
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,960
 This is because of the love that he had for us.

659
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,760
 But even death could not hold Jesus down.

660
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,600
 And after three days in the tomb,

661
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,520
 God raised Jesus back to life,

662
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,560
 defeating the powers of sin and darkness once and for all,

663
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,360
 establishing his rightful place as king

664
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,440
 over the entire universe, reconciling us with God,

665
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,800
 confirming that Jesus is indeed the Messiah and Savior

666
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,080
 the world is longing for.

667
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:13,560
 And to this day, if you call on the name of Jesus

668
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,120
 and Jesus alone, if you accept him as your Savior,

669
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,960
 you too will be saved.

670
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,360
 Right, this is the greatest story in history,

671
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,600
 the greatest story that's ever been told.

672
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,280
 This is what the meaning of what gospel is, right?

673
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,720
 This is why it's called the good news.

674
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,240
 And like I said, if you and I listening to this right now,

675
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,560
 for those of us who've already lived it,

676
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,480
 you accept this, you believe this, right?

677
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,280
 You felt the love of God.

678
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,720
 You felt the Holy Spirit working inside of you.

679
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,080
 You are aware of how he saved you from your sin.

680
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,640
 You're living in this new life now,

681
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,560
 reconciled with God, being able to gather

682
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,880
 with brothers and sisters like this, right?

683
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,640
 Would you disagree with me that this is the best news

684
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,800
 that you've ever heard, that you've ever received,

685
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,080
 the best thing ever?

686
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:04,600
 Nobody disagrees with you in that, right?

687
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,520
 Then brothers and sisters, if this is the case,

688
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,120
 why are we not telling everybody about this?

689
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,800
 Why are we not sharing it?

690
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,920
 I mean, it's not like, and I'm talking to myself here too,

691
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,640
 okay, it's not like we don't like to share news, right?

692
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,320
 Anything, social media proves to us,

693
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,480
 we love to share about things that happen to us, right?

694
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,160
 Coldplay, woohoo, yeah, she said yes, yeah.

695
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,120
 New cookies in Wan Chai, okay?

696
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,760
 All these things we love to share about, right?

697
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,000
 We will share about everything else.

698
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,560
 So why is it then when it comes to sharing the gospel,

699
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,760
 which we've already agreed is the greatest story

700
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,560
 that's ever told, but it's also a story

701
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,920
 that's hardly ever told?

702
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:51,360
 Again, in my own reflection and in my own heart,

703
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,440
 there's a few reasons why I sometimes think we are reluctant

704
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,560
 and we keep quiet about the gospel.

705
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,060
 First thing is this, fear.

706
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:01,760
 Maybe this is the biggest one, right?

707
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,960
 Questions such as, like I said just now,

708
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,400
 what are people gonna think about me?

709
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,080
 What if they mock me?

710
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,480
 I'm too religious, right?

711
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,440
 You're a goody two shoes, right?

712
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,600
 What if, you know, I know my boss is sort of hostile

713
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,640
 towards Christianity, if I speak this out,

714
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,660
 I might not get the opportunities

715
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:22,080
 that my other colleagues might get.

716
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,880
 But what if they discriminate against me?

717
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,360
 What if I start facing persecution?

718
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,360
 Or maybe what if they start asking me questions

719
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,720
 and I don't know what I'm talking about

720
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,640
 and I look like a fool, right?

721
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,960
 Fear holds us, or these things, holds us back so often

722
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,760
 when it comes to sharing the gospel.

723
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,840
 Or maybe sometimes it's, you know,

724
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:45,840
 your own laziness, apathy, excuses, right?

725
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,520
 And the truth is this, right?

726
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,320
 Again, I'm talking to myself here as well,

727
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,920
 so please don't, we're in this together, okay?

728
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:55,200
 Sometimes I feel like we don't care enough.

729
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,720
 And we give ourselves excuses like,

730
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,640
 oh, I'm not that good with words.

731
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,080
 You know, it's not my gifting.

732
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,240
 If I don't say it, someone else will share with them.

733
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,600
 I don't have the time to do that right now.

734
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,440
 You know, all these things,

735
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,160
 I'm just gonna wait for a better opportunity.

736
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,560
 And we get lazy and we prioritize other things

737
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,040
 over sharing the gospel.

738
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,880
 And perhaps sometimes it's forgetfulness.

739
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,280
 And we forget that we too were once in that place

740
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,940
 when we were without hope,

741
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,320
 where we were sitting in our sin

742
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,520
 wondering what to do with ourselves.

743
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,440
 And we forget that if it wasn't for someone else

744
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,200
 who come and spoke and preached

745
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,400
 and taught us about the gospel,

746
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,440
 no matter who it could have been,

747
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,880
 you know, it could have been a grandmother,

748
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,220
 a parent, a teacher, a friend, whoever it was,

749
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,720
 that we would have never heard the gospel

750
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,560
 in the first place,

751
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,080
 and maybe we wouldn't be living the lives in Jesus,

752
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,680
 experiencing the love that we do in this moment.

753
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:54,380
 And our minds aren't tuned to those

754
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,800
 who are still lost in the darkness.

755
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,880
 We forget about that.

756
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,720
 And if we're honest with ourselves,

757
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,280
 it's probably a mixture of all these three things

758
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,600
 coming together.

759
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:09,760
 But what I'm challenging us today, church, is this, right?

760
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,760
 It's not good enough.

761
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,120
 And if we've been called to go into the uncharted

762
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,420
 like we have at the beginning of this journey,

763
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,080
 we have been commissioned and commanded

764
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,120
 into these unknown places, like I said,

765
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,800
 to proclaim the gospel and the name of Jesus.

766
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,360
 And Paul would say it this way, right?

767
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,440
 How can they call on the name of one

768
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,160
 they have not believed in?

769
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,840
 And how can they believe in one who they have not heard?

770
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,400
 And how can they hear without someone preaching to them?

771
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,760
 And how can anyone preach to them unless they are sent?

772
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,880
 Church, what I'm saying is this, we have all been sent.

773
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,840
 And whilst we're sitting here in this room,

774
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,680
 while people out there are living and dying

775
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,920
 without hearing and believing in Jesus,

776
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,840
 because we haven't done the work of evangelism

777
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,680
 and telling people about the gospel.

778
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:00,600
 Our sermon series might come to an end today,

779
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,440
 but the call remains on us, right?

780
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,360
 This is not a time to rest.

781
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,920
 This is not a time to hold back.

782
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,680
 This is a season that we've been talking about of action.

783
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,180
 It's not a time to tone down.

784
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:15,360
 God's desire is that the gospel, right, of his kingdom

785
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,080
 will be preached through the whole world.

786
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,200
 So we cannot stop talking about this

787
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:25,200
 until every single person has heard about Jesus.

788
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:30,400
 And it's not something we can be slow and lazy about,

789
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:34,880
 because a life without the gospel leads us to some very dark,

790
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,480
 leads us to a very dark place

791
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,360
 with some very serious consequences.

792
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,840
 One of the consequences is this,

793
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,400
 eternal separation from God.

794
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:52,560
 The consequence of not hearing and responding to the gospel

795
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:57,200
 is that when we die, we end up separated from God forever.

796
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,400
 Again, we're just talking about real things here, okay?

797
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:06,080
 But our time on earth is gonna end in one of two ways, right?

798
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:10,040
 Either your body stops working, which means you die,

799
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,400
 or Jesus is gonna come back.

800
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,980
 Either way, we have very little control

801
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,000
 over those two occurrences.

802
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,240
 I mean, all of us in this room,

803
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,960
 and I pray that we do wanna live lives,

804
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,640
 good, healthy lives until we're gold and gray, right,

805
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,600
 and die peacefully in our sleep.

806
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,560
 But nobody is guaranteed that.

807
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,200
 And with my own eyes and my own life,

808
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,520
 and I'm sure you've experienced it too, right,

809
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,400
 life often, we call it cut short in some way.

810
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,600
 Sickness, disease, accidents,

811
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,620
 sometimes for reasons when we don't even understand,

812
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:46,760
 life is out of our control.

813
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,040
 In the same way, Bible tells us no one knows

814
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,560
 the day or the hour when Jesus will return.

815
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,640
 We do know he is coming back though,

816
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,180
 and when he does come back again for the second time

817
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,480
 to save those who are eagerly awaiting him,

818
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,840
 and we know that when he comes back,

819
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,120
 he's gonna be coming back as a king

820
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,520
 to judge the living and the dead.

821
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,640
 And we know when he comes back or when we die,

822
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,880
 he's gonna separate those who have accepted and lived

823
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,560
 and praised and been walking in the gospel

824
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,000
 from those who have not.

825
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,840
 And those who have lived in the gospel,

826
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,560
 who have accepted Jesus as a savior,

827
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,520
 will go off and live with him eternal life with God,

828
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,120
 and for the others, it's eternal separation from God

829
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,460
 in darkness, in punishment.

830
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:37,580
 So that's a real consequence of responding to the gospel.

831
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:40,200
 But the second thing is this,

832
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,920
 I think this might be even more pressing

833
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,180
 and more important right now,

834
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,440
 because often we focus on that,

835
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,600
 we focus on the afterlife

836
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,680
 when we go to the evangelism,

837
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,800
 like when I said, if you die today, where are you gonna go?

838
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:56,120
 But that's not the whole picture either.

839
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,760
 Because if it was, then accepting the gospel

840
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:03,760
 is sort of like the super life insurance that you could get.

841
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,160
 So the moment you die, you get to go to heaven.

842
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,840
 Okay, well then, again, let's just keep it real.

843
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,880
 If that's the case, then why not just die

844
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,440
 right after you receive the gospel?

845
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,200
 Then you get to go with me heaven straight away

846
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,600
 and everything will be fine.

847
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,360
 But when we live without the gospel,

848
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,880
 it's not just about the afterlife,

849
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,920
 but it's about life here right now.

850
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,320
 Right, this is the beautiful thing about the gospel.

851
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,600
 It's not just about going to heaven

852
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,520
 and being with God forever, right?

853
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,920
 Like I said, it's not an afterlife insurance policy.

854
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,760
 But Jesus says this,

855
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,520
 "I have come to give you life and life in the full."

856
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,560
 The gospel allows us to live our lives on this earth,

857
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,400
 however long or short that might be,

858
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:49,400
 with meaning and purpose and identity and mission

859
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,780
 that God intended us to have.

860
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:57,540
 So the gospel embodies every single part of our lives.

861
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,900
 The gospel is why we can have hope

862
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,580
 when things seem hopeless.

863
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:04,440
 The gospel is what drives us to speak up and fight back

864
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,920
 against the injustices we see in this world.

865
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,080
 The gospel is what compels us to love everybody

866
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,840
 that we see with the love of God,

867
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,720
 even our enemies.

868
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,640
 The gospel allows us to celebrate the joys of this life,

869
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,320
 but also walk with those who are going through the valley

870
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,280
 of the shadow of death.

871
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,680
 The gospel is because,

872
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,720
 this is the reason why we can come together

873
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,720
 in a room like this,

874
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,200
 people from all over the world,

875
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,720
 from all different backgrounds,

876
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,800
 together as a family worshiping Jesus.

877
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,780
 That is because of the gospel.

878
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:39,120
 This is why we cannot stay silent.

879
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,800
 Peter urges the people, "Save yourselves."

880
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,160
 He says, "From this corrupt generation."

881
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,280
 And this is what we still face to this day,

882
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,880
 a world that is corrupt, a world that is broken,

883
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,120
 a world with people living in darkness and without hope

884
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,320
 in this world or the next.

885
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,880
 But the gospel church, this is the key.

886
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,680
 This is why I keep saying we cannot be silent.

887
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,640
 We cannot shut up.

888
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,520
 We cannot give up.

889
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,620
 We cannot stop.

890
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:09,200
 We need to preach the gospel

891
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,280
 because just two minutes, a five minute walk from here,

892
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,280
 under the bridge, there's people putting their hopes

893
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,520
 in the lady, slapping against a piece of paper.

894
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,680
 They're putting their hopes in that,

895
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,140
 engaging themselves in demonic forces.

896
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,960
 That's where they're finding their hope,

897
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,520
 trying to beat your troubles away.

898
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:32,600
 People need to see that that is not real hope.

899
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:37,720
 True hope is found in Jesus and Jesus alone.

900
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,700
 We need to preach the gospel because there are kids

901
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,320
 and teenagers and young people struggling right now

902
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,960
 in Hong Kong and all over the world

903
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,000
 to find meaning and purpose in life.

904
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,200
 And some have even turned to taking their own lives

905
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,840
 as a result.

906
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,440
 You know, our teen suicide rates in Hong Kong

907
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,580
 are some of the highest amongst developed nations.

908
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:00,720
 They need the gospel to know that no matter what happens,

909
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,160
 doesn't matter how good your grades are,

910
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,840
 doesn't matter what your teachers

911
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,160
 and your exam results tell you, right?

912
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,600
 That does not define you, but you have a father in heaven

913
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,240
 who loves you and values you exactly for who you are,

914
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,700
 not what you are doing.

915
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,960
 We need to preach the gospel because they're a couple

916
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,440
 struggling in their marriages, ready to give up,

917
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,120
 not seeing a hope in the future together.

918
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,760
 And the gospel is what teaches them about love

919
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:30,760
 and reconciliation and being the church to each other.

920
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,120
 We need to preach the gospel because some have sold

921
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,960
 themselves to the ways of the world,

922
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:40,480
 chasing money, status, fame, prestige, and all these things

923
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,720
 and reaching the mountaintops where they've literally

924
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,560
 acquired every single earthly thing that they want,

925
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,100
 still finding their lives empty,

926
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:53,060
 not knowing that the only thing that will ever satisfy them

927
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,580
 is Jesus.

928
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:58,200
 We need to preach the gospel because they're people

929
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,600
 and families just facing the everyday realities

930
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,900
 of what life is.

931
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:07,700
 The family that's facing financial issues,

932
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:10,340
 the child that just gets diagnosed with cancer,

933
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:15,000
 the father who's just lost his job and is told, you know,

934
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,020
 there's no future for you in this company.

935
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:20,980
 Whatever it is, we go through the everyday harsh realities

936
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:24,180
 of life, not knowing that there's a God out there

937
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,900
 who can help them, who can lead them, who can guide them,

938
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:30,060
 who can heal, who can provide, who can save.

939
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:33,780
 For these reasons as More Church, we need to speak

940
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,660
 the gospel.

941
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:39,020
 You and me, my family and Christ have been called

942
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,140
 to do this.

943
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:47,140
 And as we do this, remember, there is great power.

944
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:51,180
 You know, it's not, your job is just to speak it out, okay,

945
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:53,860
 to have the courage to do that.

946
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,740
 But it's not up to your own power.

947
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:01,100
 But when the gospel does work, it does amazing things,

948
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:04,140
 things we would never even imagine, right?

949
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:04,980
 Check out what it says.

950
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,740
 I'm continuing the passage in Acts.

951
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,700
 When the people heard this message,

952
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,860
 after they heard Peter speak, it told us they were cut

953
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,540
 to the heart.

954
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:15,940
 In other words, they had to make a decision.

955
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,380
 They even asked themselves the questions,

956
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:20,020
 brothers, what shall we do?

957
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:20,940
 We've heard this message.

958
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:24,540
 I've realized that now I also need this, right?

959
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,740
 This is God's work.

960
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:30,700
 This is God's, the power of God's word at work, right?

961
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:33,820
 Not your own power, but the gospel itself carries

962
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:36,380
 the message of Jesus.

963
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:39,420
 So all you have to do is speak it out and wait

964
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:40,900
 for the Lord to move.

965
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,220
 It's not about how convincing you are, but it's about

966
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:46,740
 how obedient you are in allowing God to speak through you.

967
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:51,660
 And it tells us that 3000 people, amazing, were added

968
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,420
 to the number that day.

969
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,140
 Again, it's not about the numbers.

970
00:42:55,140 --> 00:43:02,020
 It's about us being ready to respond, being ready to go

971
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:05,460
 and speak the gospel to those who need it.

972
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:11,980
 So like I said in the beginning, this might be uncharted

973
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:14,260
 and maybe now, you know, as we started, maybe you're

974
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:17,420
 feeling a bit guilty, maybe you're feeling worse now, okay?

975
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:19,140
 And that's not the point, okay?

976
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,740
 The challenge is not to leave you feeling nervous

977
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:24,060
 and guilty because you've never done this before.

978
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:27,580
 It sounds so serious now, and I'm even more scared, okay?

979
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:31,740
 I want us to be encouraging each other to do this together.

980
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:34,780
 All right, let's not let us get away with letting

981
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:37,180
 nervousness and fear stop us from what we're doing.

982
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:39,420
 So I'm gonna give you a few simple things

983
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,340
 that we can start with.

984
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:43,100
 Okay, these are things I truly believe, honestly,

985
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,780
 everybody can do, okay?

986
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:46,380
 All of us can do.

987
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:47,780
 First thing is this, okay?

988
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:49,540
 And again, I'm just gonna say it bluntly, right?

989
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:52,260
 Don't be a jerk, okay?

990
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,180
 Like, be a nice person.

991
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:56,420
 Be the kind of person that other people want

992
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:58,660
 to have conversations with, right?

993
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:01,260
 You can't be rude and mean in one minute

994
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:03,260
 and then suddenly say, oh, let me tell you about Jesus,

995
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:06,700
 right, no one's gonna want to listen to that, okay?

996
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:09,980
 So just be kind, be nice, be loving, okay?

997
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:10,940
 Be a bit patient.

998
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:13,700
 I know we Hong Kongers are often very impatient

999
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:16,660
 and rushing to place in there all the time.

1000
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:20,980
 Slow down, be kind, be loving, okay?

1001
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:22,420
 Second thing is this, right?

1002
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:25,140
 Use your testimony, right?

1003
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:28,780
 If you can't remember all the details of the Bible story,

1004
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:30,820
 maybe one thing you can do is study up on that,

1005
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:33,060
 read up on that, get yourself familiar with that.

1006
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:36,300
 But even without that, right, your testimony

1007
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,660
 is the gospel at work in your life, right?

1008
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:41,540
 So it is, in a way, preaching the gospel, right?

1009
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:44,200
 And you're never gonna be confused about your own story

1010
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,880
 because it's what happened to you, right?

1011
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,680
 Like I said, we all have been through the experience

1012
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:53,760
 of receiving the love of Jesus, right, changing our lives.

1013
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,840
 Just start with that, you know, invite that friend,

1014
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,560
 invite that person out for coffee and say, you know what?

1015
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,000
 I'm gonna tell you a little bit more about myself, right?

1016
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,220
 Let me tell you about my journey in Christianity, right?

1017
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:08,480
 This is what I was before, this is where I am now, right?

1018
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,240
 It's such a beautiful way to introduce Jesus to someone.

1019
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,520
 And third thing, like we said at the beginning,

1020
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,560
 is to pray, right?

1021
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,640
 Let's be praying for this church.

1022
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,160
 Let's be praying for each other,

1023
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,080
 let's be praying for other brothers and sisters

1024
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:25,640
 all over the world who are walking down,

1025
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:28,480
 who are walking down this road and speak

1026
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:33,120
 and being encouraged to speak the gospel out.

1027
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,080
 Let's be in prayer for opportunities,

1028
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,000
 let's be in prayer for those

1029
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,440
 who haven't heard the gospel yet.

1030
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,760
 And together, as a body of Christ,

1031
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:46,880
 we say we will not give up until all have heard

1032
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,420
 and received the love and the gospel of Jesus.

1033
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:53,080
 Would you pray with me?

1034
00:45:53,080 --> 00:46:08,240
 No, we were talking just now and I made an assumption

1035
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:13,240
 that it's, you know, that everyone here has heard

1036
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,520
 that message and,

1037
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:19,400
 but I wanna give an opportunity right now

1038
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:23,320
 to perhaps this is the first time you've ever heard that,

1039
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:28,800
 that gospel story, the fact that there is a savior

1040
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,720
 and a Messiah that loves you and wants to save you

1041
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:36,480
 from your sin and give you hope and life

1042
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,720
 and life to the full.

1043
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:42,520
 And maybe today is the first time

1044
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,520
 you've ever responded to that,

1045
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:48,040
 or want to respond to that.

1046
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:51,920
 And so with an opportunity like this,

1047
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,960
 I don't want it to go to waste and

1048
00:46:53,960 --> 00:47:02,000
 I just wanna invite anyone who's there right now,

1049
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,760
 if that is you, two invitations for you.

1050
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,680
 Right now, maybe if you just,

1051
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,200
 you can just sit there and talk to God and just tell Him,

1052
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,320
 I want you, Jesus.

1053
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:19,320
 And it just starts with a very, very simple conversation

1054
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:22,360
 with God, you talk to Him just like you would anyone else.

1055
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:26,360
 You can do that quietly and He hears you,

1056
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,040
 He knows, He sees everything.

1057
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:33,160
 But if you're willing, if you are, and if that's you,

1058
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,960
 I would also invite you to perhaps get up off your seat

1059
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,720
 and come forward right now

1060
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:42,840
 so that the church can pray for you.

1061
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,160
 Together we can celebrate this wonderful,

1062
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:49,400
 life-changing moment, eternity-changing moment right now.

1063
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,080
 I'm just gonna throw the invitation out there.

1064
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,080
 It doesn't matter if nobody comes forward,

1065
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,760
 if you're in the upper house listening,

1066
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,960
 you can come downstairs and come forward.

1067
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:02,640
 I'm just gonna give us a couple of seconds

1068
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,560
 to respond to that.

1069
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:06,600
 So if that is you, either just respond where you are,

1070
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,600
 that's okay, but the courageous thing to do,

1071
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,520
 and we would love to be able to celebrate with you

1072
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,200
 if you would come forward so we can pray for you

1073
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,520
 and celebrate this together.

1074
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,280
 Is anybody out there right now with that?

1075
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:28,320
 Or maybe online, you can just let us know as well.

1076
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,900
 (gentle music)

1077
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:38,720
 All right, that's okay.

1078
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:42,840
 For the rest of us, we know what we need to do.

1079
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,960
 We've always known, today's probably just a reminder

1080
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:49,120
 of the mission, the calling that God has given,

1081
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:50,640
 the task that he's given to all of us.

1082
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,200
 And so Jesus, we pray that you would just fill us up

1083
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,880
 with the Holy Spirit, with courage.

1084
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:01,440
 Bring us to the people that need to hear your gospel.

1085
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,120
 And just through one conversation at a time, Lord,

1086
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:09,080
 we bring your kingdom here on this earth.

1087
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:13,360
 We show people that there is a God who loves them

1088
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:17,320
 and offers them everything that they've ever wanted,

1089
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:20,800
 everything that they needed can be found

1090
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,080
 when we find Jesus, true meaning and purpose in life.

1091
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,000
 And everything else fades away

1092
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,180
 when we have you in the center.

1093
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:34,040
 So Lord, help us to carry and live

1094
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:36,900
 and preach this gospel with us wherever we go,

1095
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,960
 from here to the ends of the earth.

1096
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:45,720
 Strengthen us and send us, we pray in Jesus' name, amen.

1097
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:49,980
 (gentle music)

1098
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:52,560
 (gentle music)

1099
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,140
 (gentle music)

1100
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:57,720
 (gentle music)

1101
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:07,720
