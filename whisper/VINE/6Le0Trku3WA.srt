Thank you, 我哋俾啲掌聲Francesca好唔好呀

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
好呀, 我喺度講個秘密俾大家聽先啦

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
就係呢, 其實我都未報名一陣間去BBQ

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
我都未報名, 係啦, 所以呢, 唔係, 個好消息係咩呢

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
即係呢, 所以如果你都未報名嘅話呢, 我會同你一齊去嘅

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
係啦, 我都未報名因為, 唔好意思唔好意思, 對唔住大佬

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
係啦, 係, 好, 等我搬個舖街過嚟先

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
啲蠟燭好靚呀真係

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
出年嘅暑假呢, 2024年嘅暑假

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
將會係呢, 神呼召我去進入全職服侍嘅20周年

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
係啦, 唔好望住, 我覺得好似好老咁樣, 係啦

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
喺2004年嘅時候呢, 當年我16歲

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
一陣一陣我數一計啦, 咁呀

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
嗰年我啱考完會考, 然後呢, 我嘅傳導人帶咗我去

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
同埋我教育嘅弟兄姊妹, 我哋一齊去咗個夏季營嗰度

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
一個喺烏溪沙嗰度, 好多嘅年青人一路喺度去敬拜

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
一路去呢聽神嘅訊息

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
我仲記得啲啲嗰啲講完講嗰啲咩啲啲啦咁樣

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
我好記得呢裏面嗰個敬拜

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
我好記得呢, 喺我敬拜嘅時候呢, 嗰幾日裏面

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
我曾經見到一個呢, 好鮮明嘅一個畫面

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
就係我見到呢, 耶穌佢向住我行埋嚟

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
然後呢, 佢將佢嘅手去遞畀我睇

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
佢畀我睇下佢手上面嗰個嘅釘痕

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
唔知點解呢, 當我見到呢個圖畫嘅時候呢

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
我嘅心裏面好感動呀

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
我就開始喺度喊, 不斷喊, 不斷喊

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
即係就係咁樣喊呀喊呀喊呀就過咗三四日嘅時間

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
即係神嘅愛呢, 好似一個瀑布咁

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
我由細到大, 即係十幾歲仔從來都冇試過

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
神嘅愛不斷好似瀑布咁樣去湧入我嘅生命裏面

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
就喺嗰個時間裏面, 我聽到, 即係喺我腦海裏面

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
我聽到有一把聲音嚟問我, 佢話

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
你願唔願意喺你餘下嘅人生裏面

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
你嚟跟隨我, 嚟服侍我

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
嗱, 講到呢度呢, 首先我要講多啲

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
大家可能唔知道關於我嘅嘢

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
我係點樣返教會嘅呢

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
今日即係我以前教會嘅傳道人都喺度添姐

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
好榮幸呀, 突然間講返呢樣嘢

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
喺我出世冇幾耐之後呢, 我媽媽發現佢患咗癌症

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
佢喺佢嘅病床喺醫院嘅時候有人向佢傳福音

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
而事者, 佢帶埋, 即係我媽媽帶埋我爸爸同埋我一齊返到去教會裏面

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
喺我三歲嘅時候, 我媽媽最後因為癌症佢離開咗

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
所以由我三歲嗰一刻開始, 我人生裏面有一個嘅夢想

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
就係我好想做一個醫生

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
可以去幫到人, 去醫到人, 等佢哋唔使再經歷我經歷過嘅嘢

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
所以呢, 即係喺我嘅人生自我細細個開始

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
我只得呢個夢想, 呢個嘅我嘅理想, 我嘅志願

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
我由細到大都一定會寫呢一樣嘢

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
而喺我細個嘅時候, 我都係行喺呢個正確嘅道路上面

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
即係我讀書嘅時候, 去到我中學嗰刻, 我喺新界, 即係我喺荃灣長大

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
我當時喺一間叫做喺新界裏面都幾ok嘅中學裏面

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
去到我中四, 中五, 我都係喺一個即係全級即係叫精英班

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
即係叫成績比較好嘅嗰班裏面

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
所以到我考會考嘅嗰刻, 其實我係有希望可以繼續去實踐我嘅夢想或者我嘅理想

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
但係就喺嗰幾日, 當我一路喺度喊, 一路喺度敬拜裏面

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
我聽到呢一把聲音嚟問我, 願唔願意喺我餘下嘅人生裏面

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
將我生命交畀佢, 去服侍佢

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
當時, 係我有其他嘅理想, 但係我唔知點解喺神嘅愛裏面

61
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
我覺得say yes或者講我願意係一件非常之自然, 毫無難度嘅一件事

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
當時我仲有一個咁樣嘅諗法, 即係話係囉, 望吓我

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
我都幾好呀, 即係啲嘢都做得幾好

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
神揀我係應該呀, 係咪?

65
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
但我唔知道原來我跟住嘅人生係會180度咁樣嚟反轉

66
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
去到我入大學嘅時候, 上次講過少少我大學讀啲乜嘢

67
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
但去到我讀大學嘅時候, 即係我嗰陣時呢, 即係因為我領受咗人生呢個呼召

68
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
我係非常之火熱嘅一個基督徒, 我會參加晒所有我知道可以參加嘅基督徒嘅活動

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
嗰啲咩學生團契呀, 學員傳道會呀, 嗰啲祈禱會呀, 我全部都去晒

70
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
我所有嘢都有參與, 喺外表上面, 我係一個基督徒

71
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
我係一個好為耶穌去火熱嘅一個人

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
我參與咗好多呢啲唔同嘅活動, 嚟到去表達我心裏面好想去侍奉嗰個心

73
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
但係同一時間, 近乎冇乜人知道嘅就係我裏面嗰啲嘢掙扎

74
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
喺學業上面嘅掙扎, 尤其是喺我大學讀咗大概一兩個學期之後

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
我開始發現自己呢泥足深陷喺一個嘅境地裏面

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
我冇辦法喺即係根據deadline完成我嘅功課

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
於是者開始有一兩科唔合格

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
然後再過咗兩個學期之後, 我心裏面越嚟越大壓力

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
但我心裏面諗, 我係嗰個基督徒, 我係嗰個領袖, 我係嗰個神揀選, 神呼召嗰個人

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
我嘅人生應該係好perfect嘅, 應該係好完美嘅

81
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
如果有人需要幫手嘅話, 應該係我去幫佢哋, 唔係佢哋嚟幫我嘅

82
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
我應該ok嘅, 喺我裏面一路有好大嘅壓力

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
我唔夠膽話畀我身邊嘅人聽

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
我身邊嘅嗰啲同學全部見到嘅就係

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
嘩, 呢個好熱心去服侍, 好熱心祈禱嘅treatment

86
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
到我year 2有一年去到一個位就係

87
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
我開始唔係好咁樣見人, 開始去走堂

88
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
去到一個位, 喺我year 2嘅唔記得上學期定下學期

89
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
我有一科呢, 因為我讀大學嘅時候係要take attendance

90
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
係要有一個minimum嘅上堂嘅要求

91
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
如果我再唔返學嗰一科嘅話, 我就會肥佬

92
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
我記得有一日我朝頭早係有一堂八點半嘅堂

93
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
我起身嘅時候望下個鬧鐘, 9點09分

94
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
大鑊喇, 即係好彩我讀中大, 咁我係住喺宿舍

95
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
但係中大都好大, 成個山頭我係即刻飛奔去個課室嗰度

96
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
嘩, 跑呀, 無效, 巴喘晒氣呀咁樣

97
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
嚟到課室門口嘅時候, 其實好簡單

98
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
打開到門入去搵個位坐低咁樣

99
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
咁就ok喇, 當無事發生

100
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
但係當我企喺門口嘅時候, 我腦裏面不斷喺度幻想緊

101
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
我一開門幾十對眼望住我, 好似而家咁樣嘅時候

102
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
我喺度腦裏面不斷mental rehearsal

103
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
喺度諗緊我啲同學會講嘅嘢

104
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
嘩, 呢個chap, 搞錯, 呢條友成日做project, 嘆泡, free ride

105
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
我喺腦裏面不斷幻想佢哋講緊嘅嘢

106
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
然後我就喺到門嗰度呆咗

107
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
我諗住唔係呀, 我係基督徒嚟㗎嘛

108
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
即係靠住神可以得勝, 靠住耶穌得勝咁樣

109
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
咁我就開始喺度祈禱, 我話住呀, 我真係好牛底, 求你俾勇氣我

110
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
俾勇氣我行入去坐低

111
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
祈完一分鐘之後, 唔係, 我都仲係好牛底

112
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
於是我再祈兩分鐘, 祈三分鐘, 祈四分鐘, 祈五分鐘

113
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
終於, 我鼓起勇氣

114
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
拎轉頭, 返去宿舍嗰度瞓覺

115
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
呢一覺我瞓咗兩個禮拜

116
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
兩個星期我匿埋咗去宿舍裏面

117
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
冇沖涼, 冇刷牙, 冇去見人

118
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
我唔知你有冇試過瞓覺, 瞓到一個點係

119
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
你瞓唔到啦, 你再瞓你會頭痛呀

120
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
因為你瞓得太耐, 你頭痛, 痛到要醒

121
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
我試過

122
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
痛到醒嘅時候, 覺得好似有啲肚餓啦

123
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
出去六個杯麵食完, 再繼續攤快係張床上面

124
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
後來我先知道原來呢啲叫做抑鬱症

125
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
或者叫做抑鬱症嘅病徵

126
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
喺嗰個學期完咗之後

127
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
我就退咗學, 離開咗大學

128
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
當時我諗, 係呀, 應該係因為呢

129
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
即係神父召我去做傳道人

130
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
但係呢, 我讀嗰啲嘢呢, 唔係做傳道人嘅嘢

131
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
所以呢, 神母祝福我, 等我去報解神學院再讀下先

132
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
於是我就夠膽死, 真係去報咗一間神學院

133
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
真係有間神學院夠膽死, 收咗我, 我就去讀書

134
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
然後成個循環再重覆一次

135
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
我再一次嘅交唔到功課

136
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
再一次嘅想走堂

137
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
再一次嘅喺我讀完兩年之後, 我退咗學

138
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
我記得嗰陣時, 有一日我搭巴士

139
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
我坐咗喺巴士嘅上層

140
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
我連驚到搭巴士, 我都唔敢見人

141
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
我搭巴士都要坐喺最上層, 最後面嗰個位嗰度

142
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
我望住窗外面, 我喺度祈禱

143
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
其實都唔知可以講啲乜嘢

144
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
我就同神講, 我話, 係咪我聽錯呢其實?

145
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
定係, 即係係咪我, 神啊, 我係咪聽錯咗你講?

146
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
即係, 或者係咪, 係咪我搞錯咗?

147
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
定係, 定係你搞錯咗呢?

148
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
我冇可能係你揀選嗰個人嚟㗎

149
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
當我哋喺人生裏面處處碰壁

150
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
面對一啲好大嘅艱難, 好大嘅挑戰, 或者好大嘅失敗嘅時候

151
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
自我懷疑, 或者對神嘅質疑

152
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
好多時候, 好似係一種條件反制

153
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
我哋第一時間就會咁樣做

154
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:36,000
疑惑幾乎係每一個人, 喺人生某一個時候都會經歷得到, 係咪?

155
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
如果我哋去睇吓字典裏面係點定義疑惑呢個字嘅話

156
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
對唔住, 我用英文翻譯返中文畀你

157
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
疑惑呢個字係講緊一種唔確定, 或者缺乏信念一種嘅感覺

158
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
喺我16歲嘅時候, 我係非常之確信神呼召我進入去嚟到全職服侍

159
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
呼召我成為一個傳道人, 或者宣教士, Whatever

160
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
但係當我一次又一次嚟到去碰壁, 當我一次又一次失敗嘅時候

161
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
我嘅信念嘅水平就開始插水, 咁樣

162
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
直到去到我23歲嘅時候, 我對於神呼召我呢句說話

163
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
我對呢句說話嘅信心, 嗰種嘅確定性, 嗰種嘅信念

164
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
已經去到蕩然無存嘅一個階段

165
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
可能我哋都試過好忠心咁樣去工作

166
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
但係可能我哋無得到我哋覺得我哋應得嘅一個晉升嘅機會

167
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
或者可能我哋一直為一個屋企人, 一個我哋好愛嘅人

168
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
佢嘅健康或者佢病咗可以康復, 我哋不斷去禱告

169
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
我哋相信神會嚟醫治佢, 神會嚟聽我哋嘅禱告

170
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
但係當我哋一次又一次去到醫院, 只係望住佢身體越嚟越差

171
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
望住佢好無奈, 好無助咁樣去受緊苦嘅時候

172
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
我哋嘅心裏面可能亦都會好難受

173
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
或者可能係我哋日常生活裏面, 我哋其實好努力好忠心去跟隨神

174
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
我哋返到嚟教會好努力去侍奉佢

175
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:03,000
我哋花好多嘅時間, 我哋嘅精力, 我哋嘅財力, 我哋嘅愛嚟到去付出咗好多

176
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
但係可能我哋會喺教會裏面感覺到受傷害

177
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
感覺到冇人明白我哋

178
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
我哋可能會對好多人失望

179
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
或者甚至我哋對神都有好多嘅失望

180
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
對佢有好多嘅懷疑, 有好多嘅質疑

181
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
喺度諗我係咪應該走咗去就算呢

182
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
現代嘅心理學家佢會話疑惑呢樣嘢, Doubt

183
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
疑惑呢樣嘢其實係人自然經驗嘅一部分

184
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
佢源於喺我哋嗰種與生俱來嘅批判性思考

185
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
或者我哋會質疑身邊嘅環境而去提出一啲嘅疑問

186
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
所以無道有暗, 每一次我哋人生裏面出現呢種疑惑嘅時候

187
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
都係用一種問題嘅形式出現

188
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
都係會出現一啲嘅疑問喺我哋嘅生命裏面

189
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
聖經對聖誕節嘅故事嘅描述裏面

190
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
作者從來都冇迴避過關於疑惑呢一個嘅問題

191
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
亦都冇嘗試去將一幅好美麗好完美嘅人性嘅圖畫

192
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
去嘗試展示畀我哋睇

193
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
喺事實上路加佢開始佢福音嘅故事嘅時候

194
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
佢係用一個疑惑嘅故事嚟開始佢嘅福音

195
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
但我相信如果今日我哋一齊花啲時間

196
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
你去睇呢個故事我哋一齊

197
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
我帶住呢即係我哋我哋一齊喺禱告裏面

198
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
我哋眼睛繼續去仰望神嘅話

199
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
我哋會好似故事裏面嘅人物一樣

200
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
同樣得到鼓勵同埋幫助

201
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
不如就喺我哋今日開始之前我哋就祈禱好冇呀

202
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
天父我哋要嚟打開你嘅話語

203
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
我哋要嚟返返到去喺2000年前耶穌出世嘅嗰個時段裏面

204
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
我哋想喺嗰個時間裏面望一望呢一個關於疑惑嘅故事

205
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
但係主我哋同樣地我哋今日嚟到你嘅面前求你

206
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
當我哋打開你話語嘅時候你向我哋嘅生命嚟去說話

207
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
如果我哋都活喺人生裏面有有唔同嘅疑惑

208
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
喺我哋生命唔同嘅地方裏面我哋都有好多嘅氣餒好多嘅灰心嘅話

209
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
我求你今日透過你嘅話語你親自嚟向我哋去說話

210
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
多謝你我哋咁樣禱告係奉耶穌命求

211
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
我們一齊嚟睇路加福音第一章

212
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
我哋由第五節嗰度開始睇

213
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
佢話喺希律作猶太王嘅時候

214
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
阿比亞班裏面有一個祭司叫做撒加利亞

215
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
佢妻子係亞倫嘅後代叫做伊利沙伯

216
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
佢哋兩個人喺神面前都係二人進行主一切嘅誡命同埋條例

217
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
沒有可指責的只係佢哋冇孩子

218
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
因為伊利沙伯不生育兩個人又年紀老邁

219
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
喺路加福音一開頭呢度呢我哋認識到一個叫做撒加利亞嘅祭司

220
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
佢唔單止係一個祭司咁簡單

221
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
連佢老婆都係祭司嘅一個後裔一個女嚟

222
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
以色列嘅祭司呢個職份其實係追溯返到

223
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
喺出埃及嘅嗰陣時由摩西去建立會莫嘅時候

224
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
一次過去建立埋呢個祭司嘅制度

225
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
會莫就係後來聖殿嘅一個嘅原型

226
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
就係敬拜嘅中心

227
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
我哋知道當時第一個嘅祭司或者大祭

228
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
第一個嘅大祭司就係由摩西嘅哥阿倫嚟到去擔任

229
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:14,000
祭司同埋聖殿就代表住整個以色列人佢哋嘅敬拜

230
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
而祭司就係喺聖殿裏面工作嘅嗰一班人

231
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
不過你需要知道一樣嘢就係

232
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
祭司唔係一份你可以send個application send個email去apply嘅一份工

233
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
係冇得搵工㗎

234
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
祭司呢個身份係與生俱來

235
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
喺以色列嘅十二個支派裏面

236
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
神子係揀選咗利美支派嘅人嚟到去擔任祭司呢個角色

237
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
所以你係冇得舉手話我都想做祭司

238
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
你一係出世嘅時候你一係唔係好似十二碼咁

239
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
一係入一係唔入係冇其他option

240
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
咁呀

241
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
所以呢

242
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
祭司喺以色列裏面呢就同君王同埋先知一樣

243
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
佢哋係嗰個領導嘅核心嘅階層嚟㗎

244
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
所以佢哋一出世嘅時候已經係一個有一個好尊貴嘅身份

245
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
佢哋都係啲嘅名門望族

246
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
喺呢度我哋認識到呢一對夫婦

247
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
佢哋係一對嚟自尊貴祭司階層嘅一對夫婦

248
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
路加繼續話畀我哋聽

249
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
佢哋係二人係無可指責

250
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
即係佢哋唔單止擁有咗好尊貴嘅一個社會嘅地位

251
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
而且仲有一個非常之好嘅品格

252
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
如果你係一個第一世紀嘅讀者

253
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
你讀到嚟呢度嘅話

254
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
你會預期呢一對咁完美嘅夫婦

255
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
喺猶太社會裏面應該係得高望重

256
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
然後路加用咗指示或者英文but呢個字

257
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
通常你見到但係或者只是

258
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
你好似係知道有啲嘢係唔係好妥

259
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
呢度話只係佢哋冇小朋友

260
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
而且佢哋年紀好大

261
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
喺猶太人嘅文化裏面呢

262
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
生小朋友係神嘅祝福嚟㗎

263
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
另一方面一對夫婦當佢哋唔能夠去生小朋友

264
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
當佢哋不育嘅時候

265
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
好多時候就會引嚟好多嘅閒言閒語嘅社會裏面

266
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
甚至可能有好多嘅人會對佢哋產生好多嘅睇法

267
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
好多嘅歧視

268
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
佢哋會有好多嘅羞恥

269
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
如果冇仔女嘅時候

270
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
唔單止當時嘅社會你會被視為神唔喜悅你哋

271
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
而且可能係神喺度懲罰緊你一個嘅象徵

272
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
你可以想像下佢哋一生裏面

273
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
面對住咁多咁多情緒情感上面嘅折磨嘅痛苦

274
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
同埋喺社會裏面嗰種嘅挑戰

275
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
佢哋一方面竭盡全力咁樣去服侍神

276
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
去跟隨神

277
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
但係同一個時間佢哋陷入咗一個困境裏面

278
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
就係呢個處境講緊好似神嘅恩典

279
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
神嘅同在

280
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
神嘅祝福並唔喺佢哋嘅身上面

281
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
更加慘嘅係

282
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
佢哋可能係遭受緊神嘅懲罰

283
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
可以肯定嘅係佢哋咁多年嚟肯定都一直

284
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
去為可以得到一個小朋友嚟到祈禱

285
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
但係呢個係一個從來冇被應允嘅一個禱告

286
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
喺撒加利亞嘅生命裏面

287
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
作為一個祭司佢只有一個工作

288
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
佢嘅工作就係代表猶太人向神去祈禱

289
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
但係佢自己嘅生活裏面

290
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
喺佢自己嘅生命裏面

291
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
一直有一個冇被應允過嘅禱告

292
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
你可唔可以想像一下

293
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
如果你係呢班猶太人嘅話

294
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
你仲夠唔夠膽搵呢個祭司為你祈禱

295
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
佢自己求緊嗰樣嘢咁多年嚟

296
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
佢都冇得到過

297
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
你夠膽搵佢祈禱

298
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
如果你係撒加利亞嘅話

299
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
你自己仲覺得你有資格去做

300
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
你與神俱來應該要做嘅工作

301
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
我哋一齊繼續睇落去

302
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
第八節嗰套咁講

303
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
佢話撒加利亞按班次

304
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
喺神嘅面前執行祭司嘅職務

305
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
照祭司嘅規矩抽籤

306
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
入到佢煮嘅電裏面去燒香

307
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
燒香嘅時候眾百姓喺外面去禱告

308
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
呢度路加突然鏡頭一轉

309
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
將我哋帶到去祭司嘅日常工作

310
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
撒加利亞嘅日常工作裏面

311
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
喺當時猶太祭司嘅制度裏面

312
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
總共係有24個班次

313
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
除咗啲重大之事

314
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
大時大節

315
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
即係要大家人人有份永不落空之外

316
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
喺其餘嘅時間

317
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
其實24班次嘅祭司

318
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
每一年只係需要侍奉兩次

319
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
每次只係為期一個星期

320
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
我睇到呢度嘅時候發抖

321
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
如果我哋都係咁就好

322
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
即係一個出足全年嘅糧

323
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
但係每年只係返兩個禮拜工

324
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
嘩!真係發達

325
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Hallelujah

326
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
我哋係

327
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
唔單止係咁

328
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
其實當時喺猶太傳地裏面

329
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
係有成千上萬咁多個祭司喺度

330
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
所以每一個祭司

331
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
喺佢一生人裏面

332
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
其實佢只係得一次嘅機會

333
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
入到去聖殿嘅聖所裏面

334
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
嚟到去燒香

335
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
換句話講

336
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
撒加利亞喺呢一度

337
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
佢經歷緊佢人生

338
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
整個祭司嘅生涯

339
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
佢事業上嗰個最高峰嘅高峰點

340
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
嗰個佢期待咗好耐

341
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
嗰個佢唯一可以作為一個祭司

342
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
被允許行入到去聖殿嘅聖所裏面

343
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
去燒香去侍奉去祭祀嘅嗰個moment

344
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
喺佢人生裏面

345
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
同耶和華同呢個以色列嘅神

346
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
同創造成個宇宙嘅創造主

347
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
最最最最最最接近嘅嗰一刻

348
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
就係呢一個時刻

349
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
可能佢話

350
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
我就係為咗呢一刻而出世㗎啦

351
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
路加俾我哋見到

352
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
撒加利亞佢自己生命嘅故事

353
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
佢經歷咗佢帶住嘅

354
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
生命裏面帶住嘅嗰嗰啲嘅痛苦

355
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
亦都俾我哋見到

356
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
而家就係佢生命裏面

357
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
生命裏面最高峰嘅一個時刻

358
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
然後路加佢繼續講

359
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
佢話有主嘅一個使者

360
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
企喺香壇嘅右邊

361
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
向佢顯現

362
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
撒加利亞睇到就驚慌害怕

363
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
天使同佢講

364
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
撒加利亞唔使驚

365
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
因為你嘅祈禱已經被聽見

366
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
你嘅妻子伊麗莎白要給你生一個兒子

367
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
你要為佢起名叫做約翰

368
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
你必歡喜快樂

369
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
有好多人因為佢嘅出世亦都必喜樂

370
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
佢喺主面前將要為大

371
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
淡酒烈酒都唔飲

372
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
從母腹裏面就被聖靈充滿

373
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
佢係要使好多人

374
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
好多以色列嘅人迴轉

375
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
歸於主佢哋嘅神

376
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
佢將會有伊麗亞嘅精神或者spirit同埋能力

377
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
或者應該亦都心智

378
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
你哋呢度行喺主嘅面前

379
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
叫父親嘅心轉向兒女

380
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
叫搏逆嘅人轉向二人嘅智慧

381
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
又為主預備迎接佢嘅百姓

382
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
你可唔可以想像到一個更加完美嘅結果

383
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
等咗咁耐

384
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
一個天使出現

385
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
喺佢人生最高峰嘅時刻同佢講

386
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
你嘅祈禱已經被聽見

387
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
如果有一日

388
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
喺你嘅生命可能喺你祈緊土

389
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
你返緊嚟教會嘅時候

390
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
你唔知做緊啲咩嘅時候

391
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
突然間有個天使同你講

392
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
你祈禱好多年嗰件事

393
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
神聽見你嘅祈禱被聽見

394
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
我唔知你會有咩感受

395
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
喺度計數

396
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
如果撒加利亞同伊麗莎白

397
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
佢哋每一日喺人生裏面

398
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
每一日都可以得到一個仔

399
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
或者得到一個小朋友去祈禱嘅話

400
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
可能佢哋年事已高

401
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
我當佢七八十歲

402
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
我當佢為呢件事祈禱大約三四十年咁

403
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
如果每一日祈一次

404
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
即係一年三百六十五次

405
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
乘返四十年嘅話

406
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
咁就代表佢已經總共為呢件事祈禱超過

407
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
可能大約一萬五千次

408
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
你有冇試過喺你嘅人生裏面

409
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
為同一件事祈咗一萬五千次土

410
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
應該冇啦

411
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
我咁樣望落去都冇人理我

412
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
應該冇

413
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
我可以幻想得到

414
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
佢哋啱啱開始去祈禱嘅時候

415
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
係咁

416
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
啱啱結婚

417
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
親愛嘅神

418
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
多謝你將我哋嘅配偶賜予咗俾我哋

419
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
而家我哋幸福快樂咁樣結咗婚

420
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
我哋準備好㗎啦

421
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
即係我哋祈禱

422
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
你會將一個孩子賜畀我哋

423
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
成為我哋生命嘅禮物

424
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
阿門

425
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,000
等咗好耐

426
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
咩都冇發生過

427
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
可能跟住之後就係

428
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
親愛嘅神

429
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
我哋呢

430
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
好尊重你嘅時間表

431
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
你個time table

432
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
我哋相信你

433
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
我哋祈禱你會喺你認為合適嘅時間

434
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
畀一個小朋友我哋

435
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
阿門

436
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,000
又過咗一段時間

437
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
神呀我都唔知道你

438
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
之前同你講嗰啲

439
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
你有冇聽到

440
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
即係呢

441
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
想要個仔呢

442
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
如果呢我哋兩個有啲咩做得唔好

443
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
有啲咩唔滿意嘅地方

444
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
你可以即管同我哋講

445
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
我哋會改

446
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
係咪我哋奉獻唔夠多

447
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
係咪我睇聖經睇得唔夠多

448
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
係咪我返教會侍奉唔勤

449
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
係咪我上次返去侍奉嗰陣

450
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
有少少偷懶你見到你唔開心

451
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
你話畀我聽

452
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
你話畀我聽呀神

453
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
開始可能去到一個

454
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
拍緊你同神去

455
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
討價還價嘅地步

456
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
最後可能係

457
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
唉

458
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
算啦神

459
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
我

460
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
我頂唔順

461
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
太辛苦咁樣等落去

462
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
咁樣無了期等落去

463
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
我頂唔順呀

464
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
我老婆已經更年期都離咗

465
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
即係我哋唔會再有機會得到小朋友啦係咪呀

466
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
如果係咁嘅話

467
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
算啦你當我從來冇講過呢件事

468
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
我哋忘記佢

469
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
我會繼續跟隨你

470
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
我會繼續侍奉你

471
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
不過我以後都唔會再同你講呢件事

472
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
阿門

473
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:41,000
我唔知佢祈咗幾多咁樣嘅禱

474
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
我唔知過咗幾耐

475
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
可能耐到一個地步係

476
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
佢都唔記得咗自己

477
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
以前係點樣為呢啲嘢祈禱

478
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
但係就係佢呢個事業嘅最高峰嘅時候

479
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
就當佢企喺聖所裏面

480
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
你去燒香嘅嗰刻

481
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
一個天使突然間出現

482
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
喺佢嘅面前同佢講呢句說話

483
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
你嘅禱告被誰聽

484
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
或者你嘅禱告被聽到

485
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
我嘅禱告被聽到

486
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
咩意思呀

487
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
我祈咗呢個禱不談一萬次

488
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
萬五次

489
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
咁多年嚟

490
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
我其他嗰啲祭司嘅同事

491
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
我啲鄰居

492
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
我啲屋企人

493
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
個個都同我講

494
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
係呀神聽咗你禱告㗎啦

495
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
神一定會聽你禱

496
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
上帝聽禱告呀

497
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
係呀佢聽咗㗎啦

498
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
你有信心得㗎啦

499
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
信心大啲就得㗎啦

500
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
好多人話

501
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
嗰個好仁慈嘅

502
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
嗰個好好嘅神

503
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
嗰個好信實嘅神佢聽到

504
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
但係你睇下

505
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
喺我嘅生命裏面

506
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
而家係點樣樣

507
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
係冇嘢呀

508
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
係乜都冇呀

509
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
從沒有

510
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
從來都冇有

511
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
就係咁樣呀

512
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
我求嘅嘢

513
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
我一直都得唔到呀

514
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
你哋同我講

515
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
而家我嘅禱告得到英文

516
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
你知唔知我咩年紀呀

517
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
你知唔知我人生去到咩階段呀

518
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
其實我一早已經放棄咗㗎啦

519
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
我已經唔再諗呢件事㗎啦

520
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
點解你要突然間

521
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
攞返呢件事出嚟講呀

522
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
喺我後生嘅時候

523
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
我真係相信㗎

524
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
我真係確信

525
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
神已經聽咗我禱告

526
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
我確信佢會回應我嘅禱告

527
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
但係我而家都咁老

528
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
我老婆都咁老啦

529
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
我哋唔祈呢啲禱㗎啦

530
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
你唔好再提呢啲嘢啦

531
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
好唔好呀

532
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
我都唔知道

533
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
我都唔肯定

534
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
我唔確定

535
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
神係咪真係有聽過我祈禱

536
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
我唔好確定

537
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
神係咪真係

538
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
真係愛我或者會嚟祝福我

539
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
而家你話畀我聽

540
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
我哋會生個仔

541
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
我憑乜嘢可以知道係真

542
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
我點樣樣可以確定

543
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
How can I be certain

544
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,000
毫無疑問呢個係一個

545
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
充滿住疑惑疑問嘅故事

546
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
喺呢度我哋見到

547
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
撒加利亞一個好年老嘅祭司

548
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
佢係一生咁樣去服侍神嘅一個僕人

549
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
但係多年嚟經過

550
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
過住一啲好敬虔

551
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
但係已經無可指責嘅生活之後

552
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
佢仍然好似你

553
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
好似我

554
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
好似我哋在座所有人咁樣

555
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
佢哋都喺撒加利亞

556
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
佢都喺佢自己嘅疑惑裏面

557
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
嚟到去掙扎

558
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
所以今日如果喺我哋中間

559
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
有任何人我哋曾經喺生命

560
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
或者而家喺我哋嘅生命裏面

561
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
我哋經歷過任何嘅疑惑

562
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
你要知道你喺呢個地方裏面

563
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
你唔係孤單

564
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
你唔係唯一一個

565
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
唔係淨係得你先至

566
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
關埋房門嘅時候

567
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
其中好多套喺度問神呀

568
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
你係咪真㗎

569
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
你係咪真係幫我㗎

570
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
喺聖經裏面我哋見到

571
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
跟住加伯列

572
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
佢拜訪完撒加利亞之後

573
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
就去咗搵瑪利亞

574
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
同年老嘅撒加利亞

575
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
同伊利沙伯唔一樣

576
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
瑪利亞佢啱啱定咗婚

577
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
仲未結婚

578
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
所以佢可能只係一個十幾歲嘅

579
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
teenager 一個細路女嚟嘅啫

580
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
或者一個年青人嚟嘅

581
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
sorry 十幾歲唔係細路女

582
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
對唔住對唔住

583
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
十幾歲係我哋中間

584
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
十幾歲好憎我哋細路仔細路女

585
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
對唔住係年青人年青人

586
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
加伯列佢用相似嘅方式

587
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
嚟對顯現

588
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
傳遞有一個相似嘅訊息

589
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
就係話你瑪利亞

590
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
你將會點樣生一個小朋友出嚟

591
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
佢會係至高神嘅兒子

592
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
佢將會係成個世界嘅救主

593
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
佢嘅國度應該係永無止境嘅

594
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
瑪利亞就諗啦

595
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
十幾歲咋喎

596
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
我未結婚㗎喎

597
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
吓 怎麼會咁樣

598
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
點樣會發生得到呢件事

599
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
How would this be

600
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
點樣會發生嘅呢

601
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
路加刻意去將呢兩個故事

602
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Side by side 咁樣擺埋一齊

603
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
嚟到佢向我哋去展示兩個人

604
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
一個老嘅濟斯薩加利亞

605
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
同埋一個年輕嘅童女瑪利亞嘅故事

606
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
佢哋兩個都有好合理嘅疑惑

607
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
當佢聽到一啲完全聽唔明嘅嘢嘅時候

608
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
佢哋有呢一種嘅疑問係非常之正常

609
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
但路加俾我哋睇到佢哋兩個嘅問題

610
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
佢哋兩個面對咗呢啲疑惑嘅時候

611
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
佢哋問咗兩個好唔一樣嘅問題

612
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
薩加利亞問嘅問題

613
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
佢嘅疑惑係我點樣可以確定

614
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
我點樣可以知道呢

615
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
我點樣可以certain

616
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
我點樣可以去肯定呢

617
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
換言之

618
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
佢喺度搵緊嘅係一種嘅確定性

619
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
佢搵緊嘅係一個certainty

620
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
我要確確實實知道呢件事呀

621
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
加帕列比佢嘅回應就係

622
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
你唔相信我講嘅嘢

623
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
而佢講嘅嘢其實就係神嘅話語

624
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
所以加帕列喺度指出咗

625
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
薩加利亞佢嘅不信

626
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
今日我哋喺度討論咗幾個嘅概念

627
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
畀我去解釋一下佢哋係點樣互相嘅連繫起嚟

628
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
首先我哋講到一個叫做疑惑嘅概念

629
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
頭先講到啦疑惑就係當我哋對一啲嘢唔確定

630
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
或者冇缺乏信念嘅時候

631
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
我哋內心嗰種嘅感覺

632
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
喺我哋嘅信仰裏面疑惑周不時都會出現嘅係咪

633
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
有時我哋會問神呀你係咪真係愛我哋㗎

634
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
有時我哋會問神呀你係咪真係聽我哋祈禱㗎

635
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
或者神呀你到底係咪真係真實㗎

636
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
我哋會唔會只係喺度妄想緊呢個世界有一個神喺度嘅呢

637
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
作為基督徒甚至作為人

638
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,000
我哋好多時候一生裏面都會不斷嘅經歷疑惑

639
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
唔單止喺我哋嘅信仰上面

640
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
甚至我哋人生裏面我哋經歷好多對自己嘅疑惑係咪

641
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
跟住我哋再講不信呢個概念係啲咩嚟

642
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:17,000
咩嚟㗎呢不信係當我哋決定喺我哋嘅人生裏面當冇神咁樣去過我哋嘅生活

643
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:24,000
即係咩呢即係我哋可以其實同時係一個基督徒但係同時有不信㗎喎點解呢真係

644
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
我哋可以每個禮拜返到嚟教會裏面去聚會去唱歌睇聖經祈禱

645
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:35,000
但係我哋唔相信佢係我哋人生裏面人生每一個範疇裏面嗰個最終嘅權威

646
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
我哋可以唔相信佢仍然喺我哋生命某啲範疇裏面去工作緊

647
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
我哋可能話係呀我相信神呀但係我對我自己嘅事業有我自己嘅計劃喎

648
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
或者我都為我嘅問題祈禱咗好多年佢都冇消息

649
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
我估神都係冇乜興趣聽我祈禱或者佢太忙

650
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
我真係聽過有人話神應該太忙唔得人聽我呢啲芝麻綠豆嘅祈禱

651
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
我自己搞掂佢啦

652
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,000
每當我哋去做一個決定我哋決定神呀你你可以唔使理我人生呢個部分嘅時候

653
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
你人生嘅嗰一個部分裏面就開始產生緊不信

654
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
但係重要嘅我哋要知道疑惑並唔係不信

655
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
但係疑惑可以產生可以變成不信

656
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:23,000
等我讀下一位英國嘅神學教授麥格夫佢寫嘅呢番說話

657
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
佢話乜嘢時候疑惑會變成不信呢

658
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
就係當你容許佢容讓佢嘅時候

659
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
當你執著於一啲關於信仰嘅不切實際unrealistic嘅諗法嘅時候

660
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
如果你相信你能夠或者需要絕對肯定咁樣知道一切

661
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
如果你需要certainty嘅時候

662
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
你嘅信心好快就會陷入去困境陷入去危機裏面

663
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
但信心唔係咁樣嘅

664
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
信心係關於你願意去生活願意相信神嘅存在同埋應許

665
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,000
知道有一日呢種嘅存在同埋嗰啲嘅應許都會完全得到證明

666
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
但係當你未知道之前就目前嚟講

667
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
我哋憑信心行事而唔係憑眼見行事

668
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
We live by faith and not by sight

669
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
當撒加利亞開始去疑惑

670
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
神係咪真係有聽佢祈禱嘅時候

671
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
神係咪真係會賜一個仔畀佢嘅時候

672
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
而當呢一種嘅懷疑去促使佢去講

673
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
我點樣可以肯定呀

674
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
促使佢去要求神畀一種確定性

675
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
佢畀一個certainty佢嘅時候

676
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
嗰個就係佢產生不信嘅嗰個moment嗰個時刻

677
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
作為人我哋好多時候祈禱

678
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
我哋都會好想同神求乜嘢

679
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
求一啲嘅印證

680
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
但係當我哋睇到嗰個印證嘅時候

681
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
其實我哋就唔需要再有信心

682
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
喺Alpha裏面第四第五個禮拜

683
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
我哋會開始向人介紹祈禱呢一樣嘢

684
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
祈禱係咩嚟㗎點樣祈禱嘅呢

685
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
然後通常去到嗰課最尾嘅時候

686
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
我哋都會同啲新朋友一齊祈禱

687
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,000
好多時候嗰啲可能係嗰啲新朋友人生裏面第一次去祈禱

688
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
呢個每次都係我最興奮亦都係最緊張嘅一部分

689
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
實不相瞞又多一個confession

690
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
即係其實喺教會咁多年

691
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
我哋係好識奇嗰啲十拿九穩永遠都唔會失敗嘅祈禱

692
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
哦 Ivan唔開心呀

693
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
哎呀 Ivan呢排病唔開心

694
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
哦係呀 神你又會醫治佢啦

695
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
你又好愛佢啦 你又會嚟祝福佢啦

696
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
係呀 即係神你會嚟保守佢㗎嘛

697
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
修神求你呢就按你嘅心意嚟到去醫治佢

698
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:39,000
就按住你幾時鍾意呢你就嚟到去觸摸佢咁樣

699
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
係啦咁我哋就祝福 Ivan啦

700
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
我哋好愛佢 你好愛佢㗎嘛

701
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
奉主名求阿門

702
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
但係通常我發現當我去到Alpha嘅時候

703
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
我去祈禱嘅時候就係嗰個人話佢最近冇咗份工

704
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
佢搵緊工

705
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
咁我唔能夠話阿神呀

706
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
即係你睇佢人生裏面呢萬事都有晒之意

707
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
你唔可以講咁多複雜嘅

708
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
佢個個新朋友嚟㗎

709
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
你唯一可以講嘅就係神呀我求你畀份工佢

710
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Amen

711
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:11,000
而呢一個祈禱係一個我唔知道係咪真係會成真嘅一個禱告

712
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
所以我發現原來係我人生裏面最需要信心嘅一個moment係邊度呢

713
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
就係當我係帶緊Alpha第四個禮拜講祈禱之後

714
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
散會之前嗰個祈禱我發現係最需要信心嘅

715
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
神呀你係咪真係有聽我祈禱

716
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
你係咪真係會畀份工佢

717
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
我好似將條命擺咗上嚟

718
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
你唔嚟做咁就係我好魚㗎啦

719
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
咁下個禮拜返嚟咁樣

720
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
信心嘅祈禱應該係咁

721
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
我哋有幾耐祈嗰啲禱係已經係唔需要信心嘅呢係咪

722
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,000
有另一個嘅基督徒嘅作家楊肥力叫做

723
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Philip Yancy 佢係咁樣講

724
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
佢話信心嘅相反唔係疑惑

725
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
信心嘅相反係確定性係呢種certainty

726
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,000
邊度有確定性係嗰個地方就唔再需要信心

727
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Where there is certainty, there is no room for faith

728
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
當你都可以睇到啦當你可以見到嘅時候啦

729
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
你仲點需要嚟相信神呢

730
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
你仲點需要嚟信靠佢呢

731
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
你都見到啦我哋仲點需要信心呢

732
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
路加係呢度畀我哋見到另一種嘅方式

733
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
嚟回應我哋嘅疑惑

734
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
當年有嘅瑪利亞由天使嗰度收到一個咁奇怪嘅訊息

735
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
佢都有佢嘅疑惑

736
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
但係佢冇喺冇因為佢唔能夠理解而拒絕神嘅話語

737
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
佢冇喺佢嘅困惑裏面要求神畀一個去確定佢

738
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
佢問嘅嗰個問題係How would this be

739
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
點解會咁樣發生點會有啲咁樣嘅事呢

740
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
呢個問題係一個喺度探索緊神喺佢生命裏面嘅旨意

741
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
神喺佢生命裏面工作嘅一個問題

742
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
而當佢天使向佢解釋完

743
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
佢開始明白更加多嘅時候

744
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
佢講呢句說話去回應佢話

745
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
我係主嘅侍女

746
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
我係主嘅servant

747
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
我係主嘅僕人

748
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
情願照理嘅話

749
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
成就喺我嘅身上邊

750
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
路加嚟畀我哋見到原來可以有另一個pathway

751
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
另一個途徑去回應我哋生命裏面嘅疑惑

752
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
但係今日對於嗰啲仍然活喺疑惑

753
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
仍然活喺好多嘅唔肯定不確定嘅人

754
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
中間嘅good news係乜嘢呢

755
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
聖誕嘅故事

756
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
路加嘅聖誕故事係一個疑惑嘅故事開始

757
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
但路加畀我哋見到

758
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
神從來都唔拒絕嗰啲疑惑嘅人

759
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
相反神成日都去親近佢哋

760
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
好似阿伯拉罕 摩西 約伯

761
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
俾得我哋可以不斷數落去

762
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
佢哋都對神或者對神嘅話語有好多嘅疑惑

763
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
如果你讀過詩篇嘅話

764
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
好多嘅哀求嘅詩都充滿住對神嘅疑惑

765
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
但神唔會將呢啲疑惑嘅人攀走

766
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
佢畀我哋將呢啲嘅問題帶到佢面前

767
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
佢唔係想我哋只係單單根據自己嘅經驗

768
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
我係呀 神都唔會幫我

769
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
算啦 收工啦 唔再祈禱啦

770
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
佢唔想我哋只係得出自己嘅結論就放棄

771
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
佢唔想我哋嘅心裏面開始產生呢啲嘅不信

772
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
讓呢啲不信喺我哋嘅生命裏面不斷地成長

773
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:14,000
撒加利亞 佢嘅疑惑並冇令到佢失去咗神祝福嘅資格

774
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
我再講多次

775
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
即使撒加利亞 企喺聖殿裏面嗰一刻

776
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
當佢嘅心裏面充滿疑惑嘅時候

777
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
咁樣佢嘅疑惑並冇令到佢喪失得到神祝福嘅資格

778
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
即使神叫到佢沉默 唔可以出聲 唔可以講嘢

779
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
呢個都係一個嚟提醒佢嘅標誌

780
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
當佢後來 佢嘅太太開始大肚

781
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
佢想講嘢 但係講唔出嘅時候

782
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
佢就終於可以明白 原來出於神嘅說話

783
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
冇有一句係會落空

784
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
冇有一句係唔帶住能力

785
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
天使同瑪利亞講嗰句說話

786
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
撒加利亞可以喺佢唔能夠講嘢嘅時候

787
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
用佢嘅生命親身嚟體會得到

788
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
神嘅說話係唔落空

789
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
撒加利亞嘅仔係施洗約翰

790
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
佢係舊約裏面最偉大嘅先知

791
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
佢親眼見到耶穌 伺服耶穌

792
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
甚至為耶穌施洗 為佢預備道路

793
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
但係當後來佢畀人捉咗拉去坐監嘅時候

794
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
喺佢嘅生命裏面都充滿咗一個疑惑嘅時刻

795
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
施洗約翰派佢嘅門徒去同耶穌講

796
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
佢話 你係咪嗰個要嚟嘅

797
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
定係我應該去expect

798
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
我應該去等 我應該去期待另外一個人呢

799
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
換言之當施洗約翰畀人拉咗去坐監嘅時候

800
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
佢嘅心裏面都有好多嘅疑惑

801
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
好多嘅不確定性

802
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
佢都去問耶穌

803
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
耶穌你係咪堅嘅 你係咪真嘅

804
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
耶穌冇畀約翰一個明確嘅答案

805
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
但係耶穌邀請約翰

806
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
嚟睇下佢做咗啲乜嘢嘢

807
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
所以耶穌就回答約翰派嘅嗰個使者就話

808
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
你返去同約翰報告

809
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
你所睇見嘅 你所聽聞嘅

810
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
就係黑眼嘅可以得漢見

811
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
瘸腿嘅可以走路

812
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
麻瘋嘅病人得到潔淨

813
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
聾嘅可以聽見

814
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
死人都復活

815
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
好消息傳咗畀窮嘅人

816
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
耶穌你同約翰講

817
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
我唔要畀一個確定嘅答案你

818
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
我要話畀你聽

819
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
我喺呢個世界裏面

820
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
我要畀你見得到聽得到

821
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
我仍然喺度做緊啲乜嘢嘢

822
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
今日神嚟回應我哋心裏面嗰個疑問嘅時候

823
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
回應我哋心裏面嗰啲嘅

824
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
嗰啲嘅不確定嘅時候

825
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
神唔係要嚟畀一個肯定嘅答案我哋

826
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
佢係要嚟打開我哋嘅眼

827
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
打開我哋嘅耳仔

828
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
畀我哋可以睇到去聽到

829
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
佢喺十字架上面已經話我哋做咗啲咩

830
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
而且佢喺我哋今日呢個世界嘅周圍

831
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
仍然喺度做緊啲乜嘢嘢

832
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
以至我哋可以喺我哋嘅疑惑之中

833
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
再一次因為仰望神見到佢嘅工作

834
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
我哋可以有返信心

835
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
喺我廿三歲嘅時候

836
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
我幾乎放棄

837
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
即係我幾乎就覺得

838
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
係囉

839
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
因為我聽錯

840
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
即係冇可能係神呼召我

841
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
但係當我想起

842
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
嗰個耶穌畀我睇到佢釘痕嘅雙手

843
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
當我想起神嘅愛

844
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
點樣喺我成個身體

845
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
成個生命裏面

846
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
嚟到去流動嘅時候

847
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
唔知點解我心裏面我覺得

848
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
可能我可以再試多一次

849
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
我唔知道

850
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I don't know how

851
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
但係可能

852
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
神會嚟去fix下

853
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
會嚟修補我嗰個咁破爛嘅人生

854
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,000
我只可以相信如果有人仍然可以嚟幫我嘅話

855
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
嗰個肯定係耶穌

856
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
所以我同佢講

857
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
我話

858
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
我唔知道

859
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
我有乜可能係你揀選嗰個人

860
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
難命就有一條

861
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
你要就攞去

862
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
你要就使用

863
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,000
之後神帶咗我去一個地方叫做Alpha

864
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,000
拍咗十幾集嘅影片

865
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
去向人介紹耶穌係邊一個

866
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
去話俾人聽耶穌

867
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
佢喺我哋生命裏面做咗啲乜嘢

868
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
之後神帶咗我去一間教會叫做The Vine

869
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
喺嗰度主任牧師無啦啦同我講

870
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Chadman我睇得出你係一個

871
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
曾經同神失交嘅人

872
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
我見到你咁行路

873
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
我見到你嘅生命同神嘅掙扎

874
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
我哋嘅教會好歡迎你

875
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
我哋嘅教會需要有啲咁樣嘅人

876
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
不如你返嚟服侍

877
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
今日企喺大家面前

878
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
我係一個

879
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
即係Two times drop out 退咗兩次學

880
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
無學位無證書

881
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
無乜資格證明嘅人

882
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
仍然都係難命一條

883
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
仍然都係

884
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
喺我嘅疑惑裏面

885
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
神嚟叫我將我信心擺喺佢裏面

886
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
繼續叫佢服侍

887
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
差唔多二十年

888
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
今日我企喺度

889
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
做緊嘅就係Exactly 二十年前

890
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
喺嗰個Summer Camp裏面

891
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
我聽到我見到神呼召我做嘅嘢

892
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
如果你嘅生命你嘅生活

893
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
都係因為對神嘅一啲疑惑

894
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
充滿住好多嘅掙扎嘅話

895
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
你會喺呢間教會

896
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
你會喺我哋嘅群體裏面

897
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
搵到你嘅位置

898
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
神冇嬲你

899
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
神冇拒絕你

900
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
神唔會因為你對佢有疑惑

901
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
就唔要你

902
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
聖誕節嘅故事嚟提醒我哋

903
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
神反而係因為咁樣而嚟

904
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
佢邀請我哋進入去一個

905
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
信心嘅旅程裏面

906
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
邀請我哋去睜大眼

907
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
去睇下去聽下

908
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
佢喺我哋嘅世界

909
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
喺我哋嘅生命裏面

910
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
仲做緊啲乜嘢嘢

911
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
佢邀請你進入一個

912
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
唔係憑眼見

913
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
係要憑信心去行嘅旅程裏面

914
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
佢邀請你再一次去信任佢

915
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
唔知道喺我哋中間

916
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
有冇啲人聖靈呢一刻都同你講緊

917
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
嚟呀

918
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
跟從我呀

919
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
畀我哋一齊祈禱好唔好

920
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
我邀請敬拜隊返到嚟

921
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
我哋中間

922
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:51,000
畀我哋一齊企起身

923
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
喺我哋中間可能有啲人你

924
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
冇錯你係每個禮拜你返到嚟

925
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
或者你繼續有你基督徒嘅生活

926
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
但係你知道喺你嘅生命裏面

927
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
有一啲嘅位置

928
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
嗰個位置已經係off limits to god

929
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
即係話神呀

930
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
呢個地方你唔需要理啦

931
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
呢個地方你唔需要入去

932
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
呢個地方你唔需要捉摸

933
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
呢個地方你唔需要再同我講任何嘅嘢

934
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:30,000
我哋嘅生命裏面

935
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
有啲任何嘅嘢

936
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:38,000
如果你知道喺你嘅生命裏面

937
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
已經有啲嘅地方

938
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
因為過去嘅疑惑

939
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
而產生咗啲嘅不信

940
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
喺你裏面

941
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
除非神呀你畀到一種好確定嘅答案

942
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
如果唔係我唔會再講呢樣嘢

943
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
如果你都知道

944
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
喺你生命裏面有呢個關口嘅話

945
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
今日聖靈想

946
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
喺你生命裏面去工作

947
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
佢想嚟醫治你

948
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
佢知道期望落空

949
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
嗰種嘅痛楚

950
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
嗰種嘅失望

951
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
嗰種嘅痛苦

952
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
但係佢仍然要嚟鼓勵你

953
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
要嚟呼召你再一次

954
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
去踏上一個信心嘅旅程

955
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
所以如果呢個係你嘅話

956
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
我邀請你

957
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
喺我哋敬拜嘅時候

958
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
你將呢樣嘢帶去神嘅面前

959
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
天父我將

960
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
或者我哋將我哋嘅生命向你去敞開

961
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
特別係我哋中間如果有弟兄姊妹

962
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
呢一刻經歷緊

963
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
一啲嘅疑惑

964
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
喺禱告裏面仲未見到嗰個嘅答案

965
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
或者有啲嘅地方佢已經係一個close chapter

966
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
佢已經

967
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
已經放棄咗有任何神你會工作

968
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
喺你人生呢個部分工作嘅可能性嘅話

969
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
神我求你今日

970
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
叫到死灰都要復燃

971
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
我求你

972
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
今日叫到死灰都要復燃

973
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
我求你喺好似我哋點著呢啲蠟燭一樣

974
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
喺佢哋嘅生命裏面重新去點著

975
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
嗰份嘅信心

976
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
去相信你仍然有機會

977
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
你仍然可以你仍然能夠

978
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
你仍然願意

979
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
喺佢哋人生嘅嗰個生命裏面

980
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
嗰個嘅地方裏面嚟到去作供

981
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
嚟到去祝福佢哋嚟到去同佢哋同在

982
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
或者單單同佢哋坐喺嗰種嘅痛楚裏面

983
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
主呀你仍然係佢哋生命嘅神

984
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
你仍然去看守佢哋

985
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
而且你喺呢個聖誕節呢個二馬落嚟嘅神

986
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
就係咁樣為到呢啲懷疑嘅人

987
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
為到呢啲已經落入咗不信裏面嘅人而嚟

988
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
你話你嚟係要尋找同埋拯救嗰啲失喪嘅人

989
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
主呀如果我哋失喪咗

990
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
喺我哋嘅疑惑

991
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
我哋嘅不信裏面嘅時候

992
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
主我求你今日

993
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
再一次嚟同我哋去相遇

994
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
再一次嚟呼喚我哋嘅明智

995
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
嚟呼召我哋

996
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
叫我哋可以再一次搵到嗰份嘅信心

997
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
嚟跟住你向前行

998
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
再一次將生命每一個部分

999
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
完完全全嘅向耶穌基督你嚟開啟

1000
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
主多謝你

1001
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
我哋今日禱告係奉耶穌命求

1002
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
我們推薦禱告是奉耶穌名靠

1003
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
谢谢观看 下集再见
