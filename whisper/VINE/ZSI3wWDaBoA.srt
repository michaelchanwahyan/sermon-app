1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,640
 Can we thank our worship team and just awesome.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,200
 (congregation applauding)

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,480
 Have a seat, have a seat.

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,620
 We're pretty packed in here today.

5
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,860
 So if you need some seats, there are some seats,

6
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:16,720
 I think somewhere, but there are some seats around.

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,100
 Again, welcome if you're joining us online.

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,480
 If you're in our overflow, we love you guys.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,560
 We're sorry that you're there,

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,600
 but we're glad you're with us.

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,680
 And there is no second class Holy Spirit

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,760
 in the name of Jesus.

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,680
 Amen.

14
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,800
 So we're glad that you're with us as well.

15
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,800
 In 2014, something happened here at the Vine.

16
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,560
 It was in the summer of 2014.

17
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,280
 There's something happened here at the Vine

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,280
 that so changed, completely changed my expectations

19
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,700
 of the work of Christ in the world today.

20
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,560
 On this particular Sunday, a 25 year old French lady

21
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,760
 from a Muslim background walked into Pacific Coffee

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,640
 downstairs in search of her Sunday morning caffeine fix.

23
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,160
 She had no idea that she had just walked into a church.

24
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,380
 She thought she was just coming in to get a cup of coffee,

25
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,400
 but she was struck immediately by the reality

26
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,960
 that this Pacific Coffee was the most popular

27
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,680
 Pacific Coffee she had ever seen in her life.

28
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,440
 It was filled with lots and lots of people

29
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,640
 who were chatting and laughing and hanging out and talking.

30
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,960
 And she was used to her Sunday morning caffeine fix

31
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,600
 normally being a quiet, sleepy kind of vibe,

32
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,880
 but here it was loud and raucous.

33
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,440
 She grabbed her coffee and she couldn't find a seat

34
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,560
 in Pacific Coffee 'cause it was so full.

35
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,260
 So she went and she stood by the stairs

36
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,320
 at the back of our Pacific Coffee,

37
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,160
 by the stairs that go up into the rest of our building.

38
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,660
 And as she's standing there sipping her coffee,

39
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,360
 marveling at how a rock concert has just finished

40
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,880
 in this space, suddenly a asylum seeker,

41
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,760
 one of our asylum seekers kids trips

42
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,320
 and falls down the stairs right in front of her.

43
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,720
 And immediately she looks around to see

44
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,080
 if the parent is there and if the parent

45
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,240
 is gonna react and respond, but she couldn't see a parent.

46
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,640
 And so she turned and she knelt down to help this kid up.

47
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,020
 Now, thankfully he wasn't seriously hurt at all,

48
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,600
 but she helps him up.

49
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,000
 And because she speaks French, that's her mother language,

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,360
 she just starts speaking to him in French.

51
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,640
 I think when you panic and something like that happens,

52
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,400
 you just default to your natural language.

53
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,200
 She started speaking to him in French.

54
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,040
 Amazingly though, this little boy was from West Africa

55
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,720
 and French was his mother tongue as well.

56
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,360
 And so he was able to talk to her in French

57
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,120
 and he grabs her by the hand

58
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,680
 and he starts walking her up the stairs.

59
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,880
 And she thinks that Pacific Coffee

60
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,920
 must have a second level to it

61
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,920
 and that the parents are up there somewhere

62
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,320
 and so she follows him as he's leading her up the stairs.

63
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,200
 He leads her up the first floor, up to the second floor.

64
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,320
 He leads her into the doors right here,

65
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,160
 right as the worship is starting for our 11 o'clock service.

66
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,560
 And as he leads her in, he then lets go of her hand

67
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,520
 and he runs away.

68
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:19,480
 And she's standing there wondering what is going on.

69
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,100
 For the next 90 minutes,

70
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,600
 the majority of the next 90 minutes,

71
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,840
 she's just stood right there

72
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,280
 and she's crying and crying and crying

73
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,160
 and she has no idea why she's crying.

74
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,560
 She describes it to me just a few months later

75
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,680
 as if this warmth had just come over her.

76
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,480
 And she said she had never felt a sense of love or peace

77
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,880
 like that in her life ever before.

78
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,680
 At the end of the service,

79
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,680
 she comes forward speaking in French,

80
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,200
 trying to find somebody who speaks French.

81
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,760
 Thankfully, there was a French family that was sitting

82
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,480
 just a couple of rows towards the front

83
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,360
 and we were able to connect them together.

84
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,080
 And over the process of a conversation right there

85
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,400
 and then at the front of the church,

86
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,520
 this Muslim lady gives her life to Jesus.

87
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,520
 Just a few months later,

88
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,400
 she does Alpha for the first time.

89
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,480
 She does our French Alpha.

90
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,720
 We were running a French speaking Alpha at that time.

91
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,240
 She commits, further commits her life to Christ

92
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,200
 through Alpha.

93
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,120
 I had the privilege of baptizing her

94
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,720
 just a few months later.

95
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,760
 She then was one of the leaders

96
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,000
 on our next French Alpha that we ran

97
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,920
 and she had the privilege of leading

98
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,800
 some other people to Jesus.

99
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,920
 She then came and stood in front of our whole church

100
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:45,920
 on a Sunday and told them the story that I've just told you.

101
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,000
 And then she left us just a few months later

102
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,960
 and she's now living and working again in France.

103
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,760
 Now, I would love to stand here this morning

104
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,840
 and tell you that story and tell you that the reason

105
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,040
 why this lady gave her life to Jesus

106
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,720
 is 'cause the Vine Church has an amazing

107
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,040
 evangelistic program.

108
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,960
 That we have trained people to be on the lookout

109
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,560
 for strangers entering into Pacific Coffee

110
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,640
 on a Sunday morning.

111
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,440
 I would like to tell you that we've trained

112
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,680
 all our asylum seeker kids to fake fall down the stairs.

113
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,040
 They're like little stunt kids

114
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,560
 that fake fall down the stairs

115
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,840
 so that they can speak in French

116
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,520
 to random French speaking people who walk in.

117
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,320
 I would like to tell you that we have brought

118
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,560
 all of our French families to the front rows of the church

119
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,960
 just in case a French person comes into this church

120
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,800
 who's no Jesus.

121
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,640
 I'd like to tell you that 'cause then I could pretend

122
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,160
 that the reason why this person gave their life to Jesus

123
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,400
 is 'cause the Vine is so awesome

124
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,120
 and that we have such a great evangelistic program

125
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,000
 but I love the fact that I can't stand here

126
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,360
 and tell you that.

127
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,880
 I love the fact that the only reason

128
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,680
 that that woman came to Christ on that day

129
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,440
 was 'cause God believed it was her time.

130
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,600
 Because God did it all.

131
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,920
 That there was, I mean think about it,

132
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,800
 coming into this particular Pacific Coffee

133
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,160
 for a caffeine fix.

134
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,040
 So busy that she couldn't sit

135
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,600
 so she had to stand at the back.

136
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,840
 It just so happens that a French speaking refugee kid

137
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,920
 is able to connect with her who just randomly brings her up

138
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,600
 and makes her stand right there and then runs away.

139
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,600
 And there happened to be a French family

140
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,480
 that was willing to share the gospel with her.

141
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,360
 I mean we can't make this stuff up.

142
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,080
 This is stuff that can only ever be done

143
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,280
 by a God who is able to do immeasurably more

144
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,880
 than we could ever ask or imagine.

145
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,200
 And when something like that happens,

146
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:47,200
 you can only stand back and go, God is amazing.

147
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,160
 Not the vine is amazing.

148
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,640
 Our evangelistic programs are amazing.

149
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:58,640
 God, who is able to do more than we could ever ask

150
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:03,080
 or imagine and because God did it that way,

151
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,640
 that story is still one of my most favorite stories

152
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,400
 to share in some 15 years of pastoring here at the church.

153
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,760
 The apostle Paul knew something of a God

154
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,600
 who was just like that.

155
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,880
 A God who was able to do more

156
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,000
 than we could ever ask or imagine.

157
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,280
 In fact, as he finishes his prayer in Ephesians 3,

158
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,560
 that majestic glorious prayer that we looked at last week,

159
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,160
 he decides to finish it by shifting the focus of his prayer

160
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,240
 back to this God, which is important for Paul

161
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,500
 because he's just prayed a passionate pastoral prayer

162
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,760
 for his church.

163
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,360
 I mean, he needs to spend all this time saying,

164
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,000
 my hope for you is that out of the glorious riches

165
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,360
 of Christ Jesus, that he would strengthen you with power

166
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,480
 by his spirit in your inner being.

167
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,880
 I mean, my prayer for you is that you would know

168
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,600
 that Christ lives in your heart.

169
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,680
 And because of that, you would be able to grasp

170
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,520
 how wide and high and deep and long the vastness

171
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,440
 of the love of Christ for you.

172
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,200
 And because that, you would know that love,

173
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,160
 experience that love, feel that love

174
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,200
 so that you would be filled to the whole measure

175
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,440
 of the wholeness of Christ.

176
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,600
 He's just prayed this passionate pastoral prayer

177
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,900
 for his people to experience God in a way

178
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,880
 that they've never experienced it before,

179
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,080
 but he gets to the end of the prayer

180
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,160
 and he realizes I can't finish there

181
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,060
 because God is always more than what we experience of him.

182
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:32,880
 And despite the fact that he's passionately gone,

183
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,920
 I want you to really experience him,

184
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,800
 what he's also saying to his churches,

185
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,840
 but I don't want to limit, and I don't want you

186
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,520
 to limit your expectations of God

187
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,200
 just by what you've experienced of him.

188
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,880
 And so he shifts the end of his prayer

189
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,240
 back to the wonder and the majesty and the mystery

190
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,880
 and the glory of a God who's far greater

191
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,440
 than we could ever experience.

192
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,220
 I want to read it to you.

193
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,920
 He says this in Ephesians 3, verse 20 and 21.

194
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,880
 Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more

195
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,800
 than we could ask or imagine,

196
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,040
 according to his power that is at work within us,

197
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,920
 to him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus

198
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,560
 throughout all generations forever and ever.

199
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,880
 And the whole church said, amen.

200
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,620
 This is known as a doxology.

201
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,240
 What it is is a exclamation

202
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,360
 that praises a characteristic of God

203
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,600
 that when read should cause you

204
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,640
 to enter into a place of worship as well.

205
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,800
 Paul writes these doxologies throughout his letters,

206
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,720
 and there are many that he includes.

207
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,560
 This one is one of my particular favorites,

208
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,920
 and I love it for one simple reason.

209
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,920
 Paul is challenging his church deeply on something.

210
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,800
 He's asking them, actually, through this doxology,

211
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,920
 a very important question.

212
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,800
 It's an important question 'cause he's about to enter

213
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,560
 into three more chapters in the letter,

214
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,280
 chapters four, five, and six,

215
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,160
 where he's gonna speak about the nature that we have

216
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,200
 and the way that we should live in respect to God.

217
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,200
 Before we get there, he finishes chapter three

218
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,040
 by asking his church a critical question.

219
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,740
 Who exactly is it that you worship?

220
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,600
 That's what he wants to ask his church,

221
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,080
 and that's what I sense the Holy Spirit

222
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,480
 wants to ask you here this morning.

223
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:35,960
 Who exactly is it that you worship?

224
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,320
 And this is an important question for Paul

225
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,200
 because before he tells his church

226
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:47,040
 how they should now live in response to this God,

227
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,800
 he wants to make sure that they're worshiping the right God.

228
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,280
 And as you come into church today,

229
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,320
 you might be like, well, of course I'm worshiping

230
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,320
 the right God, Andrew.

231
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,600
 I'm in a Christian church today and not somewhere else.

232
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,880
 I believe in Jesus.

233
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,960
 Of course I'm worshiping the right God.

234
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,280
 Paul's being a lot more nuanced than that,

235
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,720
 a lot more, actually, I think, challenging than that.

236
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,160
 And when I read this doxology,

237
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,440
 I find myself deeply challenged.

238
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,380
 I've read this for years, and every time I read it,

239
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,480
 I'm reminded of my own deficiencies.

240
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,960
 I'm actually reminded of how I so often can drift

241
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:30,960
 in my worship away from worshiping the God of Scripture

242
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,700
 and settling instead for worshiping the God

243
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,780
 that I have experienced.

244
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,520
 Are you tracking with me here?

245
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,600
 Now, I want you to track with this

246
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,680
 'cause I think we can all make this mistake

247
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,320
 in our Christian lives, that we end up so much

248
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,000
 worshiping the God that we have actually

249
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,540
 tangibly had an experience of,

250
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,900
 but we kind of settle or we see that as the roof,

251
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:58,080
 the ceiling of our understanding of who he is.

252
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,120
 And so our worship, the God that we're worshiping,

253
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,160
 is essentially a God that we have experienced

254
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,480
 rather than the God of the nature and the character

255
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,080
 and the power and the fullness

256
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,560
 of how Scripture describes him to us.

257
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,120
 And this is very true for us,

258
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,560
 particularly when we've been disappointed by God.

259
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,840
 And if you're anything like me in this room,

260
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,440
 you've been disappointed by God sometimes.

261
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,760
 When we get disappointed by God

262
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,860
 or maybe God hasn't come through like we expected

263
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:28,240
 or our experience of God is not like the experience

264
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,680
 of the person next to us,

265
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,560
 and they seem to cry every time they worship.

266
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,440
 They seem to get the gift of tongues

267
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,400
 and I don't seem to get that.

268
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,980
 And we begin to compare our experience with God

269
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,940
 with somebody else's experience of God,

270
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,700
 and we end up worshiping a God limited by our experience,

271
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,820
 and we can feel sometimes dejected in that

272
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,020
 because our experience is not someone else's experience,

273
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,700
 and Paul writes to the church and says,

274
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,380
 "Hang on a sec, I want you to experience God.

275
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,060
 I mean, I've just prayed this majestic prayer

276
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,180
 that you would feel his love

277
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,580
 like you've never felt him before.

278
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,660
 Everything in my being desires for you to experience him

279
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,540
 in the greatest way you could ever experience him,

280
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:08,680
 but never limit your thinking or your expectations,

281
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,140
 particularly never limit your worship

282
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,860
 just based on how you've experienced him.

283
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,660
 It's got to be so much more."

284
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,660
 So if I was to ask Paul's question

285
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:23,100
 through this doxology to us as a modern church

286
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,180
 in a modern way, perhaps I'd ask it like this.

287
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,960
 Are you worshiping the God of your truth

288
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,260
 above the God of the truth?

289
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:36,220
 Say that again.

290
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,680
 Are you worshiping the God of your truth

291
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,940
 over and above the God of the truth?

292
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:47,220
 Have you limited God simply to your own experience of him,

293
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:52,020
 whether good or bad, or are you able to worship him

294
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:55,780
 even beyond what it is that you may have experienced?

295
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:59,220
 Paul writes to the church, "Oh, now to him

296
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,260
 who is able to do, whether you've experienced a lot

297
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:06,660
 or a little, far more than you could ever have thought,

298
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,940
 that's the God to worship."

299
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,320
 I wanna actually show you how Paul does this.

300
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,680
 I'm gonna break this down in this doxology

301
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,340
 because I think it's really important

302
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,780
 that we wrestle with the challenge of this,

303
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:22,180
 but also I believe because we wanna raise glory

304
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:26,060
 in the church, and I think this is the whole of Paul's point.

305
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:29,740
 He talks about three elements in this doxology.

306
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:34,060
 The first element is you.

307
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,140
 Can you see that on the screen?

308
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,700
 Wow, modern technology, look at that.

309
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,780
 By the way, I've said this before,

310
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,300
 I'm gonna say it again.

311
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,000
 I am terrible at writing.

312
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,860
 But just track with the ugliness of my words written down

313
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,140
 and follow what we're doing here.

314
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,620
 When Paul says God is able to do immeasurably more

315
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,180
 than we could ever ask or imagine,

316
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,180
 there's an assumption Paul's making in that statement.

317
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,880
 Do you know what that assumption is?

318
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,420
 It's not a rhetorical question, it is actually a question.

319
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,180
 What is the assumption he's making?

320
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:10,920
 'Cause if God can do more than you ever ask or imagine,

321
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,000
 what is he actually assuming?

322
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,900
 That you are asking and that you are imagining,

323
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,920
 which maybe for some churches, that's a big assumption.

324
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,820
 But he's assuming of his church in Ephesus

325
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,980
 that they are actually doing two things,

326
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,980
 that they are asking, which is this idea of prayer,

327
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,200
 and that they are, the word he uses in the Greek,

328
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,260
 this idea of imagine, which we could think of it

329
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:38,420
 as like a dream, like dreaming, or like a vision,

330
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:42,140
 or the way in which we think, these things.

331
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:46,160
 The idea of our mind being engaged in life

332
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,140
 and what we hope and dream for life.

333
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:52,260
 Paul's assumption is that the church that you are praying

334
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,100
 and you're dreaming, that you are on your knees

335
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,460
 praying out for God to do some things in your life

336
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,100
 to shape and to work your life in certain ways,

337
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,740
 that you have a passion and a heart

338
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,820
 to believe that prayer can change things.

339
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,440
 And that you're not just praying for yourself,

340
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,060
 but you're praying for our city of Hong Kong

341
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,740
 in such an important time as this,

342
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,380
 and that the church together is praying and believing.

343
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,940
 He's assuming that that's what's happening.

344
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,500
 He's also assuming that you're not just praying,

345
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,700
 but you're dreaming, that you've got some ideas,

346
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,540
 that you're thinking,

347
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,360
 that the thoughts of your mind are hopeful,

348
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,580
 that you're dreaming for a better future for Hong Kong,

349
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,660
 that you're dreaming for a better future for yourself

350
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,460
 and for your family, that that future

351
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,160
 is not just some future out there,

352
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,280
 but is rooted in the kingdom and rooted in God's heart,

353
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,860
 that you're imagining what it would look like

354
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,820
 if the kingdom of God came to earth

355
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,140
 just like Jesus prayed about in his prayer,

356
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,140
 that it would be on earth as it is in heaven.

357
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,940
 There's stuff that's going on in your mind and your heart

358
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,140
 that you're passionate about.

359
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:53,280
 This idea of praying and this idea of imagining and dreaming,

360
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,060
 Paul says this important thing.

361
00:16:55,060 --> 00:17:00,060
 He says, "According to the power that is at work in you."

362
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,900
 So he says that there's a power that God does

363
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:08,160
 to help us to pray and help us to dream,

364
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,000
 which is really important.

365
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,300
 You're not praying and you're not dreaming

366
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,580
 or imagining in a vacuum.

367
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,020
 The power he mentions here is that power

368
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:19,820
 he's just prayed about in the prayer in a few verses earlier

369
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:23,060
 that you would be strengthened with power

370
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,220
 by the spirit in your inner being.

371
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:28,260
 He's like, "That power is already at work in you,

372
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,700
 for you have already been rooted and established in love.

373
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,140
 And because that power is at work in you,

374
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:36,060
 you can trust that the prayers that you're praying

375
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,980
 are on the heart of God.

376
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,680
 You can trust that the dreams and the imaginations

377
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,200
 that you hold in your heart have been placed there

378
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,400
 and are being fanned into flame by the spirit of God.

379
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,600
 It is a wonderful, beautiful thing."

380
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,440
 God doesn't ask his church to pray and leave it in a vacuum.

381
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,040
 He asks his church to pray and he asks his church to dream

382
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:00,440
 for a better future, but then he puts his power inside of us

383
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,920
 to enable us to do that in a way

384
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,240
 that brings true fruit in this world.

385
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,280
 Isn't that beautiful?

386
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,400
 No one thinks that's beautiful.

387
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,100
 Is that beautiful?

388
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,800
 Now notice, he then says this though.

389
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,980
 He says, "That's all that is assumed here."

390
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,300
 But notice this, he then says,

391
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,320
 "But there is this role that God plays."

392
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,460
 And I'm gonna use my high school level maths here.

393
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,720
 There's a sign in maths, greater than.

394
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,560
 Do you see this?

395
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,060
 This is greater than, look at that.

396
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:34,020
 He says that God, here's what you need to know about God.

397
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:38,900
 God is able to do greater than, more than you could ever ask

398
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,300
 and more than you could ever dream.

399
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,580
 And he's saying, if you want to worship God,

400
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,860
 who exactly is the God that you worship?

401
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,260
 He's like, you have to worship the one who is abundantly,

402
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:53,020
 immeasurably more than you could ever dream,

403
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,160
 more than you could ever imagine.

404
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,780
 'Cause he is so grand, so vast.

405
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,940
 His ways are higher than your ways.

406
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,100
 His thoughts are greater than your thoughts.

407
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,340
 And if you've just limited him

408
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,700
 to your own experience of him,

409
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,860
 you need to break yourself out of that.

410
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,580
 And he says, here's how you do it.

411
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,740
 You believe in a God who is immeasurably more

412
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:18,000
 than you have ever dreamt or imagined.

413
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,740
 What a glorious thing he's saying here.

414
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,740
 Now, I want you to see this,

415
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,540
 the problem we have in the church,

416
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,700
 the problem I think we have in us.

417
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,700
 I want that one, that one, thank you.

418
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,980
 The problem we have is that we get stuck,

419
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,240
 notice this, on this side of the equation

420
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,300
 I think all the time.

421
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,560
 And we get stuck on that side of the equation

422
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,020
 for I think important reason.

423
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,420
 Listen to this.

424
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,860
 It is hard to believe in a God

425
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:51,980
 who can do immeasurably more

426
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,580
 than we could ever ask and imagine

427
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,580
 if we don't first believe in a God

428
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,380
 who can actually do what we ask and imagine.

429
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,420
 Are you with me?

430
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,380
 I mean, it's hard, right?

431
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,740
 To take the jump over that equation

432
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,020
 to an immeasurably more God

433
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:11,020
 if we're already struggling to have the faith to believe

434
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:14,620
 that he could actually do what we believe that he could do,

435
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,180
 that we actually believe that he could answer the prayers

436
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,300
 that we're currently praying.

437
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:22,560
 And this is why this doxology for me is so challenging

438
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,540
 'cause I have to reflect on my own faith

439
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:27,780
 and ask, do I really believe that God could do

440
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,740
 even just what I'm praying,

441
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,260
 let alone immeasurably more?

442
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,260
 I just need to get through

443
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,160
 the first part of the equation here.

444
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,500
 If you're anything like me,

445
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,940
 there's been seasons in your life

446
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,520
 and maybe you're in one of those seasons right now

447
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,980
 where you're actually struggling to believe

448
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,860
 that God can answer your prayers.

449
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,020
 You're actually honestly struggling to believe

450
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,420
 that he could really come through with a vision

451
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,820
 or a hope or a dream that you might have.

452
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,240
 When that happens,

453
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,580
 maybe you haven't given up on your relationship with God,

454
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,420
 but here's what happens.

455
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,740
 You actually end up settling for worshiping

456
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:03,980
 what I would argue is the not enough God.

457
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,620
 No, you still believe in Jesus.

458
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,700
 You still come to church every Sunday,

459
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,340
 but because perhaps your prayers

460
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,900
 haven't been answered on a regular basis,

461
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,420
 perhaps you took that step of faith

462
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:17,340
 out into a business venture and it didn't work out.

463
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,220
 Perhaps you invited that person out on a date

464
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,820
 and they said no.

465
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,940
 Perhaps you tried to do something in faith

466
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,300
 and you felt and you had all your prayer partners pray,

467
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,740
 everybody prayed, everybody said,

468
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,900
 yeah, this is what you should do.

469
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,580
 And you took that big step of faith

470
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,740
 and it didn't work out and that hurt.

471
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,820
 And you felt a little bit let down by God

472
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:38,460
 and you felt like God was on mute in your life.

473
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,860
 And because that was so painful,

474
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,340
 because it was so public and you had done that step of faith,

475
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,060
 you've actually kind of stepped back from that.

476
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,380
 And you've said, I don't know if God

477
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,580
 does always answer prayers

478
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,200
 because he hasn't always answered mine.

479
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,100
 I still believe in him,

480
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:55,180
 but I'm not sure if he's really enough.

481
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,340
 And so some of us get stuck

482
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,140
 on the first side of the equation here

483
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:02,260
 because we're actually worshiping the not enough God.

484
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,460
 And maybe we would never would have put a label on it

485
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,100
 until today, but if you're honest with yourself,

486
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,800
 you know you're part of that camp.

487
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:13,440
 God is just not enough for me.

488
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,340
 The good news is, is I think that most of us

489
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:20,660
 kind of push through that reality at some point in our lives

490
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:23,700
 and we end up then worshiping what I would call

491
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,140
 the just enough God.

492
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,100
 And the just enough God sounds a lot better

493
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,340
 than the not enough God,

494
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,080
 but it is still a deficient God that we worship.

495
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,780
 The just enough God is the God

496
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:37,100
 that actually does answer the prayers that we pray

497
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,900
 and does come through for the dreams that we hold.

498
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,020
 I mean, track with this.

499
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:44,340
 If I had said to you that there is a church in Hong Kong

500
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,560
 where everybody in that church believes

501
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,580
 that God answers prayers and God comes through on dreams,

502
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,140
 I think you'd wanna be a part of that church, amen?

503
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,660
 Wouldn't you wanna go to a church

504
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,900
 where everybody in that church

505
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,380
 actually believes that Jesus answers prayers,

506
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,940
 actually believes that God has visions and dreams

507
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,820
 and those things can actually happen in the world?

508
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,940
 Wouldn't that be an amazingly exciting church

509
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,260
 to be a part of?

510
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,760
 It would, but it would be a church

511
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,360
 that's worshiping the wrong God.

512
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,720
 If I was to say to you at the beginning of this sermon

513
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,700
 that God could answer every single prayer you've ever prayed

514
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,620
 and come through for every dream that you could ever dream

515
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,380
 and are you happy to worship that God,

516
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,980
 I'm sure all of us would have said,

517
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,580
 sign me up on the bottom line.

518
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,420
 That's the God I wanna worship, amen?

519
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:30,740
 We think so, yes.

520
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:33,060
 In fact, we think that that's the very definition

521
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,740
 of what it means to be a Christian.

522
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,300
 Oh man, I'm a Christian.

523
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,020
 I actually believe that God can answer prayer.

524
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,780
 I actually believe that He does come through in dreams.

525
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,140
 I mean, that's what I'm supposed to believe, right?

526
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,740
 I do believe my level of faith is at that level

527
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,100
 and we think that that's right

528
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:48,160
 and Paul comes and says, if that's what you believe,

529
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,060
 you're still worshiping the wrong God.

530
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,580
 You're worshiping the wrong God

531
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:55,260
 because you have limited Him still

532
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:58,900
 to what you're praying for and what you're believing in.

533
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,380
 And even though His spirit is at work in those things,

534
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,340
 as he's just said, His power is at work in you,

535
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:06,980
 if you limit God to just answering your prayers

536
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,660
 and just coming through for your dreams,

537
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:11,260
 you still created a ceiling for God.

538
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,260
 You've still placed Him in your box.

539
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,820
 It's still a God of your truth.

540
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:19,620
 And Paul wants to pull his church broader

541
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,100
 and bigger than that and he's saying,

542
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:24,220
 you've got to worship not the not enough God,

543
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,860
 not the just enough God,

544
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,060
 the God that he calls us to worship

545
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:32,720
 is really long word that takes ages to write,

546
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,220
 the immeasurably more God.

547
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:42,060
 He's like, this is the God that you are to worship.

548
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,660
 Man, that's bad writing, but you know what I'm trying to say.

549
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,800
 (congregation laughing)

550
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,900
 That looks like the immeasurably mowed God.

551
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,700
 No, He's not the immeasurably mowed.

552
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,740
 He's like, this is the God.

553
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,820
 Like if there's a God you are to believe in your church,

554
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,940
 it's not just one that's limited to the ceiling

555
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:58,380
 of what you can pray and what you can believe for,

556
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,300
 even though you can pray and believe for some great stuff.

557
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,540
 No, He's always bigger, always greater, always more vast.

558
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,340
 His ways are always higher than our ways.

559
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,260
 And if you're gonna worship a God,

560
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,620
 you worship the immeasurably more God,

561
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,260
 the one who can do way more

562
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,140
 than you could ever ask or imagine.

563
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,420
 The one who can take a 25 year old French girl

564
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,980
 who has never stood foot in a church before

565
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:20,100
 and so fill her with the love of Christ

566
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:24,300
 that she would come forward and say, what is going on here?

567
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:31,020
 And God could save her because that's what God does.

568
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:34,220
 We never prayed for that.

569
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,420
 We never asked for that.

570
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,260
 I wanna be honest with you.

571
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,580
 I don't think we ever had the faith for that

572
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,560
 until it happened.

573
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:44,420
 And God is the immeasurably more God.

574
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,680
 Now that becomes our ceiling.

575
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,960
 I expect that now at the Bind.

576
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,940
 By the way, if you're a stranger in this room, welcome.

577
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,700
 It's good to have you with us.

578
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,860
 You're about to get saved.

579
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,700
 It's awesome.

580
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,300
 We're so glad you're here.

581
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,300
 That's now my ceiling, but now God's light.

582
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,860
 You gotta believe for more than that then

583
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,340
 'cause he's always the immeasurably more God.

584
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,340
 Are you with me?

585
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,860
 Are you tracking with this?

586
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:06,920
 Now, then Paul finishes everything that he's saying.

587
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,980
 Woo, that got big.

588
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:11,060
 He finishes it by saying there's a third element.

589
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,340
 He said, then there's this reality of the church.

590
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,580
 I love this.

591
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,500
 And he says the church,

592
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,100
 when God is the immeasurably more God

593
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,420
 and the church worships the immeasurably more God,

594
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:24,100
 he says then glory is seen in that church.

595
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,580
 Isn't that beautiful?

596
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:28,500
 It's almost as if a church has limited itself

597
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,520
 to either the not enough God or the just enough God,

598
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,900
 then it's gonna be lacking the glory of Christ in it.

599
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,740
 If you want the church to see and to feel

600
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,880
 and reveal the glory of Christ,

601
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,460
 then we have to worship the immeasurably more God

602
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,420
 'cause when you worship the immeasurably more God,

603
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:47,220
 his glory, Paul says, is seen in the church.

604
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:52,260
 It's seen in the church because when that French lady

605
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:55,020
 stood in front of a room of this size

606
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,820
 and shared the story that I shared with you,

607
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,780
 I mean, it was hopefully impactful when I shared it.

608
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,620
 Could you imagine when she shared it?

609
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,780
 Worship on that Sunday in this place

610
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:09,780
 was just off the records, off the charts

611
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:13,980
 because glory was seen in the church.

612
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,460
 And why was it glory?

613
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:18,800
 Because the church could not take any credit for it.

614
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,300
 It happened and everybody stood back and said,

615
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,500
 only God could have done that.

616
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:29,020
 And if only God could have done it, we worship that God.

617
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,540
 We're not worshiping a platform or a speaker

618
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:34,100
 or a type of worship or a preacher.

619
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,260
 We're worshiping God because that could only

620
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,860
 have ever happened by one who is able to do

621
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,060
 immeasurably more than we could ever ask or imagine.

622
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,940
 And when we see it take place,

623
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:47,540
 how can glory not be seen in the church?

624
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:50,060
 How can the church not respond in saying,

625
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:53,500
 praise God, you are glorified, as Paul said,

626
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,780
 in Christ Jesus, that the works of Christ

627
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,500
 are raised in the midst.

628
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:05,300
 The way that a church can glory God

629
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:09,500
 is simply by providing an arena in which

630
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,540
 that the work of Jesus Christ can take effect.

631
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:15,220
 That's how a church glorifies God.

632
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:18,700
 It actually gets out of the way

633
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,960
 and enables Christ to do his work.

634
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:28,840
 And that's what we wanna do here today.

635
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,980
 And as much as it was important for you

636
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,540
 to understand what Paul's finishing his prayers with here,

637
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,740
 and I hope as we've mapped it out for you,

638
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:39,980
 it's inspired you and challenged you.

639
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,860
 But the reason why we've done it here this morning

640
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:44,540
 is because of what it leads us to.

641
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,580
 It leads us to actually providing an arena

642
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,100
 in which the work of Jesus Christ

643
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,820
 can actually take effect amongst us.

644
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:54,720
 For quite some time now, as a community of leaders here,

645
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,100
 we've been praying for this Sunday,

646
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,260
 and we've been praying for this Sunday

647
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:00,580
 because we knew that we were gonna be setting aside time now

648
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,900
 for prayer and ministry.

649
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,520
 We want to actually lean into the radical idea

650
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,240
 of the immeasurably more God that is amongst us.

651
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,300
 What we're gonna do in a moment

652
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,380
 is I'm gonna invite you all to stand.

653
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:15,420
 And we've been praying for what are some things

654
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,860
 that we can pray for you for and lay hands on you.

655
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:22,220
 Our elders, our pastoral team, our prayer,

656
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,240
 innocences and prayer ministry team

657
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,860
 have prepared themselves for today.

658
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:29,060
 And what's gonna happen is we're gonna name

659
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,540
 a couple of things that we feel the Holy Spirit

660
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:34,720
 wants to minister to our people in today.

661
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,120
 And if that resonates for you,

662
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,420
 we're gonna ask you to have the courage today.

663
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:42,380
 If you're in this room, if you're in the lower house here,

664
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,500
 to come and stand here at the front in the middle.

665
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,700
 If you're in the upper house,

666
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,540
 we have space at the front set aside today for this.

667
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:52,220
 You can come and stand at the front in the upper house.

668
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,500
 If it gets too busy up there,

669
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,420
 then you can actually come down to here as well.

670
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:00,140
 But there is a prayer team with elders up there as well.

671
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,320
 If you're in the overflow today,

672
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,720
 you can come inside here for prayer.

673
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,580
 If you're online, you can contribute in this as well.

674
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:12,460
 You can send your prayers to us at prayer@thevine.org.hk.

675
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,900
 And we would love to be able to pray with you

676
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,560
 in this moment as well.

677
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,260
 But we're going to take some time

678
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,860
 to actually put what we've been preaching into practice.

679
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:24,340
 God is able to do immeasurably more

680
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,940
 than you could ever ask and imagine.

681
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:28,660
 As I was praying and preparing for this ministry time,

682
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,820
 I felt God say this to me,

683
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:33,420
 "Andrew, there are things that I wanna do in this church

684
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:36,620
 "that you have yet asked for or thought about.

685
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,260
 "You haven't even asked or thought about them yet.

686
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,800
 "There are things that I wanna do in this church

687
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,700
 "that you haven't yet even thought about or asked for."

688
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,700
 And as he spoke that to me,

689
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,180
 I felt like he was speaking it to you,

690
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,300
 and I wanna speak this over you.

691
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:51,220
 "There are some things that God wants to do in you

692
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:54,900
 "that you have yet asked for or even thought about."

693
00:30:54,900 --> 00:31:00,140
 And we're gonna make the space for that to happen now.

694
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:03,380
 So would you all stand with me, and let's stand together.

695
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,940
 We're gonna stand in a posture of prayer together.

696
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,700
 (audience murmuring)

697
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,540
 And in a moment, I'm going to invite some people forward

698
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,160
 for a specific kind of prayer.

699
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:17,360
 If this is you, if you resonate with it,

700
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,260
 then I want you to take the courage

701
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,020
 to come forward and be prayed for.

702
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,620
 If it's not for you, that's fine.

703
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,020
 You can continue just the worship.

704
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,580
 We're gonna have some worship happening,

705
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,500
 but we also wanna encourage you.

706
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,640
 We're gonna put it up on the screen,

707
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,380
 some of the things that we're praying about.

708
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,260
 We wanna encourage you to pray.

709
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,260
 Stretch your hands out, pray for the people in the middle

710
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,900
 that are being prayed for,

711
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,720
 so that we're all involved in praying and believing

712
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,100
 in the immeasurably more God together.

713
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,740
 So the first thing and the strongest thing

714
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,600
 that we've sensed over the last couple of weeks

715
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,700
 as we've been preparing and praying for this time now

716
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,460
 is that we wanna pray for physical healing.

717
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:53,020
 We wanna pray specifically for people

718
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,740
 that have physical healing needs.

719
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,500
 So whether that's a disease

720
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,100
 that you're currently battling with,

721
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,740
 whether it's like cancer or something like that

722
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,940
 that you're struggling with,

723
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,700
 whether you've hurt your ankle or your foot,

724
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,620
 whether you're suffering from migraines,

725
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:10,380
 whether there is some form of physical challenge

726
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,620
 that you're facing in your life right now,

727
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,780
 we specifically wanna pray.

728
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,220
 We wanna lay hands on you.

729
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:19,340
 We wanna believe that God is a God of miracles,

730
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:22,260
 that He can release us from the things that ail us,

731
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,180
 and particularly from physical things

732
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,480
 that are holding us down.

733
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,700
 So the very first thing we're gonna be praying for

734
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:30,500
 is anyone in here at all

735
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,500
 that has some sort of physical challenge,

736
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,100
 ailment, sickness, disease right now,

737
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:39,060
 we wanna lay our hands on you and we wanna pray for you.

738
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:39,960
 And so we're gonna do that.

739
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,500
 So can I encourage you in the upper house

740
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,820
 just to come forward now towards the front

741
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:45,980
 so the prayer team can be praying for you.

742
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,320
 If you're in here in the lower house or if you're outside,

743
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,100
 this is your space now to come forward.

744
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,940
 Don't be shy, come on forward.

745
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:54,380
 We're gonna pray for you, gonna lay hands on you.

746
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,220
 We're gonna speak life over you

747
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,980
 and we're going to do that for you now.

748
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:00,920
 So come on forward and let's spend some time

749
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,200
 believing and praying for the immeasurably more God over us.
