[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120]   Can we thank Carla for just being amazing as always?
[00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.160]   So good.
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.160]   Well, welcome to The Vine.
[00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.760]   My name's Andrew, one of the pastors here.
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.400]   And there's probably a lot of you
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.040]   that are visiting with us this weekend.
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.960]   And we are so, so glad that you are with us and amongst us.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:15.920]   And I know there's loads of people
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:16.960]   in the overflow right now.
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.360]   So I wanted to say hi to everybody in the overflow.
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.200]   Thank you guys for being willing to sit in the overflow.
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.760]   And then everybody that's sitting on the floor
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.600]   and everything crazy.
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.840]   Anyway, we're so glad you guys are here.
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.000]   A number of years ago,
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.480]   I was invited to speak at a church overseas.
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.400]   And this happens a number of times for me.
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.760]   And it's always a great privilege to travel overseas,
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.600]   to speak in other churches and other contexts.
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.920]   But every time I get invited to speak overseas,
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.280]   I know that I, as well as being excited,
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.640]   I know that I'm also gonna be exhausted
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.360]   because these trips are like full on.
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.360]   From the moment that the pastor from that church
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.800]   picks you up at the airport
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.880]   to the moment that they drop you back at the airport,
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.920]   like three days later, you are on 24/7.
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.560]   It is crazy.
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.840]   They expect you not just to speak in their church,
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.480]   but they expect you to sort of pastor all their people,
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.920]   pray for everybody, solve all the problems of the church,
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.760]   work out why their finances are not right,
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.200]   visit with their eldership and solve all the problems there
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.840]   and strategically believe for everything.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.120]   You're supposed to have a prophetic word
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.720]   for every single person in the church.
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.680]   The whole thing is crazy.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.040]   And it is a great privilege.
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.640]   Honestly, one of the great privileges to go there.
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.880]   I love what I do.
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.920]   And when I'm getting invited to go do that,
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.400]   I'm very excited about it.
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.440]   But I recognize that I have to manage my energy.
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.080]   If I don't manage my energy,
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.040]   I know that about a day and a half into the trip,
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.880]   I will hate everybody in that church.
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.680]   I will be exhausted.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.280]   Anyone here not like people when you're tired?
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.360]   You know, when you get tired, right?
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.760]   You get a little prickly with people.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.520]   And I realized that I'm going overseas to this church.
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.120]   I'm representing the vine, right?
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.880]   I don't wanna be that guy like two days in
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.920]   who really doesn't like the people around them
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.320]   and is getting a little prickly with people.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.160]   So I have to like make sure that my energy
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.920]   is well managed on these trips.
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.280]   Well, on this particular trip I went to,
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.000]   the church was larger than the vine.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.840]   They had five services on a Sunday.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.720]   I was speaking at all five services,
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.520]   pretty much back to back.
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.520]   After the third service, I was tired.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.480]   After the fourth service, I was a little bit wobbly.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.920]   After the fifth service, I couldn't even remember my name.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.840]   Okay, I was really exhausted.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.240]   And of course it was after every service,
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.800]   they expected me to be on the prayer line.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.640]   So I'd go down the front, I'd be on the prayer line.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.440]   And it was after the fifth service,
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.040]   I'm on the prayer line after I've just preached.
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.120]   There's a crowd of people
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.440]   that are waiting to get prayed for me
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.960]   that the most awkward thing
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.760]   that perhaps has ever happened to me happens.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.120]   There was this guy on the prayer line
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.080]   waiting for me to pray with him.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.520]   He comes forward and as usual with these sort of things,
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.200]   we introduce ourselves and stuff.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.760]   And I say to him, the thing that I say to pretty much
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.760]   everybody when I'm ever on a prayer line,
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.000]   I say to him, what is it that you would like me
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.360]   to pray for you for today?
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.640]   What is it that I can pray for you about?
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.200]   This was his response.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.120]   He said this, "You're a man of God.
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.720]   "I don't need to tell you what my needs are.
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.920]   "God knows.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.160]   "Just ask God and he will tell you.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.240]   "I wanna see what you will say."
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.240]   (congregation laughing)
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.120]   Five services, okay?
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.240]   I'm exhausted and I don't like people at this point.
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.440]   All right?
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.000]   And here's this guy and I tell you what,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.480]   this happens more than you might think,
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.760]   more than you expect.
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.480]   This guy comes up to me, he's basically like,
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.280]   I wanna see whether you're really a pastor.
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.960]   I wanna see if you really hear from God, okay?
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.760]   I know what my needs are, God knows, but do you know?
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.040]   (laughing)
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.600]   You're gonna have to pray about it
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.760]   and when you pray about it,
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.120]   we'll find out if you hear from the Spirit of God.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.440]   (congregation laughing)
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.320]   By the way, if you're taking notes, write this down.
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.120]   Us pastors do not like people like this, okay?
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.080]   (congregation laughing)
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.920]   This feels like you're put under a spiritual test.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.840]   It feels like they're testing you
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.160]   to see whether you're truly a person of the Spirit.
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.000]   And so this guy is speaking like this,
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.840]   by the way, this is on the same part
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.560]   as the other pet peeve that us pastors have
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.440]   and that's this, pastor, you prayed for me seven years ago
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.120]   and I've never seen you ever since.
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.880]   Do you remember what you prayed for?
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.880]   (congregation laughing)
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.600]   Here's the answer, no, we don't remember.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.520]   We're like vessels, the Spirit comes in
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.280]   and out of us, we are not spiritual data cards
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.760]   that are storing everybody's spiritual issues for decades.
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.120]   That doesn't happen, okay, anyway.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.040]   So this guy is like testing me.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.400]   I'm, my attitude, like I am using all the remaining reserves
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.400]   of energy that I have to try to be calm
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.800]   and nice and polite to this guy.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.640]   So I said, okay, yeah, sure, let's pray.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.120]   So I put my hand on his shoulder, we start to pray
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.800]   and I say to God, God, you know I'm tired
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.200]   and you know my attitude really is not good right now.
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.840]   But I come to you and if you have something
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.840]   you wanna say to this guy, speak to me
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.360]   and I'll pray over him.
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.080]   Well, as God often does with me,
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.320]   he gave me a visual, a visual something.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.440]   I often see things when I'm praying for people
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.040]   and I saw something and I begin to pray this over this guy.
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.360]   About a minute into praying it,
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.640]   I realized that what I'm praying is not very positive.
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.560]   It's not very sort of happy.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.120]   It's actually kind of a hard thing
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.080]   that I was praying for him about.
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.400]   And I kept praying and I kind of lent into
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.320]   what I sensed God was saying and as I prayed on,
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.000]   I could tell that the prayer was just a little bit heavy,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.760]   it was a little bit, it wasn't mean,
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.880]   but it was just like the things that I felt
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:03.720]   like God was saying to him
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.440]   were not necessarily easy things to hear.
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.760]   And at the end of the prayer, I said amen
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.720]   and I opened my eyes and I was met with this face.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.200]   (congregation laughing)
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.200]   And the guy says these words to me, he goes,
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.040]   "Uh, okay, thank you."
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.960]   And then he just walks off.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:23.800]   And I'm left there like,
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.680]   "That is the most awkward experience I have ever had."
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.400]   Well, six months later, I get an email
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.400]   and the email is from this guy
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.760]   and he's managed to track down my email.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.880]   And in the opening line of the email,
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.720]   I wonder if you can imagine what it said, it said this,
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.520]   "Pastor, you prayed for me six months ago.
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.120]   I wonder if you remember what you prayed for me about."
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.600]   (congregation laughing)
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.560]   The irony is in this case,
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.920]   I did actually remember what I prayed for this guy about
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.360]   'cause it wasn't very nice, right?
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.320]   And he starts to tell me in this email, he's like,
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.640]   "You know, you prayed for me and you said these things.
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.320]   And I was actually really offended in the moment
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.040]   and I didn't like what you said.
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.480]   And I walked away and out of the church that day
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.640]   and I was angry.
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:07.760]   I was angry at you.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.080]   I was angry at God."
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.200]   And anyway, he just, this was not a pleasant email
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.040]   up to this point, right?
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.160]   And I was like, "Okay, great."
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.360]   And then he said, "But you know, God kept speaking to me
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.800]   about those words that you said over the coming weeks.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.520]   And I kept having to bring myself back to prayer
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.720]   with those words.
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:27.080]   And I realized that those words that God was saying to me
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.800]   on that day were designed to uproot
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.520]   some of the deepest stuff that was in my life."
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.200]   And he went on to tell me some of the deep sins
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.760]   and the brokenness, addictions,
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.240]   and some things that he had in his life.
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.360]   And as the email went on, he said,
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.840]   "You know, I was able, it took me about six months,
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.280]   but I've been able to reach out to my wife."
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.400]   It turned out that him and his wife
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.320]   had been separated for some time.
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.880]   And he reached out to his wife and he repented with her
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.720]   and apologized for some things.
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.320]   And he said, "We've gotten back together
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.200]   and we're trying to make marriage work again.
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.040]   And I just wanted to let you know
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.320]   that although I treated you rudely in the moment,
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.280]   that those things that you said disrupted stuff."
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.480]   He goes, he actually said this.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.720]   He said, "I didn't wanna hear what you said,
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.520]   but it disrupted some things in me
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.480]   that needed to get disrupted."
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:17.560]   And he said, "I just want you to know
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.200]   that I'm in a better place now."
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:24.200]   I wonder if you've ever experienced God
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.960]   saying something to you that is not easy for you to hear,
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:32.560]   that is not comfortable to hear.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.360]   I wonder if any of us have ever experienced
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.440]   when God speaks to us in a way that
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:42.440]   kinda just comes in and disrupts some things in us.
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.320]   It's not easy, is it?
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.560]   I think as Christians, we often think that
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.120]   when God speaks to his people,
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.920]   he's always gonna speak super positive things.
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.320]   That when God speaks to his people,
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.800]   it's always gonna be kind of a feel good thing.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.200]   It's always gonna make me feel good.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.160]   It's always gonna be great.
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.000]   It's always gonna be wonderful.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.040]   And I think us Christians get so conditioned
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.040]   into thinking that that's always how God speaks,
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.640]   that when God shows up and says something
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.760]   that's slightly different to what we expected
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.240]   or says something that we weren't quite
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.720]   kind of wanting to hear or whatever it might be,
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.080]   we often, as Christians, I think, reject that.
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.920]   We think, "Oh, that's probably not God.
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:18.840]   That can't be God.
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.160]   God wouldn't say something like that."
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.440]   And we kinda push away from it.
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.240]   And I think we have this problem as Christians sometimes,
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:29.000]   'cause we're always expecting God to show up a certain way,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.440]   but when he shows up in a different way,
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.520]   we really struggle with that.
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.120]   Am I the only person here who struggles with that?
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:39.720]   I am, I guess, the only person here who struggles with that.
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.800]   I'm assuming that more of you also do.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.960]   Here's the reality that I think I've come to learn
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.280]   about God that I think is actually a very important thing
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.680]   for us to grasp, and it's this,
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.280]   that sometimes when God speaks,
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.600]   the very thing you need to hear the most
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.920]   is often the very thing you want to hear the least.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:05.560]   Come on, church.
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.200]   So often when God speaks to us,
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.320]   the very thing we need to hear the most
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:14.000]   is often the very thing we want to hear the least.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.560]   That actually is a really good summary
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.400]   of the first Christmas that happened some 2,000 years ago.
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:26.720]   See, when Matthew and Luke present the birth story of Jesus,
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:30.640]   they present it in a raw and very real way.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.040]   And yes, it's a story of incredible moments,
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.400]   a story of choirs of angels and God's birth,
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.920]   the incarnation and the glory and the peace
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.920]   that is exclaimed during that time.
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.320]   But if the story of Jesus' birth is anything,
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.720]   it's a story of a God who speaks
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:50.200]   and a God who longs to speak to his people.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.440]   But if you trace through the story,
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:57.360]   you'll see very quickly that so often the things
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.160]   that God speaks to the characters in the Christmas story
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.080]   is not the things that they were expecting to hear.
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.680]   It's not the things that they even perhaps wanted to hear.
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.720]   Take Zachariah, for example.
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.800]   God shows up in an angel through Gabriel and says to him,
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.520]   hey, because of your unfaithfulness,
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.000]   you're now not gonna be able to talk
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.400]   until your wife, Elizabeth, gives birth.
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.480]   Take Joseph, for example.
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.680]   Joseph, having discovered that his unmarried,
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:27.440]   pregnant fiancee is now pregnant with a child
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.240]   that came from the Holy Spirit,
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.640]   and he understands the shame
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.800]   that will come upon him and upon Mary,
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.040]   and so he's making plans in his mind
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.000]   to do the right thing for her and for him,
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.520]   and which is to separate their relationship.
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:40.600]   And God steps in and says,
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.440]   no, you can't separate that relationship.
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.800]   You're actually gonna have to walk into that shame,
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.280]   walk into that pain, 'cause I've got a bigger thing
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.360]   that's happening here.
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.160]   Well, think about the shepherds.
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.480]   The shepherds who were faithfully looking after their sheep,
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.120]   which was their livelihood,
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.560]   God shows up in the form of angels and says,
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.560]   leave your livelihood behind and go into Bethlehem.
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.440]   Just drop everything that you've worked hard for,
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.080]   because we've got a new thing
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.320]   that we want to happen in your life.
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:14.360]   Isn't it so interesting for us that we have a plan A
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.720]   that we think is our plan A,
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.040]   but so often God comes and says,
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.280]   there's actually a B, C, and a D
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:22.240]   that is really the thing that's gonna set you alight,
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.880]   really the thing that's gonna make you as a person,
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.960]   really the thing that's gonna flourish you
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.000]   and bring you into the fullness of who you are.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.840]   I mean, just think about Mary.
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:38.120]   God shows up to Mary and says some pretty crazy things,
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:42.040]   things that she must've been so confused by,
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:43.520]   so overwhelmed by,
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:46.800]   not things that she was expecting God to say to her.
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.560]   In fact, I think if Mary had the choice,
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.480]   she would have chosen not to be in a part
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.040]   of the whole Christmas story in the first place.
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.640]   Imagine the shame that she had to hold.
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.080]   Imagine the months that she had to go through
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.600]   where people thought all this stuff about her.
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.360]   If she had the choice, she probably would have said,
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.840]   I didn't even wanna go anywhere near that story
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.480]   or that thing whatsoever.
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.200]   And I think this is fascinating,
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.640]   that in the heart of the Christmas story,
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.680]   you see something that is so important
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.440]   for all of us to understand about how God works in our lives.
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:17.840]   And it's this, that your personal preferences
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.040]   and your personal choice
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.200]   is not always the most important things in God's mind
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.480]   when it comes to his leadership of your life.
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.900]   I know this is not the Christmas message
[00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:30.160]   you were hoping to hear,
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.800]   but I wanna encourage you to stay in with me
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.420]   because I think there's something important
[00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:37.520]   that you need to hear.
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.680]   Our personal choices and our personal preferences
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:46.680]   are not always God's most forefront things in his mind
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:49.280]   when he thinks about you and his leadership of his life,
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:51.760]   and he sees you, he sees your future,
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.040]   he sees where he's leading you in his life.
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.760]   And he says, I know what's ahead,
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:56.920]   and I know all the good things,
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.960]   I know the bad things, I know the ugly things,
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.840]   and you want plan A,
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.920]   but I've got this other plan over here.
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.520]   Your personal preference is to go down this path,
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.000]   but if you go down that path,
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.260]   I tell you in five years time,
[00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:09.400]   you're gonna hit rock bottom.
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.120]   But if you were to listen to me,
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.480]   if you were just to come with me,
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.520]   I've got a new path that I'm gonna take you down.
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.760]   And this is the way that will bring flourishing
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:19.520]   and growth and life to your personal choices
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.400]   and preferences, they're important to God,
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.480]   but they're not the most important thing to him.
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.440]   He sees stuff that you will never see,
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.360]   and in faithfulness and trust,
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.920]   we are to turn to his word.
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:32.560]   Are you following this?
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:39.420]   But sometimes the word that God brings is challenging.
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:42.000]   It's hard to hear.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.700]   And it comes and disrupts some things in us.
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.720]   Case in point is exactly what happens
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.760]   at the end of the Christmas story.
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.640]   The story that Luke is presenting to us
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:57.480]   of the birth of Jesus,
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.760]   he adds a very important story right at the end.
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:03.040]   It's almost like an epilogue to the story, if you will.
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.040]   It's the moment where Mary and Joseph,
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.480]   having had the child Jesus,
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.280]   Jesus is now eight days old.
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.720]   And from Bethlehem to Jerusalem,
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:14.240]   they make the journey from Bethlehem to Jerusalem,
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.840]   and they go into the temple when Jesus is eight days old,
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:17.800]   and they're carrying him in
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.360]   because the ritual at the time,
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.800]   the tradition at the time,
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.520]   was that faithful Jewish families
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.960]   would take their firstborn son
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:28.760]   and bring him into the temple to be dedicated to the Lord.
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.280]   And that dedication ceremony
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:32.840]   involved the act of circumcision.
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.160]   And so this was what Mary and Joseph were doing.
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.240]   They're faithful Jewish people
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.520]   going to the temple on the eighth day with Jesus,
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:40.880]   taking him into the temple
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.160]   in order for him to be dedicated
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.080]   and for the circumcision ceremony to take place.
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.760]   And when they're in the house of God,
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:51.120]   something awkward happens.
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.160]   A little bit like me standing in that prayer line
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.000]   and that man coming forward.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.780]   For Mary and Joseph,
[00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:02.160]   something significantly awkward takes place.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.440]   Let me actually break this down for you
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:07.480]   from Luke chapter two, starting in verse 25.
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.960]   Everybody still okay?
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.680]   Do you still like me?
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:12.680]   I'm really, if you're visiting, I'm really a nice person.
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:14.000]   Trust me, I am, I am.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.360]   But hang with us.
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:19.600]   Verse 25 of chapter two of the Christmas story.
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:22.720]   Now, there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.400]   who was righteous and devout.
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.600]   He was waiting for the consolation of Israel
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.440]   and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.120]   It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.840]   that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Christ.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.400]   That's the Messiah.
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.560]   Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.520]   when the parents, that's Mary and Joseph,
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.000]   brought in the child Jesus
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.120]   to do for him what was custom of the Lord,
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:46.280]   that the law required, that's the circumcision.
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:49.680]   Simeon took the baby into his arms
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.200]   and praised God, saying this.
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.280]   Sovereign Lord, as you have promised,
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.520]   now dismiss your servant in peace.
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.760]   For my eyes have seen your salvation,
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.120]   which you have prepared in the sight of all people,
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.160]   a light for revelation to the Gentiles
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.740]   and for glory to your people Israel.
[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:09.180]   Up until this point in the story,
[00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:12.240]   everything is going perfectly right.
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.120]   This is wonderful.
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:16.400]   And Luke is creating and writing the story
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.680]   to help you to see how amazing this is.
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.760]   There's the temple in all of its glory and beauty
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:22.800]   in the presence of God.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.520]   For the very first time, the Son of God
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.760]   is being brought into the temple itself.
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:30.320]   There's Mary and Joseph, the faithful family,
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.800]   bringing their child for that dedication service.
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.200]   And then we're introduced
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:37.480]   to the sort of creme de la creme, Simeon.
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.580]   And Simeon is described by Luke
[00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.740]   in the best ways that you could ever hope
[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:43.420]   to be described in the Bible.
[00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:46.560]   Listen to this, righteous and devout,
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.820]   waiting for the consolation of Israel,
[00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.380]   the Holy Spirit upon him.
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.980]   Luke is saying, this man is righteous.
[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:54.420]   He hasn't put a foot wrong.
[00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:55.980]   This man loves the Lord.
[00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.540]   He's devout in his devotion to God.
[00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:01.580]   He is waiting for the Messiah to come.
[00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:04.180]   He's so excited that one day God would step
[00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:05.500]   into the world with the Messiah.
[00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:08.800]   Not only that, but he's filled with the Holy Spirit.
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.500]   I mean, you can't paint somebody
[00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.300]   in a better light than that.
[00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.700]   Righteous, devout, waiting for God,
[00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.420]   filled with the Holy Spirit.
[00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:18.060]   And the Holy Spirit takes Simeon
[00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:19.620]   and he walks into the temple courts
[00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:21.300]   and he sees the baby Jesus
[00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:24.260]   and he sweeps up Jesus in his arms.
[00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:25.780]   And notice what he says.
[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:29.260]   He says, "This is a light for revelation to the Gentiles
[00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.920]   and glory to your people, Israel."
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:35.040]   You could not say a better thing about baby Jesus,
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:38.460]   that he's gonna be the light of revelation to the Gentiles.
[00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:41.580]   I love that the Christmas story brings us the picture
[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:44.140]   of Jesus's mission to the world.
[00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:45.940]   That anyone who was not Jewish,
[00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:48.020]   that's the majority of us in this room,
[00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:50.860]   we can come to the saving knowledge of God
[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:52.100]   through Jesus Christ.
[00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:55.660]   He's a light of revelation to all of us here in Hong Kong.
[00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:58.100]   But he's also the glory to Israel.
[00:18:58.100 --> 00:18:59.540]   He's also gonna do all the things
[00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:00.920]   that the scriptures had prophesied
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.700]   about what was gonna happen to Israel.
[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.320]   He was gonna be their Messiah and their Christ.
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:08.560]   And Simeon sweeps up baby Jesus in his arms
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:10.360]   and says all these incredible stuff.
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:13.040]   And you can imagine Joseph and Mary standing there
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.400]   and thinking, "This is the most amazing thing
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.480]   I have ever heard.
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:20.500]   This is the best thing I could ever hear about my child."
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.720]   I mean, think about this from your perspective.
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.800]   Imagine if you had a baby
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:26.880]   and you come into the vine on a Sunday,
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.920]   it would be like one of the pastors from the vine
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.240]   sweeping up your child in their arms
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:35.040]   and going, "This one, this one is destined to go to Harvard
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.120]   and graduate from the top of his class.
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.680]   This one will be a millionaire by the age of 30,
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.720]   for he will become a doctor or a lawyer or a banker.
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:47.460]   This one will master the piano and the violin
[00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:49.080]   and will speak 13 languages.
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:52.280]   And even in your old age, you will be blessed
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:53.880]   'cause this one will look after you."
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:58.880]   Every Hong Kong family would say, "Praise the Lord.
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.600]   Are you with me?"
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.360]   That's what it was like for Mary and Joseph, okay?
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:07.560]   This was their Harvard moment, all right?
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.160]   The child will be a light of revelation to Gentiles.
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.040]   He's going to be the glory to Israel.
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:14.520]   It could not get better than this,
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.640]   which is why it says in the next verse,
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:20.240]   it says, "The child's father and mother marveled
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:22.320]   at what was said about him."
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.320]   The word marveled there means they rejoiced.
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.120]   They were in wonder.
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.040]   They were in awe.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.600]   This was the most amazing thing they have ever heard.
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.240]   And right now, Luke is basically saying,
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:32.960]   "It can't get better.
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.360]   Isn't God great?
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:37.320]   Isn't he saying nice things?"
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:42.760]   And then Simeon opens his mouth again.
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:49.360]   And then he puts Jesus to one side and he turns to Mary.
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:52.560]   And I want you to hear what he says to Mary.
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:56.360]   "Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother,
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.760]   'This child is destined to cause the falling
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:01.200]   and the rising of many in Israel
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.000]   and to be a sign that will be spoken against,
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.720]   and a sword will pierce your own soul too.'"
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:15.280]   This was not in the Christmas script
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.520]   that was supposed to be the Christmas script.
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.480]   This wasn't quite as nice
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.040]   as what had just been spoken about Jesus.
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:27.280]   Simeon turns to Mary and he says some prophetic words
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:32.120]   over her that she did not want to hear,
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:33.440]   but she needed to hear.
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.800]   He says to her, first of all,
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:39.200]   that Jesus is gonna be an absolute nightmare for you.
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:43.360]   He said, "He's gonna cause the rising and the falling
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:45.760]   of many in Israel and will be a sign
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:48.280]   that will be spoken against."
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:50.280]   In other words, Jesus is gonna grow up
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:53.400]   and he's gonna be a controversial figure,
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.920]   he's saying to Mary.
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.000]   He's gonna cause the falling and the rising
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.920]   that the contents of people's hearts
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:21:59.760]   are gonna be revealed
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.480]   and no one likes the contents of their heart
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:03.360]   to be revealed.
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:07.400]   And some people will rise with Jesus.
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.800]   So some people will find their greatest life
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:10.800]   in relationship with him,
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:14.640]   but there are others who will reject him,
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:17.080]   who will not believe him,
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:18.480]   who will turn their backs on him,
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:21.720]   others who will actually speak against him.
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:26.720]   And this Jesus, he's gonna say some things.
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:29.560]   I mean, he's gonna come and he's gonna say some things
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:31.600]   that you, Mary, as his mother,
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.480]   you're gonna be like, "Oh my goodness, I can't believe
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.520]   he just said that."
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:39.560]   This is not gonna be an easy future for you, Mary.
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:42.400]   And God so loves Mary in this moment.
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:46.200]   So, I want you to see this, so loves Mary,
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:49.320]   but sees her future and knows it's gonna be hard,
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:52.240]   knows that raising the son of God is not gonna be easy.
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.080]   And so out of his love for her,
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.600]   he wants to prepare her and mold her
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:59.840]   and shape her into the woman that she needs to become
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:02.440]   so that she can be the mother to the son of God.
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:06.240]   And so he brings a word that she may not want to have heard,
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:09.680]   but she needed to hear in order to become the woman
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:10.920]   God wanted her to become.
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:16.440]   I mean, Jesus, can you imagine what Jesus is about to do?
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:19.960]   He's about to say things like,
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:22.560]   "Unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood,
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.920]   you have no part of my kingdom."
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:28.040]   That one got most of his followers to leave him.
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:29.800]   He would say to the religious authorities of the day,
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:34.320]   "You brood of vipers, you whitewashed tombs."
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.160]   He would say to his disciples, the followers,
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:38.800]   he would say, "Unless you pick up your cross,
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.640]   unless you die, basically, you can't follow me."
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:44.080]   He would actually say to his best friend,
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:47.400]   he would call his best friend Satan.
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.760]   This is not how to win friends and influence people.
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:55.600]   And then Simeon says this.
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:24:00.120]   He says, "A sword will pierce your own soul too."
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:03.600]   He's not speaking, of course, of a literal sword.
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.920]   He's not speaking of her death in the future.
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.880]   He's speaking about her emotions.
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:12.160]   He's speaking about how hard it's going to be for her.
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.680]   And that if she's not prepared for the reality
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:17.680]   of the chance and the choices and the things,
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.960]   there's one point Jesus is going to,
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:22.100]   in front of his mother, say,
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:24.640]   "My mother and father is not biological.
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:27.640]   My mother and father is anyone who follows after my father."
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:32.120]   Mary is going to have a hard path.
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:37.120]   And God doesn't hold back from helping her to see
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.960]   that there's some tough times ahead.
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:41.440]   There's a sword that's going to feel
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.320]   like it pierces your soul.
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:44.400]   It's going to be difficult.
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.920]   And God is saying this because he's like,
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.980]   "I love you so much that I'm going to say
[00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:50.840]   the very things to you that you need to hear,
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:53.800]   even as you're holding an eight-day-old child
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.000]   in your hands, the future ahead for him.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.480]   He is going to be the savior of the world.
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:59.760]   He is the light of revelation to Gentiles.
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:01.360]   He is the glory to Israel.
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.640]   You are going to have the joy of holding him,
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:05.640]   but you're also going to feel the pain
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.680]   that no parent wants to feel,
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:10.760]   and that is you're going to watch your child die."
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:18.360]   And God has so much love for Mary
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:23.460]   that he's willing to speak a hard word.
[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:28.480]   God has so much love for you.
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:32.860]   God sees everything that is ahead of you.
[00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:38.200]   God loves you so much that he's also willing,
[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:41.240]   at times, to come and speak over you
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:45.880]   and to help, perhaps, you to see that there are some things
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:48.440]   that might need to change in your life,
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:50.720]   or perhaps tell you that there are some things coming up
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.200]   that you need to get ready for and prepare for,
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.240]   'cause if you're not, it's going to be overwhelming,
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:59.160]   and it will feel like a sword has pierced your soul, too.
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:02.320]   I think sometimes, as Christians,
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.060]   we think that when we come to Christ Jesus,
[00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:07.440]   then everything's going to be absolutely perfect.
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:11.320]   The Christmas story shows us a different thing.
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:14.160]   And of course, Jesus is our life.
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:16.200]   And the wonderful thing that we celebrate at Christmastime
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.480]   is the arrival of our Savior and our Messiah,
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:19.880]   that when we're in relationship with him,
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.440]   our sin is taken care of, forgiven.
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:24.920]   We're released and filled with the fullness of God,
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:27.320]   that the same spirit that raised Jesus is found in us,
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:30.280]   and that we are found into flourishing, fullness of life,
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.560]   that we can know the fullness of peace, shalom,
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:34.320]   and that we'll have eternal life with him.
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:37.840]   There is so much good news in the gospel, so much there,
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:40.840]   and God so wants all of that for you
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:45.720]   that he's sometimes willing to speak something
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:48.880]   that is not going to be easy for you to hear
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.800]   to ensure that you remain on the path
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:52.240]   that he has for you to be on.
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:58.680]   See, Jesus is not afraid to speak a disruptive word
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.520]   to your perfect world if your perfect world
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.720]   is perfectly misaligned to his perfect will.
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:07.320]   He's not afraid to do that.
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:11.560]   And it seems weird, doesn't it, on Christmas Eve,
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:14.780]   that this would be a part of the Christmas story,
[00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:17.380]   but I think it's a part of the Christmas story
[00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:21.060]   because God is revealing his heart to his people.
[00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:23.820]   I'm so passionately in love with you,
[00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:26.900]   and I so passionately want the best for you
[00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:31.260]   that if there is anything in your life that is misaligned,
[00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:35.900]   I have the grace and the courage
[00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:37.700]   to lead you on a different path.
[00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:43.660]   I don't know about you, but I've had the disruptive word
[00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:46.820]   of God into my life many times over my life.
[00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:50.900]   I remember when I first quit my job, I was in banking here.
[00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:53.660]   I was one of those kids that was the banker.
[00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:56.100]   I wasn't a millionaire by 30, but I was a banker.
[00:27:56.100 --> 00:28:01.580]   And I felt God calling me out of that marketplace world
[00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:04.900]   into being a pastor, and so I remember quitting my job
[00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:07.020]   and moving with my family to New Zealand
[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:07.900]   to go to Bible school,
[00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:09.580]   and I remember the first month in Bible school,
[00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:11.700]   I felt so excited.
[00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:13.700]   I felt so excited about what my future was.
[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:15.780]   I could not wait to become a pastor,
[00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:17.580]   could not wait to become a preacher.
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:19.180]   I knew that God had called me to preach,
[00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:21.300]   and I was really excited to have a life
[00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:23.660]   where I could communicate God's word to people
[00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:25.540]   and speak life over people.
[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:27.580]   I mean, it was everything I wanted to do.
[00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:29.580]   And I remember in the first month of Bible school,
[00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:32.220]   I was setting myself ready for all the studies.
[00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:34.180]   I wanted to learn Greek, I wanted to learn Hebrew.
[00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:36.180]   I wanted to understand the Bible as best I could
[00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:37.620]   'cause I wanted to be the best preacher
[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:38.980]   of God's word that I could.
[00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:41.060]   And in the first month, I said to God,
[00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:43.140]   I said, "God, would you speak to me a word
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:44.660]   about my preaching gift?"
[00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:49.540]   And I was expecting that God would say,
[00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:51.820]   "You're awesome, Andrew.
[00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:53.420]   You're the best ever.
[00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:54.340]   You're the best.
[00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:55.820]   I see your future.
[00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:56.780]   You're gonna be the state apostle
[00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:58.060]   for a church called the Violet in Hong Kong,
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:59.020]   and it's gonna be amazing.
[00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:00.620]   And there's gonna be so many people on Christmas Eve
[00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:02.140]   that not only are you gonna be able to fit into the building
[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:03.620]   and it's gonna be great."
[00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:05.660]   (congregation laughing)
[00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:10.660]   I was expecting a word along those kinds of lines.
[00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:13.900]   But God said to me, "You really want me to speak to you
[00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:15.460]   about your preaching gift?"
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:17.140]   And I was like, "Yeah."
[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:20.180]   He's like, "Go to Amos chapter eight."
[00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:23.460]   So I went to Amos chapter eight, and here's what I read.
[00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:25.740]   "The days are coming, declares the sovereign Lord,
[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:27.860]   when I will send a famine through the land,
[00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:30.420]   not a famine of food or of thirst for water,
[00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:33.980]   but a famine of hearing the words of the Lord.
[00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:35.900]   People will stagger from sea to sea
[00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:37.420]   and wander from north to east,
[00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:39.460]   searching for the word of the Lord,
[00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:41.540]   but they will not find it."
[00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:45.740]   I had asked God to speak to me about my preaching gift,
[00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:48.260]   and he brings me to this passage where he's like,
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:51.380]   "Andrew, you need to understand that in your life,
[00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:56.060]   if you don't make some changes, a famine is coming on you,
[00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:58.380]   and that famine will be on hearing the word of God.
[00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:01.100]   And you need to understand that what makes a preacher
[00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:02.940]   is not how they speak the words of God,
[00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:04.700]   but how they hear the words of God.
[00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:09.100]   I am nothing if I can't hear the words of God.
[00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:11.020]   I am the worst pastor ever.
[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:13.540]   I have nothing to say on this stage,
[00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:17.900]   week in and week out, if I can't hear the words of God.
[00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:19.740]   If I can't receive and hear something
[00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:22.100]   and do my best to package it and bring it to you,
[00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:26.900]   if I can't do that, then this is absolutely useless."
[00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:29.660]   And I sat there under this idea that God's saying,
[00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:32.180]   "You really want me to speak about your preaching gift?
[00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:33.780]   Here's what you need to hear.
[00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:35.780]   It's not what you want to hear, Andrew,
[00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:36.900]   but here's what you need to hear.
[00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:39.220]   A famine is coming on your life
[00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:41.660]   where you will be completely useless,
[00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:43.460]   no matter how much Bible knowledge you have,
[00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:45.220]   no matter how much Greek and Hebrew you might know,
[00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:47.860]   completely useless unless you change
[00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:49.100]   some things in your life.
[00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:51.460]   There's some stuff in your heart, Andrew,
[00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:53.060]   that you need to deal with.
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:55.220]   And if those things don't get dealt with,
[00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:58.500]   I will block your ears and you won't hear my word."
[00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:03.380]   And this led me on a difficult six-month journey
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:07.220]   of dealing with some really important things
[00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:10.180]   in my soul and my heart that needed to be dealt with,
[00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:11.260]   things like pride,
[00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:16.180]   things like arrogance in my cool in life,
[00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:17.220]   things like thinking I'm better
[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:20.020]   because I'm in Bible school than in the marketplace,
[00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:22.820]   things that were ugly in me,
[00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:25.220]   other things that I don't want to tell you about.
[00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:27.540]   And I went through a six-month journey
[00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:29.940]   of having to bring those things to the Lord
[00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:31.780]   and have Him deal with me in
[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:35.220]   so that I could even think about being
[00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:36.620]   in the place that I'm in right now
[00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:39.860]   and doing what I'm doing with you right now.
[00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:42.940]   And every single time that I prepare a sermon
[00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:47.340]   here at the Vine, God breathes over me and says,
[00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:49.820]   "Don't forget Amos 8."
[00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:56.260]   This has been a disruptive word for me
[00:31:56.260 --> 00:32:00.500]   that has messed me up inside for years and years and years.
[00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:03.860]   And by God's grace has enabled me
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:06.020]   to hopefully stand in front of you
[00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:09.060]   and say some things at times that are helpful to you.
[00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:16.340]   Mary, Mary had this future ahead of her that God could see.
[00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:21.180]   And so he came in the gentleness of this amazing man, Simeon,
[00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:24.060]   and said some things to her that were not easy to hear,
[00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:27.220]   some things that messed some things up inside of her.
[00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:30.540]   God could see what my future was
[00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:33.780]   as a young 30-year-old wondering what was going on in life.
[00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:37.100]   He could see what was gonna happen for me.
[00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:39.140]   And he said, "You will be a disaster
[00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:40.420]   "for those people in Hong Kong
[00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:43.180]   "unless you first deal with this."
[00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:48.180]   He so loved me and you that he was willing to disrupt
[00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:51.660]   and make a mess of some things in my life.
[00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:52.900]   And what you need to understand
[00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:55.540]   is that God doesn't just come into mess.
[00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:57.500]   Sometimes He creates mess.
[00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:01.340]   And He creates a mess sometimes by bringing a word
[00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:05.140]   that is designed to disrupt some faulty old ways
[00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:07.740]   of thinking in you so that you would be brought
[00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:11.540]   into new and transformative ways of being.
[00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:15.900]   That's actually the Christmas story,
[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:21.500]   that Jesus was willing to disrupt this world,
[00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:25.780]   willing in the incarnation to come and stir some things up
[00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:28.420]   so that the world would get a vision of a life
[00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:31.300]   that is so much greater and so much better
[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:33.900]   than the one that was currently being experienced.
[00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:37.660]   The point of Christmas, the point that Jesus has come
[00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:38.820]   is so that the world would know
[00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:41.340]   that there is an alternative way and is the Savior,
[00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:43.900]   one that can set us free, one that forgives sins,
[00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:45.300]   one that changes us.
[00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:49.980]   And we need Jesus to come in to our perfect little worlds
[00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:51.900]   and mess some things up sometimes
[00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:55.220]   so that we would come into a place
[00:33:55.220 --> 00:34:00.220]   where we would truly worship Him.
[00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:06.020]   My heart for you is that you would think about it this way,
[00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:08.980]   and this is perhaps the more positive way to think about it.
[00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:12.660]   If you really want to grow as a person in 2024,
[00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:15.820]   the greatest Christmas gift you can give yourself
[00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:19.100]   is an open and receptive heart to the correction
[00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:20.900]   and discipline of God in your life.
[00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:26.740]   And I know that's not the Christmas Eve message
[00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:27.900]   you were hoping to hear,
[00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:31.580]   but I do believe it's the Christmas Eve message
[00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:32.940]   that God wants you to hear.
[00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:38.220]   If you took that seriously in 2024,
[00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:41.580]   you will have your greatest maturing growth
[00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:44.180]   that you have ever experienced.
[00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:46.540]   And it's not that God is gonna say those kinds of things
[00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:47.540]   all the time to us.
[00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:51.260]   Of course, God so often and normally and usually speaks
[00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:56.260]   words of life and hope, but let's not close our hearts off
[00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:59.140]   to the truly transformative moments
[00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:01.540]   where He puts His little finger on something
[00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:05.620]   and says, "Let's go on a journey here for a little while,
[00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:09.100]   "and let's actually allow this thing to get healed
[00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:11.820]   "and renewed and redeemed for you."
[00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:15.100]   My prayer for us as a church as we head into the new year
[00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:17.180]   is that we would have a heart like Samuel
[00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:20.420]   in the Old Testament who walked into the presence of God
[00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:25.420]   and said this, "Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening."
[00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:29.780]   Tomorrow, we're going to give you a really positive,
[00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:31.420]   happy message on Christmas Day.
[00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:37.060]   Today, my prayer is that you listened.
[00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:39.540]   Should we pray?
[00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:40.940]   Let's pray.
[00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:44.660]   Father, I am so grateful for all these amazing people
[00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:47.620]   in this room and the overflow around the building right now.
[00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:50.380]   Father, I'm thankful that they are so hungry
[00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:52.580]   to come to worship you on Christmas Eve,
[00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:56.740]   that they're willing to stand, sit in the aisles,
[00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:58.620]   sit on the stairs.
[00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:00.460]   Lord, we honour everybody in this room.
[00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:01.860]   We're so grateful for the community
[00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:03.620]   that you've built here at the Vine.
[00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:06.940]   And Father, we thank you for Christmas
[00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:08.780]   and the real Christmas story,
[00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:11.260]   the original one 2,000 years ago.
[00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:14.340]   We thank you that Luke included a story like this,
[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:15.780]   a story that perhaps is different
[00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:19.060]   from some of the other things we see in the Christmas story,
[00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:24.580]   a story where Mary sits under a challenging prophetic word
[00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:25.420]   from God.
[00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:30.340]   And Father, you speak so often words of life,
[00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:32.060]   the hope and truth.
[00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:34.220]   And sometimes you speak those words in ways
[00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:38.980]   that is designed to mess up our perfect worlds,
[00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:43.420]   particularly when we're misaligned to your will.
[00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:46.180]   (coughing)
[00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:47.300]   Father, I pray.
[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:51.140]   I pray by your Holy Spirit
[00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:56.740]   that people here would know the love of God
[00:36:56.740 --> 00:37:00.140]   seen in the beauty and the wonder of a child
[00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:01.500]   born in Bethlehem.
[00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:06.940]   That people in this room would know the call that's upon them
[00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:09.620]   that through relationship with Jesus,
[00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:11.300]   they can experience the greatest flourishing
[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:12.860]   that they will ever experience.
[00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:15.900]   And that everybody in this room would also know
[00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:21.460]   the openness of their hearts to whatever it is
[00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:22.940]   that God wants to say to them.
[00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:28.100]   Father, you know our best far better than we do.
[00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:34.140]   Father, we lay down our perceived perceptions and hopes
[00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:38.620]   and positive things that we want.
[00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:41.500]   Father, we ultimately want you.
[00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:43.700]   We want your leadership.
[00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:45.020]   We want your love.
[00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:48.380]   We wanna become the people that you need us to be
[00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:50.700]   so that the gospel could be heard in Hong Kong
[00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:52.340]   like it's never been heard before.
[00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:53.740]   I pray this Christmas Eve, Lord,
[00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:55.940]   would be a turning point for some of us here.
[00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:58.580]   And as we go into the new year,
[00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:01.220]   we would go in with open and receptive hearts.
[00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:03.300]   And that maybe there's some words
[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:04.700]   that you've been saying to us this year
[00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:07.860]   that we've gently put to one side.
[00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:10.540]   Perhaps we've been like, I don't wanna deal with that.
[00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:13.900]   And maybe as we've unpacked this story today,
[00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:16.100]   the Holy Spirit has reminded you right now
[00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:18.580]   of some of those words that God has said to you in the past
[00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:21.620]   that you've either ignored or put to one side.
[00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:24.940]   And perhaps your Christmas gift this year
[00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:26.900]   is God just gently saying,
[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:28.820]   I wanna bring you back to that word.
[00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:30.580]   I wanna bring you back to that thing.
[00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:31.980]   Let's talk about it.
[00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:35.620]   I wanna heal you and restore you and redeem you.
[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:38.300]   The years that the locust have eaten from you,
[00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:40.380]   as Joel chapter two would say,
[00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:43.140]   I wanna restore to you, the Lord says.
[00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:46.020]   Let me speak.
[00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:48.900]   Father, I pray that you would speak,
[00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:51.620]   that Lord, your church would hear,
[00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:54.460]   and that Lord, together, we would glorify you
[00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:57.300]   just like those shepherds who left behind the sheep
[00:38:57.300 --> 00:39:00.540]   and saw the child Jesus in the manger
[00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:04.820]   and went back glorifying and sharing the news of you.
[00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:07.540]   Lord, I pray that that would be your church.
[00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:08.620]   At Christmas time.
[00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:11.740]   And Father, we thank you for this.
[00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:12.780]   In Jesus' name.
[00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:14.700]   Everyone says,
[00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:16.820]   Amen, amen.
[00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:17.660]   God bless.
[00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:20.100]   Would you stand with me and we're gonna worship together.
[00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:21.100]   And then after that,
[00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:23.940]   Kyla will come in just a bit and close our service.
[00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:26.540]   (gentle music)
[00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:31.540]   [Music]
