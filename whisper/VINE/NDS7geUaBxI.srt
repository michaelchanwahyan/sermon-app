1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 A while back, actually it's a long time ago, I was in a conflict.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 It wasn't one of those conflicts where one time something happens,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 but it was a conflict that just kind of kept meandering along.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 One thing happens, another thing happens, and another thing happens.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 They make you upset.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 And I got to the point where I was just fed up. I had it. I had enough.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 So this person was so rude, so inconsiderate, you know, how dare they.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 And I don't know, I can't remember exactly what happened,

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 but I was challenged, either by a friend or through a book or something I was doing,

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 I was challenged to pray a prayer of blessing over this person.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 And I was like, that is the last person that I want to pray a prayer of blessing over.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 I didn't want to do it. But eventually I did it anyhow.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 So I prayed for this person, and I was having problems with a blessing over them.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 And I don't remember how many times I prayed this,

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 but at one time while I was praying, the Holy Spirit suddenly highlighted to me

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 and gave me insights into a lot of pain and difficulties that this person had gone through.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 And that really allowed me to have a different level of compassion and care,

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 because it provided context for how they were acting towards me.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Now, don't get me wrong, I still believe that as adults we are responsible for how we act,

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 and we need to own our actions and everything,

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 but it still was helpful to understand the context,

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 and it gave me a lot of compassion and care.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 And eventually it really changed my outlook on the person.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 I started looking at the person in a different way.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Now, what had happened?

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Well, instead of looking at the person through my human wisdom and my human understanding,

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 when I prayed, God gave me spiritual sight.

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 He let me see this other person through his eyes instead of just seeing them through my eyes.

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 And that was so powerful, because it allowed me to suddenly be more patient,

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 to show more grace, to be more understanding,

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 but then also eventually to be able to forgive and to really just move forward.

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 You know, it's amazing, right?

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 When God gives us spiritual sight, when he gives us a faith perspective,

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 how we suddenly can navigate something where we only had one way of looking at it,

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 we're suddenly able to navigate it differently, and it can make all the difference.

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Now, we all in our lives, in big ways and in small ways, we have situations, circumstances,

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 where we're looking right now at them from a human perspective, with human wisdom,

38
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 and that's okay, because we're human, and we should use our human perspective,

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 we should use our human wisdom.

40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 But I really have a sense, as I was writing this sermon series and preparing this for us,

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 that God wants to give us spiritual sight this year,

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 that he wants to give us a deeper faith perspective of what he's doing, of what is going on,

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 so that instead of just seeing the things through our limited lens,

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 that we can have a fuller perspective, that we can understand what God is doing,

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 that we can face, if it's a challenge, that we can face the challenge with hope,

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 with courage, with perspective and trust in him,

47
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 or if it's an opportunity, because it can also be positive things, right?

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 That we also know how to walk, how God is leading, and what he wants us to do.

49
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 And so I want to explore with you the following question, that's this.

50
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 How can I cultivate spiritual sight in approaching and understanding my life?

51
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 How can I gain a greater faith perspective?

52
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 How can I more consistently see things through the eyes of faith?

53
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 And how in the world do you do that?

54
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 What does that look like?

55
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 And how might God invite you to have deeper spiritual sight this year?

56
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 So I'm excited about this.

57
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 We're continuing in our sermon series, Bold in Prayer.

58
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Last week we looked at Matthew 9, where we talked about that Jesus,

59
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 as he was seeing the crowds and was seeing their needs,

60
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 and they were helpless, and they were at rest,

61
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 he invited the disciples to pray for the Lord of the harvest to send out,

62
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 to cast out, to thrust out workers into the harvest field.

63
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 And I really believe that part of that is, part of that thrusting out,

64
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 is that actually God also gives us different spiritual sight,

65
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 so that we start looking at our days, at our routines,

66
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 at the people around us in different ways,

67
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 and we can understand where he's at work,

68
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 and where he's inviting us to partner with him in the work that he is doing.

69
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 So that's what we looked at last week.

70
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 Today we are in 2 Kings.

71
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 I want to provide a little bit of context for you,

72
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 and I'm going to start by looking at a map that I stole from Pastor Ivan,

73
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 that he used this morning.

74
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 I was like, "Oh, this makes it a lot easier to explain what I want to explain,

75
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 so let me use the same map."

76
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 So 2 Kings, to give a little bit of context,

77
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 since we are not consistently right now walking through the book of 2 Kings.

78
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 So first, there's a reign of King Solomon, and also the demise of that.

79
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 There's a separation of Israel being one nation to being two kingdoms,

80
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Judah and Israel, so the southern kingdom, the northern kingdom.

81
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 We're going to pick things up around the 9th century before Christ,

82
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 where the prophet Elisha, he is in Dothan.

83
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 I want to say Gotham, but it's Dothan.

84
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 You know, Germans have problems with T-H.

85
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 Dothan.

86
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 We're also going to be looking at Samaria,

87
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 which was the capital of the northern kingdom.

88
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 It's King Jehoram, Israel's king.

89
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 He's actually not even mentioned in the passage,

90
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 but we're going to look at by name.

91
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Let me go to the other side.

92
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 And then we're going to look at King from Aram,

93
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 who was raiding, attacking, warring with Israel.

94
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 So this is the broad context.

95
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 There's a lot more going on, but I think that gives you a little bit of an idea

96
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 of what's going on.

97
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 So let me take you to 2 Kings 6, where starting in verse 8, it says this.

98
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 "Now the king of Aram was at war with Israel.

99
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 After conferring with his officers, he said,

100
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 'I will set up my camp in such and such a place.'"

101
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 I think it's very cool that the Bible uses the word "such and such."

102
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Verse 9.

103
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 "The man of God sent word to the king of Israel,

104
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 'Beware of passing that place, because the Arameans are going down there.'

105
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 So the king of Israel checked on the place indicated by the man of God.

106
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 Time and time again, Elisha warned the king

107
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 so that he was on his guard in such places.

108
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 Now he sent a raid to the king of Aram.

109
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 He summoned his officers and the men of them,

110
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 'Tell me which of us is on the side of the king of Israel.'

111
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 'None of us, my lord,' said one of his officers.

112
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 'But Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel,

113
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 tells the king of Israel the very words he speaks in your bedroom.'

114
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 'Go find out where he is,' the king ordered.

115
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 'I can send men and capture him.'

116
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 The report came back, 'He is in Dothan.'

117
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 Then he sent horses and chariots and a strong force there,

118
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 and they went by night and surrounded the city."

119
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 So we're told the king of Aram, he's picking a fight,

120
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 he's warring against Israel,

121
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 he makes all these amazing plans with his officers in the war room.

122
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 But for whatever reason, his plans are always thwarted.

123
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 The king of Israel is always able to avoid him.

124
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 They're not able to catch him, they're just always able to escape.

125
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 And so the king realizes, this is beyond coincidence.

126
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 One time, okay, two times, okay, three times, okay, four times, come on.

127
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 Who's the leak? Who's the mole?

128
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 And so then he's told that it's not any of his officers,

129
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 but it's a prophet, Elijah,

130
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 and that he knows the very words that are spoken in the bedroom of the king,

131
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 which is very creepy.

132
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 But what that means is if Elijah, the prophet,

133
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 knows what is spoken in the bedroom, that means he knows everything.

134
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 He can hear everything, he can perceive everything.

135
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 God has given him supernatural sight, supernatural insight

136
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 into what's going on.

137
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 And so the king of Aram decides we're going to go after him,

138
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 but I just want to highlight a contrast here.

139
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 The king of Aram has no idea where Elijah is

140
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 while Elijah knows everything about the king of Aram.

141
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 So he even needs to send out a spy to figure out where he is

142
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 to send someone there.

143
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 And so then he sends the troops, horses, chariots,

144
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 that would be the equivalent of the most modern military equipment there is.

145
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 I have no idea what the most modern military equipment is.

146
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 I assume it's like drones and helicopters and things.

147
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 But they're sending their special forces there.

148
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 And that's a bit of overkill for catching one person.

149
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 But the king is so frustrated that he's fully going for it.

150
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 Let's continue in verse 15.

151
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 "And when a servant of the man of God got up and went out early in the morning,

152
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 an army with horses and chariots had surrounded the city.

153
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 'Oh no, my lord, what shall we do?'

154
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 The servant asked. 'Don't be afraid,' the prophet answered.

155
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 'Those who are with us are more than those who are with them.'

156
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 And Elijah prayed, 'Open his eyes, lord, so that he may see.'

157
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 Then the lord opened the servant's eyes, and he looked,

158
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 and he saw his hills full of horses and chariots of fire around Elijah."

159
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 So now instead of seeing things from the Arameans' perspective,

160
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 now the narrative shifts,

161
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 and we get to see things from Elijah and his servant's perspective.

162
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 We get to see things from their point of view.

163
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 Elijah's servant gets up, he steps outside,

164
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 and oh my gosh, oh no.

165
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 That's what he says, oh no.

166
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 They are surrounded by enemy forces.

167
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Like I said, it's the most modern military equipment,

168
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 so this is intimidating, this is scary.

169
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 He is freaked out.

170
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 And so he calls out, "Oh no, my lord, what shall we do?"

171
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 So he calls out to the man of God,

172
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 who also, of course, indirectly represents God, Elijah.

173
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 Like, "Oh no, what shall we do?"

174
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 Now it would be easy to just pass over this really quickly,

175
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 this 'oh no' moment.

176
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 But when you and I go through an 'oh no' moment,

177
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 it doesn't usually just pass quickly.

178
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 It actually really occupies us, we're really challenged with this,

179
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 and so I don't want us just to pass over it quickly.

180
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 Because the truth is that there is something

181
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 that every one of us, at one point or another,

182
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 we feel surrounded, we feel fenced in,

183
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 we are overwhelmed by the challenges that are going on in our lives,

184
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 where we also, like the servant Elijah, have an 'oh no' moment.

185
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Where there are things we see,

186
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 and we do not know the way out, we do not know what to do,

187
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 we have no answer, we have no way forward.

188
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 So that is what the servant Elijah is seeing.

189
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 He's seeing enemy forces on the hills,

190
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 they're surrounded, and they're about to get them.

191
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 And so then he calls out to Elijah.

192
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 And Elijah responds, "Don't be afraid.

193
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 Those who are with us are more than those who are with them."

194
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 Now, I have a question for you.

195
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 If you're overwhelmed, if you are freaked out

196
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 about the challenges in your life,

197
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 and somebody just tells you, "Don't be afraid."

198
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 How do you feel about that?

199
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Might be annoying, right? Let's be honest.

200
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 And we do that a lot in church, right?

201
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 We tell each other things are true,

202
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 but sometimes we just don't want to hear them.

203
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 "Don't be afraid." He's like,

204
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 "How can you tell me not to be afraid?

205
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 There's like horses and chariots all around us,

206
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 and we're about to be in enemy's arms,

207
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 we're about to be taken captive.

208
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 Like, what in the world are you talking about?

209
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 Elijah, are you crazy?

210
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 And by the way, what do you mean

211
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 that those who are with us are more than those who are with them?

212
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 What do you mean by that? What does it even mean?

213
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 Who are you talking about?"

214
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 That's probably how I would have reacted.

215
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 And so what Elijah's servant doesn't know

216
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 is that Elijah has spiritual sight.

217
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 He's able to see what is going on around him,

218
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 not just from a human perspective,

219
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 but from a supernatural perspective.

220
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 He understands how God is at work in the moment,

221
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 and that makes all the difference.

222
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 And so he prays for his servant's eyes to be opened.

223
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 So in verse 17 it says, "And Elijah prayed,

224
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 'Open his eyes, Lord, so that he may see.'

225
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 Then the Lord opened the servant's eyes,

226
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 and he looked, and he saw the hills full of horses

227
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 and chariots of fire all around Elijah."

228
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 So Elijah prayed for spiritual sight for his servant,

229
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 and God opened his servant's eyes,

230
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 and he suddenly was able to see the circumstances,

231
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 the situation that he's in, that he's facing,

232
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 from a completely different perspective.

233
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 While just a moment ago he's crying, "Oh, no,"

234
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 and he's overwhelmed, and there seems to be no way out,

235
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 now his eyes are opened, and he sees those who are with us

236
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 are more than those who are with them.

237
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 And he sees the chariots of fire, he sees the heavenly hosts,

238
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 the heavenly army outnumbering the enemy

239
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 that is there to get him.

240
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 Wow!

241
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 What a perspective, and what a change in perspective.

242
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 And you know, the words, "Do not be afraid that he spoke,

243
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 that at first might seem annoying."

244
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 Now that his eyes are open, "Oh, I do not have to be afraid."

245
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 Because these words of "Do not be afraid,"

246
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 they're not just wishful thinking.

247
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 They're actually based in the reality of who God is

248
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 and what God is doing.

249
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 Can I get an amen? Come on. Amen. Yes.

250
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 And so he does not have to be afraid.

251
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 And you know, this is true for us as Christians,

252
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 because what we see is not everything that is going on.

253
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 There is a spiritual reality.

254
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 Psalm 34 verse 7 says, "Know that the angel of the Lord

255
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 encamps around those who fear him."

256
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 So if you're walking with God, the angel of the Lord

257
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 surrounds you and encamps you.

258
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 God is with us. You know, we are not alone.

259
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 He is for us. And that's another thing in the situation.

260
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 It's not just that he gets to see, but it also means that

261
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 God is with Elisha and his servant.

262
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 They are not alone, and neither are you and I.

263
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 We are not alone. God is with us, and he is for us,

264
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 even more than we can imagine or think.

265
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 So God is for you, and he's greater and more powerful

266
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 than you can think or imagine.

267
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 I mean, I don't know about you, when you walk around

268
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 through your day, if you have in mind who God is constantly

269
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 in all his fullness and all his glory and all his power

270
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 and all his majesty and all his love.

271
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 I don't. I want to, but truth be told, I don't.

272
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 So God is more powerful, more loving, more caring

273
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 than you and I can imagine.

274
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 And he is at work in our lives, just as he is at work

275
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 in the life of Elisha and his servant in this moment.

276
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 But let's continue and see what happens.

277
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 Verse 18, "As the enemy came down toward him,

278
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 Elisha prayed to the Lord, 'Strike this army with blindness.'

279
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 So he struck them with blindness, as Elisha had asked.

280
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 Elisha told him, 'This is not the road, and this is not the city.

281
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Follow me, and I will lead you to the man you are looking for.'

282
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 And he led them to Samaria.

283
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 So after they entered the city, Elisha said,

284
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 'Lord, open the eyes of these men so that they can see.'

285
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 And the Lord opened their eyes, and they looked,

286
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 and they were inside Samaria."

287
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 Now remember, Samaria was the capital of the northern kingdom.

288
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 They're inside the capital of the enemy.

289
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 And Elisha had led them there.

290
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 So we're told that Elisha prayed a second time, so they do attack.

291
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 So just because we know who God is, that he's powerful and great,

292
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 doesn't mean that we still go through whatever challenge we're facing,

293
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 but we can walk through it differently because we know the power of God,

294
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 we know who God is, and so we can face it differently.

295
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 So as they are coming at him, he prays, and God answers his prayer,

296
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 and he strikes them with blindness.

297
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 Now what's interesting is, and I didn't catch this on multiple readings,

298
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 only after I read some commentaries and things,

299
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 is that actually the blindness that is talking about here is not physical blindness.

300
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 What do you mean not physical blindness?

301
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 Well, the Hebrew word that is used here, "sanverim,"

302
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 it's a very rare word.

303
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 It's not the normal word that is used for blindness.

304
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 It's actually only used three times, twice in this passage, once in Genesis.

305
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 And it means blindness, dazzling, and deception.

306
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 And so in NIV it's translated as blindness,

307
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 but if we look at the context, I think we can see that something else is going on.

308
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 Elisha asks them to follow him,

309
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 that he's going to lead them to who they're looking for.

310
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 How can they follow him if they can't see?

311
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 And this is still, I think it's like 11 miles or something like that,

312
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 so it's still quite a stretch.

313
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 And then suddenly he's telling them,

314
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 "Oh, this is not the road and this is not the city."

315
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 They were just looking at the city.

316
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 They were just on the road.

317
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 Just because you're physically blind suddenly doesn't mean that somebody can tell you

318
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 this is not the road, this is not the city.

319
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 So something has changed in the perception.

320
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 They have distorted perception.

321
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 God has blinded them from the reality of the situation that they're in.

322
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 And so then Elisha is able to lead them into the city,

323
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 into Samaria, which is the hub of Israel,

324
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 into the enemy from the Arameans' perspective, the enemy of Seraturi.

325
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 And then he prays for them again and their eyes are open,

326
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 and now they can see where they're at.

327
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 And that's for them an "Oh no" moment.

328
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 So earlier we had the "Oh no" moment for Elijah's servant,

329
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 now we have the "Oh no" moment for the Aramean soldiers.

330
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 Let's continue in verse 21 and see what happens.

331
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 "So when the king of Israel saw them, he asked Elijah,

332
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 'Shall we kill them? My father, shall I kill them?'"

333
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 He's very eager.

334
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 "'Do not kill them,' he answered.

335
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 'Would you kill those you have captured with your own sword or bow?

336
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 Set food and water before them, so that they may eat and drink,

337
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 and then go back to their master.'

338
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 So he prayed a great feast for them,

339
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 and after they had finished eating and drinking,

340
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 he sent them away and they returned to their master,

341
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 so that bands from Aram stopped raiding Israel's territory."

342
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 I can only imagine what it must have been like,

343
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 as these soldiers, as their eyes are opened,

344
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 and they're like, "Oh my goodness, no, we're in enemy territory,

345
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 we're surrounded, and there's a king who's drooling

346
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 over the opportunity to kill them."

347
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 But since they were not the king's prisoners,

348
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 they were Elijah's prisoners, he actually, I believe,

349
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 also through spiritual sight, through what God had revealed to him,

350
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 he shows them mercy and grace, and that then allows them

351
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 that this conflict, at least for a while, actually does continue eventually,

352
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 but for a while this conflict ends between Israel and Aram.

353
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 Now, this whole passage is, there's two dynamics that I want to highlight.

354
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 The first one is, that it's all about sight.

355
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 Elijah sees and knows the plans, and knows what's going on,

356
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 and what they want to do, and the king of Aram, he doesn't know,

357
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 he doesn't have sight.

358
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 Then the military, they surround Elijah and his servant,

359
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 and the servant doesn't have sight, and then God gives him sight,

360
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 and then they take away, so as you see, it's all about vision,

361
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 and seeing and not seeing, and this brings me to a second point,

362
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 is all of this also shows that God is sovereignly over the situation.

363
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 There are politics going on, there are world powers,

364
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 or regional powers here in this case, fighting,

365
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 but God is sovereign in the midst of this conflict,

366
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 and is working out his purposes, and what he desires,

367
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 what he wants, comes to pass.

368
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 And there's a third thing I actually want to highlight to you too,

369
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 and that is that, is the relationship between Elijah and God,

370
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 because we see Elijah pray three times, open his eyes, blind them,

371
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 open their eyes, and Elijah is walking in this relationship with God,

372
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 and that's why he has spiritual sight about what's going on.

373
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 Now, of course, this leaves us at the point of asking the question,

374
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 what does all of this mean for us?

375
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 This brings us also back to the earlier question that I asked,

376
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 how can we cultivate spiritual sight in approaching and understanding our lives?

377
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 How can we start not just looking at our circumstances,

378
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 our challenges, from a human perspective,

379
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 which we again still should, because God has made us and given us that,

380
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 we should use our human reason and wisdom and all of those things,

381
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 but how can we also look at things with spiritual sight,

382
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 with eyes of faith, or see things through the eyes of God?

383
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 Now, how do you do that?

384
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 Well, there's three things I want to highlight.

385
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 The first one is, this really happens through a relationship with Jesus.

386
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 Now, if you want to have spiritual sight, if you want to understand what God is doing,

387
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 if you want to see beyond just the physical reality, you need to know Jesus,

388
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 because when you become a Christian, actually even talks about it,

389
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 when you move from darkness to light or from spiritual blindness to sight,

390
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 it's part of how the Bible describes even conversion or coming to faith,

391
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 you gain a different perception, a different perspective of reality,

392
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 because now you can see things through eyes of faith.

393
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 You can see that Jesus really is the Savior, that he is God's Son,

394
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 that he did die, that he did rise, that he is powerful over death, over sin,

395
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 that he is able to forgive us, and you can now see this because you are a Christian.

396
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 But then just because we're a Christian doesn't mean that we always have spiritual sight.

397
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 I mean, earlier I was telling a story of me, I was in this conflict,

398
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 and I was not having spiritual sight.

399
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 I was having just my human perspective of what was going on.

400
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 And so we need to nurture our relationship with God to develop the sight.

401
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 And so as our relationship and intimacy with God grows, so does your spiritual sight grow.

402
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 So if you want to have spiritual sight, we need to invest time in our relationship with God,

403
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 which we're doing right now through this fasting season,

404
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 coming before God with our fasting, with prayer, with reading of Scripture, with worship,

405
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 or whatever else you're doing.

406
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 But then the second thing is that the way we gain more sight is through God's Word,

407
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 because God's Word is God's revelation to us.

408
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 It's how he has shown us who he is, how powerful, how mighty.

409
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 He has shown us his love.

410
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 He shows us his purposes that he has for us through his Word.

411
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 And so if we don't know his Word, we have limited sight.

412
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 But as we get to know God's Word, he wants to give us more of a faith perspective,

413
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 because we know God's revelation more, and we can see things differently.

414
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 We can see things through a lens of faith.

415
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 Now, as I was thinking this through, I was reminded of Psalm 119, 105.

416
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 "Your Word is a lamp for my feet and a light on my path."

417
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 It's like we're walking around in darkness, because we're not seeing everything.

418
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 But as we go into God's Word and the Holy Spirit illuminates God's Word to us,

419
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 we can start seeing who God is.

420
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 He speaks to us even directly about things that are going on, gives us an understanding.

421
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 And it's like light on a path.

422
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 Like before you're walking in darkness, now as you're getting to know God more through his Word,

423
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 it's like your path lights up, you're more clear on where to walk and what to do.

424
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 And so if you want to grow in sight, you need to spend time in God's Word.

425
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 And he wants to light up your path in the way that he has for you,

426
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 whether it's in challenges, whether it's an opportunity, whether that's with your dreams.

427
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 But he will light up your path, and he will show you a way.

428
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 So for some of us here, this might be one thing that God is inviting you this year,

429
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 to go deeper into his Word.

430
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 And when we read God's Word, we can ask the Holy Spirit to illuminate it,

431
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 to help us understand his Word, to show us what it means for us.

432
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 And he does that. He loves doing that.

433
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 So that is the second important thing.

434
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 That's one way that we live out that relationship is through his Word,

435
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 as we come to his Word and ask God to help us understand and spend time.

436
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 So we gain spiritual sight by getting to know God's Word,

437
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 and the Holy Spirit illumining God's Word to us.

438
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 And finally, we cultivate spiritual sight and approaching and understanding our life through prayer.

439
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 And that's really what the passage really focuses on.

440
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 It's this praying relationship with Elisha and between Elisha and God,

441
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 and where he's able to see things because he prays.

442
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 Prayer is how God gives us spiritual eyes to see what we otherwise would not see.

443
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 So if we're not praying, there's things you're not going to see.

444
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 God only opens those up when we pray, when we come to him and ask him.

445
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 Just like Elijah asked for his servant's eyes to be opened,

446
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 so that he could perceive that he was not alone in the challenge that he was facing.

447
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 But without prayer and without praying for each other,

448
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 so I also love that it's Elisha praying for Elisha's servant,

449
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 without praying for each other and without prayer,

450
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 we're not going to have spiritual sight.

451
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 We're going to not be able to see things as clearly as they are.

452
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 We're not going to be able to perceive all of the reality,

453
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 all of what God is doing in circumstance.

454
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 But when we pray, God gives us a vision.

455
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 He gives us sight and helps us to see things we're otherwise not seeing.

456
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 And so invited to pray.

457
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 Now, I wanted to share, I already shared earlier the story about praying

458
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 and God giving me eyes to see this conflict differently.

459
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 And in the end to be able to resolve it, right?

460
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 So that was the first thing.

461
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 But I want to share something actually that's just church plant.

462
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 Now, in 2022, that's when we announced in one try,

463
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 in the church that sent us here, the Vine,

464
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 we announced that we're going to be planting this church.

465
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 And then we started meeting as a church plant team with like 30 people twice a month.

466
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 And so we're gathering together, but we're in one try,

467
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 but we're talking about planting in New Long.

468
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 How in the heck is that going to work?

469
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 And so we decide that we're going to have a one-off barbecue

470
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 and Sunday service at EIS International Preschool,

471
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 which is close to Fairview Park, I think, Sunton.

472
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 I can't remember the exact little town.

473
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 And the day before, we actually were running an alpha at the same school.

474
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 And I was praying, and while I was praying,

475
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 God gave me this overwhelming sense that the next day,

476
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 God was going to give us a foretaste of what this church will be like.

477
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 That he will, so to speak, pull away the curtain

478
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 and give us a vision of what the Vine in New Long will be like.

479
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 And that he was giving us this vision to encourage the team, the church plant team.

480
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 Now, you have to imagine, we're not a church yet.

481
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 We're just preparing ourselves, but nothing has happened yet.

482
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 We're in one try, and I really had the sense that we needed encouragement.

483
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 We needed to be able to see.

484
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 And so God gave us, through this service, a picture of what this church could be like.

485
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 And then another thing happened.

486
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 We had problems with this venue.

487
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 So even though we were already paying rent for this venue,

488
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 we couldn't do anything because we were waiting for some permits.

489
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 And so then suddenly, this one-off barbecue and this one-off service,

490
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 suddenly we knew a way forward, because God gave us a way forward.

491
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 We didn't know how to work. This was not part of our plan.

492
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 But now, because God had spoken, because he had given us this picture and this experience,

493
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 now we knew what to do.

494
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 So in January 2023, we started meeting every week at EIS, in that preschool.

495
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 And guess what? The church started looking like that barbecue, when we had that Sunday barbecue.

496
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 You know, so it's amazing that when we pray, that God speaks to us,

497
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 that he reveals things to us, that he gives us guidance.

498
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 Now, this was not part of our plan.

499
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 I did have a plan on how to plant this church.

500
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 But, you know, you have to have a plan.

501
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 But you also have to be ready for your plan to completely change.

502
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 And this was not our plan, and it changed.

503
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 But through prayer, God gave us vision, and he gave us a way forward that we did not have,

504
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 that I did not have, where I did not know what to do, but God showed us what to do.

505
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 You know, and it's the same way that God wants to work in your and in my life,

506
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 and when we pray, he will give us sight about things that we otherwise will not see.

507
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 So we know how to walk, we know what to do, we gain encouragement, we gain perspective.

508
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 And so God wants to meet you when you pray.

509
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 So we pray, so when we pray, God helps us to see things that we otherwise would not see.

510
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 Now I want to invite the worship team to come up.

511
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 So the prophet, Elisha, he prays over the servant,

512
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 and then that he can see, and then he says, you know, or before he does it, he tells him,

513
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 "Those who are with us are more than those who are with them."

514
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 Elisha's servant, he could not see it.

515
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 And I think there's many of us right now, we're in situations where we cannot see what God is doing.

516
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 We cannot see how that God is mighty, that he is powerful, that he is at work.

517
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 You know, we cannot see that God is for us, that he's not against us.

518
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 And so we need to come with prayer, because we need a word from the Lord.

519
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 We're struggling.

520
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 We're overwhelmed, some of us.

521
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 And God wants to give us a word, he wants to give us a perspective,

522
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 so that we can move forward, that we are not hopeless,

523
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 that we're not living just in anxiousness and anxiety,

524
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 but that we can have faith that God will move with us, that he will provide with us,

525
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 that we can have faith that he's with us, that we are not alone.

526
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 That we can have assurance that he loves you.

527
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 He loves you. He loves you.

528
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 He has not given up on you. He is not finished with you.

529
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 There is more ahead.

530
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 And he has the power and the ability to provide.

531
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 And just like Elisha's servant, as I was preparing his message,

532
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 I really believe that God wants to meet us here right now in our "Oh No" moments.

533
00:36:52,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 Some of us are surrounded by these heavy military forces,

534
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 and we don't know what to do.

535
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 And we've been carrying, some of us have been carrying these "Oh No" moments from our 2024 into our 2025.

536
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 And for some of us, these "Oh No" moments have come in 2025.

537
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 We're like, that's not how we wanted to start this year.

538
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 But I believe that God wants to meet you right now.

539
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 He's inviting us to come to him in prayer and to ask him,

540
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 "God, give me sight. Give me spiritual sight.

541
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 I'm just, I'm drowning here. I need a word from you.

542
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 I need you to meet me.

543
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 I need you to give me faith. I need you to give me hope.

544
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 I'm struggling to hold on.

545
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 I do not know what to do."

546
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 And then as we come to him in prayer,

547
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 he is going to release sight.

548
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 He's going to give us words.

549
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 He's going to give us images.

550
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 He's going to put people around us.

551
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 And he's going to show us that we are not alone,

552
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 that he is with us, that we can make it through,

553
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 whatever is going on, that he can lead us.

554
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 And I also have the sense that he really wants us to know his power.

555
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 God's power is greater than the impossible situation you are facing.

556
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 He is more mighty, more powerful than whatever it is that you are going through.

557
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 And he has the power and the ability to get you through it, to lead you through it.

558
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 But not only is he powerful, he also is loving.

559
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 He loves you. He is for you. He is not against you.

560
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 The apostle Paul knew this.

561
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 He experienced it himself in his own life.

562
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 He didn't have an easy life if you read the New Testament.

563
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 He went through many hardships, trials, unimaginably difficult things.

564
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 And he encouraged the Roman Christians in chapter 8.

565
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 He says, "If God is for us, who can be against us?"

566
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 If God is for you, who can be against you?

567
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 Come on, people.

568
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 So part of seeing with spiritual side is seeing how big God is.

569
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 God is bigger than everything.

570
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 He is bigger than the things that appear so overwhelming to us right now.

571
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 He is bigger than your worry that you hold and that you carry.

572
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 He is bigger than your success.

573
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 He is bigger than your failure.

574
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 He is bigger than the temptation that you are facing.

575
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 God is bigger. He is more powerful.

576
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 If He is for you, who can be against you?

577
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 So I have a question or questions for us to reflect on.

578
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 So what is threatening and surrounding you right now?

579
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 What is your "Oh no" moment that you are carrying with you?

580
00:40:44,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 Where do you need spiritual sight right now?

581
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 So church, I want to encourage you right now.

582
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 If you need spiritual sight, actually I want to invite everyone to stand.

583
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 If you need spiritual sight, whether it's for an opportunity, whether it's for a challenge,

584
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 I want to encourage you to stretch out your hands right now before you.

585
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 And I want to ask the Lord for you and pray over you. Let me pray.

586
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:43,000
 Jesus, I thank you that you are mighty and powerful.

587
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 I thank you that you are greater than any of the challenges,

588
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 any of the circumstances that we are facing right now.

589
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 Lord, you see the outstretched hands.

590
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 There is struggle. There is difficulty. There is challenge.

591
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 But Lord, I pray right now by your Holy Spirit, will you come.

592
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 Holy Spirit, come. Will you move?

593
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 Will you provide? Will you raise faith where there hasn't been faith in a long time?

594
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 Will you pour out your love where we feel like you have not loved us, you have forgotten us?

595
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 Lord, will you make your love known right now?

596
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 Will you make that a lived reality?

597
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 Where there is fear, will you speak the words of us?

598
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 Do not be afraid because I am with you. You are not alone.

599
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus.

600
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 Give us eyes to see. Lord, we need you.

601
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 Give us vision. Thank you, Jesus.

602
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 Amen. Amen.

603
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 Let's worship church.

604
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 [music]

605
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 Lord, I come.
