1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
 Well, good morning. It's great to be here with you and great to also be with you online

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,440
 And when we were having that amazing worship had this image of you Andrew dancing in your hotel room there

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,600
 So as we worship together

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:20,560
 I pray that if you're here in the house or wherever you are worshiping that God would speak to us and

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,880
 Thank you for those prayers Carla. And so I would say this don't stop praying now

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,840
 Okay, keep praying my mom was a saint and she told me once about a time

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,040
 she was in a small town in Florida and

8
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,040
 She didn't really know where to go to church on a Sunday

9
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,560
 So she decided just to go to the church closest to her

10
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:48,080
 She went there and she said the pastor was really struggling. He just couldn't seem to get any point across

11
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:53,920
 So she said you know what Steve so I prayed for him and he got much much better

12
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,600
 So I'm counting on you to keep praying and don't stop praying

13
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,680
 We're going to talk today about

14
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,040
 courage

15
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,040
 courage and challenging times

16
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:12,320
 But before we do let me just say what a delight what a joy it has been for Marian and I

17
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:19,640
 to worship here together at the vine over this last year since October and to come every week and to

18
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,840
 hear God speak to us

19
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,720
 We have been as Carla said kind of friends of the vine for a long time

20
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:35,780
 We did a number of justice conferences together and I can tell you that right in that section right over there one justice

21
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:42,600
 Conference there was a couple of pastors together and we were praying and God through the Holy Spirit just spoke to me in a powerful

22
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,720
 way

23
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,440
 Now there is nothing special about that section over there, right?

24
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,440
 So don't feel like you should move over there, but you do look beautiful over there though

25
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,640
 So but anywhere in this room

26
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,880
 God has a word for us. And as Carla said earlier when we were praying that's what we heard

27
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,040
 We heard that the Holy Spirit wanted to take

28
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:09,580
 the song to take the prayers to take the welcome to take the message and to

29
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,920
 Individually translate it for you

30
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,760
 Now that's gonna take humble courage in order for you to receive that

31
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:24,320
 So wherever you are in your walk or in your relationship with God, whether you feel you're far away or close

32
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:30,360
 God has something for each one of us and I have found that when he speaks it's actually

33
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:37,800
 Pretty simple like a child because we are children of God. So it may be as simple as just hold on

34
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,840
 or it may be as simple as I

35
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,200
 Love you, or you're beautiful

36
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,040
 Or I don't know what it is, but God has a word for us. And so we do not want to miss it

37
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,280
 Now what I have found also is that the Holy Spirit

38
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:00,920
 Loves to speak through his word the Word of God and that's one of the primary ways for me that the Holy Spirit

39
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,560
 Speaks to me is through the word

40
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,360
 So I love it that every Sunday we come to the vine and we open up the word and we hear what the Spirit is saying

41
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:13,520
 For us so today we're gonna do that, but we're gonna have only one verse today

42
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,480
 So the verse is this Romans 12 12

43
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,120
 Be joyful in hope

44
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,160
 patient in affliction

45
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,760
 Faithful in prayer now, that's a short passage, right?

46
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:33,680
 But it's a powerful one if we can receive it if we have that humility to say I need this and that

47
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,440
 Courage to act on it when we hear what it's saying to us

48
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,360
 So be joyful and hope patient and affliction faithful in prayer

49
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,560
 That's the text a little bit of the context and you can see that it comes from Romans Romans 12 12

50
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,000
 Romans sometimes is called the Himalayas of the New Testament

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,600
 because in Romans Paul reaches these lofty heights of

52
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:03,760
 Insights spiritual insights and for me, I'm not sure if it's Romans 8 or Romans 12

53
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,760
 Which is the the Everest of the Himalayas or maybe the K2 which is which but?

54
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,400
 Romans 12 is full of power. It starts with these words that we know

55
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,360
 Therefore I urge you brothers and sisters in

56
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:26,480
 View of God's mercy to offer your bodies in living sacrifices. In other words, he's saying

57
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:35,000
 Give it all we're all in that's how he starts this passage and then he goes on and he says this do not

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,680
 conform

59
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,640
 No longer to the patterns of this world

60
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,760
 But be transformed by the renewing of your mind

61
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,520
 Do you remember pastor Andrew when he preached on a different spirit?

62
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,840
 And that's what this is saying is don't be conformed any longer to the patterns of this world

63
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,640
 But then he says this be transformed by the renewing of your mind in other words

64
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,240
 Let's think about how we might do it differently

65
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,120
 Reframing I believe that's what God has for us this morning

66
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,160
 Now if you have your Bible in terms of you're looking at it on your iPhone or whatever

67
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,800
 You might see right above verse 9 in chapter 12. There's a little subtitle

68
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:24,360
 That's an editors those weren't in the original text, but they're helpful to find the context one of those that I read

69
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,960
 Said that the following were marks of a true Christian 9 through the end of the book

70
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,600
 Mine just says love and

71
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,780
 One of the ones I like the most says love in action

72
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,320
 love in action

73
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,240
 So that's my question for you

74
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:52,560
 What does love in action look like in your week this week

75
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,240
 What does love in action look like because Paul in?

76
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,960
 Philippians 5 6 he said this the only thing that counts is faith

77
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,080
 Expressing itself through love, you know in this complicated world

78
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,440
 Sometimes we need to get down to this simple and I what Paul is saying it's about love

79
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:20,640
 So what does love look like in your life this week now? I believe that Romans 12 12

80
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:26,080
 Can help us answer that question it can give us some clues of what does that look like?

81
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,360
 So it's a short

82
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:35,080
 Verse, but it's a powerful verse and it's so short. I think we should memorize it. What do you think?

83
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:41,640
 Yeah, I think we should do it right now. Should we do that something a little different? Okay good

84
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,240
 Some people going. Oh, yeah

85
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,520
 Okay, let's try this together. This is how it's gonna work. It's really simple

86
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,080
 We've done this in a number of different settings. So what we'll do is first of all, let's just stay it together

87
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,720
 Say it together be joyful

88
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,720
 be joyful

89
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:03,520
 Faithful in prayer, okay, so it's pretty simple, right?

90
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:09,760
 Okay, so turn to your neighbor and you get to give them a little encouragement by saying this verse to your neighbor

91
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,280
 Be joyful in hope

92
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,280
 patient and affliction

93
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,240
 Faithful in prayer. Okay, your other neighbor is jealous now

94
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:24,760
 So turn to their other neighbor and say exhort them be joyful in hope

95
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,400
 patient and affliction

96
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:33,400
 Faithful in prayer and this may be the last time pastor Andrew lets me preach here, but thank you

97
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:39,280
 Thank you for working with me on this because this is important and I want to do it one more time

98
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:45,080
 But this time I want us to think about what we're saying, right the words and and say it to me

99
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,080
 I need this blessing be

100
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,680
 All right, you guys did it that's good

101
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:04,200
 So the heroes in the dark made it hard for you, didn't they they took away your your cue card there, but be joyful in hope

102
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:09,000
 Patient and affliction

103
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,160
 faithful in prayer

104
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:17,560
 We would do this sometimes in the prison ministry that I was working with at Community Church over six years

105
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:23,880
 every month we would go in first of the month into lychee cock and we would gather with the brothers there and

106
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:30,680
 Sometimes often we would learn scripture together and I would say to them, you know tonight

107
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:38,040
 When you're in your cell and it's dark you can't read the scripture, but it'll be there with you

108
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,920
 You can lie there and know

109
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:47,040
 The calling to be joyful and hope patient and affliction faithful in prayer. I

110
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:53,400
 Would say to them that when they come to that time where they're in front of the judge and they've got their earthly

111
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,520
 Lawyer advocate on one side and they've got the Holy Spirit advocate on the other side

112
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:04,720
 They've got the Word of God within them. They can't open their Bible in that setting but they can know

113
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,400
 The Word that is in them be joyful and hope patient and affliction faithful in prayer

114
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,880
 And you can too

115
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,320
 so tonight

116
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:21,680
 when you're in your room and the lights are out and you're having a hard time sleeping and you're thinking about

117
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,560
 The meeting the next day and you're wondering

118
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,400
 about God's

119
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,760
 Word for you. You can be joyful and hope patient and affliction

120
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,960
 Faithful in prayer when you're in that meeting

121
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:41,000
 Tomorrow morning, you've got your colleague on one side your boss on the other side

122
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,680
 You can be faithful in prayer

123
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:50,160
 You can be patient in affliction. You can be joyful and hope because it's in you it's in us

124
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,400
 Okay, but it's here right now, right? And so this often happens I think in

125
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,680
 With followers of Christ is we have too much head knowledge

126
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,840
 Everything's up here

127
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:05,080
 But it doesn't make that 18 inch journey all the way down to where it counts into our heart, right?

128
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,680
 Because when it's in our heart, then we live it out

129
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:14,320
 So that's what we want to focus on now is what does it mean not to memorize this but to know it by heart?

130
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,960
 if we know it by heart, then

131
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:23,080
 Then we can live it and it can be love in action for us. So we're gonna need some help for that and

132
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,920
 as as Carla said earlier

133
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,000
 last year

134
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,400
 Marian and I felt the Holy Spirit calling us on from Community Church

135
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:40,600
 Which was a very difficult kind of challenging time to go on because we had poured our love and and there was deep love there

136
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,600
 but we felt God was calling us on and

137
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,960
 We didn't know at the time where he was calling us

138
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,760
 but then we

139
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,800
 We followed God and found that he was calling us to the University of Hong Kong

140
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,440
 And as Carla said right now, I'm there working with character leadership

141
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:04,960
 With a team that's developing character leadership for the next generation. So first-year students, they'll be there four years in character leadership

142
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,400
 now

143
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,480
 The point of character leadership is that you know in traditional?

144
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,760
 Leadership theory there are three C's right? There's your

145
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:21,640
 Competence there's your commitment in other words how gifted you are how hard you work?

146
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:27,000
 but there's a third C that we often forget and that is character and

147
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,440
 just like the others can be taught hard work and

148
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,320
 Competence character can be taught

149
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,720
 so

150
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,840
 How how can we teach this one of the key components of teaching character?

151
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:48,280
 that again and again from all the way back from Socrates to Aristotle and on to today is that a key component of

152
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,560
 learning character is what's called an

153
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:56,080
 Exemplar an exemplar. Do you know what exemplar is?

154
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:02,640
 Yeah, good exemplar is basically a fancy word and it just means it's an example

155
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:07,200
 Of someone who's an example consistently for good in your life

156
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:13,460
 You have many exemplars in your life if you thought about it, and I'm sure you are an exemplar for many

157
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:18,760
 So I want to introduce you to an exemplar this morning. I met this exemplar

158
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,200
 about 15 years ago in Hungary and

159
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,640
 His name is father Oleson

160
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:34,760
 Now I believe father Oleson can help us in terms of understanding what Romans 12 12 means in our life

161
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:40,160
 But also understanding what would it mean to live with humble courage?

162
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:46,320
 this week a few years ago God laid on my heart these two words humble courage and

163
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,480
 I feel this is what we are called to live out our love in action with

164
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,120
 So let me tell you a little bit about father Oleson father Oleson

165
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:03,680
 The father comes because he's a Benedictine monk. He was in Hungary. I met him at an international pastors conference

166
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,200
 We were there and it was a very informal type thing. Someone just announced would anyone like to meet father Oleson?

167
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,840
 He's gonna come over this afternoon. You can have coffee with them. So there's about five of us that decided

168
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,720
 Yeah, that sounds like a good good deal. So we sat there with them and then father Oleson

169
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:26,200
 Began to speak he was 90 years old at the time and he began to talk about the time

170
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,560
 right after World War two

171
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:35,080
 Where he was put into prison into a Soviet gulag for ten years

172
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:40,820
 He and his friends were both put or all put into this gulag now

173
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,000
 at that time

174
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,720
 hundreds of

175
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,360
 thousands of people were being put into prison in his country and

176
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,320
 Only hundreds were returning

177
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:59,160
 But father Oleson and his friends. They basically said we not only want to

178
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:05,520
 Return but we want to come home stronger. And so they came up with four rules

179
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,760
 by rules just ways of living and

180
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,680
 these

181
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:17,800
 Ways of living help them to live love in action and it helped them to be stronger

182
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,680
 It helped them to have humble courage

183
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:26,200
 So I'd like to share those with you would is that okay? Would you like me to share the the four?

184
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,380
 Yeah, okay good because I don't have anything else. So that would be good

185
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:36,600
 All right rule number one

186
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:43,520
 Rule number one is don't complain. So we're gonna start with the hard one right right off the bat. Don't complain father

187
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:48,760
 Olson also expressed it in this way. He expressed it don't over dramatize your suffering

188
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:54,760
 Why because it makes us weaker and he realized when you're facing challenging times

189
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,720
 None of us in this room is in a Soviet gulag

190
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:05,400
 All of us in this room and whatever room you're watching from

191
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,960
 Is facing a battle

192
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,720
 we all have something challenging in our lives and

193
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:18,560
 So what I believe is these rules these guidelines can help us to face these

194
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:25,840
 Challenging times now this one what father Olson said is he said we found it made us weaker

195
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:32,520
 So we made a pact that we would not complain and there's lots to complain about in a Soviet gulag as you can imagine

196
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,080
 But we would not complain

197
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,800
 But yet what we would do if this one of us started to complain because it's easy to start

198
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,560
 then the others would say tell us about your job and

199
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,260
 There were people there who had been plumbers. They had been

200
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,160
 Lawyers, they've been doctors have been all these different jobs

201
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:54,040
 And he said I discovered more about different vocations in those ten years than in my whole time

202
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,120
 Don't complain

203
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:03,400
 Paul who also is in prison also facing a challenging time. He said it like this in Philippians

204
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,920
 - he said do everything without

205
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,800
 grumbling or arguing

206
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,000
 So that you may become

207
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:19,720
 blameless and pure children of God without fault in a warped and crooked generation and then I

208
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,840
 Love this then you will shine like

209
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,480
 stars in the sky

210
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,920
 Amen

211
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,920
 Okay, so that word

212
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:35,200
 Grumbling is and maybe some of your translated and translated complaining because it's the same word

213
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:40,680
 It's also the same word that goes back to the desert with the children of Israel who were

214
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:46,940
 Grumbling in their tents. Okay. So here's the time of confession. How many of us have been?

215
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:54,280
 Grumbling in our tents in this last week. My hand is raised. So we're grumbling in our tents. That's what we do, right?

216
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,480
 but

217
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,120
 What we hear here is that if we can refrain

218
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:05,760
 If we can refrain then we can shine like stars here's what I found, you know

219
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,720
 It's hard to be joyful and complain at the same time

220
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:16,440
 Right. So when Paul says be joyful and hope we need to not complain to give ourselves a chance, right?

221
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,760
 But that's the first one be joyful

222
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:28,400
 Do not complain shine like stars. Let's go to the second one the second rule find joy in small things

223
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,880
 find joy in

224
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,740
 small things and here father Olson basically said this he said

225
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,440
 Don't go looking for trouble trouble will find you right?

226
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,920
 Look for joy

227
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,520
 Don't go

228
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:53,840
 Looking for trouble trouble will find you that sounds like Jesus doesn't it? Jesus says in this world you will have trouble

229
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,440
 Today has enough troubles of its own

230
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:02,600
 Don't go looking for trouble but go looking for joy now. We just finished here in Hong Kong

231
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,560
 I actually finished around the world but finished the Olympics, right?

232
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,680
 But here in Hong Kong

233
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,240
 It was a special Olympics for us because we really did quite well

234
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:16,640
 As our city in terms of six medals in the Olympics and then in the a pair Olympics which just finished last Sunday

235
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,720
 five more medals coming in

236
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,480
 at the time of

237
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,040
 father Ola son's time in the Gulag

238
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,560
 He said one of the toughest

239
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,200
 Summers was the summers of 1952

240
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,960
 it was just

241
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,040
 Wretched during that summer, but the same summer

242
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,840
 Was the Helsinki Olympics?

243
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,840
 And so what they decided to do they decided we're gonna make our own Olympics in here

244
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:52,400
 so they came up with this idea for their own Olympics and the idea was very simple that basically what you would do is you

245
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,840
 would look during the day for the

246
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:03,400
 Everything that you could be thankful for and then the way the game worked was at in the evening right after the cabbage soup

247
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,120
 then

248
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:10,640
 We would share the things that they were thankful for and they had no medals to give right but the one

249
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,180
 Who had the most for that day?

250
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:18,480
 Then they would ask him what's your favorite song and then they would sing him that song

251
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,040
 Kind of like an anthem but as the honoring of him

252
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:27,480
 father Olson said that summer the grand champion came up with

253
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:34,920
 17 things in one day that he was thankful for in that Soviet Gulag and when he was explaining in his victory speech

254
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:40,520
 He said I was too busy trying to find them and to remember them to actually

255
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:44,480
 Complain or to actually think about the suffering

256
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:50,600
 This is the flip side of being joyful if we don't complain in order to be joyful

257
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:56,880
 We do look for small things to be grateful for on the flip side of being positive

258
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,640
 And

259
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,640
 This also helps us with hope

260
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:07,400
 Because after a while when our joy quotient goes down, it's harder to be hopeful

261
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,120
 But Paul says be joyful in hope

262
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:18,400
 So I want to I want to share with you a little definition of hope that I hope you find helpful

263
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,400
 And it's one I came across

264
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,280
 Last year. I was just going through some research and it's one by Thomas Aquinas

265
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,920
 Thomas Aquinas from the 13th century father of the church a great teacher and he defines hope as this

266
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,680
 He says hope is a future good

267
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,680
 difficult but possible

268
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:44,580
 Okay. So here's what I would like you to do whatever challenging time you're going through right now

269
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:52,040
 Then take these four parts of the definition and overlay them on your challenging time, right?

270
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:56,760
 So this is what I did because when I came across this I was going through a very difficult time

271
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,960
 And so when I read it, I thought okay. Yep difficult check. That's true

272
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:08,240
 And then I came back and I said is it future definitely. I'm not feeling good right now. It's definitely in the future. It's difficult

273
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,640
 It's in the future or it wouldn't be hope but then I thought it's actually

274
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,120
 Possible. I'm not just having a

275
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:22,240
 like a wishing but it's possible what I'm imagining and it's actually good and

276
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:29,080
 So Aquinas goes on to say right after this that this is possible in Jesus Christ

277
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:35,360
 Because Jesus all things are possible and nothing is impossible with God

278
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:41,880
 And so if you're in a place like this and you do have a lineup with these things, hold on

279
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,120
 Hold on because in Jesus Christ

280
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,720
 It's good and it's possible. What is coming?

281
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,760
 but then you might think okay, that's nice words, but

282
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,560
 can I be joyful in that hope and

283
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,520
 Here, I think we need to redefine

284
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:06,080
 We need to reframe as we talked about in the beginning what joy is

285
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,560
 Because see joy is

286
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:15,960
 Not the absence of suffering but joy is the presence of God

287
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:24,320
 Joy is not the absence of suffering. They're right there in the middle of a Soviet gulag, but it is the presence of God

288
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,760
 When Marian and I

289
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,520
 were living in in London our oldest and our youngest were both born in London and

290
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:37,480
 When we were living in London at that time, this is obviously pre-covid

291
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,800
 There was lots of travel people would come in and just like we're living here in Hong Kong people come and visit us

292
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:47,400
 Then they would come and visit and so we would take them on a tour of the town and one of the traditions that we loved

293
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,400
 Is when we were going around?

294
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,800
 London, you know in Buckingham Palace

295
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:56,680
 They have this tradition that when the Queen is in the flag is flying, right?

296
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:01,580
 So you go by and you kind of take a look is the Queen in oh she's in and I'm not sure what it means in

297
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:05,560
 My life, but it was kind of encouraging right? So you say okay, the Queen is there, right?

298
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,680
 Now think about joy

299
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:14,440
 If the flag of joy is waving over our lives the King is in

300
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,160
 the King is in and

301
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:23,020
 That's actually one of the indicators sometimes for me is if my joy is going then I need to be closer to God

302
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,200
 but the joy of

303
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,200
 the Lord

304
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,200
 Is the presence of God?

305
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,840
 But how do we do that?

306
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:39,400
 Okay, and that goes on to the next one in terms of rule number three be humble and be noble

307
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,160
 But let me stop here. So how's this going? Is this is this making sense?

308
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,520
 Yeah, you're with me. Yeah clear enough

309
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:52,220
 Okay. All right. We'll hand out coffee in a little bit and no, okay

310
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:55,120
 Thank you for your prayers

311
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,280
 rule

312
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:04,400
 Number three be humble and be noble now at this point in our conversation over coffee with father

313
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,600
 Olison he struggled a bit and

314
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:11,360
 He was struggling to put into words. What is rule number three some of it?

315
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,280
 I think was a translation problem from Hungarian to English

316
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,320
 But some of it is he was really struggling with what does this mean?

317
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:24,480
 And he came up with these four words be humble, but be noble and this is what he said

318
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,600
 he said

319
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,600
 We don't have

320
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,880
 the power of the world

321
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:36,720
 But we are not ants before the mighty

322
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:43,360
 We don't have the power of the world, but we are not ants before the mighty

323
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,920
 The same power

324
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,480
 That raised Jesus from the dead is in you

325
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:58,680
 The Holy Spirit his power within you and this is what father Olison was getting at. There's a humble

326
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:05,200
 Courage that is ours in Jesus Christ who humbled himself

327
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:11,920
 To the point of death and endured the cross there is this humble courage that we have

328
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,840
 together

329
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,880
 Now he gave us an example

330
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:25,400
 That some of the guards were helping some of the or excuse me some of the brothers the prisoners were helping the guards

331
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:31,480
 They didn't have to but it was just a part of their saying we are not ants we can serve

332
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,680
 Now I was thinking

333
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,800
 About two year

334
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,880
 2018 and in

335
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:46,400
 2018 as I was preparing the sermon or not wasn't preparing 2018 as I was preparing the sermon thinking about

336
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,080
 2018

337
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,160
 there was a time where kung-sung who runs prison ministries and

338
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,120
 here in Hong Kong and

339
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:00,280
 They had an idea that year that they wanted to bless the guards

340
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:05,840
 Through the brothers and so they spoke with the brothers talked to the brothers and the brother says yes

341
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,680
 We want to be a part of this and so we would go in as I said every month

342
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:13,560
 And so the idea was that kung-sung basically came up with a song

343
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,800
 And the song was stand by me and then they came up with a dance

344
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,240
 that we all had to learn or got to learn I guess and

345
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:26,080
 As we would go there after the teaching time we would all learn this dance together

346
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:32,960
 And we would learn the song together and then the day came where we were going to honor the guards now

347
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,800
 I'm not sure if my dancing honored the guards or not, but we all

348
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,920
 danced and we sang and

349
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:46,920
 The guards were moved and they brought in some of the higher-ups and we blessed them

350
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,960
 and

351
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:57,480
 After everyone had left and it was just the brothers and us then I told them I said what you did today was beautiful

352
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,600
 It's truly love in action

353
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,600
 It's being humble but noble

354
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,400
 It's this humble

355
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,520
 courage coming through

356
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,040
 You know in humble courage is

357
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:19,560
 actually, it's meant for hard times because in hard times we are humbled right and in

358
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:23,600
 Challenging or hard times. We also need courage and

359
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:29,040
 It may be that you're going through a very challenging time right now in a relationship

360
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:34,760
 And maybe you need the courage to say something to a person

361
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:41,560
 But you also need the humility to listen when that person responds

362
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:46,440
 Or maybe you're in a situation where you have the humility to know that you need some help

363
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,920
 But you also need the courage to act on that

364
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:54,760
 This humble courage is ours in Jesus Christ

365
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:59,960
 You know this part now is really talking about

366
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:05,920
 Be patient and affliction rules number one rule number two was about being joyful and hope

367
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:11,960
 But this one is what does it mean to be patient and affliction if you were translating word-for-word the original Greek?

368
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:16,800
 For be patient and affliction. It would basically be in affliction enduring

369
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:21,840
 Enduring translate patience. It's not a bad translation, but it's this idea of

370
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,960
 persevering patients holding on

371
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:31,800
 And it's also this idea. It continues to go on that's humble courage right because don't get me wrong

372
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,800
 Please don't understand me courage does not always roar

373
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:43,760
 Courage is not this soldier one minute in battle courage. It's the courage which sometimes

374
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:49,280
 Just where we say at the end of the day. I'm gonna show up tomorrow and

375
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:55,680
 That's courage where I'm gonna show up in a relationship, or I'm gonna show up in

376
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,360
 This last year at the University of Hong Kong

377
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,400
 There have been many times where I have just felt overwhelmed

378
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:12,400
 Times where I just felt there was more demanded of me than I could really help out with and so

379
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:18,960
 Basically on those days. It was just hum just try and say okay. I'm gonna have the courage to show up right

380
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:29,800
 Let's keep that let's not tell my boss about that okay, so actually my boss might be watching on TV

381
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,320
 but

382
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,320
 That's courage humble courage

383
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,920
 How do we get that?

384
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:44,960
 We can teach that we can learn that but there's an essential element of humble courage

385
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:50,000
 And that is rule number four and our last rule says we go to rule number four

386
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,480
 And that is cling to God cling to God

387
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,680
 At this point father Olison said

388
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:08,240
 He said we found that those who had someone to cling to

389
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,280
 did much better and

390
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,760
 Then he said this he said as Christians

391
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:20,640
 We all have someone to cling to and we cling to God

392
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,000
 We cling to Jesus Christ

393
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,640
 If you're here or online and you're not a Christian or Christ follower

394
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:35,320
 It's open to you as well. It's always open to say with humility

395
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:40,320
 I need that in the courage to act on that everyone in this room

396
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:46,760
 Who is a Christian at some point exercise humble courage to become a Christian we had to confess

397
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:52,200
 I can't do this on my own and we had to have the courage to say am I supposed to give everything that feels like

398
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,200
 a lot

399
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,560
 Right and so that's what it is

400
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,000
 Is that humble courage all through the summer?

401
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,080
 Carla started us off

402
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,120
 And then we had promise

403
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:11,800
 Tim we had John and they were unpacking the Psalms for us in a beautiful way of what does it look like in everyday life?

404
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:19,680
 Here's a Psalm 63 and Psalm 63 says this my soul clings to you

405
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,360
 your right hand

406
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:29,640
 Upholds me my soul clings to you your right hand upholds me

407
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:35,320
 Father Olson

408
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,720
 Died

409
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,760
 When he was a hundred years old and

410
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:48,120
 He when he the day he died there was actually when the book published about him and

411
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,440
 in this book

412
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:56,960
 It was on his hundredth birthday. It was published says I am aware. This is father Olson speaking

413
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:04,120
 He says I am aware of the fact that I am a simple man of

414
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:08,360
 Average abilities I have no special

415
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,840
 physical or mental skills

416
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,360
 But life

417
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:23,120
 Always demanded more from me than I was capable of can I hear an amen on this?

418
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:30,680
 But life always demanded more from me than I was capable of

419
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,800
 God

420
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,960
 Always stood next to me and more than once

421
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,120
 Helped me in miraculous ways

422
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,480
 Be faithful in prayer

423
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:53,520
 one of the things that father Olson said is he said in that prison we hung on to the scripture and

424
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:57,520
 We hung on to prayer and they held us

425
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,560
 So we've been looking at scripture, right? So

426
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:07,440
 Be joyful in hope patient in affliction

427
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,360
 and faithful in prayer

428
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:14,280
 But let's do the last part now together. We're gonna go into a time of prayer

429
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,480
 because to cling to God is to just go to him and to say

430
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,960
 God I need you

431
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,960
 To have that humble courage

432
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,840
 So let me do this. We're gonna close

433
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:36,440
 And sometimes it's nice to stand when we pray so I'm gonna invite you if you're comfortable to stand as we pray

434
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:42,920
 If you don't feel or if it's easier for you connected God sitting that's fine, too

435
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:48,440
 But if you stand it's kind of a physical prayer, it's basically say we're standing together

436
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:53,760
 Remember, it wasn't just father Olson. It was father Olson and his friends

437
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:59,880
 He gets his name on the rules, but his friends were there as well. It's not any one of us who can do this

438
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:04,760
 We do it together. We do it together here at the vine and also

439
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,720
 None of us can do it without

440
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:13,960
 Jesus Christ or with God's help if we go out and try to do these four things in our own that'll last about two weeks

441
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:18,480
 But if we can start at the end with rule four

442
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,520
 Then what I think we'll find is the others will come

443
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:28,920
 Supernaturally natural so let's pray for that. Let's pray together

444
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:38,560
 So I want to invite you that if there was anything in this

445
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,960
 Message where you felt

446
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:47,440
 really connected and I

447
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,800
 Believe God was speaking during that time. So go there and

448
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:58,760
 Carry on this conversation with God and if you're not a follower of Christ, there may have been something

449
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:03,800
 That spoke to you go there and reflect and think on that

450
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,200
 And cling to God

451
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:13,360
 Jesus is open and available and always with us

452
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:18,680
 And he's ready to answer us as we call out to him

453
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:26,960
 This last Saturday as I was praying not yesterday, but last week was praying for you

454
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:32,280
 And I felt the words from Isaiah coming to me to say this

455
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:38,160
 Before they call I will answer and while they're still speaking I will hear

456
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:44,560
 So before you even call to him today, he's answering if you're speaking to him right now. He is

457
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,360
 hearing you

458
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:54,960
 And if there's one area that you want to be stronger in and you realize that's a character you need to grow in to

459
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,640
 To have more humility to have more courage or whatever

460
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:06,120
 Ask God because we can learn these things and we have the beautiful teacher of the Holy Spirit to teach us

461
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,320
 And we learn together

462
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:18,000
 And if you're in a challenging time

463
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:24,920
 Right now

464
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,880
 With humility just say that to God

465
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:36,880
 And with courage say God I will whatever you want. I will do

466
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,240
