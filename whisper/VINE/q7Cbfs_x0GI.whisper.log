[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.240]   - Thank you, Carla.
[00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.840]   I've loved this series.
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.540]   Week by week, we've received tips,
[00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.460]   biblical examples,
[00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.800]   different voices,
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.440]   but with the same agenda,
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.600]   to help us grow spiritually,
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.020]   to flourish.
[00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.680]   I do hope you've had the chance to check out
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.720]   the Spiritual Foundation Toolkit.
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.760]   It's an excellent resource
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.320]   and takes over where these sermons leave off,
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.400]   so to speak.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.500]   And I get the honor to close this series.
[00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.560]   But I must warn you,
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.440]   I am gonna talk today,
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.200]   I'm gonna talk to you today
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.060]   about a dirty word,
[00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.560]   shock horror, yes.
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.460]   A dirty word.
[00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.380]   And it's this,
[00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.580]   evangelism.
[00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.820]   I know you've been put off by tele-evangelists,
[00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.260]   over-hyped big stadium meetings
[00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.260]   and over-zealous Christians wearing witness t-shirts.
[00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.580]   I saw one this week, very topical,
[00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.020]   given the number of mosquitoes here in Hong Kong.
[00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.260]   And he said this,
[00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.860]   "I want to be so full of Christ
[00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.180]   that if a mosquito bites me,
[00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.740]   it flies away singing,
[00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.580]   'There is power in the blood.'"
[00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:46.220]   The worldwide church has been confused.
[00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.720]   Jesus had risen from the grave,
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.860]   was about to go to the Father
[00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.400]   and giving his disciples instruction
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.380]   as to how the work of the gospel would continue.
[00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.820]   But what we've done is we've taken this verse, Mark 16, 15,
[00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.140]   I'll read it to you.
[00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.720]   He said to them,
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.820]   "Go into all the world
[00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.100]   and preach the gospel to all creation."
[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.960]   But what the church has done,
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.080]   has taken this verse,
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.860]   which describes the call to evangelism
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.260]   and made it seem like it only applies
[00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.740]   to those who we discern have a calling for it,
[00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.440]   those we deem to be evangelists.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.780]   And I'm here today to tell you
[00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.780]   that Mark 16, 15 is not a command just for evangelists,
[00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.440]   but for all believers.
[00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.220]   In simple terms, you.
[00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:05.980]   Sir Irankine evangelist DT Niles simply puts it this,
[00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.980]   "Christianity is one beggar telling another beggar
[00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.620]   where he found bread."
[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.760]   And to demonstrate that,
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.480]   I wanna look at a passage in 2 Kings 7.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.280]   Some background.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.500]   In that story, Jerusalem had been under siege
[00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.360]   and the people were about to die of starvation.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.460]   Meanwhile, we read this, verse three.
[00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:43.600]   They said to each other, "Why stay here until we die?
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.220]   If we say we will go into the city,
[00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.540]   the famine is there and we will die."
[00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.300]   "And if we stay here, we will die."
[00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:01.180]   "So let's go over to the camp of the Arameans and surrender."
[00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.980]   "If they spare us, we live."
[00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.300]   "If they kill us, then we die."
[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.300]   Anyway, they went over to the camp
[00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.080]   and discovered that God had done something
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.360]   to frighten the attackers away,
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.500]   leaving food and precious possessions behind.
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.260]   Let's move on to verse eight.
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.400]   They ate, they drank,
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.600]   and they carried away silver, gold, and clothes,
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.040]   and went off and hid them.
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.900]   They returned and entered another tent
[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.100]   and took some things from it and they hid them also.
[00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.700]   Then they said to each other, "We're not doing right."
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.460]   "This is a day of good news
[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.280]   and we're keeping it to ourselves."
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.280]   "If we wait until the daylight, punishment will overtake us."
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.840]   "Let's go at once and report this to the royal palace."
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.620]   "This is a day of good news
[00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.940]   and we're keeping it to ourselves."
[00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.460]   We are like these beggars.
[00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.340]   Only in our case, we are spiritual beggars
[00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.140]   and we have found spiritual food.
[00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.840]   Then like the lepers, we then decide
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.300]   not to keep this good news to ourselves,
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.640]   but to share it with our starving neighbours.
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.540]   And that is the simplicity of witness.
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:48.180]   Christianity is one beggar telling another beggar
[00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.140]   where he found bread.
[00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:56.140]   Now to demonstrate, I have chosen an unlikely assistant
[00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.660]   to demonstrate how to witness.
[00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.700]   It's "Wall-E."
[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.540]   "Wall-E."
[00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:07.160]   "Wall-E" was a 2008 film, an animated film,
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.440]   starring a robot who is designed to clean up
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.140]   an abandoned waste-covered earth.
[00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.860]   "Now you know me and acronyms, so I'm gonna start with W."
[00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.160]   "W" is for words.
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.020]   "1 Peter 3:15,
[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.220]   'But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord.
[00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.260]   Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone
[00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.380]   who asks you to give the reason to the hope you have.'
[00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:39.540]   This does not mean stand up at your desk and work
[00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:43.940]   and preach a sermon, unless God specifically
[00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.260]   asks you to do that."
[00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.400]   Probably unlikely.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.860]   But I wanna share with you some tips which have helped me.
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:57.300]   I was in the business world longer than I've been a pastor.
[00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.980]   Actually, I was a businessman almost as long
[00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.320]   as I've been a Christian.
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:06.140]   I love Jesse's talk on faith and the workplace.
[00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:07.860]   If you haven't heard it yet,
[00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.240]   I recommend you check it online.
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.100]   Now the trouble with being a pastor,
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:18.060]   most of my time these days is spent mainly with Christians.
[00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.340]   The famous inventor, Thomas Edison says this,
[00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:26.340]   "We often miss opportunity because it is dressed in overalls
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.860]   and looks like work."
[00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:34.860]   Now my first tip is this, fly your flag early.
[00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:39.980]   It is more difficult to do it later on.
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.460]   Now I'm gonna be honest with you.
[00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:44.260]   I used to cheat a little bit.
[00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:49.240]   I used to have a small cross on my jacket.
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.340]   Now that's not for everyone,
[00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:55.460]   but I wanna suggest a few quick ways
[00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.500]   that business people can fly their flag.
[00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.820]   To give you some practical ways you could do this
[00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:05.340]   in the office without making your colleagues feel
[00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:08.040]   they're getting bashed over their head with the Bible.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:11.220]   Try a conversation.
[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.960]   What did you do at the weekend?
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.060]   It gives you a chance to say something
[00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.100]   about being with Christian friends
[00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:25.180]   or a church event without being over religious.
[00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:29.020]   When someone is sick or has a problem,
[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.460]   how can I pray for you?
[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:34.300]   No one says no to prayer.
[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:39.180]   And I had everyone from the tea lady to senior management
[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:42.580]   asking for prayer for all sorts of things.
[00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:44.380]   Be an encourager.
[00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.420]   Don't get drawn into office politics,
[00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:50.100]   backbiting or negative talk.
[00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:55.100]   People will soon notice a difference in you and ask you why.
[00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:58.080]   Again, be gracious in sharing.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.540]   Delay in flying your flag could lead to compromise.
[00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.380]   And then the realisation,
[00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:08.980]   oh, I didn't realise you were one of them.
[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:12.740]   Secondly, make a connection.
[00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:15.920]   Find some common ground.
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:21.440]   People like to talk about things they are interested in.
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.900]   If we show an interest in the things
[00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.760]   that they are interested in,
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:29.120]   they may be more interested in what we have to say.
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.560]   When I was in sales,
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.240]   the first thing I did was look at someone's office,
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.980]   their desk, their bookshelf for clues.
[00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:41.840]   People like to talk about their hobbies, their families.
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.380]   Invite them out for a coffee or a better still happy hour
[00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:50.380]   to get to know them rather than just WhatsApping them
[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:52.780]   with the latest church invitation.
[00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:55.440]   If I take someone out for lunch,
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:59.860]   I always start a conversation with the waiter or waitress.
[00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:04.300]   Learn a few simple words of Chinese, Tagalog, Nepalese.
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.460]   I particularly like Nepalese.
[00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:08.980]   I go into a restaurant, I go, "Namaste."
[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:10.900]   Oh, "Namaste."
[00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:12.860]   And then I go, "Jai Masi," which is,
[00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:15.580]   they say, "Oh, that's a Christian greeting."
[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.860]   I said, "Jai, are you a Christian?"
[00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:21.820]   'Cause we have a lot of Nepalese Christians at our church.
[00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:27.900]   The person who you are with is by this time engaged.
[00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:33.260]   I'd love to go on, but I wanna emphasise thirdly,
[00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.480]   look for opportunities.
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.820]   The Holy Spirit will give you windows.
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:46.120]   20 years ago, one of my team at work knocked on my door
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.320]   and asked me a question.
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.840]   I didn't know at the time she was thinking of leaving.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.920]   She said, "How have you been able to stay
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.320]   at the same company for 25 years?"
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:00.960]   I gave an answer I would not normally recommend.
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.880]   I just said, "Jesus."
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.000]   And that prompted an hour or so of conversation
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.440]   at the end of which she prayed a prayer to receive Christ.
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:14.280]   And I prayed with her to be filled with the Holy Spirit.
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.880]   She came to the Vine.
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.320]   Her name is Wendy Lee.
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.800]   She is still very much part of the Vine.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.440]   I baptised her in Repulse Bay,
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.040]   married her in Union Church
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.680]   and dedicated her son here at the Vine.
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:31.480]   I find aeroplane journeys a great opportunity.
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.800]   Do you remember aeroplanes?
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:33.640]   Yeah.
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:39.080]   You have a person's company for maybe 12 hours.
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.760]   I let it slip around takeoff that I'm a pastor
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.180]   or maybe I'm on my way to a Christian conference
[00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:46.560]   or mission trip.
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:51.560]   The result is either a long and interesting conversation.
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:55.280]   Otherwise, they soon pretend to fall asleep
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.320]   and ignore me for 12 hours.
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:01.800]   Fourthly, know your story.
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:05.240]   No story is better than yours.
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.840]   People can argue about theology
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.960]   but not your personal experience.
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:14.560]   What I mean is this, what I was like before I met Christ,
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.000]   how I met Christ and the difference He has made.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.800]   In mission trip preparation, we do a one minute testimony.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:26.200]   Find a friend somewhere and practise.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.000]   We could call it the elevator pitch.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.760]   But sometimes we don't need to say anything
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.440]   as A is for actions.
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:42.200]   Actions speak louder than words is a popular idiom.
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.760]   People say, "I don't believe what you say,
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.320]   "I believe what you do."
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.280]   All talk, no action.
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.000]   There is a danger when our words and actions
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.360]   don't match up, are inconsistent.
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.120]   The reality of our media driven age
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:01.520]   is where people are saying seems to have such a big impact.
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:05.360]   And oftentimes it's those who are keyboard warriors
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:09.200]   who are shaping the narrative of our cities and culture.
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.160]   I think there is a good reminder for all of us
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.440]   to live less online and more in the real world.
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.560]   To be more of a Christian in our everyday moments
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.840]   than pretending to be one online.
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:27.040]   There's a common Christian expression, go the extra mile.
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.080]   Jesus talked about it in Matthew 5:41.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.840]   Jackie Pullinger says this,
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:36.040]   "God wants us to have soft hearts and hard feet."
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:40.740]   The trouble is so many of us have hard hearts and soft feet.
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.760]   We can be the extra mile people.
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:50.100]   And that follows very nicely into L is for life.
[00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:53.480]   People are put off Christianity,
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:57.040]   not by the person of Christ, but by his followers.
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.160]   That is so sad.
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.240]   Gandhi said this, "I like your Christ.
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.580]   "I do not like your Christians.
[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:07.720]   "Your Christians are so unlike your Christ."
[00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:13.060]   But on the other hand, let me tell you about Joanna Chow.
[00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:16.500]   Joanna Chow at the time was our Vine administrator.
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:20.660]   More than 10 years ago was diagnosed with serious cancer.
[00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:23.260]   I wish I could report that she had been radically healed.
[00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:27.420]   And I know she had and has many struggles.
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:30.180]   But the way she has conducted herself
[00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:33.060]   has led to many of her family members
[00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:35.020]   to give their life to Jesus.
[00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:38.260]   And I know she is praying for the rest.
[00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.000]   The famous American evangelist D.L. Mooney says,
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.920]   "Out of a hundred people, one will read the Bible.
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.740]   "The other 99 will read the Christian."
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:55.580]   Our witness, our witness, our love, our actions,
[00:14:55.580 --> 00:15:01.100]   our words must be always with love.
[00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:04.180]   We cannot give what we haven't received.
[00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:06.180]   We receive to give away.
[00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:08.140]   We're not to be like the Dead Sea,
[00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:09.940]   which feeds nothing.
[00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:12.300]   But the River Jordan bringing life,
[00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:14.660]   it reflects our river model vision.
[00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:21.540]   Those we witness to can never be notches on our belts
[00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:25.740]   or KPIs on our scorecards when they respond.
[00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:27.500]   Paul says that without love,
[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:31.860]   our witness is a noisy gong, a clanging cymbal.
[00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:34.220]   Ask God to pour out His love.
[00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:39.220]   Romans 5:5, "For those in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria,
[00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:41.180]   "and the ends of the earth."
[00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:44.380]   After all, loving people is important,
[00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:47.140]   regardless of whether they end up
[00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:48.860]   saying the sinner's prayer or not.
[00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:52.140]   There is great value in loving people,
[00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:55.100]   regardless of the surface result.
[00:15:55.100 --> 00:16:01.140]   W plus A plus L plus L leads to E, evangelism.
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:05.500]   And I repeat, evangelism is one beggar
[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:10.020]   telling another beggar where to find bread.
[00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:13.140]   And I'm gonna give you all an opportunity
[00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:16.820]   to put this into practise in a simple way.
[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:19.860]   I wanna introduce the alpha opportunity,
[00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:24.420]   one beggar telling another beggar where to find bread.
[00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.940]   And my aim is this, for everyone
[00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:30.060]   who calls the Vyandale Home Church
[00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:35.060]   to invite at least one friend to Online Alpha.
[00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:38.660]   And I want you right now in your mind,
[00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:42.500]   or maybe write it down, think of that friend.
[00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.660]   And we pray in Jesus' Name, all of us,
[00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:47.980]   prayers across the city, across the world,
[00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:49.620]   for that one friend.
[00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:52.660]   We pray, Lord, that You'll give us the grace
[00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:57.660]   and the opportunity to invite them to Online Alpha.
[00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:59.860]   And so I've reached half time.
[00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:03.220]   At this stage, I wanna recommend a stage
[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:08.220]   of going even further, the Spiritual Foundation Toolkit.
[00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:12.140]   It starts off with learning how to prepare
[00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:13.620]   your story and testimony.
[00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:16.720]   It follows some resources in how to start conversations
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.900]   about your faith.
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:19.680]   And there are some simple resources
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.660]   that you can help share with friends
[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:25.020]   and a section on going deeper,
[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:26.900]   a section on how to run Alpha
[00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.540]   and deal with difficult questions.
[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:34.700]   But as we move into the second half today,
[00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:38.660]   you, particularly those of you that know me well,
[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:42.780]   would not expect me to give a talk on evangelism
[00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:47.140]   without at least offering some sort of challenge.
[00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:49.300]   So what I wanna do is attempt to give you
[00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.220]   one of the best biblical examples
[00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:53.980]   on how to make a connection,
[00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:58.220]   but to use it to issue you with a personal challenge.
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:02.340]   And the connection point is in six short words.
[00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:05.180]   Will you give me a drink?
[00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:07.820]   Now I might be in trouble if I started going to stop
[00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:10.020]   to strangers in Hong Kong saying that,
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:11.780]   will you give me a drink?
[00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:14.900]   But in this instance, it led to one of history's
[00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:18.300]   most well-known conversion stories,
[00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:22.720]   which ended up with the words, come see a man.
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:27.720]   Those words were uttered almost 2000 years ago by a woman.
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.120]   She said, come and see a man
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:32.640]   who told me everything I ever did.
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.200]   Could this be the Lord?
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.240]   Could this be the Messiah?
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.800]   John 4, 29.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.760]   She was not just any woman.
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:44.160]   We know her today as the woman at the well.
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.220]   We have no idea of a name,
[00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:51.480]   but what we do know is firstly, she was an outcast.
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.800]   The Samaritans were hated by the Jews
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.440]   regarded as half breeds, pigs.
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:00.400]   What we also know is secondly, she had a questionable past.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.240]   She had had five husbands
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.680]   and was living with a man, not a husband.
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.600]   What we also know is thirdly,
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:11.680]   she had her own ideas about how to worship God.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:15.520]   In fact, for her, it wasn't about how, but where.
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.320]   Samaritans believed that God had to be worshipped
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.640]   on a particular mountain.
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.760]   Now I know that many of us here today
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.520]   may have felt like that in our lives,
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.560]   believing that to worship God,
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:30.600]   we had to go to this church, go to this place of worship,
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:34.200]   or behave in this way, even dress the right way.
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:38.280]   We can maybe all identify with a Samaritan woman,
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:44.520]   but this lady met a man, not just any man,
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:48.080]   not like the men who had abused her,
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.220]   seen her as an object for lust.
[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:54.160]   This man's name was Jesus.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.720]   He had taken a detour just to be there in Sychar
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.720]   at the well to meet her.
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:03.440]   We read that Jesus had to go through Samaria,
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:07.840]   but Jewish people would actually take a long detour
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:10.240]   to avoid going through Samaria.
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.400]   Such was their hatred of each other.
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.200]   So why did he have to go?
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:19.180]   He had to go because this woman was important to him.
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:25.560]   And I need to tell you that Jesus is here on Vine Church
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:30.200]   everywhere today, specifically to meet you.
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.020]   He is here because you are important to him.
[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:35.960]   Now back to the well,
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:39.200]   Jesus' disciples had gone out to buy lunch.
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.480]   We read that Jesus was tired.
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:47.480]   He was fully human and sat down by a well.
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:51.560]   We read when a Samaritan woman came to draw water,
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:56.560]   Jesus said to her, "Will you give me a drink?
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:59.120]   Will you give me a drink?"
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.360]   Now this was wrong.
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:05.880]   Jesus, a Jewish man, talking to a Samaritan,
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:09.280]   talking to a woman, talking to a woman with a past
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.960]   who was probably there at midday
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:13.980]   to avoid being seen by the village gossips.
[00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:17.320]   But you know, it was not about a drink he needed.
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:20.320]   It was all about what she needed.
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.320]   That was the connection point.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:26.000]   That was my Nepalese waitress conversation.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.320]   That was my time with Wendy Lee.
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:33.460]   And we witnessed a most bizarre conversation
[00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:36.500]   about a drink that Jesus didn't really want
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:39.360]   from a woman who didn't think he should be asking her,
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.840]   leading to a discussion which interplays
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:43.960]   between the water from the well
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.620]   and this thing called living water.
[00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:50.300]   Jesus said, she said to Jesus,
[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:53.340]   "I don't know what this living water is,
[00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:57.700]   but it sounds like I should have some."
[00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:01.100]   Here at Jacob's well, after five husbands
[00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:04.180]   and living with a man, after a tragedy,
[00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:06.820]   a lifetime of tragedy and emptiness,
[00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:08.740]   disappointment and discouragement,
[00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:11.240]   sinfulness and spiritual thirst,
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.660]   she finally met a man.
[00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:19.580]   Not a man who took from her, but a man who gave to her.
[00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:22.380]   And what did he give to her?
[00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:27.380]   Life, eternal life, living water.
[00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:31.140]   Jesus said, if she drank the water from the well,
[00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:34.380]   she would be thirsty again in no time,
[00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:36.340]   especially in the midday humidity.
[00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.020]   I can understand that.
[00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:42.240]   Then Jesus said, if she drank this living water,
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.820]   she would never go thirsty again.
[00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:48.880]   No wonder she ran to the city and proclaimed to the men,
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.660]   the women wouldn't listen to her,
[00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:53.700]   "Come and see a man."
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:58.700]   Almost 2000 years later, on 28th of March, 2021,
[00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:04.860]   I say to you today, come and see a man.
[00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:09.860]   I wanna introduce to you my best friend, Jesus.
[00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:12.480]   You see, when this woman came to the well,
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.400]   she was a woman with a past.
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:18.240]   As she left the well and went back to the town,
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.880]   she was a woman with a future.
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:25.040]   You may have logged into church everywhere today
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.920]   as someone with a past.
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.120]   To be honest, we've all done things
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.680]   that we know to be wrong.
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:34.640]   The Bible tells us this very clearly.
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.560]   But there is good news.
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:40.400]   The Jesus who met the woman at the well is here.
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:43.480]   His Holy Spirit is present and wants to meet you.
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:44.640]   He wants to fill you.
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.960]   And He wants to send you away from this meeting
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:49.120]   on Facebook Live or YouTube,
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:53.400]   not as someone with a past, but as someone with a future.
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:54.960]   He has a plan for your life,
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:57.600]   no matter how good or bad you've been,
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:00.040]   whether you've been going to church all of your life,
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:02.680]   or this is the first time you've ever logged in
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:04.520]   to a Christian website.
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:05.600]   He says one word.
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:07.440]   Come.
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.040]   Come.
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:12.760]   Come as you are.
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:16.200]   Don't wait until you think you're good enough.
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.260]   You will never be good enough.
[00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:20.640]   But there is just one thing.
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:23.000]   And it's a big thing.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   He wants all of you.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.520]   The Bible says, if you cling onto your life,
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.880]   you will lose it.
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:34.780]   But if you give up your life for me, you will find it.
[00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:37.660]   My friend, you have a choice.
[00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:42.900]   Hold on to your old life.
[00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:45.900]   I understand it.
[00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:48.340]   You love it so much, you don't want to change.
[00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:51.340]   We become comfortable.
[00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:54.660]   Even in our sinful ways, we become comfortable.
[00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:57.660]   But the Bible says, if we want to cling onto our past,
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:00.260]   our guilt, our shame, it's a no-win.
[00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:03.060]   The woman of the world could have done that.
[00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:05.060]   She could have resisted the free gift
[00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:08.100]   of what Jesus described as living water.
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:10.960]   But Jesus says today, come.
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:15.100]   If you want to be like the woman at the well,
[00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:18.700]   be a person who arrived online with a past,
[00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:22.020]   and you want to log off as a person with a future,
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.780]   I'm gonna ask you to take that small step.
[00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:26.940]   Come and see a man.
[00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:29.340]   I'm not gonna promise you a life
[00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:32.580]   that is free from trouble, a bed of roses.
[00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:36.580]   But what I will promise you is freedom from your past,
[00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:39.740]   your wrongdoings forgiven, the love of the Father,
[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:42.300]   the presence and the filling of the Holy Spirit
[00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:45.820]   to lead you and the gift of eternal life.
[00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:48.780]   And a relationship with a God who says,
[00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:50.860]   I will never leave you.
[00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:53.060]   I will never forsake you.
[00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:55.700]   The next few minutes could determine
[00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:59.140]   where you spend eternity, and that's a long time,
[00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:04.780]   and how you spend the rest of your life here on earth.
[00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:09.780]   And maybe not just you, but also the friends
[00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:14.660]   that each one of us is going to invite to Alpha.
[00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:18.780]   If I may, can I ask you just to close your eyes
[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:19.980]   wherever you are?
[00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:22.980]   And I'm gonna give you that opportunity now,
[00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:26.740]   the opportunity that Jesus gave to that lady at the well.
[00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:28.140]   Come and see a man.
[00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:32.100]   Today on this Palm Sunday,
[00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:35.020]   what a day to say goodbye to your past
[00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:38.340]   and hello to my future.
[00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:41.500]   Let's pray together.
[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:48.300]   Father God, I come to You now as somebody who has a past.
[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:52.460]   I have done things in my life I am ashamed of.
[00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:55.660]   I have done things in my life I know are wrong.
[00:26:56.220 --> 00:27:01.220]   I believe that You sent Jesus to die for me upon the cross,
[00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:06.900]   to forgive my sins, to give me a hope and a future.
[00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:12.860]   Lord Jesus, I give You my life now.
[00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:15.700]   I'm not perfect, Lord.
[00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:22.320]   I give You what I have and ask You, Lord, to take my life,
[00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:27.820]   forgive my sins, fill me with Your Spirit
[00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:33.100]   that I might receive this living water.
[00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:40.200]   Help me today, Lord, not just to receive You for myself,
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:45.140]   but to share You with those around me.
[00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:47.080]   I pray now for those I work with,
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:50.740]   those I travel on the bus or the MTR with,
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:53.240]   for my family, for my friends.
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:56.740]   I pray one day, Lord,
[00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:01.200]   we will see them all face to face in heaven,
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:06.380]   looking back to the day when we said to them,
[00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:08.740]   come and see a man.
[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:12.740]   I pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:16.180]   Amen.
[00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:20.980]   I realise we're not all face to face today.
[00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:23.340]   I'm gonna ask you just a couple of things
[00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:24.660]   for those who responded.
[00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:26.660]   If you prayed that prayer,
[00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:28.700]   particularly if you prayed it for the first time,
[00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:30.060]   please tell someone.
[00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:34.220]   It doesn't matter who that person is to an extent,
[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:37.980]   but please tell someone that you prayed that prayer.
[00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:40.620]   Secondly, for those who are watching online,
[00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:41.740]   we have a chat box.
[00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:45.220]   And if you just type the word, yes, Y-E-S,
[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:46.660]   into the chat box,
[00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:50.720]   one of our pastors will spend that time with you,
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:54.660]   will come back and help you on the next steps
[00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:55.860]   that you have to make.
[00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:59.820]   So firstly, tell someone.
[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:04.660]   Secondly, if you're online, put Y-E-S in the chat box.
[00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:07.280]   And thirdly, if you're watching the recording,
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:08.620]   we have these connect cards
[00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:10.100]   and you'll see a QR code appearing
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:11.900]   on the screen at the moment.
[00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:14.340]   Fill in that connect card
[00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:17.540]   and we would love to contact with you,
[00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:19.180]   love to invite you on Alpha.
[00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:22.240]   There's lots of things in store for you.
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.740]   But for all of you who prayed that prayer,
[00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:27.980]   God bless you.
[00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:30.920]   This is the first day of the rest of your life.
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:32.540]   And you leave here today,
[00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:34.340]   not as a person with a past,
[00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:36.980]   but a person with a future.
[00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:39.860]   And for the rest of us,
[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:42.580]   let's go into the whole world
[00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:46.300]   to share the good news of Jesus Christ.
[00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:49.180]   Amen.
