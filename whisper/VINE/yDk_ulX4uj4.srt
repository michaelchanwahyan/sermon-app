1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
 Good morning, everyone, how are you?

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:06,080
 You, oh, real human beings.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,400
 You are alive?

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,240
 Yes.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,440
 I cannot, I cannot describe to you

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,320
 how uninteractive it is to speak to a camera.

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,420
 And I am so excited that you are breathing,

8
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,480
 hopefully into your mask and not onto anyone else.

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,640
 But you're in this room.

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,140
 You are, you could do anything today and I will love you.

11
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,080
 You could fall asleep on me

12
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,600
 and I will love you for being here, okay?

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,800
 That's not an excuse to fall asleep,

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,620
 but I'm just letting you know

15
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:40,880
 that that is what you could do.

16
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,080
 I am also so glad you are online right now too.

17
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,020
 And our hearts do go out to everybody here.

18
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,560
 We know that right now this vaccine pass is not ideal.

19
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,840
 It is something that we understand.

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,280
 We know that a number of you watching

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,400
 are not able to attend in-person services right now.

22
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,640
 And we love you, you are a part of church.

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,040
 We are church both here and online.

24
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,760
 In fact, why doesn't everybody turn around,

25
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,160
 stare at the camera that is right there

26
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,760
 and give everybody a wave and say, "Hey, I love you."

27
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,840
 I love you, right?

28
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,600
 And I know 'cause I know cameras, they're waving back.

29
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,240
 I can tell that, I can tell that.

30
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,120
 I'm so excited.

31
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,760
 As I was praying about how do we come together today

32
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,960
 on this day where we reopen for in-person services,

33
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,080
 I felt strongly the Holy Spirit say, just put on pause

34
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,400
 the act series, our series called "The Unfinished Story."

35
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,000
 We're gonna put that on pause for a few weeks

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,360
 because I wanted to speak into some things

37
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,200
 that I think are really important for us to grapple with,

38
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,120
 wrestle with as we come back into this emerging

39
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,240
 out of the fifth wave

40
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,560
 that we've all been battling right here.

41
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,000
 And I'm calling this, I'm gonna do three weeks with you

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,920
 back to back on this, and we're calling it "Reopened."

43
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,560
 And I know that sounds cheesy

44
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,040
 'cause we're reopening right now

45
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,820
 and we're reopening as a society.

46
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,780
 But here's my thought for each one of us.

47
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,400
 The worst thing that can happen

48
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,080
 is that we reopen our society with closed hearts.

49
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,800
 And I don't know about you,

50
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,840
 but it's been a pretty rough two or three months.

51
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,600
 It's been some pretty tough things that have happened.

52
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,760
 There's been a lot of emotions

53
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,720
 that I'm sure you in this room are holding.

54
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,440
 I'll be honest, there's been a lot of emotions in me

55
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,040
 which you would perhaps classify as not particularly godly.

56
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,060
 There's things I've struggled with,

57
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,300
 anger I've wrestled with,

58
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,180
 opinions that I've had about people,

59
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,800
 judgements that I've made about the government

60
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,460
 and things around me.

61
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,660
 There is stuff that has gone on in my heart.

62
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,820
 And the worst thing that could happen

63
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,100
 is to think that we're now reopened

64
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,460
 and yet there's closure in here.

65
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,300
 And so I wanna take this next three weeks

66
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:48,300
 to speak to you about how you need to reopen your spirit

67
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,620
 as we emerge out of the fifth wave.

68
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,440
 Because what I do not want is a church.

69
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,840
 And by that, I mean the big C, the Church of Hong Kong,

70
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,880
 to be filled with people

71
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,920
 who are happy that the restrictions are down,

72
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,340
 but are still angry and bitter at everything else.

73
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,160
 I think we need a revival in our spirits

74
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,700
 and we need to be opened again

75
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,840
 to the things that the Holy Spirit is doing in this here

76
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,720
 and this now, and is anybody here?

77
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,880
 Cameras do not say amen.

78
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,360
 Just pointing that out at the start of my message

79
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,640
 in case you want to not be a camera today.

80
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,080
 In Jesus name.

81
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,260
 I'm gonna go to,

82
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,840
 I wanna frame what I'm speaking about today

83
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,760
 by reading one of my favourite passages of scripture.

84
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,080
 It's a story from Luke.

85
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,360
 Luke is the master storyteller.

86
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,920
 I preach a lot from the gospel of Luke

87
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,640
 and I wanna preach from my favourite story in Luke.

88
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,320
 I'm like, this is my first Sunday back

89
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,840
 to preach to real human beings.

90
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,200
 I'm gonna go to my favourite story

91
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,400
 and preach the heck out of it.

92
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,680
 Are you all right with that?

93
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,140
 Okay, so.

94
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:03,200
 I'm so excited, okay.

95
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,040
 Luke 7, starting at verse 36, says this.

96
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,380
 Now, one of the Pharisees invited Jesus

97
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,960
 to have dinner with him.

98
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,760
 So he went to the Pharisee's house and reclined at the table.

99
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,960
 When a woman who had lived a sinful life in that town

100
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,360
 learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee's house,

101
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,400
 she brought an alabaster jar of perfume.

102
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,720
 And as she stood behind him at his feet weeping,

103
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,080
 she began to wet his feet with her tears.

104
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,440
 Then she wiped them with her long hair,

105
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,700
 kissed them and poured perfume on them.

106
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:43,320
 Now, when the Pharisee who had invited Jesus saw this,

107
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,120
 this is what he said to himself.

108
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,080
 Well, if this man was truly a prophet,

109
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,920
 he would know who it is that is touching him right now,

110
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,820
 what kind of woman she is, that she's a sinner.

111
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:00,320
 Not the first time in history that a man has judged a woman.

112
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:06,980
 Jesus answered her, "Simon, I've got something to tell you."

113
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,200
 You know you're in trouble with Jesus

114
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,840
 when he says something like that to you, by the way.

115
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,140
 Andrew, I got something to tell you.

116
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,400
 Let me tell you a story, Andrew, about your life, right?

117
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,920
 "Simon, I got something to tell you.

118
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,840
 Teach me or tell me, teacher," he said.

119
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,160
 Well, there are two men

120
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,600
 and they owed money to a certain money lender.

121
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,380
 One owed 500 denarii and the other owed 50.

122
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,800
 Now, neither of them had the money to pay them back.

123
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,600
 So he cancelled the debts of both of them.

124
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,680
 Now, here's the question, which of them will love him more?

125
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,200
 Simon reluctantly perhaps replied,

126
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,820
 "Well, I suppose the one who had the bigger debt cancelled."

127
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:50,360
 "You have judged correctly," Jesus said.

128
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,500
 And then he turned towards the woman and he said to Simon,

129
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,880
 "Do you see this woman?

130
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,880
 I came into your house

131
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,120
 and you did not give me any water for my feet,

132
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,240
 but she wet my feet with her tears

133
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,360
 and wiped them with her hair.

134
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,880
 You did not give me a kiss,

135
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,960
 but this woman from the time that I entered

136
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,920
 has not stopped kissing my feet.

137
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,320
 You did not put oil on my head,

138
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,880
 but she has poured perfume on my feet.

139
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,360
 Therefore, I tell you, her many sins,"

140
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,440
 notice this, "she has and had many sins.

141
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,720
 There are many sins, they are forgiven.

142
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:29,360
 For she loved much,

143
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,240
 but he who has been forgiven little," note this,

144
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,280
 loves little.

145
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,360
 Then Jesus said these words to her,

146
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,840
 "Your sins are forgiven."

147
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,600
 Father, as we open up this passage this morning,

148
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,400
 I am so grateful that we are emerging here

149
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,440
 in this fifth wave, that we are reopening society.

150
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,760
 We're grateful that we can gather in person in this room

151
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,580
 as well as online in this moment.

152
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,640
 But Father, we want to capture what is on your heart

153
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,240
 in this season and in this time.

154
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,360
 Lord, I believe you've got a word in season for us

155
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,800
 as a church.

156
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,360
 And as we open up this incredible story

157
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,340
 of a woman, Father, I want to pray

158
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,320
 that you would open our hearts.

159
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,480
 Lord, I believe that each one of us,

160
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,800
 myself included in this room,

161
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,200
 we need to be reopened today

162
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:21,200
 to your tender and yet focused move of your Spirit in us.

163
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,560
 Father, would you come by your Spirit, move upon us all.

164
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,720
 And we thank you for this.

165
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,640
 And everybody in the room and online says,

166
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:35,000
 "When I was nine years old,

167
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,400
 I woke up in the middle of the night

168
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,080
 with the worst stomach ache I had ever experienced.

169
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,240
 It was excruciating pain.

170
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,660
 It was so painful that I wondered

171
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,740
 whether I would still be able to continue to breathe.

172
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,320
 And it was the middle of the night

173
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,120
 and my parents' bedroom was down the corridor from mine.

174
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,960
 And I fell out of bed and I walked as gingerly

175
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,120
 like this as possible to my parents' bedroom.

176
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,300
 I opened the door and I walked in

177
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:09,080
 and my mom's there snoring and I shake her.

178
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,160
 And she grudgingly kind of like wakes up

179
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,160
 and I'm like, "Mom, my stomach's on fire."

180
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,560
 Now, if you're a parent in this room,

181
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,840
 you will know that there is a universal thing

182
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,520
 that takes place in kids

183
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,080
 when they want to get a day off school.

184
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,480
 And that universal thing is to pretend

185
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,120
 they have a stomach ache,

186
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,040
 because you can never prove

187
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,340
 whether they have the stomach ache or not.

188
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,020
 And it's a good one for kids.

189
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,160
 And parents know this the world over.

190
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,480
 And at midnight, my mom turns over

191
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,160
 and through her sleepy eyes, and she says,

192
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,560
 (moans)

193
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,480
 She was at the first service, by the way, it was classic.

194
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,320
 Anyway.

195
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,520
 (moans)

196
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,560
 And you, if you're still feeling funny in the morning,

197
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,280
 we'll talk about it then.

198
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,360
 (snores)

199
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,620
 I get back to my bedroom for an hour.

200
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,560
 I try to sleep.

201
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,520
 I can't sleep.

202
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,640
 My stomach is literally on fire.

203
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,940
 I'm having trouble breathing.

204
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,240
 I'm in so much pain.

205
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,840
 About an hour later, I fall out of the bed.

206
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,640
 This time I crawl to my parents' bedroom.

207
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,880
 I open the door.

208
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,120
 I scream as loud as I can

209
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,800
 and dramatically fall on my back

210
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,240
 in the middle of the bedroom.

211
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,280
 My parents figured that

212
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,000
 there must be actually something wrong with me.

213
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,580
 So they scoop me up in their hands.

214
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,620
 They go to the car.

215
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,040
 We drive to the nearest hospital to the A and E.

216
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,880
 The doctor takes one look at me and he goes,

217
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,080
 "I think you've got a problem with your appendix."

218
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,260
 And my parents are like, "I guess it's not about school."

219
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,220
 (audience laughs)

220
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,020
 And the doctor said, "We're gonna have to take you now

221
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,940
 into emergency surgery."

222
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,760
 And they give me this drug called codeine,

223
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,460
 which is supposed to kill pain,

224
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,380
 but it made me feel even weirder and worse.

225
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,740
 And they rushed me straight into surgery.

226
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,800
 They remove my appendix.

227
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,540
 They zip me back up.

228
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,400
 Apparently they said to my parents just a little bit later

229
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,180
 that if they hadn't removed my appendix that hour,

230
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,140
 I would have died 'cause it would have ruptured.

231
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:05,720
 Couple of hours later, I wake up in the hospital room

232
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,280
 and minus my appendix.

233
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,760
 And I'm still in a huge amount of pain.

234
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,240
 And I'm still feeling really strange.

235
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,360
 And there's just a lot of pain in this air.

236
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,760
 And I say to the doctors, "I'm still in pain."

237
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,240
 And they think that's weird.

238
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,040
 And so they're like, "Well, give him some more codeine,

239
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,880
 this drug."

240
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,000
 And so they pump more codeine into me.

241
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,280
 Now, I suddenly find out a few hours later

242
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,080
 that I'm allergic to codeine.

243
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,980
 Now, this is the thing about allergies.

244
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:34,860
 What is it about?

245
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,680
 Why did God create allergies?

246
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,520
 Here's the weird thing about allergies.

247
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,320
 You only know you're allergic

248
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,680
 when you actually have the thing that you're allergic to.

249
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,600
 Are you with me?

250
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,680
 Like babies should be born with a list.

251
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,480
 Here are all the things Andrew was allergic to.

252
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,080
 Please avoid these for the rest of his life.

253
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,200
 That's not the way it works, right?

254
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,800
 So they pump all this drug into me, this codeine,

255
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,520
 and my body's allergic to it.

256
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,360
 We didn't know it.

257
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,240
 We find that out.

258
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,240
 My whole body erupts in pain, ejecting this drug.

259
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,320
 And what should have been a relatively easy fix

260
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,880
 meant that there was so much trauma

261
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,000
 in the area that my appendix had been in,

262
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,520
 and in the drugs that had been now in my system,

263
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,520
 that I was for five days in desperate fight for my life.

264
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,400
 My mom and dad would visit me in the hospital,

265
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,240
 and I would walk down to try to get some exercise

266
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,060
 when I was feeling up to it.

267
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,840
 I had my IV drip and I was wearing one of those smocks

268
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,240
 that has open in the back, right?

269
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,760
 It wasn't a good sign.

270
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,880
 I was nine years old walking around the hospital.

271
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,800
 My parents thought I was an old man.

272
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,720
 They walked past me the first time they came to visit me.

273
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,760
 I was in so much pain.

274
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,000
 There was so much need for healing in the trauma

275
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,720
 of the area where the appendix had been removed.

276
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,640
 But after about six days or so,

277
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,840
 I was released from the hospital and I went home,

278
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,200
 but I still wasn't feeling myself.

279
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,460
 And it was about another month or so

280
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,460
 before I returned to my full health,

281
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,100
 before I really felt like myself again.

282
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:05,200
 The whole experience was absolutely harrowing.

283
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,680
 It was a harrowing experience,

284
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,060
 but I learned in it a valuable life lesson.

285
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,580
 And as I was praying about what it is

286
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,660
 that we need to talk about,

287
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,860
 that we need to speak about

288
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,260
 as we reopen our in-person services,

289
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,780
 as the city reopens out of this fifth wave,

290
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:24,000
 it was this life lesson that the Lord led me to.

291
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,120
 And it's a life lesson I wanna share with you now.

292
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,800
 It's this, that the removal of the problem

293
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,220
 is not necessarily the healing.

294
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,760
 Come on, church.

295
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,760
 The removal of the problem is not necessarily the healing.

296
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,040
 For the appendix, which had almost ruptured,

297
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,560
 that was inflamed and was bad,

298
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,640
 needed to be removed from me.

299
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,140
 And it was, but that wasn't actually

300
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,420
 the fullness of my healing.

301
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,020
 That appendix had created so much trauma

302
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,820
 in the other organs around it.

303
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,340
 And the drugs that they had put in me

304
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:02,100
 had created such a dramatic experience in me

305
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,300
 that my healing journey was a much longer journey

306
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,220
 than simply removing the one thing that was the problem

307
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,100
 that had kick-started all the things

308
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,140
 that were happening in my body.

309
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,380
 And I realised in that experience

310
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,760
 that so often we forget this in life.

311
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,580
 We think that if we just remove the problem,

312
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,380
 then everything else is gonna go fine.

313
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,820
 That we don't realise that actually

314
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,660
 when the appendix is taken,

315
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,260
 there's still a journey of dealing with the trauma

316
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,940
 that is inside of us.

317
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,820
 We need to understand that the experience of our healing

318
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,540
 and the place of our hope

319
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,700
 is not found in the removal of the problem.

320
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:46,300
 It's found in processing the trauma caused by the problem.

321
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,620
 Come on cameras, wake up.

322
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,380
 I need you with me.

323
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,500
 Amen.

324
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,740
 It's actually found in the processing of the trauma

325
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,980
 that the problem caused in the first place.

326
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,200
 And we gather here today, man, I'm excited.

327
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,820
 We're celebrating.

328
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,740
 We're celebrating that because of the lifting

329
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,020
 of some social distancing measures.

330
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,900
 We're able now to gather in person if we're vaccinated.

331
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,140
 We're celebrating the reality

332
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,100
 that actually the government is changing

333
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,860
 some of the travel restrictions,

334
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,300
 that we only have seven days now in quarantine

335
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,340
 rather than 21.

336
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,340
 Gonna have an amen for that.

337
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,940
 We just heard this week, come on babies.

338
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,580
 We just heard this week that in May,

339
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,820
 foreigners will be able to come to Hong Kong.

340
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,020
 So if you've got family that live overseas,

341
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,180
 they can now come to Hong Kong

342
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,020
 if they're willing to have seven days in a hotel

343
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,500
 and be a part of us again.

344
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,100
 That's good news.

345
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,020
 We're also knowing and seeing

346
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,100
 that COVID cases are coming down every day.

347
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,220
 We're now just seeing a couple of hundred cases.

348
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,340
 That's a great thing.

349
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:49,220
 A lot of businesses have reopened and this is so good.

350
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,820
 We have a lot of small business owners

351
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,240
 in our community here at the Vine,

352
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,380
 people that own gyms and restaurants.

353
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,920
 Those things now are open again.

354
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,340
 Restaurants can go into the night.

355
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,220
 We can all eat dinner together again.

356
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,900
 Four of us looking at each other in the eyes without masks.

357
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,500
 This is all good stuff that we celebrate,

358
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,340
 but here's the danger.

359
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,460
 The danger is in all of that celebration,

360
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,380
 we think that the removal of the problem

361
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,260
 is where our healing happens.

362
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,500
 It's where we think that if Hong Kong

363
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,260
 can just lift the social distancing restrictions,

364
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,500
 if COVID could just go away,

365
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,460
 that I will enter back into another stage

366
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,860
 of flourishing of life.

367
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,140
 And the reality is there's trauma you need to process.

368
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:33,500
 The reality is there's stuff that's going on

369
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,760
 in each one of us.

370
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,380
 It's been a difficult three years

371
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:41,380
 from the summer of 2019 to now.

372
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,860
 It's been a really hard time.

373
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,940
 And each one of us in this room,

374
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:48,100
 we're dealing with hardship, with anxiety, grief,

375
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,620
 things that we're struggling with,

376
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,180
 anger, frustration, fear.

377
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,640
 We're wondering where our future is.

378
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,380
 Some of us are wondering, do we stay in Hong Kong or not?

379
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,000
 We're wrestling with the government,

380
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,080
 wondering when things might change,

381
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,220
 when actually restrictions and things might shift.

382
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:06,700
 We're in a place where we're feeling all of those emotions

383
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,300
 and we have to be super careful

384
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,880
 that we don't equate our flourishing

385
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,740
 to the decision of some change

386
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,540
 in some social distancing measures.

387
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,820
 Because if we do that, here's what will happen.

388
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:21,340
 We will reopen society with closed hearts.

389
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:27,260
 We will reopen Hong Kong with traumatic, broken people,

390
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,380
 people in desperate need of more than just

391
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,800
 less than 14 days in a hotel quarantine,

392
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,960
 people who are actually in need

393
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,280
 of the thing that we gather here today to celebrate,

394
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:47,120
 the Spirit of God working in us,

395
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,080
 renewing, redeeming, and filling us and changing us.

396
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,040
 And the question we should have is,

397
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,840
 how do we receive that kind of healing?

398
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,920
 'Cause I don't know about you,

399
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,320
 but I don't wanna put a band-aid on my COVID trauma.

400
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,340
 I don't wanna just think that I can zip it up,

401
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:07,160
 remove the appendix and everything's gonna be fine.

402
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,800
 I wanna dig into the realities

403
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,040
 that I know that my emotions go deeper than that.

404
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,600
 I know the things that I've been frustrated

405
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,440
 and angry with go deeper than that.

406
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,000
 And Lord, if you don't heal that,

407
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,920
 I might be freer in society,

408
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,020
 but I am still bound in chains inside of me.

409
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,960
 I wonder if anybody else might feel

410
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,660
 a bit like that in the room today.

411
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:33,440
 How do we not put a band-aid on our COVID trauma?

412
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,120
 Well, I think the story we're looking at today

413
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,120
 gives us some answers to that.

414
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,960
 It's one of my favourite stories, as I said earlier,

415
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,280
 I love this moment.

416
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,880
 Luke is a master storyteller,

417
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,500
 and he tells this story so beautifully.

418
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,480
 It's a story of two individuals

419
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,020
 that could not be more different.

420
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,760
 We're introduced to the first, he's a Pharisee.

421
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,080
 His name is Simon.

422
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,680
 If you wanna think about the male privilege

423
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,080
 of the first century, Simon is your man.

424
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,160
 He's a man of power in the story.

425
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,960
 He's a law-abiding Pharisee, a good guy.

426
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,840
 He's the guy that all the other Jews look up to

427
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,280
 and wanna emulate.

428
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,760
 He's the person that people look to

429
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,680
 as the ones that will bring in the Messiah

430
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,040
 whenever the Messiah arrives.

431
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,640
 The Pharisees were loved for their obedience to the law

432
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,900
 and the way that they operated in society.

433
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,160
 And they were looked up to and worshipped.

434
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,560
 And here's Simon.

435
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,400
 He's opened up his home to welcome in

436
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,600
 this travelling rabbi, Jesus.

437
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:33,600
 And Luke contrasts this power man, Simon, with a woman.

438
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:40,480
 The woman is never named in the story.

439
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,680
 It's interesting, right?

440
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,080
 And Luke introduces us to her

441
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,240
 by telling us one simple thing.

442
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,480
 She had lived a sinful life in that town.

443
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,120
 That's the way he describes her.

444
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,000
 She's lived a sinful life in that town.

445
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,880
 Here's the thing you need to know.

446
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,400
 The word that Luke uses for sinful here is a rare word.

447
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,280
 There's actually a number of Greek words for sin or sinful.

448
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,280
 This one is one of the rarest words.

449
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,400
 And Luke, although he uses the word sin a lot

450
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,200
 in both Luke and Acts, it's only used twice.

451
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,760
 This particular version is only ever used twice by Luke.

452
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,480
 The other time that it's used, other than this story,

453
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,220
 is when Peter first comes into contact with Jesus.

454
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,120
 That moment when Peter's on the boat

455
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,680
 and they fished all night and Jesus is sitting there

456
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,040
 and he says, "Throw the nets on the other side of the boat."

457
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,840
 And the fishermen, including Peter, are like,

458
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,000
 "Dude, we're the fishermen, you're a wandering rabbi.

459
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,960
 "We've been fishing all night.

460
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,800
 "What do you mean?"

461
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,760
 He's like, "Just throw your nets on the other side."

462
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,760
 They throw their nets on the other side.

463
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,440
 They cannot pull the nets in

464
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,120
 because of the massive catch of fish.

465
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,720
 And here's Peter's reaction.

466
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,880
 He knows in that moment that this Jesus

467
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,680
 is who he says he is.

468
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,380
 He knows he's a prophet.

469
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,820
 He knows he's greater than anyone he's ever met.

470
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,780
 And Peter's sitting there facing Jesus, he says this.

471
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:01,020
 He says, "Get away from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man."

472
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,140
 It's the same word, sinful.

473
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,060
 The word in Greek means this.

474
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,980
 It means I recognise I've done some wrong things

475
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,680
 in the past and I have remorse of them.

476
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,580
 That's specifically what this word means.

477
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,620
 And Luke takes that word and applies it to the woman

478
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:20,040
 right up front because he's trying to teach you something.

479
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,200
 He wants you to know right at the start of his story

480
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,440
 that this woman has done some bad things in her past.

481
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,640
 She feels remorse for them

482
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,360
 and she is not now defined by them.

483
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:36,560
 He wants you not to judge her on the actions of her past.

484
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,720
 He wants you to see what she does in the present.

485
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,800
 And this is really interesting

486
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,000
 'cause church history has got this wrong.

487
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,840
 Church history that is mostly written by men

488
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,660
 have declared that this woman is a prostitute.

489
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,500
 That's what most commentaries will tell you

490
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,340
 if you read a commentary about this story.

491
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,660
 They'll say, "Well, this woman was obviously a prostitute."

492
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,720
 It's the same word applied to Peter.

493
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,120
 So are we saying that Peter's also a prostitute?

494
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,900
 Maybe.

495
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,220
 (congregation laughing)

496
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:11,100
 It's my staff over there, so proud of them.

497
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,260
 (congregation laughing)

498
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,220
 So proud.

499
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,500
 Bible school.

500
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,840
 But I want you to catch this, right?

501
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,080
 Catch this, come with me.

502
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,520
 Luke is trying to tell this story

503
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,320
 so that we're not judging this woman

504
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,600
 based on some past expectation.

505
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,120
 There's nothing in this text

506
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,440
 that says she's a sexual sinner at all.

507
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,440
 It just says she's done some bad things in her past.

508
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,000
 She feels remorse for them.

509
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,760
 What he wants you to focus on

510
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,200
 is what she does in that moment.

511
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,040
 And in verses 37 and 38, he unpacks that for you.

512
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,680
 He says, "Oh, she comes in.

513
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,280
 She hears Jesus is in town.

514
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,600
 She rushes into the house.

515
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,840
 She's not invited.

516
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,040
 She goes straight in and she goes to his feet

517
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,840
 'cause he's reclining at a table.

518
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,920
 And she wets his feet with her tears

519
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,000
 and she wipes them with her hair.

520
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,240
 And she kisses him all the time on his feet.

521
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,720
 And she pours this expensive perfume on him.

522
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,560
 Why?

523
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,040
 Because she's worshipping.

524
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,520
 She's not doing something sexual.

525
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,240
 She's not trying to seduce him.

526
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,760
 She's not trying to be intimate.

527
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,920
 This is worship, gratitude.

528
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,600
 The expression of the love that is so abundant

529
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,880
 that she will break tradition.

530
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,880
 She wasn't supposed to be in the room.

531
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,680
 She was not invited as a woman to that room.

532
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:29,680
 She did not care because she had to say, "Thank you."

533
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,800
 I love it.

534
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:37,140
 Church history calls her the sinful woman.

535
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,380
 I refuse to call somebody the name

536
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,700
 of something they've done in the past,

537
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,920
 but I wanna call people based on who they are today.

538
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,240
 She's not the sinful woman.

539
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,960
 She's the anointing woman.

540
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,120
 Are you with me?

541
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,640
 Can we hear her roar?

542
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,920
 Simon failed to hear her roar.

543
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,320
 Simon, in fact, saw what she did.

544
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,800
 And although he doesn't say anything out loud,

545
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,640
 Luke captures for us what he says in his head.

546
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,080
 He basically goes like this.

547
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:08,920
 He's like, "Pfft.

548
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,440
 "I can't believe this woman.

549
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,600
 "I mean, if Jesus truly was a prophet,

550
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,160
 "if this guy really was who he claims to be,

551
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,900
 "who the crowds claim him to be,

552
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,360
 "he would know the kind of woman

553
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,020
 "that is touching his feet right now.

554
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,840
 "He would know that she is a sinner."

555
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,200
 Which is really interesting 'cause Simon in that moment

556
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,740
 is not just judging the woman based on her past behaviour

557
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,640
 or her reputation in the town.

558
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,160
 He's judging Jesus as well.

559
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,360
 Are you following me?

560
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,920
 He's judging both people in the same time.

561
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,200
 He's cynical, he's judgmental,

562
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,080
 and he's reaching out in that negative judgmentalism.

563
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:52,080
 And Jesus knows this, which is the irony of the story.

564
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,440
 The man doesn't think that Jesus is a prophet.

565
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,920
 Jesus is about to prove that he really is a prophet

566
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,220
 'cause he knows exactly what Simon's thinking.

567
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,400
 And you need to understand this,

568
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,240
 that the sinner at this mill is not the woman,

569
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,080
 but it's Simon.

570
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,900
 'Cause Simon is the one who's judging.

571
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,080
 Simon is the one who's feeling pride in his heart.

572
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,920
 Simon is the one who's casting judgment

573
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,360
 on somebody's actions.

574
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,040
 And Jesus understands all of this.

575
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,580
 And so Jesus does whatever Jesus does best.

576
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:27,060
 And that is, let me tell you a story.

577
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:30,480
 And he tells him the story about this guy,

578
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,440
 this money lender.

579
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,280
 He gives out this money

580
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,960
 and there's this big debt and small debt.

581
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,120
 And then he cancels the debts

582
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,520
 of everybody he's given money to.

583
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:40,000
 And he asked Simon, "Who is going to be more happy?

584
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,520
 Who is going to love this money lender more?"

585
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:46,840
 And Simon, by this point, realises he is in a corner.

586
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,080
 He realises Jesus has got the better of him.

587
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:56,720
 And he says to him, "Well, I suppose the one

588
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,040
 who got the greater debt cancelled."

589
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,080
 And Jesus says these cheeky words.

590
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,080
 This is cheeky Jesus.

591
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,800
 I love cheeky Jesus.

592
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,600
 Jesus says this, "You have judged correctly

593
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,640
 for the first time tonight,

594
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,640
 'cause you've been judging incorrectly the whole evening.

595
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,840
 But now you judge correctly.

596
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,760
 And in judging correctly, Simon, you've sealed your fate."

597
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,340
 'Cause Jesus says, "Do you see this woman?"

598
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,000
 He's not going, "Do you see this woman?"

599
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,300
 He's going, "What do you see when you see this woman?

600
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,940
 Do you see her reputation?

601
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:37,160
 Do you see the things that you think that she's done?

602
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,600
 Or do you see what she has done in this moment?"

603
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,080
 And it's powerful because he goes into

604
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:43,920
 exactly what she's done.

605
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,240
 Let me read this to you in verses 44 to 46.

606
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,480
 Is everybody okay?

607
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,760
 Online, are you okay?

608
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,520
 Oh, good.

609
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,080
 He says, "Do you see this woman?

610
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,160
 I came into your house.

611
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,240
 You did not give me any water for my feet,

612
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,040
 but she wet my feet with her tears

613
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,480
 and wiped them with her hair.

614
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,120
 You did not give me a kiss,

615
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,760
 but this woman from the time that I entered

616
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,360
 has not stopped kissing my feet.

617
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,360
 You did not put oil on my head,

618
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,640
 but she has poured perfume on my feet."

619
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,520
 He goes through this list of things

620
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:14,120
 that Simon could have done for him, but did not do.

621
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,800
 Now, it's really important you understand

622
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,260
 that Simon was under no legal obligation

623
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,940
 to do any of those things.

624
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,260
 There was no legal obligation 'cause he's a Pharisee.

625
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,720
 If there had been a legal obligation,

626
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,160
 he would have done it.

627
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,300
 There was no legal obligation

628
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,040
 for him to treat a guest that way.

629
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,360
 Oh, here's a bowl for your feet.

630
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,520
 Oh, give you a kiss on the entry.

631
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,820
 Oh, let me put some oil in your hair

632
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,760
 'cause you've been out in the dusty Galilee all day, right?

633
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,980
 A host would do those things if they truly honoured

634
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,640
 and valued the guests they were inviting to their dinner.

635
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,760
 It wasn't this standard thing.

636
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,280
 It was the above and beyond.

637
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,420
 Simon is pictured here basically two things,

638
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:52,920
 doing the bare minimum of the law to keep the law.

639
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,400
 And secondly, not valuing or understanding who Jesus is.

640
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,120
 So when Jesus says, "Do you see this woman?"

641
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,920
 What Jesus is actually also saying to Simon is,

642
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,420
 "Because she sees me."

643
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:07,840
 She understands the value.

644
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,240
 She understands what I have done for her.

645
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,340
 She understands all of the things

646
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,200
 that I am about to do for Israel.

647
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,800
 You failed to do that because you did not give me a water.

648
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,200
 You did not give me a kiss.

649
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,080
 You gave me no perfume on entry.

650
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,880
 You did not do any of the things that you would have done

651
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,440
 if you believe that somebody of honour and worth

652
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,400
 and value had entered your house.

653
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,760
 And the question we have to ask ourselves is,

654
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,360
 "Why does Simon, the lorabying Pharisee, get it all wrong,

655
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,080
 but the woman who's lived a life of sin get it all right?"

656
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:44,740
 And the answer to that is found in her healing.

657
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,400
 Because she understands that the removal of a problem

658
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,840
 is not necessarily always the healing.

659
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,420
 Notice where her healing comes from.

660
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:57,560
 Here's Jesus beautifully in verse 46 and 47 and eight.

661
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,880
 "Therefore I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven,

662
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,800
 for she loved much, but he who has been forgiven little

663
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,240
 loves little."

664
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,240
 Jesus makes this incredible connection for this woman here.

665
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,280
 He says, "You wanna know why she's doing those things?

666
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,400
 She's doing them because she has experienced forgiveness."

667
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,320
 And not just experienced forgiveness,

668
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,920
 but experienced forgiveness at such a deep level

669
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,600
 that it is literally transformed

670
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,040
 and renewed her identity and her life.

671
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,280
 She is not the same person that she was a month ago,

672
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,360
 two months ago, five months ago, a year ago.

673
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,400
 Yes, she has lived a hard life.

674
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,400
 Yes, she has made some mistakes,

675
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,840
 but she is remorseful for them.

676
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,680
 Why?

677
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,720
 Because she's understood there's a God who forgives

678
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,640
 and redeems and restores and renews.

679
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,280
 And she's allowed that forgiveness,

680
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,480
 not to put a bandaid over her sin,

681
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,420
 but to come and gouge out the trauma of her life

682
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,840
 so that she's so new and restored

683
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,680
 that she's willing to bust into a house

684
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,280
 that she was not invited to.

685
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,000
 She's willing to go in front of a Pharisee

686
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,880
 who's supposed to be the person in power

687
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:00,240
 and humble herself and worship Jesus.

688
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,240
 She is so forgiven that she is able to love.

689
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:13,200
 And Jesus is saying to Simon, "Can you love like that?"

690
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,280
 Jesus says these words to her.

691
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,480
 He says, "Your sins are forgiven."

692
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,340
 It's tempting when we read that to think

693
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:26,240
 that because of her actions in that moment,

694
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,000
 Jesus declares that her sins are forgiven.

695
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,280
 That's really bad theology,

696
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,080
 and you need to be careful of that.

697
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,660
 We don't earn the forgiveness of God

698
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:36,280
 by our good righteous actions.

699
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,180
 We don't wash feet in order to be forgiven.

700
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,040
 We don't pour out expensive perfume

701
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,280
 in the hope that God might turn His heart to us

702
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,140
 and forgive us.

703
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,960
 The word for your sins are forgiven here

704
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,400
 is in the perfect tense in the Greek.

705
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,160
 The perfect tense basically means this.

706
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,880
 It means there's been an action in the past

707
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,120
 that has an implication on the present.

708
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,200
 So what he's saying to her is,

709
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,840
 "Your sins were forgiven in the past."

710
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,200
 In other words, he's declaring to her and to Simon

711
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,140
 and everybody else in that room in that moment

712
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:06,680
 that this woman has experienced forgiveness before.

713
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,560
 And because she knows that she has been forgiven before,

714
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,600
 she is so filled with love that she's come here today

715
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,040
 to do these things, not in order to get forgiveness,

716
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,240
 but because she has been forgiven.

717
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,520
 Her extravagant act of love

718
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,240
 is not the cause of her forgiveness,

719
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,120
 it's the response to her forgiveness.

720
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:26,960
 Are you with me?

721
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,040
 And Jesus is making this point

722
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,680
 so that Simon would understand

723
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,480
 something that's so fundamental and so true,

724
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,760
 that there is a direct link

725
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,520
 between our ability to receive forgiveness

726
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,840
 and the healing that that creates in us,

727
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,840
 and our ability to actually offer true love to others.

728
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:53,240
 Jesus is saying there's a link between forgiveness and love.

729
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,440
 One of the most powerful things as human beings

730
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,240
 that we can understand is that link.

731
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,080
 Jesus says, literally,

732
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:05,320
 "Those that have been forgiven much, love much.

733
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:09,400
 Those that have been forgiven so little, love little."

734
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,580
 This is Jesus opening up a healing journey for Simon.

735
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,260
 Jesus understands that the removal of a problem

736
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,460
 is not necessarily the healing,

737
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,060
 but the healing actually needs to go deeper than that.

738
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,380
 But the healing that we all need

739
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:26,380
 is only found in the power of a forgiving God,

740
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:30,100
 and in our deep understanding of that forgiveness.

741
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,260
 I'm sure this woman was not proud of some of the mistakes

742
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,860
 and things that she had done in her life,

743
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,620
 but she could love extravagantly

744
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,900
 because she had first been loved,

745
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:43,020
 because God had poured out His love

746
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,820
 in the power of forgiveness in her,

747
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,420
 and that changed everything about her.

748
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:50,660
 And here's the thing for us here in Hong Kong.

749
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:54,340
 I tell you this, Hong Kong is in need of healing, amen?

750
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,300
 It's in need of the redeeming

751
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,300
 and restoring healing love of God.

752
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:01,860
 You are in need of the healing love of God.

753
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,180
 And I wanna say it as strong as this.

754
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:07,460
 There will be no healing for Hong Kong.

755
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:10,500
 There will be no true restoration for the social unrest

756
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,700
 and the pandemic unless the church

757
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,900
 can become a vessel of God's love again.

758
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:20,300
 And the only way we become a vessel of God's love

759
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,700
 is through the doorway of forgiveness.

760
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:26,300
 And you're tempted sitting here to think,

761
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,140
 because things are reopening,

762
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,820
 my life will be able to flourish again.

763
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:33,820
 And I'm here to tell you as hard as this word is,

764
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:36,260
 that the only way your life is going to flourish

765
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,980
 out of the back of these three years

766
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,180
 that we've all experienced

767
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:42,300
 is if you allow a bit more forgiveness into your life.

768
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:46,420
 If you allow yourself to process

769
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,380
 some of the trauma that you're feeling.

770
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,420
 If you stop and say,

771
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:55,420
 "I will not put a band-aid on how I am right now.

772
00:32:55,420 --> 00:33:00,340
 "Holy Spirit come, because I need to be forgiven."

773
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:05,860
 We need to be forgiven of our words, of our attitudes.

774
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:11,500
 We need to be forgiven of our judgmental negativity.

775
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:15,700
 This is the interesting thing to me.

776
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,700
 I think the great danger for us emerging

777
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,300
 from this fifth wave is this,

778
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:22,540
 that we would emerge more like Simon

779
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,420
 and less like the anointing woman.

780
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:28,260
 And we will emerge that way

781
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,220
 because we haven't dealt with the things

782
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,740
 that really need to be dealt with.

783
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:36,260
 And we will become more judgmental

784
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:39,460
 because there's stuff inside of us that has been difficult,

785
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,780
 because there have been decisions made

786
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,780
 that have rightly annoyed us,

787
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,140
 because we haven't been able to do some of the things

788
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,380
 that we'd wanted to do.

789
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,940
 And those things are true and real

790
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:47,940
 for every single one of us.

791
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,860
 And they create frustration and anger

792
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,340
 and all this thing inside of us.

793
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,420
 And if we're not careful,

794
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,020
 we're going to be more like Simon,

795
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,740
 judging the people around us, judging the government,

796
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,740
 judging individuals, judging the church,

797
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,820
 judging our boss, judging our businesses,

798
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:05,620
 judging everything, being cynical and critical.

799
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:09,740
 Because we haven't dealt with the trauma that's real in us.

800
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:15,060
 And Jesus says to Simon, "Do you see this woman?

801
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:21,140
 She loves extravagantly because she's been forgiven deeply."

802
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:25,220
 And as you emerge from this fifth wave,

803
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:29,700
 let me gently say to you, do you see that woman too?

804
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:34,460
 Are you willing to open yourself up this week

805
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:37,460
 and over the next three weeks to be reopened

806
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:41,620
 to the healing work that God needs to do in your life?

807
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:45,020
 And it starts with forgiveness.

808
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,900
 Forgiveness for the things that I have done.

809
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,180
 Asking God to forgive me for my brokenness

810
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,300
 and for my thoughts and my actions.

811
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,460
 Forgiving myself,

812
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:56,580
 because that's sometimes the hardest person to forgive.

813
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:59,300
 And then going to others that I've hurt or wronged

814
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,780
 and asking for their forgiveness.

815
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:06,740
 And then in that, forgiving and releasing others.

816
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,420
 Jesus in scripture connects forgiving

817
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,380
 to the year of blessing.

818
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,220
 The year of blessing, the year of Jubilee.

819
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,220
 That was always about release of three things.

820
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,260
 Debt, the full release of debt,

821
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,700
 which is the story that Jesus connects us to.

822
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,380
 The second thing was the release of the land.

823
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,140
 Anybody who'd been taken away from their land

824
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,860
 can go back to their land and own it again.

825
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,820
 The third thing was released from slavery.

826
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:27,020
 I want you to know that your forgiveness,

827
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,740
 your act of forgiveness will release you

828
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,260
 from the debt that you carry.

829
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:34,580
 It'll plant you firmly in the ground again

830
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,300
 for a place of flourishing.

831
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,660
 And it will break the slavery you're feeling right now

832
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,980
 to your emotions and your brokenness

833
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:45,020
 and the anger and the fear and the anxiety.

834
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,460
 That's what forgiveness does.

835
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,580
 It releases.

836
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:54,420
 Would we be released to truly be a church of love?

837
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:58,140
 'Cause the only way this city will heal

838
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,820
 is with the love of God.

839
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:02,380
 And the only way the love of God will come

840
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:05,660
 is if the people of God know they're forgiven.

841
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:10,060
 Let's do the work so that we can be the people

842
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,060
 God calls us to be.

843
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:13,860
 I want to have you just close your eyes with me

844
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:14,700
 and open your hands.

845
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,540
 I want to pray.

846
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:21,460
 Holy Spirit, we are so grateful.

847
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:27,340
 So grateful, God, for this season we're in.

848
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:32,220
 We're grateful for the lifting of these measures,

849
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,540
 for the fact that we can gather in this room again today.

850
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,100
 What a wonderful thing that is.

851
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:41,100
 Father, we're grateful for your hand on our city.

852
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:44,180
 We're grateful for the many mercies

853
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,460
 that there have been in the last three months.

854
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:50,580
 Father, we're also aware of the challenges

855
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:54,900
 and the emotions that those things have created in us.

856
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:58,300
 Father, we would be wrong to reopen society

857
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,420
 with closed hearts.

858
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,940
 So Holy Spirit, I pray right now

859
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,380
 for every person in this room.

860
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:08,260
 Lord, where our hearts are more like Simon,

861
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:14,900
 where we find ourselves critical, cynical, frustrated.

862
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:23,700
 Father, we don't need more Simons in Hong Kong.

863
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,340
 But Father, for us to shift from Simon to the woman,

864
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,460
 we need forgiveness.

865
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:32,460
 We need to encounter that same power of love

866
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,340
 and forgiveness that she encountered.

867
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:37,740
 And we need her to come and truly do the work in our hearts

868
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,020
 'cause the removal of the problem

869
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,540
 is not necessarily the healing,

870
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:44,820
 but the healing comes through the processing of the trauma.

871
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:49,580
 And Lord, would you teach us how we do that?

872
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,660
 And we know that it begins in forgiveness.

873
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,820
 I want you to take a moment right now,

874
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,620
 maybe if you're comfortable,

875
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,940
 just open your hands where you're sitting.

876
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,500
 If this is speaking to you,

877
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,860
 if you wanna respond this morning,

878
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:03,740
 it's just a simple thing online or in this room,

879
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:04,860
 just open your hands.

880
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:08,940
 By opening your hands, it's not anything special,

881
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,980
 but it's just a posture of receiving.

882
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:15,620
 And the Holy Spirit really honors your heart

883
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:18,060
 and he sees where you're at.

884
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:24,660
 And I believe that you need forgiveness.

885
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,460
 (gentle music)

886
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,940
 And I want you just to allow the Holy Spirit

887
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,820
 to search your heart and show you what areas

888
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:34,020
 he wants you to deal with today.

889
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,100
 There'll be some other areas tomorrow and next week,

890
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,500
 but in this moment,

891
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:42,820
 see the Holy Spirit is a kind, gentle person

892
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,580
 that leads us to repentance.

893
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:52,380
 The woman was not perfect.

894
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,940
 (gentle music)

895
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:57,180
 She knew she had done some really bad things.

896
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,460
 Peter was not perfect.

897
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:02,860
 He knew he had done some really bad things.

898
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:06,380
 But what made the difference between them

899
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:11,300
 and Simon in this story was forgiveness and love.

900
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:14,980
 I pray right now by the power of the Holy Spirit

901
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,880
 that Lord, you would move in forgiveness over this church.

902
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,940
 Lord, I pray you would move in forgiveness

903
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,640
 over every individual here today.

904
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,220
 Father, we need it.

905
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:29,020
 And Father, we thank you that in your forgiveness

906
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:32,100
 comes what we see in this woman's life,

907
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:36,860
 love, joy, gratitude.

908
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:40,780
 And so Lord, I pray that as we have this time

909
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,700
 of forgiveness in your spirit,

910
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:46,860
 out of that would emerge a celebration in our hearts

911
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:51,900
 and a love that this city so desperately needs.

912
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,340
 That it wouldn't be a fake love

913
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,900
 that we try to stir up as a church,

914
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,580
 but it would flow from the place of forgiveness.

915
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:01,340
 So take a moment,

916
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,260
 and in a moment the band will come and lead us,

917
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:06,100
 but just take a moment now, don't rush this.

918
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,740
 So allow the Holy Spirit to speak to you beautifully.

919
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,780
 He loves you deeply.

920
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,660
 He's not angry at you.

921
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,940
 He's not Simon.

922
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,060
 He's not judging you.

923
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,540
 He's Jesus.

924
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,500
 And He's saying, "Do you see this woman?

925
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,540
 That could be you too.

926
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:25,260
 Come to me.

927
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,340
 Come to me."

928
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,780
 (gentle music)

929
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:33,360
 (gentle music)
