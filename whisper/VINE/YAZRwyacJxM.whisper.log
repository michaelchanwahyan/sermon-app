[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080]   I'll just now say it again,
[00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.280]   everybody needs you, a friend like Justin Ho, seriously.
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.180]   Love you, brother.
[00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.780]   Well, I also want to start just this morning
[00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.940]   by honoring my friends and colleagues
[00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.600]   who have shared from the pulpit over the past four months,
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.800]   especially in this series over the past five, six weeks.
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.820]   It's been amazing, it's been so refreshing
[00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.840]   to hear different voices unpack certain topics
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.640]   of the Bible and just the talent
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.280]   and the depth of the relationship
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.760]   that our pastors have in this church
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.400]   and in order to faithfully bring the word to you.
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.440]   I'm really honored to work with such a great
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.120]   and amazing team and we're really glad,
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.040]   of course, to have Andrew back as well.
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.020]   And so, so today, you know,
[00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.680]   we are closing out our forgiveness series
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.080]   and it's been a great journey,
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.120]   but even though today, you know,
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.720]   it's the end of the sermon series,
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.160]   it's by no means the end of our journey in forgiveness.
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.120]   And the message I'm bringing today,
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.680]   excuse me, it's been sitting in my heart
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.640]   for, you know, some weeks now
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.440]   and I've been wrestling with it,
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.400]   I've been fasting and praying for it,
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.720]   which I don't always do.
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.920]   Just confession, right?
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.260]   I don't always do, leading up to a sermon,
[00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.480]   but this one, I have been.
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.320]   And so before we start, I hope we can pray again, right?
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.440]   And you to pray for me too
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.880]   as we open up scripture together.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.080]   So let's pray, church.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.840]   Jesus, just thank you for your word, Lord,
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.000]   the depth and the richness
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.160]   and the conviction that comes from it.
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.800]   Help us to listen well,
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.560]   to draw in well to your word today, Jesus,
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.460]   as we open up scripture as a family, Lord.
[00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.360]   Be with us in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.580]   Okay, good morning.
[00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.160]   Good morning if you're joining us online
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.560]   and overflow as well.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.860]   Let me ask you a question first.
[00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.880]   What is the worst date that you've ever been on?
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.700]   Okay, the worst date.
[00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.480]   Okay, maybe some of you are on a date right now
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.080]   and you're about to say,
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.520]   I was thinking I was gonna brunch today,
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.600]   but this person brought me to church instead, right?
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.020]   It's a pretty terrible date right now, okay?
[00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.400]   I hope it won't be, all right?
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.640]   Let me share one of my experiences with you, okay?
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.000]   This is like 20 plus years ago now, okay?
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.760]   I was a new university student in London.
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.940]   You know, a new uni student in a new city,
[00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.680]   I'm trying to get to know people, right?
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.700]   It's a part of the journey.
[00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.160]   And so I sign up for psychology classes.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.280]   Now, the only reason I signed up for psychology
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.880]   was because the rumor was, word on the street
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.400]   was that lots of girls did psychology, okay?
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.120]   I was 18, 19 years old, okay?
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.960]   Don't judge me.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.560]   Some of you come here 'cause there's a lot of girls here.
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.400]   Right, so.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.120]   I'm just saying, okay?
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.280]   I don't remember a single thing I learned, okay?
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.280]   But there was this girl that sat next to me, okay?
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.440]   And she was nice, okay?
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.280]   She was nice.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.800]   And so I thought to myself, okay,
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.480]   let me ask her out for lunch.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.560]   And so we get chatting, and after a few weeks
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.120]   of sitting next to each other, I ask her,
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.360]   would you like to join me for lunch tomorrow?
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.600]   I said, sure.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.440]   Okay, so far, so good.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.520]   She said, all right, let's go to Wagamama's for lunch.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.000]   Okay, and she agrees.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.800]   Okay, now, for those of you who don't know,
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.720]   Wagamama's is a fusion restaurant, okay?
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.960]   They take Japanese food and make it terrible.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.760]   Okay, that's what they do, okay?
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.760]   [audience laughing]
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.400]   Londoners do not like Wagamama's, right?
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.000]   I loved it, though, okay?
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.920]   You'll see why in a minute.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.840]   Okay, so, you know, lunch date comes along.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.120]   We're eating, conversing.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.240]   Oh, you're from Hong Kong, you're in it?
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.520]   Oh, yeah, that's really cool, you know?
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.760]   And, you know, chatting along, you know?
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.280]   Weather's been a bit rubbish, right?
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.480]   British, typical British conversation, okay?
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.080]   Having a good time.
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.120]   Then come times to pay the bill.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.380]   Now, of course, being the gentleman that I am, right,
[00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.160]   the one who initiated the date,
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.400]   I thought it was only appropriate
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.960]   that I would, you know, take the bill.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.200]   But it was also because I had a secret weapon.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.120]   You see, I had coupons, okay?
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.400]   [audience laughing]
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.040]   So, a few weeks before this, right,
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.480]   I found on a website that Wagamama's was offering
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.000]   buy one, get one free lunches, okay?
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.740]   And so I went to the library,
[00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.880]   and I must have printed out like 25 of these coupons, right?
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.600]   I cut them all up, okay, and I had them ready, okay?
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.680]   I was ready.
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.880]   And so, you know, the bill came,
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.080]   and I said, I got this, all right?
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.800]   And she was pretty impressed, you know,
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.400]   and said, I have a coupon.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.440]   It's buy one, get one free, right?
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.120]   And I pull out my stack of coupons, you know,
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.560]   it's like, and her face, though, right?
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.580]   I thought she was thinking, oh my gosh,
[00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.840]   look at this handsome, frugal Chinese man, right?
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.000]   [audience laughing]
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.040]   Boyfriend material, okay?
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.360]   But the look on her face was like shock
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.200]   and maybe a little bit of disgust, okay?
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.880]   Like, she didn't say it out loud,
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.360]   but I knew what she was thinking.
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.560]   It's like, wow, this dude is cheap, okay?
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.160]   [audience laughing]
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.400]   This cheap man, he took me to Wagamama's
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.720]   'cause he had two for one coupons, okay?
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.040]   So, needless to say, there was no second date,
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.760]   but I did keep eating at Wagamama's,
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.120]   and it was so good, okay?
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.300]   So, I was a poor student.
[00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.920]   And I wish I could say I've changed since then,
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.920]   but I'm still kind of cheap, okay?
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.940]   For example, okay, my first wedding anniversary,
[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.720]   my wife is sitting here right now.
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.000]   We're celebrating our 15th wedding anniversary,
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.480]   by the way, this December, okay?
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.320]   So.
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.480]   [audience applauding]
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.120]   Praise the Lord, okay?
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.480]   If you wanna know if God is real, this is proof, okay?
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.480]   Like, my first wedding anniversary, okay,
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.160]   I have been saving up coins, okay?
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.200]   All the loose change I get every day, I throw it in a pot,
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.240]   okay, so I saved up a whole bunch of coins.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.200]   I was gonna use that to take my wife out for dinner
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.040]   on our first wedding anniversary.
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.480]   But, okay, I went to the bank and they said,
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.860]   oh, if we change this into cash or whatever,
[00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.280]   it's gonna cost you like 2% of the,
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.960]   so I didn't wanna do that, 2%, okay?
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.280]   So what I did, I took all the coins, okay,
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.680]   and I paid for our meal that evening in coins, okay?
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.080]   Like, it was like a $1,000 meal, okay?
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.640]   Like, in fives and twos and ones, okay?
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.800]   Brittany was embarrassed.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.480]   Again, I thought it was great, okay?
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.480]   'Cause, you know, I've been saving up these coins
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.900]   for something, okay?
[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.280]   So that's me, okay?
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.120]   Now, you'll see why in a minute
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.920]   why I shared these stories with you.
[00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.300]   Over the past five weeks, we've been taking a deep dive
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.940]   into the topic of forgiveness.
[00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.460]   And I really hope it's been useful.
[00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.620]   I really hope it's given you a good understanding
[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.540]   of what God's heart is when it comes to forgiveness
[00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.860]   because we've really needed it.
[00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.180]   But I told you guys at the beginning
[00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.380]   that this was a heart cry from the church.
[00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.060]   I wanna show you something this morning.
[00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.860]   This mixing bowl right here, full of these prayer requests,
[00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.340]   these are the prayer requests
[00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.180]   that were taken up during Converse, right?
[00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.380]   Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds.
[00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.140]   There's even more that wouldn't fit into the bowl, okay?
[00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.260]   Hundreds of these prayer requests,
[00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.940]   all on the topic of forgiveness.
[00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:53.820]   Lord, help me to forgive.
[00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.900]   Lord, I need forgiveness, okay?
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.180]   All of them to do with forgiveness.
[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.240]   And to say that we were wrestling with this
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.840]   as a church would be an understatement, right?
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.820]   We were deep in the idea of needing
[00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.700]   to understand what forgiveness is,
[00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.460]   writing out our struggles in this.
[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.040]   But as we were going through the series
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.380]   and as we were coming to an end,
[00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.820]   I noticed some pitfalls or some dangers
[00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:21.640]   in focusing too much just on the topic of forgiveness.
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:26.120]   Because in all this talk about needing to embrace forgiveness
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.700]   because it's what God has done for us, right?
[00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.720]   We've began to realize that Jesus has taken away
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.000]   all our guilt and our shame.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.980]   He holds nothing against us, which is all true.
[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.800]   The risk there is that forgiveness
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.940]   becomes something we take for granted.
[00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:42.660]   Our mindset becomes, hey, since it's always there
[00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:45.080]   and it's free, we can just help ourselves to it,
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.020]   then why not, right?
[00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.100]   I'm just gonna live my life how I want,
[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:51.500]   do whatever I want, and then just ask for forgiveness later.
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.560]   Right, we might even start to take the same mindset
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.820]   when it comes to forgiving each other, right?
[00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:59.060]   We hold forgiveness over each other,
[00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.780]   kind of like a weapon, right?
[00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.980]   We hurt each other, we offend each other,
[00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.300]   but instead of doing the hard work of confessing
[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.720]   and repenting and changing who we are,
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.520]   we develop this mindset of, well, you have to forgive me
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.840]   because Pastor Ellison and all those other pastors
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.440]   said so in this sermon series, right?
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.280]   I can hear it right now.
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.400]   Maybe you and your spouse are having an argument.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.920]   You know you've been wrong, you know you've messed up,
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.880]   but instead of owning up to the mistakes,
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.160]   out comes your mouth.
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.120]   You need to forgive me.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.240]   Didn't you listen to the sermon series?
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:31.960]   Okay, listen, if that's what we've walked away with
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.120]   at the end of this series,
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.040]   then we've caught the wrong end of the stick.
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:39.080]   In other words, if we've come away from this sermon series
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.040]   thinking forgiveness, we can access cheaply,
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.200]   you know, just like cheap Wagamama coupons
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.940]   or just coins that we can bring, okay,
[00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:48.840]   then we've cheapened forgiveness.
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.400]   Forgiveness cannot be something we cheat,
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:57.120]   we treat cheaply because forgiveness was God's idea.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.440]   It was his gift to us.
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.240]   Right, we even said at the beginning of the series,
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.060]   forgiveness is like a journey, right?
[00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.120]   We're learning how to forgive,
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.540]   but even that I think is not totally accurate
[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.360]   because I've realized that actually,
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:15.320]   you can learn to forgive in a lot of different ways.
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.400]   What we heard about some of this throughout the series
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.080]   is about some of the benefits of forgiveness, right?
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:24.080]   The world of science and psychology tells us that,
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.480]   you know, forgiveness brings us many health benefits, right?
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.880]   It lowers your blood pressure,
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.640]   live longer lives, lowers your stress and anxiety, right?
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.120]   So forgiveness you can embrace
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.900]   as a way of looking after yourself, right?
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.900]   Buddhism teaches forgiveness, right?
[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.000]   Buddhism teaches, you know,
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.980]   as a forgiveness as a way to reach inner peace, okay?
[00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:44.300]   So you can get to inner peace just by forgiving.
[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.580]   Hinduism, right, and forgiveness have to do with karma.
[00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.060]   So the more you forgive, the better your karma is,
[00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.040]   you don't come back as something horrible in the next life,
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.340]   okay, eventually leads you
[00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.580]   to the heights of self-realization.
[00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:58.740]   Even the Quran teaches forgiveness, right?
[00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.180]   Forgiveness is a virtue that Allah values,
[00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.360]   so the more you forgive, the more virtues you store up
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.560]   with Allah for treasures in the next life.
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.340]   So if you want to learn just to forgive,
[00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.240]   there's lots of ways to do that.
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:17.300]   But the goal is not to become good at forgiving, okay?
[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:22.300]   Our goal in life is to become more and more like Jesus.
[00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:25.200]   That's the ultimate goal.
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.880]   Our goal in life is to learn what it means
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:31.740]   to enter through the small and narrow gates.
[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:34.540]   Our goal in life is to discover that Jesus is the way,
[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:37.460]   the truth, and the life, and no one comes to the Father
[00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:38.460]   except through him.
[00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:43.060]   Because it's only when we learn to be like Jesus
[00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:46.460]   that we can truly live out and practice forgiveness
[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.340]   as God intended for us to do it.
[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.500]   Listen carefully again.
[00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.040]   If we've learned how to forgive
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.460]   without learning how to be like Jesus,
[00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:58.220]   then we've missed the point.
[00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:01.120]   So we're gonna open up Scripture.
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:04.240]   And the passage we're looking at today
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.240]   will remind us of the ultimate goal in our lives
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.560]   and the challenge to follow it.
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:13.560]   So Matthew chapter 16, verses 24 to 26.
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.720]   Familiar words maybe, but let's look at them again together.
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.120]   Then Jesus said to his disciples,
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:23.960]   "Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves,
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.460]   "take up the cross, and follow me.
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.480]   "For whoever wants to save their life will lose it,
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:33.360]   "but whoever loses their life for me will find it.
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.380]   "What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world
[00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:38.340]   "yet forfeit their soul?
[00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:42.900]   "Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?"
[00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:49.580]   We talk a lot about the benefits of following Jesus,
[00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:53.100]   and indeed, forgiveness is one of those great benefits.
[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.640]   Once we accept Jesus as our Lord and Savior,
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:12:00.160]   we believe our sins are forgiven and that we're justified.
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.980]   The basic idea of being justified means
[00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:04.360]   that because of God's forgiveness over us,
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.080]   our sin is not on the record anymore.
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.060]   It's been blotted out, it's been erased.
[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:12.080]   The debt of sin has been paid on us, for us.
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.800]   So that means when God looks at us,
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.160]   he doesn't see our sin.
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.240]   Instead, he sees one who is clean, who is pure.
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.480]   You can think about it this way.
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:22.060]   A justified me almost means it's just as if
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:23.880]   I had never sinned.
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.880]   So that's available for us, it's free.
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.800]   Well, free for me and you, of course,
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.280]   but it wasn't totally free
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:36.520]   because forgiveness came at the great cost of Jesus' life.
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.840]   And because it comes at the great cost of his life,
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.940]   we cannot treat it cheaply and with content.
[00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:47.920]   Like I said, if we do this, it's like treating forgiveness
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.760]   like things we can just, free coupons we can use
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:53.240]   all the time, okay, and just access whenever we need.
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.980]   Yes, forgiveness is free, but it's only free
[00:12:55.980 --> 00:13:00.240]   because Jesus paid the price we cannot pay for ourselves.
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.860]   And even though it is available to all,
[00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:06.780]   there are certain conditions that God gives us
[00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:11.360]   in order to properly receive his gifts and benefits.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:14.900]   The point of forgiveness is not just to comfort you
[00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:17.340]   when you feel sad, to make you feel better
[00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:19.660]   when you've done something wrong, right?
[00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:22.580]   Forgiveness is actually meant to change you,
[00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:25.420]   to shape you, and mold you, to encourage you
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:27.860]   to become more like his son.
[00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:31.340]   In other words, if you want to know the full benefits
[00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:36.100]   of forgiveness, you have to become a discipleship,
[00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.380]   a disciple of Jesus.
[00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:42.380]   And when it comes to becoming a disciple of Jesus,
[00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.940]   when it comes to following Jesus,
[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:47.980]   it comes with change in our lives, real change.
[00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:51.380]   It comes with a cost to our lives as well.
[00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:54.700]   But this only makes sense because if not,
[00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.420]   anyone could call themselves a Christian, right?
[00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.820]   Anyone could call themselves a Christian,
[00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:00.380]   keep living lives however they want,
[00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:02.380]   receive God's forgiveness, but again,
[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:05.140]   that's cheapening the whole idea of God's grace
[00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:06.860]   and his mercy.
[00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:09.020]   If we want to call ourselves Christians,
[00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.860]   if we profess to follow Jesus with our lives,
[00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:13.300]   it's gonna cost us something.
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.900]   There are changes that must be made.
[00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:20.460]   There's a certain way God expects us to live
[00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.660]   as his followers.
[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:28.380]   So the question is, what does it cost us to follow Jesus?
[00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:29.620]   Well, if you go back to the passage,
[00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:31.300]   we're gonna find out.
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.700]   Verse 24, Jesus starts by saying,
[00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:37.080]   if anyone would come after me.
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.340]   Anyone.
[00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.060]   Now, anyone means anyone, okay?
[00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:42.580]   This means you, this means me,
[00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:45.460]   this means anyone who's listening right now.
[00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:49.220]   This is an invitation to all people at all times.
[00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:53.980]   Anyone can choose to become a disciple of Jesus.
[00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:56.980]   But notice I used the word choose, right?
[00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:59.340]   If you want to.
[00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:02.020]   If also means it's a choice.
[00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:04.540]   If you want to become a disciple of Jesus,
[00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:07.060]   these are the things we're gonna have to walk in.
[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:09.100]   God's not gonna drag you kicking and screaming
[00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:11.140]   into a relationship to follow him.
[00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:14.260]   That's not true following, that's not true discipleship.
[00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.540]   That's not true love.
[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.540]   He's not gonna do that.
[00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:20.560]   We all have a choice.
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:24.640]   And Jesus is about to explain, if you want to follow me,
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.580]   there are requirements.
[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:29.620]   We're about to dive in into something
[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:31.220]   that might change the definition
[00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:34.140]   of what it means for you to follow Jesus.
[00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:34.980]   And I'm gonna tell you,
[00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:37.940]   it's more than just coming to Sunday services.
[00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:40.420]   It's more than just giving an offering, volunteering,
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:42.080]   being part of a community group,
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.260]   as amazing and good as those things are
[00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:45.700]   for the life of a Christian,
[00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:48.460]   it's gonna be much more than that.
[00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:52.180]   So the question, maybe the most important question
[00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:55.500]   you could ever ask yourselves in your life is this.
[00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:59.080]   Do you want to go after Jesus?
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:03.300]   Do you want to be a disciple of the Lord?
[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.460]   Because if you say yes,
[00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:08.660]   it's going to drastically change your life forever.
[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.920]   If you say yes, we're about to leave,
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.700]   we got to lean into some things we need to do
[00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:15.980]   in order to follow him.
[00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:19.100]   Firstly, it teaches us this.
[00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:24.220]   A disciple of Jesus must deny himself.
[00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:27.460]   Your first step in deciding to follow Jesus
[00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:30.900]   is to deny yourself.
[00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:32.500]   Now, what does this mean?
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.380]   It's not just, ooh, I better not have that chocolate.
[00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:36.620]   Ooh, I better not have that cake,
[00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:38.500]   moment on the lips, lifetime on the hips.
[00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:40.780]   It's not just that.
[00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:43.520]   It's not that kind of deny yourself.
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.480]   But what this is talking about, church,
[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:49.560]   it's talking about the full and total surrender
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:52.760]   of your life into his hands.
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:56.820]   Okay, think about this for a second, all right?
[00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:58.520]   Because we live in a day and age, right,
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:01.000]   where the prevailing mindset seems to be
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.720]   you can and should have whatever you like
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:05.720]   whenever you like, right?
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.960]   The world says take control of your life, right?
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.460]   There's this belief out there that teaches us, right,
[00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:14.020]   we are so much in control that you can truly have
[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:18.660]   whatever you want, all you need to do is manifest it, right?
[00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:21.500]   You heard of that term, manifesting, right?
[00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:25.420]   The idea, okay, is making everything you want and feel,
[00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.380]   okay, everything you, sorry, let me say it clearly.
[00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:30.820]   The idea of making everything you want to feel
[00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:34.380]   and experience a reality through your thoughts,
[00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:37.100]   your actions, and beliefs.
[00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:40.600]   In other words, what it's saying is deny yourself nothing,
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.400]   but whatever makes you feel good,
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.280]   that's what's good for you, so do whatever you want.
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:49.680]   Okay, listen, this sounds good, it sounds attractive,
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.480]   do whatever you want, manifest whatever you want,
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:55.280]   deny yourself no pleasure, right?
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:56.680]   Some preachers out there might even say
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.080]   this is God's will for your life, right,
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:02.040]   to live a life of constant bliss and blessings
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.240]   with no struggles, right?
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.760]   This is a lie, church.
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.460]   Think about it for a minute.
[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:12.660]   If life was about making yourself happy,
[00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:13.860]   why would we need God?
[00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.940]   Well, if you could just manifest whatever you wanted
[00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.680]   all the time, serve your own needs,
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:22.140]   you wouldn't need God, you would be God yourself.
[00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:26.980]   So denying yourself is not really about, you know,
[00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:32.460]   it's about embracing a whole different way to live.
[00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:36.780]   It's about discovering, actually, your true purpose in life.
[00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:40.160]   And your purpose in life, our purpose in life, right,
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:44.640]   it's not for you to discover the pleasures of this world.
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:46.600]   Your purpose in life is not to live a happy,
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:49.600]   comfortable life, die peacefully in your sleep.
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.600]   Your purpose in life is not to become the best
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.760]   at whatever you're doing.
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.920]   Your purpose in life is not to find a partner,
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.560]   get married, and settle down.
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:00.720]   Your purpose in life is to become a follower of Jesus,
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:04.400]   because you have been made an image bearer of God.
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:08.580]   Your purpose in life is to worship Jesus
[00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:11.020]   with all your heart, mind, and strength,
[00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:13.900]   to be an example of his love to others.
[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:18.900]   Above everything else, this is your ultimate goal in life.
[00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:23.000]   And for you to be able to do that,
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.500]   you're gonna have to deny yourself.
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.100]   You're gonna have to be willing to say,
[00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:30.220]   everything else is gonna take a back seat,
[00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:32.320]   and I'm gonna fully dedicate myself
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.780]   to becoming more like Jesus.
[00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:37.740]   And I know it sounds extreme, right?
[00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:39.340]   It almost sounds as though Jesus is trying
[00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:41.180]   to kill everybody's personality,
[00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.940]   so we all act in the same way, right?
[00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:46.080]   It sounds a bit like Jesus is to get rid
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.740]   of everything enjoyable in your lives, right,
[00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:51.180]   and force you to be grumpy and miserable all the time.
[00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:53.520]   It sounds a little bit like Jesus is saying,
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.660]   don't have fun, just follow me.
[00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:58.800]   But that's not true, either.
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.660]   That could be further from the truth.
[00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:04.220]   Remember the story of the rich young ruler.
[00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:07.460]   He is the person who encounters,
[00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:10.220]   and he's actually interested in who Jesus is
[00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:12.320]   and in giving his life to him.
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:15.180]   But when he is challenged to deny himself
[00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:18.260]   of a significant wealth and possessions,
[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.420]   he couldn't do it.
[00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:23.100]   And he walked away grieved, the Bible tells us,
[00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.660]   even though he still had all the riches
[00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:29.440]   that he ever wanted, he walked away grieved.
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:32.680]   On the other hand, when Zacchaeus,
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.680]   another wealthy man who's interested in following Jesus,
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:37.880]   when he realizes what he has to do,
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.640]   he gladly gives everything up.
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.480]   He says, I'm gonna pay back four times
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:42.880]   what I stole from other people.
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:46.300]   He gives away all himself, denies himself all of that,
[00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:49.760]   and Jesus declares that salvation
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:52.340]   has come to his house today.
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.860]   The one who was willing to deny himself
[00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:58.420]   discovered the true meaning of life.
[00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:00.860]   The one who was not willing to deny himself
[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:03.840]   walked away from the giver of life.
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:07.100]   Church, let me remind us today,
[00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:10.740]   denying yourself, fully surrendering
[00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:12.900]   to anything Jesus wants you to do,
[00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:16.300]   this has to be the first step that you must take
[00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:19.400]   in your life of following Jesus.
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.960]   Right, so how do we do it, though?
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.100]   How do we do this, rise up to this challenge
[00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:25.860]   of denying yourself, right?
[00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:28.980]   It's not just a matter of strong will, right?
[00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:31.660]   Strong will can lead you to do a lot of crazy things.
[00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:35.260]   I've done two marathons, okay, with zero training, okay,
[00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:38.020]   just based on willpower alone, I'm not kidding, okay?
[00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:40.700]   I did two trail walkers even, no training,
[00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:41.980]   I just got up that morning,
[00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:43.700]   decided to go do it with my group, okay,
[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:45.260]   went and did it, finished, okay,
[00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:47.780]   I almost died at the end of all those events, okay?
[00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:49.660]   Don't recommend it, okay?
[00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.400]   But you know, your willpower, your grit
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.560]   will get you certain places,
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:58.020]   but it's not gonna be able to help you in this that much.
[00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:03.440]   There's an even more drastic step that you have to take.
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:04.920]   And Jesus tells us the next step, then,
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:07.240]   is to, if you want to, come after me,
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:10.960]   deny himself, and pick up your cross.
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.280]   Pick up the cross.
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:16.940]   Now, again, the idea of picking up your cross,
[00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:18.760]   I feel like it's sort of a concept
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:22.520]   that's been cheapened by modern day thinking, right?
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.720]   It's sort of a cutesy little phrase that we say sometimes,
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.080]   right, I'm gonna pick up my cross,
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.360]   and we think of it as something like
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.800]   an irritating burden that you need to bear, right?
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.920]   Oh, you know, the cross I have to bear,
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.960]   my cross is this gout in my big toe, you know,
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.060]   acts up all the time, every time I eat, you know,
[00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:38.480]   spicy noodles, my gout flares up, okay?
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:42.260]   Or my cross to bear is to have to work
[00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:43.320]   with Dave over here, right?
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:44.880]   I have to see him every day, you know,
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.760]   and Dave is such a burden to me, right?
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:49.680]   It's much more than that, though.
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:54.120]   The cross is not just an annoyance.
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:58.080]   The cross was an instrument of death, right?
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.480]   And picking up the cross means that we deny ourselves
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:03.280]   to the point where we think of all our earthly passions,
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:07.060]   our sinful desires, as crucified and put to death.
[00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:11.200]   Taking up the cross not only means to deny yourself,
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.340]   it actually means to die to yourself.
[00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:17.320]   Dietrich Bonhoeffer says it this way,
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:20.280]   when Christ calls a man or a woman,
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:23.100]   he bids him to come and die.
[00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:26.560]   If we just stop that denying ourselves,
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.280]   that stuff is still sort of there, right,
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:30.040]   lingering in the background, you know,
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:32.200]   and the danger is, you know, like a bad habit,
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.400]   we always run the risk of going back to it.
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.840]   It's familiar, it's warm, right?
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:38.080]   There is a sense of like safety in sin
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.480]   as messed up as that is.
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:43.160]   But scripture doesn't call us just to resist sin,
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:45.440]   no, that's just the first step.
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.000]   The next step scripture tells us to do
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   is put the sin in our old lives to death, right?
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.240]   Time and time again, the Bible tells us to do this.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.440]   Check it out, Galatians 5:24,
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:59.440]   "Those who belong to Christ have been crucified
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:02.720]   "with the flesh and its passions and desires."
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:05.500]   Romans 6:11, "In the same way, count yourselves," what?
[00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:10.500]   "Dead to sin, but alive in God to Christ Jesus."
[00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:14.780]   Matthew 5, 29 to 30, Jesus talking to us,
[00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:17.000]   "If your right eye causes you to stumble,
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.060]   "gouge it out and throw it away.
[00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:21.960]   "If your right hand causes you to stumble,
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:25.100]   "cut it off and throw it away."
[00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:28.180]   2 Corinthians 5, 17, "So if anyone is in Christ,
[00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:33.180]   "he is a new creation, what is old has passed away.
[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:36.380]   "Look, what is new has come."
[00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:42.060]   Without dying to ourselves, there will always be the risk
[00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:45.300]   of going back, doing things according to your own agenda.
[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:48.960]   Without dying to ourselves, we will want to say no
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.700]   when God says yes.
[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:53.240]   We will say stop when God says go.
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:56.600]   We'll say I'm not ready when God says go and do this for me.
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:58.920]   And the attachments we have to the things on this earth
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:01.640]   will always try to stop us
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:04.940]   from living a life full with Jesus.
[00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:08.800]   Now Jesus isn't just trying to make you
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:10.320]   a better version of yourself, right?
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.540]   Put some, you know, you put makeup on a pig,
[00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:13.840]   it's still a pig, you know what I'm saying?
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.640]   Okay, he's not just trying to give you
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.540]   a better version of yourself.
[00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:21.200]   What Jesus is offering you is a brand new life.
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.480]   And in order to have this brand new life,
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.740]   the old life must die.
[00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:28.720]   This is what it means to be born again.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.480]   This is why we sometimes, when we come to Christ,
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:33.220]   we call us the process to be born again.
[00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:36.700]   We are buried with him by baptism into death
[00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:39.360]   in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.840]   by the glory of the Father,
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:44.600]   we too might walk in the newness of life.
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:48.280]   Do you resonate with this church?
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:52.080]   Is your desire to know Jesus even in his death
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:56.700]   and going to the cross your number one priority in life?
[00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:00.600]   Are you willing not just to deny, but to die,
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.840]   to throw away your old life
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:05.880]   so that you may know and follow Jesus?
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:09.120]   I know, like I said, it sounds radical,
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:11.120]   it sounds extreme, right?
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:12.480]   Even as I was preparing this, you know,
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:15.160]   it's like, "Oh, chill, you know, it's not that serious."
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.420]   But it really is.
[00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:19.100]   It's not radical.
[00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.960]   This should be the norm for people who want,
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:24.680]   who say they follow Jesus.
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:28.360]   We should be able to stand here like Paul does and say,
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:30.600]   "I resolve to know nothing else
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:33.840]   "except Jesus Christ and him crucified."
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:37.620]   Without dying to our old life,
[00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:41.500]   we will never embrace the new life offered to us,
[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:45.280]   a life where Jesus can finally give us an invitation
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:49.920]   by saying, "Then come and follow me."
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:55.600]   This becomes your only purpose in life.
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:59.760]   Not chasing whatever feels good,
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.120]   not satisfying your flesh,
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:04.380]   but our aim after old life has been crucified
[00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:06.920]   is to wholeheartedly, single-mindedly,
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:10.920]   with every single fiber in our body, follow Jesus.
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:14.480]   This is discipleship.
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.680]   This is what it means when we say
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.240]   we're trying to grow big people,
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.240]   not in ourselves, but in Christ.
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:24.640]   When people have denied their lives to the point of death
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:26.400]   so that they can follow Jesus
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:29.520]   with absolutely nothing holding them back,
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.720]   this is the cost.
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:35.360]   This is the people that Jesus is seeking.
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:39.400]   If you really wanna experience God's forgiveness over us,
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.480]   then this is what we have to do.
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:46.040]   Deny yourself, pick up the cross, and follow him.
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:49.160]   So let me ask us again,
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:53.860]   do you want to follow Jesus?
[00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:59.320]   Because if you do, a life with Jesus will mean discipline.
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:03.200]   A life with Jesus will mean denying yourself
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:06.020]   and putting your sin and old life to death.
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:10.320]   Following Jesus, it will mean suffering.
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:13.240]   It will mean the risk of persecution.
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:16.760]   It will mean being misunderstood by people around you.
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:20.760]   It will mean wholehearted obedience to him and him alone.
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:24.880]   It's gonna mean walking by faith and not by sight.
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:27.860]   It means loving your neighbors as you love yourself.
[00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:30.400]   It's gonna mean even loving your enemies.
[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:34.220]   It's gonna mean standing up for justice.
[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:37.780]   It means loving those others have deemed as sinners.
[00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:40.160]   It means sacrificial giving.
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:42.460]   It means looking after the widows and the orphans.
[00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:46.380]   It means proclaiming the gospel boldly.
[00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:48.980]   It will mean the world might hate you.
[00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:52.460]   It's gonna mean going down the narrow, more difficult gate.
[00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:53.980]   It's gonna mean dropping everything
[00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:56.860]   like the disciples did at the sound of his voice.
[00:28:56.860 --> 00:29:00.220]   It will mean putting him above all else.
[00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:03.180]   It's gonna mean spending time in his word.
[00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:04.660]   It's gonna mean thinking about things
[00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:07.580]   that are pure and noble and true.
[00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:09.720]   It's gonna mean committing yourself to a church,
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:12.620]   the body of Christ, serving the church.
[00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:17.420]   It will mean forgiving others as Jesus has forgiven you.
[00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:20.480]   It's gonna mean loving your wife as Christ loved the church.
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:22.320]   It's gonna mean praying for your husband.
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:24.220]   It's gonna mean teaching the children
[00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:25.880]   the way they should go.
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:29.020]   I could go on and on and on and on,
[00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:32.440]   but it also means this.
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:35.980]   It also means freedom from sin and darkness.
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:39.020]   It means joy.
[00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:43.020]   It means being surrounded by a community that loves you.
[00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:45.020]   It means living a life full of the power
[00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:48.240]   of the Holy Spirit that goes with you wherever you go.
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:51.400]   It means seeing miracles, signs, and wonders.
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:53.700]   It means being filled with wonder and awe and worship.
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.060]   Even when we look up at the sky,
[00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:59.280]   we realize there's a God who created all this.
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:03.460]   It means a life full of purpose and direction.
[00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:06.740]   It's gonna mean a life that is not governed by fear,
[00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:08.880]   but driven by love.
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:11.900]   It's gonna mean a life that's free from shame.
[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:13.820]   It's gonna mean enjoying the blessings
[00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:15.960]   that God chooses to give you.
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:18.400]   It's gonna mean a life of fruit.
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.760]   It's gonna mean whole and healthy families.
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:23.260]   It's gonna mean discovering the reason
[00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:26.140]   why God put you on this earth,
[00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:28.660]   was to follow him and to worship him.
[00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:34.400]   It means becoming, it means Jesus becoming the one
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:38.320]   and only significance for your life.
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:43.320]   This, my friends, is the only life that is worth living.
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:47.880]   But it's a choice.
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.600]   Like I said in the beginning, this is a choice.
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:51.840]   It's a question of if.
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:55.860]   Which is why Jesus also gives us very clear consequences
[00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:57.760]   of what life will turn out like
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:00.400]   if we don't choose to follow him,
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.100]   if we don't put our hope with him.
[00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:07.960]   For whoever would save his life, Jesus says, will lose it.
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:12.620]   But whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.
[00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:15.180]   In other words, what he's saying is,
[00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:18.480]   the more you try to control your own life,
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:20.900]   the more you live life on your own terms,
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:23.580]   the more you refuse to deal with your sin and darkness
[00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:25.860]   and hold on to vengeance and retribution,
[00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:28.400]   the more you try to be your own savior,
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.560]   you're gonna lose your life.
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:33.940]   And I was trying to come up with a cutesy story
[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:35.940]   and an example for this, but actually,
[00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:38.260]   at the end of the day, it's just,
[00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:41.000]   this is one of those things where you have to say,
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.540]   if you know, you know.
[00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:44.900]   And you're not gonna know
[00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:47.940]   until you actually make that decision to do that.
[00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:49.700]   Because in the wisdom of this world,
[00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:51.420]   it doesn't make sense.
[00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:53.460]   It really doesn't make sense.
[00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:55.340]   The world tells us to look after yourselves,
[00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:57.580]   prioritize your needs, make your life comfortable.
[00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:59.500]   And yes, these things are important.
[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:03.580]   Don't get me wrong, this is not a call into self-abuse.
[00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:05.220]   That's not the point.
[00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:08.100]   Right, when Jesus calls someone
[00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:09.980]   to come to a life of following him,
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:12.660]   it's not a call of misery and suffering
[00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:15.340]   just for the sake of suffering.
[00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:18.020]   But he does call us to leave everything behind.
[00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:18.860]   Why?
[00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:21.660]   Because no one can serve two masters.
[00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:23.620]   He does say you have to love the Lord your God
[00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:28.180]   with all your heart, all your soul, and all your mind.
[00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:30.260]   And we're never gonna be able to do this
[00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:33.160]   by holding on to our own vision for our lives.
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:36.420]   Yeah, 'cause I know it doesn't make sense.
[00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:38.780]   But what doesn't make sense
[00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:40.940]   is actually the way it's supposed to be.
[00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:44.860]   So let us not be so foolish and be deceived
[00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:46.900]   to think that the world's way of doing things
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:49.120]   is the right way to do it.
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:51.300]   Right, scripture tells us that it might sound
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:53.940]   like foolishness from the world's perspective,
[00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:58.480]   but the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom.
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:00.380]   1 Corinthians 1:25.
[00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:03.700]   And this will only make sense
[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:05.560]   when Jesus has transformed your mind,
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:07.860]   when your hearts are renewed,
[00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:10.020]   when we have died and received new life,
[00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:12.020]   when we see the freedom that comes
[00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:13.980]   and the fruit that comes with a life
[00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:18.160]   wholeheartedly devoted to walking with Jesus.
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:24.160]   It's like what the people do in Matthew 13 in this parable.
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:27.800]   The kingdom of heaven following Jesus.
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:30.920]   It's like treasure hidden in a field.
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:34.620]   When a man found it, he hid it again,
[00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:38.520]   then in his joy went out and sold everything he had
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:40.720]   and bought that field.
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.760]   Again, following Jesus is like a merchant
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:44.440]   looking for fine pearls.
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.760]   When he had found one of great value,
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:51.760]   he went away, sold everything he had and bought it.
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:58.180]   The only thing, the only way to find out
[00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:00.600]   what Jesus has in store for you
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:04.160]   is for you to give him everything you've got.
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:07.320]   It will cost you everything.
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:10.660]   There are no half measures in this journey.
[00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:15.880]   It's sink or swim, but when you give everything you've got
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:20.840]   to Jesus, he promises to give you life
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:23.900]   and life in the full in return.
[00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:28.160]   Now, how does this relate to forgiveness?
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:32.200]   Well, you see, this is what forgiveness is really for then.
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:34.920]   I think I alluded it at the beginning of the message.
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:37.040]   It's not the get out of jail free card
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:39.600]   that we think gives us permission to do whatever we want
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:41.960]   and God asks God to pardon us, you know,
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:44.080]   do it first, ask forgiveness later.
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:47.440]   Like I said, that's cheapening God's grace.
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:49.720]   But forgiveness becomes this sort of guidance
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:52.440]   and encouragement for those who have made that decision
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:55.240]   to follow Jesus with everything they have.
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:58.100]   Because Jesus knows, God knows in this journey,
[00:34:58.100 --> 00:34:59.680]   you're gonna mess up.
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:01.120]   Right, we are not perfect people.
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:05.080]   We're on the way to our citizenship in heaven,
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:07.160]   but we're not quite there yet.
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:09.120]   So you're gonna stumble, you're gonna fall,
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:10.740]   you're gonna mess up, you're gonna make mistakes
[00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:12.560]   along the way.
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:14.700]   But this is where forgiveness comes in.
[00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:17.680]   This is where God comes along and uses forgiveness
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:20.760]   as an encouragement when you fail and you fall
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:23.320]   to pick you back up when we make those bad choices
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:26.160]   to say it's okay, just keep walking this way,
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:29.500]   keep coming along with me, I have forgiven you.
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:34.400]   If we're dedicated to walking this way with Jesus,
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:37.200]   then forgiveness becomes like a safety net
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.000]   that catches us when we fall
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   and encourages us along to carry on.
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:46.880]   Without forgiveness, our relationship with Jesus
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:48.740]   would not be possible.
[00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:52.960]   And so you see all these prayers, church,
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:55.960]   this isn't actually a call for forgiveness, I think.
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:58.940]   All these prayers that we wrote out as a church,
[00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:02.500]   I see this as a desire, as a heart,
[00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:06.080]   as a cry to make us more like you, Jesus.
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:07.720]   We wanna be more like you.
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:10.080]   I wanna deal with this junk, I wanna deal with this stuff
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:14.200]   in my life so that I can embrace the true life
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:18.460]   that you've given me, so that I can be free to follow you.
[00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:23.480]   So let's not cheapen forgiveness, church.
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:29.000]   In order for Jesus to forgive us, it cost him his life.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.580]   So it's only fitting that if we want forgiveness,
[00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:35.940]   we have to give him our lives.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.920]   This is the kind of people he's looking for.
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:43.880]   So don't wait.
[00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:47.120]   This is my last encouragement to you, don't wait.
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:50.880]   If you have been reminded that Jesus asks of you today,
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:54.360]   or this is the first time you're making such a decision,
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:55.520]   do it now.
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:58.400]   Right, some of us, I know when we hear a message like this,
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:36:59.960]   okay, I know, Alison, I know,
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:01.720]   but just I need a bit more time,
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:04.680]   there's certain things I need to deal with first, okay.
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.220]   Do this, maybe experience this
[00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:08.940]   before I give my life to Jesus.
[00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:13.360]   There's a passage about this.
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:16.300]   Jesus warns us against this, right.
[00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:18.120]   Those of us who say, I'm gonna take life easy,
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:20.760]   eat, drink, and be merry, and then I'll go on
[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.960]   and about my business with the Lord.
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:25.960]   Only for God to respond, you fool.
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:28.960]   Tonight, this very night, your life
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:31.160]   will be demanded from you.
[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:36.320]   We don't know how much time we have, church.
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:41.720]   Jesus is coming back, you could be called back home today.
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:46.300]   Today, right now, in this moment,
[00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:50.460]   is the time to make that decision to follow Him,
[00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:55.460]   to discover the life that He has called you to live,
[00:37:55.460 --> 00:38:00.360]   the only path that leads to true life.
[00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:04.760]   So I wonder if you would pray with me, church.
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:14.220]   Like I said, the series on forgiveness ends today,
[00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:16.460]   but our need for forgiveness will never end
[00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:19.540]   until we see Jesus face to face.
[00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:24.500]   So our prayer is that we would be a church,
[00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:28.940]   a generation that, a body of Christ
[00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:31.620]   that decides to take Jesus seriously
[00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:36.020]   at His word, that when we say we're living
[00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:40.360]   for Jesus and Him alone, we really mean that.
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:44.340]   That we are a church that values the gift
[00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:49.340]   of forgiveness so, so much, we realize
[00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:51.180]   what it costs Jesus, that as a church,
[00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:54.020]   we've decided we're not gonna cheat this cheaply
[00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:55.180]   and with contempt.
[00:38:55.180 --> 00:39:01.240]   Instead, I'm gonna embrace it in my life,
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:06.240]   and use it as the way Jesus shapes us
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:11.260]   and molds us to be more like Him.
[00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:20.060]   And the good news is that we don't do this alone, church.
[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:26.220]   And we have the Holy Spirit that guides us,
[00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:28.100]   that leads us, that walks alongside us,
[00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:30.380]   that helps us do impossible things,
[00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:32.520]   things we could never do by our own power.
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:36.260]   The ability to resist sin, to run from temptation,
[00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:38.580]   to put our old lives to death.
[00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:42.460]   That is done through the power of the Holy Spirit
[00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:43.900]   at work in your lives.
[00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:51.660]   And so Jesus, we come before you now as a church.
[00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:57.180]   As people making up the body of Christ,
[00:39:57.180 --> 00:40:01.680]   as your children who you've made in your image, God.
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:10.380]   To say, and if you really wanna say this,
[00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:12.720]   then I pray that this is your prayer.
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:15.980]   To say, Jesus, I give my life to you.
[00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:22.920]   I'm willing to walk away, to put to death even,
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:25.360]   everything else in my life,
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:29.160]   in order that I may know you and you first and foremost.
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:37.380]   That I might embrace your purposes and your will
[00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:41.080]   and your vision and your calling for my life.
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:46.400]   And whatever it costs, Jesus, I'm willing to do this
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:49.700]   because I know this is where the true purpose
[00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:51.100]   of my life is found.
[00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:56.100]   So Jesus, help us in this journey.
[00:40:56.100 --> 00:41:00.720]   Holy Spirit, help us in this journey.
[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:05.580]   And help us to encourage each other too.
[00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:07.120]   This is why you've binded us together.
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:09.340]   This is why the church matters.
[00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:10.360]   We don't do this alone.
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:11.440]   Yes, we have the Holy Spirit.
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:14.240]   We also have each other to help us along.
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:18.700]   To pray, to be an example, to encourage.
[00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:24.700]   So Jesus, may we be people who are wholeheartedly,
[00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:30.840]   all in, fully dedicated to following you,
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:33.420]   no matter what it costs us.
[00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:37.600]   In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:47.600]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
