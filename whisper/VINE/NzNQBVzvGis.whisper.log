[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   In the summer of 2002, I was driving south on Highway 1 from Monterey, California.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   And I pulled up on the side of the road, I started hiking up this trail, this familiar trail in the coastal mountains.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Now if you're not familiar with California, and particularly that stretch of California,
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   it is some of the most beautiful central coastline there is.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   I mean it is absolutely beautiful.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   There is redwood trees, there is wildlife, there is the Pacific Ocean, and you have incredible views.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   And so I wanted to go and hike to this bench that had an amazing view.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   And I wanted to spend some time there with God, to pray, to hear from Him, to seek Him.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   And so as I finally made my way up to this bench, which was quite a hike,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   I sat down on it, and I noticed that there was a plaque on the bench.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Now one of those planks that usually mentions who donated to the bench.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   So as I was reading the plaque, it said, "There has been a change of plans."
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   And I just had to smile, because that summed up my life in the last year.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   You know, God had spoken to me, and unexpectedly there was a change of plans
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   that had turned things upside down for me.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Now, we, as Christians, we all, in one way or another, experience God speaking to us,
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   giving us words, giving us new direction.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   And that can look different ways for different people.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   I know for some of you, that has meant joining this church plant,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   where there was a word at the beginning when we announced we're going to plant a church in Yulong,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   and some of you felt a stirring, this word from God, to be part of this community
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   and be part of the work that God wanted to do here.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   So God spoke to you in that way, and I believe for many of you it was unexpected,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   because you didn't know we were going to do that.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Then that might be in your workplace, that God maybe calls you into a different workplace,
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   or He calls you into doing something differently in your workplace than you have done it before.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   And so what I want to do in this message, I want to explore with you today a question.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   And the question is, how can we say yes to God's work in our lives and be open to His leading?
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   How do we do that?
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   How do we say yes and surrender ourselves to what God is saying to us and then walk in it?
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Easier said than done, right?
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Yes.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   So we're continuing in our Advent Sermon series, "Surprising Joy."
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Now you might wonder, what does a change of plans have to do with joy?
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Those two might not go together in your mind.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   So I want to say a little bit about that.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   A lot of times when God does have a word for us, speaks to us about something,
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   initially it's not easy.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Actually, a lot of times we complain when God gives us a new word.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   And we're like, "Oh, no, I don't think this is God. I think this is from somebody else.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   I don't want this."
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   And then we wrestle with it.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   And it's only a lot of times later when we actually walk in obedience to that word
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   that there is a surprising joy that comes.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   So that's where we're going to head today.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   And so I just felt like I should say this up front because a lot of times you don't associate change
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   with surprising joy.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   So today we're going to pick up where Pastor John left off last week.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   We looked last week at the story of Zachariah and Elizabeth and how God met them.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   They had been praying for a child, and God met Zachariah in the temple,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   and he promised them that Elizabeth would be with child,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   that he would prepare the way of the Lord.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   And then at the end of the passage that we looked at last week,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   this incredible miracle happened because Elizabeth was barren,
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   so she hadn't been able to conceive.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   And now in old age, she was found to be pregnant.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   And so we talked about these desert and barren seasons in which God meets us
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   and where he can surprise us with joy, even on the ones where we've given up on,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   where we stop believing that God can meet us in those places.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   So today we're going to pick up literally at the verse where we left off last time.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   So we are in Luke 1:26.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   So let me read it to you.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   "In the sixth month of Elizabeth's pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   a town in Galilee, to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph,
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   a descendant of David.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   The virgin's name was Mary.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   The angel went to her and said, 'Greetings, you who are highly favored.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   The Lord is with you.'
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be."
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   So in the previous passage, the angel met Zechariah in the temple
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   as he was doing his priestly service.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   And so now we hear that the angel is meeting Mary in Galilee in a town of Nazareth.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   One took place in a place of prominence and of importance that people would perceive
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   in a temple, you know, it's the center of the worship of Israel.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   The other one literally took place in the middle of nowhere.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   And as a matter of fact, Nazareth was so insignificant
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   that it's not even mentioned in the Old Testament.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   When Philip was introducing Nathaniel in the Gospel of John to Jesus of Nazareth,
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Nathaniel responded, "Nazareth? Can anything good come from there?"
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   So on top of not being significant, it didn't even have a good reputation.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   So we see that it's quite an extreme contrast of where the angel meets Zechariah
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   and where he meets Mary.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   So perhaps it's actually important for us today to be reminded
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   that God doesn't just show up in the moments like just at church,
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   even though he does do that too, but he shows up in our everyday moments,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   even in mundane ones where we think he isn't there.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Because for God, every place, every moment is sacred and he is everywhere.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   And he often meets us in unexpected places during unexpected times.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   I sense we need to hear that because sometimes we feel like we need to go
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   to a certain place to hear from God, but God can speak to you where you are.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   He can speak to you in the season that you are in in your life.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   So I guess the question is, are we ready, right, to hear?
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Well, next we were introduced to Mary and we're told that she is pledged to be married to Joseph.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Now, Luke doesn't explain what "pledged" means.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Another word for this would be she's betrothed.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   So what that meant in a cultural context is that Mary's father has agreed
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   that Joseph is allowed to marry Mary and Joseph has paid her a bridal price.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   And Mary has as of yet not moved in with Joseph, so that's the pledging period,
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   the period in between. So that's what's going on there.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   And so the angel tells Mary in verse 28, "Greetings, you who are highly favored.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   The Lord is with you."
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   But then we're told that Mary is troubled, not at his presence,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   but she's actually troubled at his words.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   Interesting, right?
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   I think if an angel shows up, I would freak out because there's an angel there.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Maybe he could handle the words more, but she is freaked out or troubled by his words, by what he says.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   So let's think about that a little bit more.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   Why is Mary troubled?
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   What's so troubling about what the angel says?
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Now, imagine you have an ambassador of the president of some important country.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   You can choose your country. Everyone have a country?
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Yes? Okay, good.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   And then the person comes to you in your home, comes to you in your workplace,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   and they say, "Greetings, Derek, you who are highly favored."
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   And you're like, "Okay, hi."
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   And if I would be greeted this way, "Greetings, Tim, you who are highly favored,"
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   I'm like, "Did the angel or did the ambassador, is he getting the right Tim?
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   I'm waiting for somebody else because I'm not at the center of power.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   I don't think that any ambassador or any president has any message for me.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   And so why in the world would that guy or that woman show up and give me this strange message?
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   Because I don't perceive myself as somebody who would get this type of message."
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   And that's how Mary must have felt, that she didn't feel like she was the type of person
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   who would get this type of message from God.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   "You who are highly favored, the Lord is with you."
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   Because she didn't perceive herself in that way,
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   that she would be the type of person who would receive this type of message.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   She was a teenage girl, probably 12, 13 years old.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   At that time, women got engaged and married.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   She was young. She was in an insignificant town.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   She was seen by her contemporary society as insignificant.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   And yet here, this messenger from God shows up in her house and delivers her this message.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   So this is a lot to process.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   Are you sure you have the right person?
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   But when God, through His Word and His Spirit, sort of breaks into our mundane, our everyday life,
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   I think a lot of us can relate to how Mary feels.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   Like, are you sure you have the right person?
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   Are you sure you're asking the right person to do this, whatever He's asking you to do?
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Because a lot of times we don't think that we're the right person.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   We don't feel like we're qualified.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   We don't think we have what it takes or whatever God brings our way.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   We think this message must be for somebody else.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   And so there is just a lot to process.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   So how would you feel when God has a word for you and meets you and speaks to you?
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   Well, let's continue in our passage.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   It says, in verse 30, it says this, "But the angel said to her, 'Do not be afraid, Mary.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   You have found favor with God.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David,
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   and he will reign over Jacob's descendants forever.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   His kingdom will never end.'"
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   How will this be, Mary asked the angel, since I'm a virgin?
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   So the angel's message reassures Mary, "Do not be afraid."
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   So there was some fear in this encounter.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   The words stirred fear in her, and he reassures her, "Don't be afraid.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   You have found favor with God."
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Notice the second time that the angel mentions favor.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   First she was highly favored.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   Now he says, "You are favored."
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   What does that mean, to be favored by God?
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   Does it mean you're God's favorite, like the only favorite?
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   Well, having God's favor means that God is showing you grace.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   He's showing you his goodness, his mercy.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   A lot of times when we think of grace, we think of forgiveness.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   And that is one of the most amazing graces, like the song says,
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   that we can receive in our lives, that we know the grace of Jesus, his forgiveness.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   But God's grace is much bigger than that.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   His favor is much bigger than that.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   Now here in Mary's instance, the favor is also that God is involving her in her work, in his work.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   That God is inviting her into being part of this beautiful thing that God is doing.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   That's also God's favor, that he invites us into the things that he is doing.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   And he does it with every Christian in different ways.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   There's also God's favor, God's grace in that.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   But it also means that he will provide what is needed.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   He promises Mary his presence.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   He's going to be with her. The Lord is with you.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   She's not going to be alone in what he's asking her to do.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   He's going to provide for her what she needs to carry out what he's asking her to carry out.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   So that's also the favor and the grace of God.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   And of course, the biggest favor that we experience is that we become part of the family of God.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   You know, that we are children of God.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   And God's grace we can never earn.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   We don't deserve it.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   But it's just something that he loves to give when we come to him and when we receive this gift.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   And it's the same with these things that he brings to us.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   It's a gift of grace.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   We can reject it or we can receive it.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   And just trust that he is with us and that he will give us what we need to do whatever he's inviting us into.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   Now Mary finds also out some of the details of what it means to be highly favored.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   Probably not what we would associate with being highly favored.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   Or maybe in some ways yes, in some ways no.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   She is told that she will bear a son.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   And through what the angel Gabriel says, it's also very clear that this will be the Messiah.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   He's actually quoting verses from 2 Samuel 7 where there's a promise to King David
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   that he will have a descendant who will reign on his throne forever.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   And so Mary knew this.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   And so she's understanding, wow, process that information, right?
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   Who can process that?
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   So she learns a little bit about the identity of the child that she will have.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   And suddenly also the name Jesus, Yeshua, takes on a different significance.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   It's a common name during Jesus' time actually, the name Jesus.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   But it means God saves, God heals.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   That's literally what Jesus was going to do.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   He had come to save the world from their sins and to restore them back to the Father.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   Restore us back to the Father.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   Wow, what an incredible word for Mary.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   Now there's two shocking things in here, right?
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   Actually, it's probably more than that, but I'm just going to talk about two.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   The first one is that she is going to give birth to the expected, the longed-for Messiah,
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   the one that Israel has been waiting for, the rescuer, the redeemer.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   Wow, that's a message.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   And probably very personally shocking to her is that she's going to have a child, but she is a virgin.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   She has had no sexual relationships with a man.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   Wow.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   Now there's precedent in the Bible for God blessing families with children, you know,
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   deep down the line when they thought they couldn't conceive and God does a miracle,
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   like we saw with Zachariah and Elizabeth, that she was barren, but he did a miracle and gave them a child.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   But there is no precedent for what's going to happen with Mary,
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   where somebody who is not yet married, who is pledged but not yet married,
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   and who is a virgin and is told that she will have a child.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   So Mary has some questions.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   I think we can all understand that, right?
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   If that was coming to all the women in here your way, you would have some questions.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   Like how, Lord, what, how does this work?
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   And so what I love is that Mary actually brings her question to God
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   by asking the angel who is the representative for God in this case.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   How will this be since I am a virgin?
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   Now I want us to notice that.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   You know, she could have just said, no thanks, moved on,
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   but she chooses to actually to engage with a question, just wanting to understand, Lord.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   I want to understand how is this possible? How will this be?
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   Can you help me? I need to understand this.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   You're asking me to do this. Can you help me understand this?
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   That's actually an act of faith.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   There's maybe some questions, some doubts in there.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   But she's trying to understand.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   And that faith of trying to understand that honors God.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   So let's see how, actually, what the response is.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   So in verse 35, let's go there.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   It says this, "The angel answered, 'The Holy Spirit will come on you,
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   and the power of the Mosaic will overshadow you.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   So the Holy One to be born will be called the Son of God.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   Even Elizabeth, your relative, is going to have a child in her old age.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   And she who was said to be unable to conceive is in the sixth month.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   For no word from God will ever fail.'"
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   Now, what I love is that Mary asked a question,
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   God actually gives her an answer.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   He actually does respond to her question.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   Now, God invites us always to ask Him questions.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   Whether we think they're big or small, we can bring any question to Him.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   When He asks us to do something, when there's a word that breaks in,
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   or even for anything in your life, God welcomes questions.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   God invites them.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   Now, we don't always get an answer immediately.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   In this case, Mary gets an answer immediately.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   A lot of times it comes later.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   A lot of times it's not the answer that we expect.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   But she does get an answer.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   And the answer is that the Holy Spirit will come upon her.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   It's the same Spirit of God who is part of God's creation
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   who will create this child within her and will do this miracle within her.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   So that's the answer that she gets.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   And the angel then shares a powerful truth with Mary.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   And I think she really needed to hear this word to be able to cope with all that she's being told.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   And it's in verse 37.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   I have two translations.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   One says, "For no word from God will ever fail."
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   You know, what I'm saying is going to come to pass.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   God's Word never fails.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   It never returns void.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   Another way to translate it is, "For nothing will be impossible with God."
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   You know, nothing is impossible with God.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   Now, what Mary heard seemed impossible.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   But God is ensuring her.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   Nothing is impossible with God.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   And if God calls you to something, if he asks you to do something, you know, it is possible.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   And we lose sight of--we get caught up with the impossible.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   And we focus on that.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   And we get fearful and we get stuck on that.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   But I believe that the angel is giving this word to Mary because she needs to be reminded of who God is, who is making this ask.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   It's not just anyone.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   It's not, you know, somebody, a relative asking her, you know, this question.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   It's God.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   The creator of the universe.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   The almighty with all power who has no limitations.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   He can create things out of nothing.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   And so she needs to remember who God is.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   Now, this is the biggest news that I think I can imagine dropping into somebody's lap.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   Right?
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   What a message to receive for a teenage girl in the middle of nowhere.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   And Mary, she must have been aware of all the shame and all the talking of people that would be involved in that.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   Now, here she is pregnant.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   You can't hide your pregnancy.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   And people can see it.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   And in a cultural context, there was a huge stigma on that.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   Actually, it was even theoretically punishable by death.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   Now, at that time, that was not usually exercised.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   But it was a very serious matter.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   And who would believe her if she explains, well, God told me that the Holy Spirit, you know, will create his child within me.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   Who's going to believe that?
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   As a matter of fact, Joseph didn't believe her, the man that she was engaged with.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   He didn't believe her.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   When he found out that she was pregnant, he wanted to quietly divorce her.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   It was only when the angel appeared to Joseph that he believed Mary.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   So this is a very costly ask.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   I mean, it's not an easy thing that God is inviting Mary into.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   Now, of course, it's also incredible, and I don't want to lose sight of that as well,
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   like that she gets to give birth to the savior of this world.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   She gets to give birth to the messiah they long for, you know, rescue and redeem and king.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   But it's both of these things.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   And a lot of times when we hear this Christmas narrative over and over again,
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   for those of you who have been in church for quite a while, it's easy to forget the shocking nature, you know, of this ask, right?
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   I mean, it's not an easy ask.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   So how does Mary respond to this?
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   Well, we can read about that in verse 38.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   She says, "I am the Lord's servant," Mary answered.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   "May your word to me be fulfilled."
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   Then the angel left her.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   "I am the Lord's servant. May your word to me be fulfilled."
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   Wow.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   What faith and courage from this teenage girl.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   You know, make herself available, God, to surrender to him, to trust him,
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   that he will provide what is needed in this very difficult circumstance that she will have to be walking through.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   But she has faith, and God has assured her, and she believes this assurance.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   She believes that nothing is impossible with God.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   She believes that the Lord is with her.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   And so she takes this step of faith and surrenders and makes herself available.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   I mean, it's just incredible.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   Now, what about us?
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   What if God brings us a word, asks us to do something?
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   What if there is a change of plans that he has for you?
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   Which brings us back to the opening question.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   How can we say yes to God's work in our lives and be open to his leading?
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   How can we be like Mary and just say, "I am the Lord's servant. May your word to me be fulfilled."
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   Now, earlier I started off with a story of going to a bench and sitting on this bench that said,
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   "There has been a change of plans."
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   Now, what had happened?
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   Well, I was in my early 20s.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   I was working as a financial advisor for Morgan Stanley in Monterey, California.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   And I was attending Santa Cruz Bible Church.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   Santa Cruz where all the surfing and all that happens, also an exciting place.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   And in that church, they had a tradition where every year they had a missions month
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   where they had missionaries, mission partners that they supported that came.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   They preached. They shared about the work that they did.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   And the first Sunday, I'm listening to, I can't remember who it was, who was preaching.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   And I'm just wrecked.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   I have tears in my eyes, which I think might have been the first time I had tears in my eyes in church in my life.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   And I'm like trying to figure out what's happening to me.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   Like what's going on?
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   What does this mean?
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   So I talked to a friend and he's like, "Well, I think God might be asking you to do something or so."
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   I said, "Oh, interesting."
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   So I prayed over there, talked to some friends about this.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   Next Sunday, same thing.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   Tears.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   I was like, "Oh, my God, what does this mean?"
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   Third Sunday, even worse.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   It's like snot.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   You know, like we're talking like the full weeping and things.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   And I'm just like, "What in the world?"
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   But on that third Sunday, I was very clear that God was calling me to serve him.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   I didn't understand how.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   I wasn't really on that trajectory.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   But I also had the strong sense that I actually needed to quit my job.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   That's kind of a scary move.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   So that day, I don't remember when, I think it was right after the service.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   It's a long time ago.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   I drove to the office, cleared out my office.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   The next day, I came in not with a suit, but in my casual clothes.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   I walked to my boss, and I told him that God was asking me to do something
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   and that I needed to quit my job.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   And my boss actually commended me for my courage.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   He's like, "Wow, that's a courageous thing to do."
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   But he also told me, "Don't show up at another investment firm
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   because we invested a lot of money in you.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   If you show up somewhere else, we need to charge you for that."
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   I was like, "Okay, I'm very sorry. I'm sorry, sorry."
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   Okay, so now I quit my job.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   I don't have a job, but I don't know what I'm doing.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   And actually, one important part of the story is,
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   which I didn't realize at that time, and I think that that's not normal,
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   like right away quitting your job, so just saying that.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   But what I realized was that I was about to invest a lot of money
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   for somebody I knew.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   Actually, I was already in process in the making.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   And if that would have gone through, I could have not backed out.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   I would have been stuck in my workplace.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   And so I actually even went back to the office, told the cashier,
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   "Hey, when this check comes in, can you let me know so I can get it,
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   send it back to the people?"
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   So this was also part of God's time.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   He pulled me out this last second before I was so committed
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   that there was no way out.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   And there really would have been no immediate way out.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   So I didn't tell my parents about this because I knew what they would say,
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   so then I did call them, and they were freaked out.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   "You are making the biggest mistake of your life.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   This is the second job you're quitting
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   within not too long a period of time.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   People are going to think you're flaky.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   Nobody will ever want to hire you again."
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   Thank you, Mom and Dad, for the encouragement.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   But honestly, just true feelings from a parent, right?
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   Being worried about their son who's just starting his career life.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   And so I started freaking out.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   Did I hear God wrong?
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   Did I make a big mistake?
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   And so I needed to bring those fears and questions to God.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   So I prayed, "God, can you just help me understand this?"
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   I also prayed that my parents would actually see that God had called me
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   and was asking me to do something differently,
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   that there was a change of plans.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   So then I ended up getting a different job in the meantime
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   because I needed to pay my bills.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   And I applied for one of the organizations that I heard share
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   on one of the Mission Sundays.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   So I ended up going with an organization called Mercy Ships,
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   a medical mission ship bringing hope and healing,
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   most of the time along the west coast of Africa.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   So I joined them in Sierra Leone and in Senegal.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   I did a discipleship training school there.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   Shout out to my YWAM friends here,
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   where I served in the finance department half the time,
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   attended that school, and then we had an outreach.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   So I did that.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   And during that time, God answered a lot of questions I had as well
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   because I was like, "Do I even have what it takes to serve God in this way?"
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   because I really didn't perceive or see myself in this way.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   Like I said, that was not my trajectory beforehand.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   All my friends were surprised at this.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   And so then I finished that time--
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   and I'm going to wrap up the story in a second--
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   and I felt like if God is asking me to do this,
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   I probably need to study, go to seminary, get some education.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   But I had borrowed a lot of money from my parents to do this mercy ship thing
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   because I didn't have much time to raise funds,
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   so I owed them quite a bit of money.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   And they were like, "Yeah, you're going to pay that back."
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   So I was like, "God, can you provide for me?"
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   And I only applied to one seminary, and I got 100% scholarship.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   And for me, if you don't know seminaries, they don't give much scholarships.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   So for me, this was just incredible, God providing.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   So now I was in California.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   I was going there to clear up my stuff and move to Texas to go to seminary,
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   but I was on this mountain, and all these things had happened.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   I was just amazed how God had changed my life and the plans for my life.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   Now, this is my messy journey,
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   and certainly maybe I didn't do everything in the perfect way in that process,
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   but that was just my journey.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   And I also want to be very clear.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   I believe that God doesn't call most people to be pastors or do mission work.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   I believe most people He calls us to workplaces
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   where He has something specific He wants us to do in an organization,
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   or He calls us in a family to do something there,
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   or maybe through the church and the community.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   So I just also want to be very clear on that.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   But this brings us back to that question.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   If God speaks to us, how do we respond to His leading?
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   Do we say yes to Him? Do we surrender to Him?
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   Do we say, "Lord, not my way, but Your way"?
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   And so I want to give six things to keep in mind when we respond to God's leading.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   When you sense that God is speaking to you and you're trying to process this,
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   I want to give six things.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   So up here behind me.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   The first one is, ask, "Is this leading truly from God?"
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   Now the last thing I want is that people are quitting their jobs,
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   and two years later, they're like, "I quit the job because of your sermon,
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   and nothing has happened. What's wrong with you?"
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   So we do need to discern.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   Is this really God?
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   And of course, looking at Scripture, this is in line with Scripture.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   But the other thing is, do talk to some trusted friends,
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   your community group, your pastor.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   Stay with you. Ask them to give their perspective.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   People that love you, that know you.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   And get their input.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   Now ultimately, you still will own your decision.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   You'll take ownership of your decision.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   But do get the input from others.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   Invite them into the discerning process with you.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   That's the first thing.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   The second thing is, a lot of times when you do get a word from God
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   where He asks us to do something, there is a lot of fear.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   There is complaining.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   "I don't want anything to change."
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   And these fears that come up, they can drive us away from God,
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   or they can actually draw us closer to God.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   And I just want to encourage you to engage with God.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   Bring your fears to God.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   Ask Him to meet you in that,
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   as you're wrestling with what He's saying to you,
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   as you're trying to figure out and make sense.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   Because it comes unexpected.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   We can't prepare for that God will suddenly speak to us in our house,
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   in our workplace, and has this direction-changing word for us.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   Third thing, seek answers to your questions from God.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   Mary asked, "How will this be?"
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   I had questions about my leadership.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   Can I even do this?
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   Am I even the right type of person for this sort of stuff?
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   Now Mary got an answer right away from me.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   It was like seven months, eight months later.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   But ask God questions.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   He welcomes our questions, and He does respond to us.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   Maybe not always in the timing when we want to.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   Maybe not even in the way that we want to,
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   but He does respond to us.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   So bring your questions to God.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   Then the fourth one is surrender to God's will.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   There is a point where we actually have to make a decision.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   Are we going to say yes to what God wants to do?
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   Are we going to be like Mary?
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   I am the Lord's servant.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   May your word to me be fulfilled.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   Are we actually going to say that?
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   Lord, I'm available.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   I trust you.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   Even though I don't understand everything, even though I don't know how to do everything,
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   I'm just going to say yes to you because I know who you are.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   So there's that point where we actually have to make that decision.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   And then when fear arises, because it will along the way,
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   I was freaked out when I talked to my parents.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   All their anxieties I suddenly felt.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   And I wondered myself, did I make the biggest mistake of my life?
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   Did I hear God wrong?
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   But what do we do when those fears start to overwhelm us
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   and they start drowning us?
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   Well, we need to look to God.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   Nothing is impossible with God.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   God is with us.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   Those were two affirmations to Mary.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   And we need to remember who God is.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   Now, when I was a youth pastor early on here in Hong Kong,
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   I started off in one of the youth groups.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   And for a year, nothing was happening.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   And I really was struggling.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   Am I the right guy for this?
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   And I wrestled.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   Did I hear you wrong?
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   Am I in the wrong place?
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   And God, as I was looking at God, I was like, no.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   God brought me here.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   This was not my idea.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   This was God's idea.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   And he knows me even better than I know myself.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   And he knows the people who are better than myself.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   And if this is his idea to have me here,
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   then I must be the right person,
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   and that really gave me comfort and courage.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   Just remember, God even understands me better than I understand myself.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   And then finally, we discover the joy that comes from walking in God's calling.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   Now, the joy doesn't come always right away.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   I'm sure that Mary initially,
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   even though there was also excitement with the Messiah part,
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   that it was quite costly, quite heavy to say yes to what God was asking of you.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   But even in this next, if you just read on a little bit,
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   there's actually the Magnificat where Mary praises God,
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   where there is joy.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   And so joy comes later,
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   and it is that surprising joy of being obedient to God.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   It doesn't mean that what we're doing is easy.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   God asks us to do things that are outside of our comfort zone a lot of times,
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   that are a lot of times challenging,
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   that might never be super easy,
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   but we can know his presence.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   We can know his power.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   We can know his goodness.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   And there is joy in also just being used by God,
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   even if it's not easy.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   And so we're surprised by joy.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   Now, I want to invite the worship team to come up.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   And I don't know what your thinking has been
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   or what you have been processing as I've been sharing a message on Mary
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   and how she responded to this announcement from this angel
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   that he gave her and even my own story.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   If there are some words from God that maybe you're right now wrestling with,
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   maybe they're not,
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   but I actually want to just encourage you even with these six points,
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   if there's something that God is inviting you to do,
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   I actually just want to give a moment for you to respond to God.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   And so why don't we do this right now?
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   I'll just give a moment of just talking to God about what he's been speaking to you through the service,
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   and then afterwards I'll pray for us.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   So why don't we do this?
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   Just take a minute.
