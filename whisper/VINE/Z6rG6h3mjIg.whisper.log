[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Stop, think, don't do something stupid.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Sounds quite simple, right?
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   We stop whatever we're doing,
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   we take time to reflect and we think,
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   and because we do that,
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   we're able to make better decisions
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   that are good for ourselves,
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   but also decisions that are better for other people.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   But I have a question.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   Do we actually really do that?
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Sometimes we do, but a lot of times we don't.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   And I want to share with you a time when I have not done that.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   So in 2010 to 2013,
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   I was living in Hong Kong,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   this was the first time around.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   I was working for a church full-time,
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   but I also studied full-time for three years.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   And so the way I did my work was,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   I worked, I came home, I studied, I went to bed.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   And then I repeat the next day.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   And then on the days that I was off,
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   I also worked all day because that was the time
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   when I really could get my studies,
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   take care of my studies.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   And so I just kept going in this brutal cycle,
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   and one thing I didn't do
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   was I didn't schedule in some rest.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   I just, you know, went for it.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   But the problem was there were signs
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   that something was not going right that I ignored.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   I don't know if you ever do that.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   So I started gaining a lot of weight.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   My back started hurting.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Friendships started to suffer
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   because the only way I could carry friendships was at work.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   But I still kept going.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   I ignored the warning signs.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   And so I ended up having so much back pain,
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   I had a prolapsed disc
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   where I had this sharp pain running down my leg.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   So prolapsed disc, slipped disc.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   I started to not be able to walk that far anymore.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   And I suddenly had these sharp pains
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   where it didn't matter where I was,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   I had to sit down on the floor
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   and curl up in some position
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   so that I could deal with the pain.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   And so we're talking Hong Kong streets.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Laying on the streets, curling up in a position
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   so I wasn't in pain.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   And as you know, Hong Kong streets are not very clean.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   So not a great place to do that.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   But I kept going, right?
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   And that was not the only thing that suffered.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   My friendship suffered
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   and also my relationship with God suffered as well.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Because when you keep going and going and going
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   and you're just grinding
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   and you're in this brutal cycle of work without rest,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   it's hard to actually enjoy
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   and be in a relationship with God
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   and to hear from God.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   And so spiritually I was also dry
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   a lot of the times during that time period.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   But I'm sure that I'm not the only one who does it.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   I'm sure that I'm not the only one
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   whose life has started to spin out of control
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   because of a relentless schedule.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   As Benedict already mentioned,
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   the city can be relentless in terms of what it demands of you.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Maybe it's your workplace
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   where you have a job,
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   your colleague quits,
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   suddenly you need to do your colleague's work.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   But guess what?
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   They're not hiring somebody to replace your colleague.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Boo!
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Right? Boo!
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Well, so suddenly you have this crushing workload
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   that you need to carry.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Or maybe, I just learned this, I'm very proud of this,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   the 9-9-6 work culture.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   9am to 9pm, six days a week.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Maybe that is your schedule.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   And beyond that,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   there's not much time for anything else.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Then sometimes also work doesn't just take place in a workplace.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Work also takes place at home.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   So there might be demands at home.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   So there's a lot of things that can make our schedule
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   quite brutal, quite relentless.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   And if we don't have times of rest,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   this relentless schedule starts crushing us.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   And it comes at a high cost.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   And there's pressures that work two ways.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   There's internal pressure and there's external pressure.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   External pressure is what I was describing with our jobs
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   and our circumstances, maybe at home.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   But then there's the internal pressure as well.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   And that's actually striving.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Where we're trying to be someone, please someone,
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   be accepted by someone.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   And there's something within us that makes us feel like
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   we cannot relax.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Because if I relax, I'm not going to pass my studies.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   If I relax, I'm not going to be able to hold this degree.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   So I always need to work.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   I just need to keep going.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   I need to keep pushing.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   And so there are these external and internal forces
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   that we experience.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Is anyone tired by now?
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Talking about not resting?
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   I feel kind of tired.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   But what I want to do with you,
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   I want to explore with you a question.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   And that's this.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   How can we cultivate a life that is marked by rest
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   and not striving and exhaustion?
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   How do you do that?
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   And what does God's word have to say to us about that?
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Like how can God speak into our life about this topic?
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   So we're going to be in Genesis chapter 1 and 2 today.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Again, actually mainly in chapter 2.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   And we're going to explore what that has to say.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Now the first Sunday of the Stewarding Our Life sermon series,
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   I think four or five weeks ago,
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   we talked about that we are created in God's image.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   And that part of what it means to be created in God's image
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   is that we are rulers, we are cultivators,
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   we image God in this creative work,
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   and we're actually created for good work.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   We're created to cultivate, to make culture,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   to organize the structure,
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   to contribute to the flourishing and the thriving
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   of the world in general and of people specifically.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   And that when we do that,
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   that's what we are partially created for.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   We can be fully human, fully who God has made us to be.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   And if we're not able to do that, we suffer.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   And we've experienced that.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   I shared about a time of unemployment in my life
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   that was difficult, even mentally, for me.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   But today we're going to look at the other side of it,
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   because work is not the only thing that we're meant to do
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   or that we're created for.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   We're also created for rest and enjoyment.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   And so let me take you to Genesis 2,
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   where starting in verse 1, it says this.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   This is day 7 of creation, by the way.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   It says this,
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   "Thus the heavens and the earth were completed
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   in all their vast array.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   By the seventh day, God had finished the work
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   he had been doing."
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   So on the seventh day, he rested from all his work.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   "Then God blessed the seventh day and made it holy,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   because on it he rested from all the work of creating
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   that he had done."
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   So this is the beginning of the Bible,
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   and it talks about God working
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   and then God seizing and resting.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   And I want to explore these few verses with you
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   by three words.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   And that's rested, blessed, and made holy.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   So let me start with rested.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   So God created the world six days,
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   and he looked at it, it was very good,
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   and then he rested.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Now the word rest is Shabbat,
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   and Shabbat, that's also where we get the word Sabbath from.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   It means to rest, to stop, to cease, to desist,
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   to celebrate, to be completed.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   So God had completed his work, and he stopped.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   And he paused.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   So that's the first thing.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   God just didn't keep relentlessly going.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   He enjoyed what he had made.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   The second thing is blessed, Barach.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   Now this is interesting because this is the third time
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   in the creation narrative that God blessed something.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   First he blesses living creatures.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   Then God blesses human beings.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   And he blesses them because he wants them to multiply,
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   to flourish, to thrive.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   And now thirdly, he blesses a day.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   Now that's kind of strange.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   It's like living creatures, people,
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   but now he blesses a day.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   What in the world does that mean?
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   It means that God, that this day is fruitful,
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   that there is something that he does when we observe that,
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   that it bears fruit in our lives.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   There's a blessing over it that God has spoken over time
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   that when we observe it, we experience the fruitfulness
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   of this day.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   So God spoke a blessing over it, and he made the day fruitful.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   Interesting, right?
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   Because a lot of times the only way we feel like it's fruitful
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   is if we're productive and get stuff done.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   But God makes a day of rest fruitful.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   He blessed it.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   And then the third word is made holy, Kedesh.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   And so that means to set apart, to consecrate, to make holy.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   Now that's also an interesting concept.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   How can you make a day holy?
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Like we might expect a site to be holy,
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   that there's a holy mountain or a holy person,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   but for a day to be holy.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Now holy means basically to be set apart.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   So God has set apart this day for himself,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   and he has made it holy.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Now let me put all of this together.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   What we see here from this in Genesis 1 and 2
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   is that in creating the world,
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   God establishes a pattern of work and rest for human beings
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   that is essential for human flourishing.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   Six days we work, one day we rest.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   When we observe that rhythm, we can flourish.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   When we ignore it, it's like going against a grain of wood.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   You get splinters.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   There's a price to pay when we ignore it.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   That's just generally part of the rhythm that God has established.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   So that's the first thing.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   But I want to follow this idea of rest in the scripture
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   through the Old Testament and then also the New Testament.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   So how does it continue?
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   Well, the next book of the Bible is the book of Exodus.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   And there God actually commands his people to observe the Sabbath,
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   to keep the seventh day holy.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   And this happens after the Exodus.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   So God has powerfully delivered Israel out of slavery.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   And then they're at Mount Sinai,
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   and God reveals through the Ten Commandments
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   part of who he wants his people to be,
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   how they can flourish and thrive,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   how they can be a society that has a character that honors God.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   And part of that is the Sabbath and observance of that day.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   So let me read that to you.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   It's in Exodus 20, starting in verse 8, it says this.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   "Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   Six days you shall labor and do all your work.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   But the seventh day is the Sabbath to the Lord your God.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   On it you shall not do any work,
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   neither you nor your son or daughter,
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   nor your male or female servant,
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   nor your animals, nor any foreigner residing in your towns."
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   I'm just going to pause you for a second.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   I love that this applies to everyone, right?
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   This is not just for the Israelites.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   This is God's principle for everyone.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   It doesn't matter who you are, where you come from,
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   what your role is.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   This is for everyone.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   But let's continue in verse 11.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   "For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth,
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   the sea and all that is in them.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   But he rested on the seventh day.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy."
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   So the Sabbath command in this first time
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   that the Ten Commandments are or appear in the Bible,
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   it is rooted, it is grounded in God's creation narrative.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   You know, that God worked and God rested,
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   and therefore you are to work and you are also meant to rest.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   But there is actually a second time
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   where God gives the Ten Commandments.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   And this is Moses shares them to a new generation.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   And there's a difference.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   He roots the reason for why Israel is supposed to observe the Sabbath
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   in a different reason.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   Let me show you.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   Deuteronomy 5, verse 15, it says this.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   "Remember that you were slaves in Egypt,
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   and that the Lord your God brought you out of there
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   Therefore the Lord your God has commanded you
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   to observe the Sabbath day."
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   Interesting.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   So here Moses grounds the observance of the Sabbath
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   in the Exodus story, not the creation story.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   And the Exodus story is a redemption story
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   because remember, the Israelites, they were slaves in Egypt.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   They had a relentless schedule.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   They had to work every day.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   There was no break.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   They had a brick-making quota for the Egyptian building project
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   that was brutal.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   They had to go get their own straw for making bricks.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   And so God is saying, "I have delivered you.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   I have set you free.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   You have now freedom.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   And when you're a free person, you rest.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   You don't just keep going like when you were enslaved in Egypt."
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   And it's interesting because when you look at Deuteronomy 5, verse 15,
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   it says, "Remember that you were slaves."
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   You were.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   You're not anymore.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   And so Israel needed to remember that,
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   and they needed to live in this freedom that God had given them.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   You're no longer under Pharaoh's rule.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   You're under God's rule.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   You're no longer under a tyrant's rule.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   You're under loving God's rule.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   So observe the Sabbath and rest.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   Now, the Sabbath was a sign of the covenant
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   that God had made between Israel and himself.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   And so observing it was a way of keeping the covenant.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   So they were commanded to do it.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   They had to do it.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   But both the creation story and the Exodus story,
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   they shape how the Sabbath was lived out.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   So first, the creation story, on the one hand,
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   reminds Israel that God is the ultimate creator,
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   that he is the ultimate provider,
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   and all source of blessing comes from him.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   And that means because God is the source of our blessings,
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   not our own striving and work,
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   that means we can actually afford to rest and cease and start working
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   because he will provide.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   And then on the other hand, the Exodus story reminds Israel
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   that they are beloved, redeemed children of God.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   It reminds them that they're supposed to leave Egypt behind.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   You do not have to work.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   You don't have to exist in this way anymore,
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   that the surrounding culture is existing.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   I want you to live differently.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   And so you're going to cease and you're going to pause.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   And isn't that interesting because I feel like for us,
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   we have pressure from our surrounding culture, right,
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   to just keep going, to keep working, to produce more.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   And sometimes that's pressure from within us,
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   but it's also pressure from around us.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   So actually observing rest as a powerful declaration in faith in God
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   that he provides, that I am his, that I am free,
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   and I do not need to give in to the tyranny of this relentless,
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   restless schedule that is placed on us.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   And so this is what the Sabbath practice of Israel is rooted in.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   So let's fast forward to the New Testament.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   And here that could be a lot that could be said,
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   and I'm going to keep it quite simple and to the point.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   I'm going to address the question,
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   do Christians still need to observe the Sabbath?
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   And the quick answer is no, but I want to explain.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   And I also want to point out that the creation rhythm that God has established
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   of work and rest is still that rhythm, and if we ignore it, it impacts us.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   So that's very important.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   So I just want to say that straight away.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   There is blessing on resting, and it is fruitful when we rest.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   But we don't have to observe the Sabbath like Israel had to.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   And so I want to take you to one of Paul's writings in Colossians 2, 16.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   He says this, "Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   or with regard to religious festivals, a new moon, celebration of a Sabbath day.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   These are a shadow of the things that were to come.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   The reality, however, is found in Christ."
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   Now what does this mean?
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   Well, it points to that Christ has fulfilled what the Sabbath points to.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   The Sabbath was a sign pointing forward, a weekly reminder
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   that our own work can never save us.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   It can never fully give us rest.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   It can never fully make us whole.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   And that this rest and this wholeness is alone found in Christ,
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   and Christ has fulfilled that.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   And so when we're anxious and striving people and we can't stop,
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   we find rest in Jesus because our striving doesn't really bring us security.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   It doesn't really bring us wholeness that we think it will.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   We think it will establish us.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   We think that we can save ourselves in essence through our efforts.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   We're going to make ourselves whole by trying harder,
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   by working harder, by positioning ourselves better,
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   but we never fully arrive.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   But in Jesus, there are true rest and wholeness is found.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   He gives us our identity.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   You are beloved children, sons and daughters of God,
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   and you can find rest in that.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   It's not rest in your striving, which we think will bring us that security and rest,
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   but it never does.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   You never arrive, but you can find rest in Christ.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   So that's what Paul is saying, that Sabbath was a shadow
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   and was observant that pointed towards the ultimate rest,
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   which is found only in Christ Jesus.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   And that is part of the gospel message,
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   that when we come to Jesus, we can experience this peace
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   and we can experience this rest over our striving, over what wears us out.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   But all of this brings me back to this question I asked at the beginning of the message.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   How can we cultivate a life that is marked by rest and not striving and exhaustion?
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   What does that look like?
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   How do we actually break this cycle that so many of us find ourselves in,
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   that many of us here today are stuck in?
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   How can we start seeing that changed?
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   Well, for one, we learn from the creation story
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   that there is this rhythm that God has established of work and rest,
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   and that when we observe it, that there is blessing in that.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   So that's always true.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   And if we go against that, we will pay a price for that.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   But then we also see that through Jesus, there is this greater rest.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   In him, in Galatians 5.15, it says this,
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   that it is for freedom that Christ has set us free.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   Stand firm then and do not let yourself be burned again by the yoke of slavery.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   Christ has set you free for freedom.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   You no longer need to live this way.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   Live as free people, not as enslaved people.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   And this is still true for us Christians.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   Yes, in Jesus there is rest when we come to know him, and there is peace.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   But then we need to learn to live in this rest, and it doesn't automatically happen.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   We can still be restless, anxious, worn out, even as Christians.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   So again, how do we cultivate this life of peace and rest and wholeness?
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   What does that look like?
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   Where do we start?
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   Well, the first thing is we actually need a schedule, a time.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   Is that a German thing? Schedule time?
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   Got to go to a schedule, let me look.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   But you somehow have to put it in your schedule.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   If you do it officially, on your phone, or in your planner, or mentally,
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   however you do that, you actually need a schedule time of rest.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   Now for a lot of us, of course it's amazing if you can take a whole day
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   and somehow figure out how to do that.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Praise God that you're able to do that.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   And some people are. Others struggle with that, with the demands that are on them.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   So what I want to encourage you is actually just start somewhere.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   This is not about perfection. Start somewhere.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   If you can carve out two, three hours, maybe one hour is like sleeping in longer,
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   and then there's two hours of drawing close to God, put that in your schedule.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   And start doing that regularly.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   So the first thing is we need to schedule it.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   Second, spend unhurried time with God.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   So this is where observing rest in the way that Scripture encourages
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   is different from taking time off.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   Time off is like I'm watching Netflix, I'm just laying in bed, doing whatever.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   But when we want to cultivate this life of rest, it does take time,
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   spending time in a relationship with God.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   So we need to have unhurried time with God.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   Now what might this look like?
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   I think this looks quite different for different people.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   I'm a little bit hesitant to say this is exactly what you need to do.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   But I'll just share what I do and some things that I know people do,
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   and I hope you can decide what will be helpful for you.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   So for me, what I do is I need about an hour and a half time.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   I don't necessarily use that hour and a half, but I just need that time
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   because otherwise it's not unhurried time.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   Because, for example, in the mornings when I do my devotions,
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   a lot of times I'm rushed.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   It is unhurried time, even if I try for it not to be.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   So when I want to set aside this time to really rest and spend time with God,
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   I need unhurried time.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   So I might spend 45 minutes, maybe an hour, maybe a little bit longer with God,
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   but I just have the freedom because there's a margin.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   And then in that time I might worship, I read Scripture,
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   I pray over Scripture, I journal, I pray for you, I pray for my family.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   And so those are like some of the components that are part of my unhurried time with God.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   But for you, maybe it's like prayer walking.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   Maybe you're like a person who connects outside with God,
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   and you're walking out in nature, and you're praying outside in that way,
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   and you're worshiping.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   So whatever is helpful to you, do that, to spend unhurried time with God.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   Does that make sense?
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   All right, third one.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   And this is be renewed.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   Now, this is not something that we do.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   This is something that the Spirit of God does.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   But when we schedule a time of rest, when we spend unhurried time with God,
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   God does renew us and refresh us.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   Remember earlier there's just blessing over when we have time of rest.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   Well, God blesses that time.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   He makes it fruitful.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   And he wants this time to bear fruit in your life.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   And so there's two main ways that I believe that God wants to make this time fruitful.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   Or let me put it this way, two ways that I want to share.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   The first one is this.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   When we spend time in this intimacy with God, God actually reminds us of who he is.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   That he is the loving father.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   He is redeemer.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   He's rescuer.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   He's creator.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   He's almighty and powerful.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   And it puts God back into focus because he gets out of focus when we're rushing around
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   and we're spinning like crazy and we lose focus of who God is.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   And so it puts God back into focus and reminds us of who he is
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   and it gives us perspective on all of our lives, on all the stuff that's going on.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   And I have this quote from John Oswald that I want to share with you.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   He says this, "If we make God our focus, knowing he, the transcendent holy one, is in control of all things,
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   then we can live in confidence in the sanctuary of his power and his love."
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   And I love this.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   When we make God our focus, we can be confident and we can live in his place
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   in the sanctuary, this peace of rest of his power and his love.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   And that means that as we make God our focus, we can start setting aside our anxieties
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   and replace it with an awareness of the presence of God.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   That God is with us.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   You are not alone.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   He is right by your side.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   That he loves you and that he is powerful.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   He has power above everything.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   And so regardless of what challenge you're facing, regardless of what circumstances you're facing,
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   you can live in the sanctuary of his power and his love.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   And I think that's a beautiful description of rest.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   That it doesn't matter where you're walking around, doesn't matter what circumstance you're in,
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   you can live in the sanctuary of his power and his love because you know him
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   and because he is the focus and the center of your life.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   Isn't that a beautiful picture? Am I the only one?
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   So that's the first thing.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   When we spend this time with God, we are renewed through that.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   But then that's not the only thing.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   We're also reminded of who we are.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   Now the external and internal pressures, they try to tell us all sorts of things about who we are.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   They try to tell you, you are not enough.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   You're not producing enough.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   If you only work a little bit more, if you only try a little bit harder, maybe one day you'll be okay.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   That's what internal, external pressure tells us.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   But when we spend our time with God, he speaks over you.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   You are my beloved child.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   You are my son, my daughter with whom I am well pleased.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   And so when we know our identity, our identity is not found in striving and accomplishing things
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   and getting a million things done and being 10% more productive than last week
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   and meeting more KPIs.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   God also just powerfully allows us to rest in our identity that he gives us.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   Not that other people try to give us or that we think we can somehow earn, but that's never stable.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   And so he renews you through that.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   And I believe he is speaking that over some of you even right now,
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   just reminding you of your identity, that you are loved.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   You're not your performance or your lack of your performance.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   You are a beloved child of God.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   And he wants you to be able to find rest and peace in your identity in him.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   And then, of course, a final blessing of this renewal is just simply we get to enjoy,
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   and that's a grace blessing, just be in relationship with God.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   We get to enjoy our relationship with God.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   Now, so how can we respond to this message?
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   How can we start living in a sanctuary of his power and his love?
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   Well, for one, you actually need to set aside time to rest and to spend unhurried time with God.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   So if you're not do that and you just keep doing what you're doing,
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   your life's going to continue just to spin out of control,
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   and there's going to be consequences, just like there was with me, right?
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   Back problem, sitting on streets, laying on streets of Hong Kong,
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   relationship problems, marriage problems,
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   because you keep ignoring those things and just keep going in that cycle.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   So you need to schedule a time to rest and to connect with God.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   So right now, maybe that's the thing that you need to do.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   So when are you going to do it this week?
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   So take out your calendar and actually put it in.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   Find that time, find that moment.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   Maybe it's during the week, maybe it's in the weekend.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   So that's for some of us what we need to do.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   But for others of us, rest is found in Jesus.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   So for one, all of us need to come to Jesus.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   But I want to right now speak specifically to those of you who actually don't know Jesus fully yet.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   And I want to give an opportunity to actually come to Jesus and to become a Christian.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   And it's easy to come to church.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   Sometimes we think coming to church makes us a Christian.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   Coming to church doesn't make you a Christian.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   Sometimes we grow up in a Christian country, and we feel like I'm a Christian because I grew up in this country.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   Growing up in a Christian country doesn't make you a Christian.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   Growing up in a Christian family does not make you a Christian.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   There comes this point in our lives where we have to make our own decision.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   Am I going to receive Jesus into my heart?
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   Or am I going to cross that line?
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   And so I want to give that opportunity to do that right now.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   And so what I'm going to do is I'm going to just in a simple way, I'm going to do the ABC, just an acronym.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   You know, we admit that we're sinners, that we're broken people, that we have this need for Jesus for His forgiveness.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   Believe that Jesus is Savior and Redeemer and Lord, that He died, that He rose.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   And then finally confess, confess that Jesus is your Lord.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   Not somebody else's, not your neighbor's, but your Lord.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   And so I'm going to lead you in a prayer.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   You can quietly pray it along in your heart, and you can become a Christian and take that step.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   So let me do this right now for us.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   I want to invite the worship team to come up as well.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   Jesus, thank you so much that you love me.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   I admit that I am a sinner, that I have done things that I know are wrong.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   That I've sinned against you, and I've sinned against other people.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   Please forgive me.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   And Jesus, I will now place my faith in you.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   I believe that you died on the cross for my sins, and that you rose again so that I can have new life and be forgiven.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   And so Jesus, I invite you in my heart right now.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   I confess that you are my Lord and my Savior.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   Will you come into my life?
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   Will you fill me with your Holy Spirit?
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   And I pray this in your name, Jesus.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   And all God's people said, Amen.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   Now if you've prayed this prayer, you know, God's Word says that if we can confess with our tongue that Jesus Christ is Lord, we are saved.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   You have crossed over.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   Now we still need to learn what that means, what it means to follow Jesus, and that's what we're here for as a community.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   But I would love to, if you've taken that step, I would love to hear from you about it, so I can encourage you and walk with you in that.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   So right now I want to invite all of us to stand, and I actually want to pray over all of us.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   So if you've been exhausted and you're tired, whether that's just through striving or maybe your external pressure,
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   I just want to invite you to stretch out your hands just as a symbol of just wanting to receive from God.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   I just want to pray over you.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   Jesus, thank you so much that you are the one in whom we truly find rest.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   Thank you that you love every single person here, that you know every single person, you know what's going on, you know the challenges that they're facing.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   And I just pray right now that you will come, that you will meet them, that you release the peace of God over every single heart right now.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   That you renew us and refresh us with your Holy Spirit.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   Lord, I also pray for change.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   I pray for freedom, that you have set us free to live a different life, not a life of slavery anymore, but a life of freedom in you.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   So I pray if striving has been what's been driving us, Lord, I pray in the name of Jesus that the striving is broken right now.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   Thank you, Jesus.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   So I pray, Lord, that you make us a community that rests in you, that knows your peace, that knows your wholeness, that you restore us, that you refresh us and renew us.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   And that we can live differently because we know you.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   So we thank you, Jesus, for your work that you are doing right now.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   Thank you, Jesus.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   And I pray all that in your name.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   Amen.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   Amen.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   Let's worship church.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.580]   (gentle music)
