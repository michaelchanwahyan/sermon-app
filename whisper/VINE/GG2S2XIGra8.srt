1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
 I am so pleased to be with you this morning.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:10,720
 I get to do two of my favorite things at the same time.

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,280
 And the first is to be here in Vainiung Long.

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:21,080
 Sandra and I really, I mean really, really love this church.

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:29,820
 And the second is to have the opportunity to preach from the Book of Acts.

6
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,560
 And especially the second chapter.

7
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:41,880
 Acts 2 is a powerful chapter that introduces the Holy Spirit's dynamic presence in the

8
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:49,080
 life of believers and demonstrates the transformation it brings.

9
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:57,840
 In this pivotal passage we witness the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the disciples.

10
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:09,040
 A moment that serves as the essential catalyst for Christian community formation.

11
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,240
 And what word do we commonly use for Christian community?

12
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,940
 Yes, the word church.

13
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:22,400
 Going back to some of the words we sang earlier in the song King of Kings.

14
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,240
 I put them on the screen.

15
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:33,400
 And the church of Christ was born and the Spirit lit the flame.

16
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:43,280
 These 13 words spell out exactly the message I want to bring you this morning.

17
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,160
 And the church of Christ was born and the Spirit lit the flame.

18
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:58,120
 I am so glad to have the opportunity to preach on this passage in Acts 2.

19
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:06,200
 As what we will see is that the church community as we know it today is a direct result, a

20
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:13,020
 consequence of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.

21
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:21,920
 I'm also glad that to allow me to preach on Acts chapter 2 that you had Elder Deborah

22
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,760
 preach on chapter 1 last week.

23
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:30,800
 I particularly love the toothpaste illustration.

24
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:40,880
 What Deborah told us that Acts chapter 1 was all about waiting.

25
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:50,420
 The disciples were told, "Wait for the promise of the Holy Spirit."

26
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,900
 It was also about preparing.

27
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:02,720
 But the key to the formation of the Christian community that we call church is right there

28
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,600
 in chapter 2 verse 1.

29
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,020
 Look at it.

30
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:13,260
 When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place.

31
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:20,400
 I want to spend a little time, more than a little time on this one verse.

32
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,400
 Let's look at that expression, "all together in one place."

33
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:31,660
 In its original Greek form is homophumed.

34
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:40,860
 Now homophumed is a Greek word meaning with one mind, with one accord.

35
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:49,060
 It signifies a state of unity, harmony and shared passion amongst a group of people.

36
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:57,540
 In fact it absolutely 100% represents the picture you had of the building blocks.

37
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:02,140
 Homophumed is a combination of two Greek words.

38
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:10,820
 Homos which means same and thumos, passion, emotion.

39
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:20,460
 It signifies and suggests a group acting with a shared passion and a shared purpose.

40
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:31,820
 Therefore homophumed is used to describe the disciples being in one place, both physically

41
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:37,540
 and spiritually.

42
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:44,380
 Homophumed represents a powerful expression of Christian community where individuals are

43
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:53,540
 bound together by shared faith and purpose, striving towards a common goal.

44
00:04:53,540 --> 00:05:01,900
 It emphasises the importance of unity and harmony within the body of Christ.

45
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:13,460
 Church, the good news is that we are already united through the body and blood of Jesus

46
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:19,620
 Christ, wonderfully similarised every time we take communion.

47
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:29,020
 But vineyard long, vineyard long, I'm not here today to tickle your ears.

48
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:34,060
 I'm not even here today to preach a good sermon.

49
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:40,660
 I am calling you today as a precursor to receiving the Holy Spirit.

50
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:46,780
 I am calling you to oneness.

51
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:53,060
 If we are to fulfil our call to be a relevant Christian community, if we are to fulfil our

52
00:05:53,060 --> 00:06:04,300
 dream, our vision to explore uncharted territories, we need to be one.

53
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,940
 I want to remind you what the Apostle Paul says in Ephesians.

54
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,220
 You've heard me say this before.

55
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:19,020
 There is one body and one spirit, just as you were called to one hope when you were

56
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,500
 called.

57
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:26,900
 One Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all who is over all and through

58
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,140
 all and in all.

59
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:45,100
 Today, today my friends, we will see what happened as a consequence of being one.

60
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:51,460
 In short, they received the Holy Spirit.

61
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:58,780
 And church, we need to receive.

62
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,700
 We need to receive.

63
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,300
 Let me explain.

64
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,060
 Let's assume today I was to write you a cheque.

65
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,340
 You remember cheques?

66
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:21,820
 I write you a cheque for a million dollars, but it always stays in my hand.

67
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,820
 It's useless.

68
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:30,020
 Oh yeah, you can talk about the amazing million dollar cheque.

69
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:36,540
 Have deep philosophical and theological questions about why I would choose to write you such

70
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,900
 a cheque.

71
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:47,700
 But you have to receive it and put it in your own account.

72
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,900
 Now I forgot to say, pray like mad that it doesn't bounce.

73
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:56,020
 But somehow that explodes the illustration.

74
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:03,060
 And so after last week's message on waiting, I'm going to be talking about and praying

75
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,180
 for receiving.

76
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,620
 Let's look at this again.

77
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:14,020
 When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place.

78
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:19,780
 Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole

79
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,420
 house where they were sitting.

80
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:27,460
 They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of

81
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,380
 them.

82
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:40,300
 All of them, all of them, all of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak

83
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:44,900
 in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them.

84
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,860
 I want you to look for a moment at the scene.

85
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:52,420
 Jerusalem was filled with visitors.

86
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,060
 It was the feast of Pentecost.

87
00:08:54,060 --> 00:09:00,860
 God fearing Jews from all over the known world gathering to give thanks for the first of

88
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:08,820
 the harvest and to celebrate the giving of the law to Moses on Mount Sinai.

89
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:19,460
 And it is here, not in a secret stable or a lonely mountaintop, but in the middle of

90
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:23,300
 a city bursting with people.

91
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,700
 Does that sound familiar?

92
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:35,900
 We might translate this in Cantonese as Mongkok.

93
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:44,420
 People who have come to seek Him, it is there that God shows up.

94
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:51,940
 God creator of the universe who has existed from beginning, the beginning of time is physically

95
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:56,140
 present by His Holy Spirit.

96
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,140
 Let's look at what we see.

97
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:02,780
 Wind, wind from heaven fills the whole house.

98
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:06,740
 Wind just like Elijah felt in the cave.

99
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:14,220
 Fire, like Moses saw at the bush that didn't burn up, like the fire that consumed Elijah's

100
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,700
 soaking sacrifice.

101
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:28,220
 And God speaks, not through a prophet or a priest or a pastor, but through 120 uneducated,

102
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:38,580
 uncultured Galileans so that everyone can hear and understand in their own language.

103
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,080
 It's the story of the tower of Babel in reverse.

104
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:47,500
 You know the story of Babel, the curse of Babel, how humanity, originally speaking just

105
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:54,740
 one language, was punished for their ambition to build a tower reaching heaven.

106
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:59,380
 The curse was broken.

107
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:05,600
 When the visitors eventually go home, they will return changed, taking with them the

108
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:12,640
 experience of the Spirit, the Spirit living in them, the law written in their hearts,

109
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:18,740
 the first fruits of new life in Christ.

110
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:27,020
 The first thing we notice is this, they all received the Holy Spirit.

111
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,980
 I'm going to give you a free English lesson this morning.

112
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,460
 Alright, ready?

113
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:39,780
 The word "all" means all.

114
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:44,140
 Everybody!

115
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:48,460
 You know, you come to church, "I'm sure that person next to me would receive the Holy Spirit."

116
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:53,300
 No, they all received the Holy Spirit.

117
00:11:53,300 --> 00:12:00,260
 And they all, that's that word again, they all received the gift of tongues.

118
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:06,260
 Now I want to explain this a little bit, put simply, the gift of tongues is a gift given

119
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:14,540
 to believers by the Holy Spirit where a person speaks in a language that they haven't learned.

120
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:20,420
 This can either happen in a known language which was happened on the day of Pentecost,

121
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:29,440
 or most commonly an angelic language allowing us to speak to God without going through the

122
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,460
 operation of the human mind.

123
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:40,860
 And the good news this morning, so can we.

124
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,860
 So can we.

125
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:47,340
 I'm going to give you the key, I'm going to give you the key right now.

126
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:53,180
 The key is asking.

127
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:59,820
 Matthew 7, 7, "Ask and you might receive."

128
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:06,700
 Ask, and the people who have been coming to church for two years might receive.

129
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:11,380
 Ask and you will receive.

130
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:17,980
 Just read on and see what happened after all of them, all of them received the Spirit and

131
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:21,220
 all of them were speaking in tongues.

132
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:28,580
 Verse 5, "Now they were staying in Jerusalem, God fearing Jews from every nation under heaven.

133
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:33,860
 When they heard this sound, the crowd came together and bewildered, because each one

134
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,940
 heard their own language being spoken.

135
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:45,980
 Utterly amazed, they asked, "Aren't all of these who are speaking Galileans?"

136
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:52,180
 Now how is it that each of us hears them in our native language?

137
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:59,260
 When the crowd hears the disciples miraculously speaking in their own language, they ask,

138
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:02,820
 "What does this mean?"

139
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,500
 I'll tell you what it means.

140
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:10,300
 It is a profound work of the Holy Spirit.

141
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:15,940
 As I said earlier, it is a reverse of the curse of Babel.

142
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:22,500
 I'd like to think of it actually also as a gift of ears, because we read that each one

143
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:29,460
 of them heard them in their native language.

144
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:40,800
 My friends, as we lean into our uncharted season, we must understand this profound work

145
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,740
 of the Spirit.

146
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,860
 God is faithful to his promise.

147
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:53,260
 Jesus has ascended and sent us the Holy Spirit, bringing us new possibilities as God's power

148
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:57,180
 works through community.

149
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:03,860
 The miracle of Pentecost demonstrates the universal reach of the Gospel, crossing barriers

150
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:08,340
 of culture, language, and background from day one.

151
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,340
 Look at this.

152
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:20,300
 Parthians, Medes, and Elamites, residents of Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus

153
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:28,140
 and Asia, Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, and the parts of Libya near Cyrene, visitors from

154
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:37,980
 Rome, both Jews and converts to Judaism, Cretans and Arabs, we hear them declaring the wonders

155
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:43,220
 of God in our own tongues.

156
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:54,500
 These verses highlight the diversity of the crowd and the miraculous nature of this event.

157
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,980
 I wish I could have been there.

158
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,580
 It must have been something really special.

159
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:04,100
 As we read this reaction from the crowd, amazed and perplexed, they asked one another, "What

160
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,900
 does this mean?"

161
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,820
 Some however made fun of them.

162
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,820
 They had too much wine.

163
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:19,260
 The mockery reveals a division in the crowd.

164
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:28,180
 Some were amazed and perplexed, while others chose to dismiss the event as mere drunkenness,

165
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:34,060
 demonstrating a lack of understanding or willingness to accept the supernatural.

166
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:38,420
 My friends, we still see this in the church today.

167
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:49,620
 A genuine move of God can be greeted with excitement and joy or of cynical scepticism.

168
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:55,180
 I have on numerous occasions witnessed both.

169
00:16:55,180 --> 00:17:02,900
 But hear me when I say, the outpouring, the receiving of the Holy Spirit must not only

170
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:08,380
 make a difference to the church and individual Christians.

171
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:12,220
 And here is the foundational truth.

172
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:17,140
 There is no church without the Spirit.

173
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:21,980
 We might as well go home.

174
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:25,540
 There is no church without the Spirit.

175
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:32,940
 No community of faith without the power and the unity and the love He brings.

176
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:36,260
 I think this is important enough, I want to say it again.

177
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:43,980
 There is no church without the Spirit and no community of faith without the power, unity

178
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:48,140
 and love that He brings.

179
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:55,020
 The Spirit doesn't just enhance existing community.

180
00:17:55,020 --> 00:18:01,900
 He births us into a community through our new birth in Christ.

181
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:12,700
 His work is both unifying and diversifying, breaking down barriers while bringing unique

182
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:20,780
 purposes for us as a diverse body.

183
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:24,220
 Vine year long.

184
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:35,420
 We are called to be a Spirit empowered community that draws new people into God's family and

185
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:43,220
 crosses barriers to share the good news.

186
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:50,060
 Drawing new people into the community and crossing barriers to share the good news.

187
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:55,740
 And the first difference we see happening to the disciples on receiving the Holy Spirit

188
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,300
 is boldness.

189
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,300
 I love this.

190
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,620
 Peter puts his hand up.

191
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,620
 Peter!

192
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,940
 Peter the denier.

193
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:15,780
 Denied Jesus three times becomes Peter the evangelist.

194
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:22,540
 Remember Jews from all over the known world are in Jerusalem for the feast of Pentecost.

195
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:27,020
 Peter takes his opportunity and begins to preach.

196
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:30,140
 I love his first statement, it raises more than a smile.

197
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:34,380
 Then Peter stood up with the eleven, raised his voice and addressed the crowd.

198
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:40,140
 Fellow Jews and all of you who live in Jerusalem, let me explain this to you.

199
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,700
 Listen carefully to what I say.

200
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,180
 These people are not drunk as you suppose.

201
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,380
 It's only nine in the morning.

202
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,900
 I love the way the message version puts this.

203
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,700
 These people aren't drunk as some of you suspect.

204
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,740
 They haven't had time to get drunk.

205
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,900
 It's only nine in the morning.

206
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:05,580
 Now I've got to say it was a regular practice for the Jews not to eat or drink anything

207
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,060
 until the third hour of the day which is nine o'clock.

208
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:11,020
 They started counting at six o'clock.

209
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:15,020
 Usually on the Sabbath or in festival occasions.

210
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:20,340
 Peter stands with the eleven apostles and addresses the crowd clarifying they are not

211
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,980
 drunk.

212
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:31,740
 He explains that the events unfolding are a fulfillment of a prophecy that was given

213
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:36,540
 in Joel 2 28 to 32.

214
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,220
 You'll be familiar with this.

215
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:44,980
 It says in the last days I will pour out my spirit on who?

216
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,220
 All people.

217
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,060
 Your sons and daughters will prophesy.

218
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,140
 Your young men will see visions.

219
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,540
 Your old men will dream dreams.

220
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:55,860
 I dream a lot these days.

221
00:20:55,860 --> 00:21:03,220
 Even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my spirit in those days and

222
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,040
 they will prophesy.

223
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:13,980
 You see in the Old Testament the Holy Spirit had been given to certain people at certain

224
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:18,020
 times for certain tasks.

225
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:25,540
 But Joel's prophecy said that a time would come that the Holy Spirit would be poured

226
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:30,500
 out on all people at all times.

227
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:39,340
 Imagine Ho Sun Yee building on Sunday 28th of August at 1230pm.

228
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,120
 Let's take a look.

229
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,200
 In the last days God said I will pour out my spirit on all people.

230
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,440
 The emphasis is on all.

231
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,880
 Your sons and your daughters will prophesy.

232
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,720
 It is regardless of sex.

233
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,280
 Your young men will see visions.

234
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,640
 Your old men will dream dreams.

235
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,520
 It's regardless of age.

236
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,960
 Even on my servants.

237
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,920
 Regardless of background, race, colour, rank.

238
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:11,600
 Even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my spirit in those days.

239
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,800
 It is for everyone.

240
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:20,840
 And they will prophesy.

241
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:28,560
 In these verses it signifies that people including men and women, young and old, will speak under

242
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,160
 divine inspiration.

243
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:37,840
 This ability to prophesy is seen as a sign of God's spirit being poured out on all flesh.

244
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:47,760
 Now prophecy is not foretelling like a fortune teller or a soothsayer, but foretelling.

245
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,040
 Declaring God's word.

246
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:57,760
 I believe that we at Vine Yuen Long are called to have a prophetic voice to our neighbours

247
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,800
 and our community.

248
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,560
 What does this mean for us?

249
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:13,440
 We are called to be a spirit empowered community that draws people into God's family and crosses

250
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:20,500
 all barriers, race, age, sex, social standing, to share the good news.

251
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:26,000
 The same spirit that fell at Pentecost is at work among us today.

252
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,080
 Ready to form us into the community that God intends in this season.

253
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:46,520
 But I want to ask the question, what barriers is God calling us to cross?

254
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:54,000
 How can we ready our hearts to welcome those with different backgrounds?

255
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,480
 Peter then reminds us, directly quoting from Joel 2, 30-31, of Christ's promise to come

256
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,480
 again.

257
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,480
 We talked about it earlier, Ben, again.

258
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:15,240
 In glory for his people and for the judgment that awaits those who reject him.

259
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,840
 The verses on the screen describe cosmic events.

260
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:26,940
 Stars in the sky, signs on the earth, blood, fire and smoke preceding the great and glorious

261
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,560
 day of the Lord.

262
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:34,360
 These verses are interpreted as signs of God's judgment and the coming of God's Christ's

263
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,840
 kingdom.

264
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:42,840
 With the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost being a partial fulfilment of Joel's

265
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,440
 prophecy.

266
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:54,560
 You see, throughout his sermon, where he quotes the prophet Joel, Peter hammers away, hammers

267
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:59,960
 away, hammers away at a single point.

268
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:09,400
 Jesus Christ is Lord and Saviour and people must put their faith in him.

269
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:15,600
 Jesus Christ is Lord and Saviour and people must put their faith in him.

270
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:22,480
 He emphasises that salvation is available to all.

271
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:28,080
 All who believe and all who call upon the name of the Lord.

272
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:36,920
 That means anyone, regardless of background or past actions, can be saved by putting their

273
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:43,720
 faith and their trust in Jesus Christ.

274
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,680
 I'll put a verse up there.

275
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:50,120
 Next verse.

276
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,120
 Let's read it all together.

277
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,120
 Ready?

278
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,640
 One, two, three.

279
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:58,020
 And everyone calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.

280
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,020
 That was three of you.

281
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,020
 Let's do it again.

282
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,280
 One, two, three.

283
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:07,240
 And everyone calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.

284
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,360
 One more free English lesson.

285
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,640
 Everyone means everyone.

286
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,640
 Close your eyes, please.

287
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,320
 Let's have every eye closed now.

288
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:25,360
 The band can come back.

289
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,360
 Just take a moment.

290
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,760
 Let's have every eye closed, please.

291
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,640
 Let's respect this moment.

292
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:38,440
 I want to give an opportunity here and now, right here and now, for this verse to become

293
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:43,320
 a reality for someone.

294
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:51,400
 If there is anybody here at this moment who is not following Christ, you wouldn't call

295
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:55,080
 yourself a Christian.

296
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,320
 There's good news today.

297
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,440
 And the good news is in this verse.

298
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:10,120
 Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.

299
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:19,040
 And just while every eye is closed, if you would like to call upon the name of the Lord

300
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:24,400
 for the first time today, maybe a friend brought you to church, maybe you don't even know why

301
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,160
 you're here.

302
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:30,360
 Maybe you've been coming for weeks and weeks and weeks, but haven't really made that connection

303
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,200
 with Jesus Christ.

304
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,600
 You wouldn't call yourself a Christian.

305
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:42,960
 The good news is all that can change this morning.

306
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,560
 If you would like to give your life to Jesus Christ, I would just like you, while every

307
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:57,400
 eye is closed, to put up your hands so I can pray for you.

308
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:02,600
 I'm not going to embarrass anyone here this morning, but if you would like to become a

309
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:09,640
 Christian this morning, if you would like to give your life to Jesus Christ, this is

310
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:13,400
 your moment.

311
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:18,320
 So just while every eye is closed, if that's you, I'd love to pray for you.

312
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,040
 Would you put up your hands so I can see you?

313
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,680
 I'm going to pray for you.

314
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,600
 We'll just wait for a moment.

315
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,600
 Thank you, Lord.

316
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,520
 Thank you, Lord.

317
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:38,520
 Let's stand, everybody.

318
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:46,000
 When the day of Pentecost came, all the disciples were in one place.

319
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,320
 One place physically, one place spiritually.

320
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,160
 The Holy Spirit came upon them.

321
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,040
 They were filled with the Holy Spirit.

322
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:03,220
 They prayed in tongues.

323
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:06,680
 The Church of Christ was born.

324
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,520
 Spirit lit the flame.

325
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,760
 I want you, if you're just comfortable, just put your hands in front of you like this to

326
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,760
 receive.

327
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:24,040
 We're going to ask the Holy Spirit now just to come and to fill us as individuals, as

328
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,640
 a church.

329
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,920
 Holy Spirit, come.

330
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,640
 Fill us with your power.

331
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,720
 Fill us with the boldness that Peter had.

332
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:45,800
 Fill us with the love for the people that the disciples had.

333
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:52,200
 Fill us, Lord, that you might change this community and the communities that we serve.

334
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,000
 Holy Spirit, we wait for you.

335
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:02,280
 Will you come?

336
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:06,880
 You may be just feeling God's peace upon you.

337
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:14,480
 You may be feeling strangely warm.

338
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,640
 Maybe your hands are tingling.

339
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:22,000
 You don't have to receive any of these things, but Lord is doing something in this room right

340
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 now.

341
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:29,680
 Just receive the Holy Spirit.

342
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,160
 You say, "But Pastor, I was filled with the Holy Spirit five years ago."

343
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,760
 I'm not interested.

344
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:39,200
 Let's be filled with the Holy Spirit today and tomorrow and the day after and the day

345
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,200
 after.

346
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,840
 Let's go on being filled with the Holy Spirit.

347
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,920
 Holy Spirit, come.

348
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:53,360
 Touch us and fill us.

349
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,440
 On the day of Pentecost, the disciples all started to pray in a language they didn't

350
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,440
 understand.

351
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,120
 We call it the gift of tongues.

352
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:06,880
 If you want to receive that gift, just open your mouth and start to speak.

353
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,680
 Don't say A, B, C or a word.

354
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,800
 Don't speak in a language you know.

355
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,320
 Just open your mouth and allow God to work through you.

356
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,480
 Let's just spend a moment.

357
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,440
 If you want to do that, just start today.

358
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:26,440
 Come on, just be bold.

359
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:48,600
 You can afford to speak a little bit louder.

360
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:54,000
 It's amazing.

361
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,240
 I can see happening all around this auditorium.

362
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,280
 God touching people, people praying in the language of the Spirit.

363
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,440
 I just want to encourage you.

364
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:10,200
 We're just going to take a couple more minutes just to do this.

365
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:35,320
 I just want you to stop.

366
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:39,440
 It shows that this is something which you are in control of.

367
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,680
 It's not like an evil spirit that controls you and gets you to pray in a strange tongue.

368
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:48,040
 You can start or stop when you want to.

369
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,880
 For those of you who are a little bit doubtful, I just recommend you go home and get under

370
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,880
 the shower.

371
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,040
 Let the shower run and start to pray in tongues.

372
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,040
 It's good.

373
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,320
 It makes you so unconscious of yourself.

374
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:03,320
 Okay, let's just start to pray out again.

375
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:19,520
 All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit.

376
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:31,480
 All of them prayed in tongues.

377
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:36,640
 The news I've got for you this morning is, oh yes, it was for you.

378
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,080
 Being filled with the Holy Spirit was a blessing for you.

379
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,160
 Receiving the gift of tongues was for you.

380
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,880
 God hasn't got us here this morning for that.

381
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,800
 He's got us this morning for them out there.

382
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:55,280
 Building bridges with our community.

383
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,640
 I'm going to pray right now.

384
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:03,400
 The Lord that what you have done in this place this morning, what you're doing in our lives

385
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:08,520
 now, what are you going to continue to do Lord when we go home and put the shower on

386
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,840
 and pray in tongues?

387
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:16,200
 Lord, it's not about a church service.

388
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,280
 It's about a community.

389
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:28,880
 Lord would you send us out in the power of your Holy Spirit to build bridges with our

390
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:35,360
 family, the people we work with, the people we're going to meet on the MTR on the way

391
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:40,880
 home.

392
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:45,960
 There is a world out there that needs to hear the good news of Jesus.

393
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:50,800
 And the good news is this, that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.

394
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:57,720
 In a few weeks time we'll be celebrating that when we do the baptism.

395
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:02,960
 People who have given their lives to Jesus, celebrating that.

396
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:14,120
 Lord send us from this place down the stairs, out into the square, into the Yoho Mall and

397
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:28,540
 the MTR, that Hong Kong would be saved, that China would be saved, that you would allow

398
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:36,340
 us to take this Gospel, this precious Gospel to the ends of the earth.

399
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:39,000
 We pray this in Jesus' name.

400
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,120
 Amen.

401
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,120
 Let's worship God together.
