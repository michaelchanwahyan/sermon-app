00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
 Good morning. Good morning to our online community as well who are joining us.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:12,640
 Before I get started, during worship there was a line from a movie that came into my head.

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:18,240
 Some of you may have seen the movie, it's called The Holiday. It's a Christmas movie.

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:27,120
 And there's a music composer in this movie who writes music for movies. That's his job.

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,560
 And there's a scene in the movie where he writes a song for a new friend that he's made.

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:42,160
 And he tells her, "I only used the best notes." And it came into my mind today that

7
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:49,440
 God would say to you today that when he composed you, when he put you together,

8
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:57,280
 he only used the best notes. And some of you here today, I think, there might be some people here

9
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,520
 who've been told otherwise. And maybe you don't know the truth of what I've just said to you.

10
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,240
 But God would say to you, when he put you together, when he composed your life,

11
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:17,120
 he only used the best notes. I get to share the third sermon in our Advent series called

12
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:24,960
 Of Relatives and Rejection. Let's start with reading from the Word. Luke 2, 1-7 says,

13
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,960
 "In those days, Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire

14
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:38,480
 Roman world. This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria.

15
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:46,400
 And everyone went to their own town to register. So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth

16
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:53,440
 in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem, the town of David, because he belonged to the house

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,040
 and line of David. He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him

18
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:07,520
 and was expecting a child. While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born,

19
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:14,400
 and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger,

20
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:22,560
 because there was no guest room available for them." Now, hidden beneath these verses is a whole

21
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:32,240
 other story. Joseph returns to the place he belongs, the place his family, his extended family,

22
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:40,480
 is from. And amongst all those people, not one of them opened their doors to Joseph.

23
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:48,160
 Not one of them found a small space in their dwelling where mats could be laid on the floor

24
00:02:48,160 --> 00:03:00,000
 for this family. Not one. And the reason was Mary. Mary was pledged to be married. She was not yet

25
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:09,680
 married, but she's pregnant. She's with child. Their voices, that this child was a miraculous gift

26
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:16,880
 from God, had fallen on deaf ears. Mary and Joseph have brought shame on their family,

27
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:24,080
 and nobody wanted to go near them. Nobody wanted their reputation to be tainted.

28
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:33,040
 Mary and Joseph were rejected, and no room was available for them. And so they find themselves

29
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:42,720
 in a room made for animals. And Jesus is born. Mary wraps him up and places him in a food trough,

30
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:50,800
 where the animals would normally eat from. Their comfort level, maybe two out of ten.

31
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:57,440
 But what about the smell? Just stop for a minute. Have you been in a room with livestock,

32
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:06,400
 or where livestock were once inside? Not very pleasant. Maybe zero out of ten.

33
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:16,080
 Isaiah 53, 3 says, "He was despised and rejected by men, a man of suffering and acquainted with

34
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:23,680
 disease. He was despised as one from whom men hide their face, and we did not respect him."

35
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:33,600
 Even before Jesus was born, he was despised and rejected. His own flesh and blood hid their face

36
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:42,720
 from him. Now juxtapose this with smiling rosy faces, a roaring fire, Christmas stockings all

37
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:50,080
 in a line, smell of turkey wafting from the oven, beautifully wrapped gifts meticulously chosen,

38
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:57,200
 piled high under the exquisitely decorated Christmas tree. Everyone in there matching

39
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:04,640
 Christmas jumpers, just like what Damien's wearing down here. Or maybe matching Christmas pyjamas,

40
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:10,480
 or Christmas socks. Michael Buble crooning away in the background.

41
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:19,280
 You see, putting the first Christmas experience beside our current expectations of what Christmas

42
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:27,360
 should be, there is a huge discrepancy. The first Christmas was messy, and Joseph and Mary were

43
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:35,280
 feeling very real feelings of rejection and loss. Estranged from their family, isolated from a

44
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:44,640
 community that could only see an unwed mother. To now, when we do everything we can to create the

45
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:54,160
 perfect Christmas experience for ourselves. Even so far as deliberately avoiding any relatives

46
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,560
 who may potentially mess up our perfect Christmas.

47
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:09,840
 The problem with this is that we are not perfect. Life is not perfect. Rejection, loss, disappointment,

48
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:18,400
 imperfection, confusion is still as real and current today as it was at the very first Christmas.

49
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:25,920
 Maybe your story is similar to Jesus's. Maybe you know all too well what it's like

50
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:32,560
 to be rejected by your family. Maybe Christmas does not bring the family welcome,

51
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,800
 or connection that it should.

52
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:44,400
 Maybe you're the only believer in your family. Christmas is not celebrated, and maybe your faith

53
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:52,640
 leaves you feeling lonely and at times despised. Rejection can close us off,

54
00:06:52,640 --> 00:07:02,960
 but the first Christmas can give us hope. Yes, Joseph, Mary and Jesus were rejected by their

55
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:11,440
 relatives and left to fend for themselves, but others came to witness and share in the joy of

56
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:21,200
 that first Christmas. Wise men and shepherds. In Luke 2 verses 16 to 20, it records the joy and the

57
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:27,600
 praise and the treasured moments that were brought into Mary and Joseph's lives by the shepherd.

58
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:36,880
 Luke 2 verses 16 to 20 says, "So the shepherds hurried off and found Mary and Joseph and the

59
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:43,840
 baby who was lying in the manger. When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what

60
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:49,440
 had been told them about this child, and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherd said to

61
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:56,720
 them. And Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart. The shepherds returned

62
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,320
 glorifying, praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they'd been

63
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:12,160
 told." You see, the beauty of Jesus's birth is that it created the opportunity for us all to be drawn

64
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:20,640
 back into family. You know, I have always loved Christmas, and as I was reflecting on this and

65
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:27,440
 on this sermon that I was preparing, I realized that Christmas was the time of my personal

66
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:38,560
 rejection and also the time of my adoption into my forever family. In 1973, some of you are working

67
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:44,240
 out how old I am right now, let me save you the trouble, I'm turning 50 very soon.

68
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:59,280
 In 1973, four days before Christmas, I was born to an unwed school girl. She brought shame on her

69
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:05,280
 family and she was sent away to have me in secret in another part of Australia.

70
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:13,040
 I was put up for adoption and two weeks later I was swept into my forever family.

71
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:21,120
 Adoption to me is the epitome of love, where there is no blood connection

72
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,520
 and yet love comes and wraps you up as its own.

73
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:37,200
 Christmas undoes rejection. Jesus comes and he wraps you up as his own.

74
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:47,680
 We are all given the opportunity to be adopted into his love. I challenge you that if you struggle

75
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:57,440
 with rejection, let this Christmas be the one that begins to set you free. Let it be your adoption

76
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:09,520
 story. John 1 verses 12 to 14 says, "Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name,

77
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:17,280
 he gave the right to become children of God." Children born not of natural descent, not of

78
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:28,240
 human decision or a husband's will, but born of God. The word became flesh. Jesus made his dwelling

79
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:35,040
 among us. We've seen his glory, the glory of the one and only son who came from the Father, full of

80
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:44,000
 grace and truth. When you accept Jesus as your saviour, you are lovingly swept into his family

81
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,640
 and you are lovingly swept into this family.

82
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:56,160
 And in a church of this size, no one should be alone this Christmas.

83
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:04,240
 There is a challenge here that I am deliberately giving to us all. A challenge for us to reach out,

84
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:12,160
 to be vulnerable, to make space in our homes for those who need to experience family this Christmas.

85
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:22,080
 What else can we learn from the first Christmas? What was its purpose? What was the purpose of the

86
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:31,840
 first Christmas? Jesus came into the world to make sure every human being knew their full worth,

87
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,480
 that they were loved and that they were valuable.

88
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:47,840
 What would our Christmas look like if our sole focus was to ensure that the people in our lives

89
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:56,080
 came away from Christmas fully loved, fully assured of their value?

90
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:04,560
 You see, the trouble is that Christmas comes with lots of traditions. I mentioned some earlier.

91
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:11,280
 I have fond memories from my childhood of a present opened the night before Christmas.

92
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:18,880
 It always contained a new set of clothes that we would wear the next day to church.

93
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:27,120
 We couldn't open the rest of our presents till we got home from church. We were always envious

94
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,680
 of the families who let their kids open their presents on Christmas morning.

95
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:40,640
 And once we got home, we'd have a big Christmas dinner with a Christmas ham, grandma's potato

96
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:47,360
 salad and all the trimmings. We often had people at our table that were not blood related.

97
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:54,480
 In the early years, we often had students from Papua New Guinea that mum and dad would bring

98
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:02,160
 back with them to Australia. My mum and dad were teachers in Papua New Guinea and every Christmas

99
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,840
 they would pay for some senior students to accompany them back with our family to Australia

100
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:13,520
 to have Christmas. And in the later years, I remember bringing loads of our friends from

101
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:21,920
 university back to my parents' place to share Christmas. After a big Christmas lunch, we'd play

102
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:28,160
 a game of backyard cricket and then get stuck into the leftovers because there's always leftovers

103
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:38,400
 on Christmas day. Here are some photos from my childhood of students that my mum and dad brought

104
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:45,520
 back from Papua New Guinea to us to share Christmas with us. That's a little Susanna up there with the

105
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:52,240
 blonde hair. Sorry, they're so hard to see because obviously they're back in, you know, the time when

106
00:13:52,240 --> 00:14:00,960
 cameras were not that great. Over the years, I've tried to recreate some of these traditions for my

107
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:06,800
 own children, wanting them to experience some of the joy that I remember from my childhood.

108
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:14,000
 And there's nothing inherently wrong with this. But recently, God got my attention and shared

109
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,240
 something with me that I'd like to share with you today. A month ago, I was at Bethany on

110
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:28,160
 Chungchow Island having a retreat. If you don't know what Bethany is, it's a retreat centre on

111
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:35,360
 Chungchow Island, very cheap, but a beautiful place that you can go if you just want to stop.

112
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:42,000
 You can either take your family or go as an individual. I highly recommend it. And when I

113
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,600
 go there, there's a place I go to sit in the morning. It's out on the rocks on a cliff,

114
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:55,440
 overlooking the water. Every time I go to Bethany, I visit this same spot and have a quiet time.

115
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:01,920
 It's become a bit of a tradition. Well, this time when I got there, it began to rain.

116
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:10,560
 At first, it was a light shower, and then it became a downpour. I didn't want to leave. This

117
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:17,360
 was my tradition. So I began searching for a dry place. I eventually found one tucked under some

118
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:24,640
 trees. However, as I was sitting there, I realised I could see none of the views, none of the beautiful

119
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:31,680
 views that I loved going to that place for. So I began searching again. And after 10 minutes,

120
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:39,120
 I stopped and I said, "God, you knew I was going to be here. You prompted me to come. What are

121
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:47,600
 you trying to tell me?" And I felt God say to me, "You can continue to waste time trying to recapture

122
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,360
 an experience you've had in the past, or you can embrace the reality of this moment,

123
00:15:53,360 --> 00:16:00,880
 this new moment in time, and create a new experience, a new memory."

124
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:07,360
 You see, when we try to recapture an experience or memory from the past,

125
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,520
 you might create a version of it, like sitting in the dry space under the tree.

126
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:20,320
 But you'll miss out on the views. You'll miss out on the beauty of the new things

127
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:27,920
 you could have experienced. At that first Christmas, Joseph's family were trying to

128
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:35,280
 hold on to their reputation, their traditions. But the reality was that life had changed.

129
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:45,440
 Circumstances had changed. Joseph and Mary's life had changed. Yes, it was messy, but they were family.

130
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:53,120
 Instead of embracing this, Joseph's family chose to try and keep up the appearance

131
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,800
 of the perfect family by distancing themselves from the mess.

132
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:10,000
 So let me ask again, what would our Christmas look like if our sole focus was to ensure that

133
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:18,720
 the people in our lives came away from Christmas fully loved and fully assured of their value?

134
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,280
 Would it look a little more messy?

135
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:34,880
 Would there be more people at our table? Would there be moments of tears as we held someone who

136
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:41,200
 might be experiencing their first Christmas without their spouse or their friend or their

137
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:49,360
 grandparent or their child? If we relinquished our preconceptions of what Christmas should be

138
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:56,480
 and instead made it a time of welcome, a time of inclusion where rejection is undone

139
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:08,560
 and loss is acknowledged, a time of deep love, a time where we reaffirm value despite the chaos

140
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:18,960
 and despite the mess, maybe, just maybe, we will see wondrous new views and unexpected beauty in

141
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:28,800
 the midst of the mess. Something like what the wise men experienced. In the middle of all the

142
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:39,360
 mess of Herod and his scheming, the wise men go on their way and the star they'd seen in the east

143
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:46,000
 goes ahead of them and it stops over the place where the child is. When they saw the star,

144
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:54,080
 they're overjoyed and on coming inside, they see the child with his mother Mary and they bow and

145
00:18:54,080 --> 00:19:01,680
 worship him. They open their treasures and they present him with gifts. The wise men got to see

146
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:08,240
 this wondrous new view, the brand new baby born in the midst of the chaos of that time.

147
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:14,720
 Upholding the traditions of Christmas, the food, the presents, the decorations,

148
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:21,120
 it can be stressful. I'm a little bit stressed at the moment because my four grown children have

149
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:27,360
 all their presents wrapped under the tree and I don't have one. Very stressful.

150
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:35,440
 The first Christmas came with some gifts but in every other way, it was very ordinary.

151
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:44,960
 Why did God bring his son into the world this way, almost in the poorest, humblest way?

152
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:56,000
 Why? When he could have arranged it so differently. I think there are two main reasons.

153
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:05,200
 I think he wanted to identify with his creation, with us, with the least.

154
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:12,880
 To tell us this Christmas that he understands what it is to be without.

155
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:23,040
 He understands what it is to be estranged from family, to be lonely and in need.

156
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:35,760
 He understands what it is to feel rejected, to feel unseen and to be labelled invaluable by society.

157
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:47,840
 In our mess, our chaos, our confusion, our disappointment, our loneliness, our exclusion,

158
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:57,280
 our rejection, Jesus can look us straight in the eye and he can say, "I fully understand.

159
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,920
 I've been there."

160
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:09,440
 Another reason I believe God chose to bring his son into the world in this way is to loudly proclaim

161
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:18,400
 that he would not be all about the bells and the whistles, all the external trappings of wealth

162
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:25,200
 and position and privilege and pride. He would not be like any earthly king.

163
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,880
 His kingdom would not focus on the outward but the inward.

164
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:37,520
 Can we be reminded this Christmas that it is not about the bells and whistles?

165
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:46,160
 Can we lay aside any stress that is building? Can we lay aside any strivings for the perfect

166
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:55,920
 Christmas? Can we learn from Jesus what Christmas is truly all about? Christmas can be simple

167
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:04,640
 and Christmas can be messy. Christmas can be different from what it has been before.

168
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:10,640
 This Christmas, can we be challenged to embrace the new moment

169
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:16,160
 we are in? Can we be challenged to create some new views?

170
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:23,680
 Can we open up our family home to those who need it the most?

171
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:32,800
 Can we be challenged to reconcile and invite family members back in who've previously been

172
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:43,200
 shut out? Instead of lavishing expensive gifts on people, can we give them the gift of our time,

173
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:53,600
 our presence, our love? Can we make sure that the least in our worlds are remembered,

174
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,880
 that they're visited, that they're given gifts? I want you to stop and think who are the people

175
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,080
 in your life, who are the least that God has surrounded your life with?

176
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:16,560
 Are they domestic workers? Are they elderly relatives? Are they refugee families?

177
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:22,000
 Are they people who have no one to spend Christmas with?

178
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:28,160
 There's a lot of people in Hong Kong who have no family here to spend Christmas with.

179
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:34,480
 And in fact, when we came to Hong Kong, we were very lonely.

180
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,440
 And when it came to Christmas time, we decided that

181
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,880
 we would open up our Christmas table to anyone who didn't have a place to go.

182
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,960
 And we forged some of the most beautiful relationships from those times.

183
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,440
 Some of the people we've shared Christmas with are in the services today.

184
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,600
 Some of them will be joining us on Christmas Day still.

185
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:14,320
 If in our loneliness, we had not reached out, if we'd not been vulnerable, we would have missed

186
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:20,880
 out on all those beautiful new views, all those beautiful friends that we now have,

187
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,160
 that we've made family.

188
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:30,720
 Jesus's purpose in coming was to make sure every human knows their full worth,

189
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:40,880
 that they are fully loved and fully valuable. Can this become our purpose this Christmas?

190
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,840
 Can you stand with me?

191
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:54,400
 (Silence)

192
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,400
 Father, we just come to you.

193
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:06,400
 And in the midst of all this crowd, each of us is seen by you.

194
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,400
 Because you don't see a crowd, God, you see

195
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:18,000
 individuals that you love, that you know, that you value.

196
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:27,680
 Father, we just ask that this Christmas we will take the opportunity to reimagine it,

197
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:36,720
 see what it could be, ask you if there's something new that you want us to do with it,

198
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:43,520
 someone you want us to draw near, someone you want us to love better,

199
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:50,000
 someone you want us to reconcile with and to give a second chance to.

200
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,560
 (Silence)

201
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:02,800
 Father, we just remember in this moment how loved we are.

202
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,640
 (Silence)

203
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,680
 (Silence)

204
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:14,880
 Wrap us up afresh in your kindness and your love.

205
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,120
 (Silence)

206
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,720
 And Father, this Christmas,

207
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:26,160
 (Silence)

208
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,920
 may it be a little bit messy.

209
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:32,640
 (Silence)

210
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:39,920
 May we be willing to open up ourselves to share it with a few more people,

211
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,920
 to share it with someone maybe who's grieving.

212
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:50,640
 (Silence)

213
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,600
 And Father, I also pray for people standing here today.

214
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,720
 (Silence)

215
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,680
 And no one's ever told you that you were composed with all the beautiful notes.

216
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,520
 (Silence)

217
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:11,280
 You've never heard that you are so loved, that God didn't even withhold his own son.

218
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,160
 (Silence)

219
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:19,760
 He wanted you to know that you are fully valuable, fully treasured.

220
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,920
 (Silence)

221
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:28,880
 And if you don't know that today, then I encourage you to pray with someone, to let someone know.

222
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,120
 (Silence)

223
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:38,480
 Because you are loved with a love that has no end to it.

224
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:44,800
 (Silence)

225
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,360
 Father, for those of us who've been blessed with much,

226
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:55,360
 show us ways to make the least be seen this Christmas.

227
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,360
 (Silence)

228
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:03,840
 That they might know that they are no one, and that you see them.

229
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:13,200
 (Silence)

230
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,640
 Father, we just thank you for the example that you gave us of that first Christmas.

231
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,480
 (Silence)

232
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,720
 You didn't make it something that was so out of reach that none of us could reach it.

233
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,680
 (Silence)

234
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:30,640
 You made it something so simple, just relationships.

235
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,480
 (Silence)

236
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,080
 No material things.

237
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,000
 (Silence)

238
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,680
 We can all do that, God.

239
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,480
 (Silence)

240
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,440
 Just great love.

241
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,760
 (Silence)

242
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:51,200
 Fill us all afresh with your great love, your capacity that goes beyond offenses,

243
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,880
 that goes beyond estrangement, that goes beyond our limits,

244
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,840
 and makes a way where there is no way, this Christmas, God.

245
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,600
 (Silence)

246
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:12,160
 May the people in our lives leave Christmas fully assured of that they are loved,

247
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:17,760
 fully assured that they are valued, and that they are no one.

248
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,120
 In your precious name, amen.

249
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:31,120
