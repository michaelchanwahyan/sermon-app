1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,340
 Everyone says, amen, amen, amen.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,840
 (congregation applauding)

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:06,800
 Have a seat, have a seat.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,600
 My name's Andrew, I'm one of the pastors here,

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,800
 and if you're relatively new to the Vine,

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,200
 we're so glad you're with us.

7
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,800
 We're in week two of a four-week series

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,800
 on the topic of personal transformation.

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,400
 And this idea in scripture

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,840
 that one of the primary ministries of Jesus

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,240
 is to, through His Spirit and His truth,

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,000
 take us from the people that we are right now

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,840
 to the people that He longs for us to be,

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,440
 the people He's created us to be.

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,040
 And we're basing this series in Ezra, the book of Ezra,

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,240
 and specifically this moment of pivotal history

17
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,400
 for Israel's people,

18
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,560
 where they've been taken out of their exile in Babylon,

19
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,400
 the 70 years of exile in Babylon,

20
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,160
 and now released by Cyrus, the king of Persia,

21
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,700
 to go back to Jerusalem,

22
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,960
 and they're standing there in the book of Ezra

23
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,460
 in the rubble of Jerusalem,

24
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,400
 where Jerusalem, some 70 years before,

25
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,600
 had been this glorious city.

26
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,100
 The Babylonians had come in, pulled down the wall,

27
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,240
 destroyed the temple, 70 years in exile.

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,840
 Now the Jewish people back standing

29
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,800
 in the rubble of the city they love.

30
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,200
 And as they're standing in that rubble,

31
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,300
 they hear the taunts of the enemies around them.

32
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:21,060
 And those taunts say, "Can you see the rubble around you?

33
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,700
 "Can you see how burnt out the stones are?

34
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,600
 "Can you see what was once glorious

35
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,460
 "now lies in ruin around you?

36
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:33,460
 "Can life ever come back to these burnt out stones?"

37
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:37,600
 And we said last week that for Israel, so for us,

38
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,840
 that there's things that lie in ruin in us,

39
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,800
 rubble that we're aware of in our own lives.

40
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,860
 Perhaps something that's happened to us in the past,

41
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,840
 something that we're not proud of.

42
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,100
 Perhaps the mistakes we've made,

43
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,160
 or maybe mistakes others made to us.

44
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,960
 Trauma that's embedded, hurt and shame, failure, pain,

45
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,860
 whatever it might be.

46
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,660
 But I think all of us can recognize

47
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,740
 that there's some things in our lives that lie in ruin.

48
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,960
 Rubble that we're asking ourselves,

49
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,640
 can anything good ever come from this?

50
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,460
 That we wrestle, don't we, with sometimes recognizing

51
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,760
 that we're not the people that we wanna be.

52
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,860
 And we think, you know what?

53
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,500
 I can never be the person that I wanna be.

54
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,960
 I can never be the person God wants me to be.

55
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,440
 'Cause I've got this rubble and this ruin.

56
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,880
 And have you seen it?

57
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,720
 And if you could see it,

58
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,280
 you'd know that nothing good could ever come from this.

59
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,040
 And what we saw last week in Ezra chapter three

60
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,180
 is this beautiful moment where the builders

61
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,180
 bring out the first stones to begin to rebuild the temple

62
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,980
 that had been destroyed some 70 years before.

63
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,940
 And as they bring it out,

64
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,580
 there's this sense of that question hanging over Israel.

65
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,340
 Are you going to agree with the taunts of the enemy,

66
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,080
 see the rubble around you and think nothing good

67
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,380
 could ever come from it?

68
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,980
 Or are you gonna get a new mindset?

69
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,980
 And then recognize that there is that rubble,

70
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,580
 but believe that in the power and in the mercy of God,

71
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,180
 the rain that falls by the Holy Spirit,

72
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,680
 what was rubble in this moment

73
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,040
 can become a new building in the next.

74
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,680
 And last week, I shared with you some ways

75
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,720
 in which I think God begins this process

76
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,320
 of personal transformation in our lives

77
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,220
 and those areas that we recognize have that ruin

78
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,780
 and that rubble.

79
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,540
 I wanted to summarize four things specifically

80
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,040
 that we talked about last week,

81
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,940
 just to help you get a sense of where we are in this series.

82
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:32,940
 And then we're gonna go from there.

83
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,040
 Here's the first thing we learned last week.

84
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,780
 Any process of personal transformation doesn't begin

85
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,580
 until we take an honest and sober look

86
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,280
 at the rubble that exists in our lives.

87
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,280
 We must understand and own what needs to change within us.

88
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,340
 No one has ever changed or transformed

89
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,000
 without first saying there's something inside of me

90
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,400
 that needs to change.

91
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,300
 And it's a sober thing to recognize

92
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,900
 that there is rubble and ruin,

93
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,140
 not to try to hide it,

94
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,300
 not to try to pretend it's not there,

95
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,880
 but to say, Lord, I recognize it

96
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,040
 and I know I can't do anything about it,

97
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,200
 but Lord, I bring it to you.

98
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,300
 We saw last week, number two,

99
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,200
 that God's work of renewal begins in the rubble.

100
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,640
 It's the very place where he does his best work.

101
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,480
 He doesn't remove our rubble.

102
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,600
 He restores it.

103
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,000
 The beautiful thing that we saw last week

104
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,400
 is that those first kind of stones

105
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,040
 that were laid by the builders

106
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,240
 were out of that burnt out rubble

107
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,580
 where people thought nothing good could ever come of that.

108
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,300
 That becomes the stone the builders rejected,

109
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,140
 becomes the cornerstone.

110
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,740
 The things in our lives that we think,

111
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,540
 oh man, if only I could just get rid

112
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,300
 of all of that gunk and stuff.

113
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,940
 That's the stuff that God's playground.

114
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,740
 He looks at that stuff in your life.

115
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,340
 He rolls up his sleeves and says,

116
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,040
 come on, we're gonna do something

117
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,740
 with what you thought could never be transformed or renewed.

118
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,780
 Thirdly, we saw this last week.

119
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,600
 As Christians, worship must begin a process

120
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,900
 of transformation, not just complete it.

121
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,140
 When we are in the rubble,

122
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,780
 our worship should focus on the character of God

123
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,200
 over the circumstance of the world.

124
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,840
 We often worship as a response,

125
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,600
 worship out of the overflow

126
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,840
 or the outcome of something God's done.

127
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,100
 God's answered that prayer.

128
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,140
 He's come through for me.

129
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,340
 He's done that miracle.

130
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,040
 Out of that, I find worship.

131
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,300
 And that's absolutely right.

132
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,300
 We should worship out of outcome.

133
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,200
 But what we see in Ezra chapter three

134
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,080
 is that the Jewish people, the Israelites,

135
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,740
 began worship long before they saw an outcome.

136
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,000
 They lay the foundations of the stone

137
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,600
 through this act of worship, giving praise and glory,

138
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,340
 not because of what they can see with their eyes,

139
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,880
 not because of some thing

140
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,140
 that they're expecting God to do in the future.

141
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,580
 They praise for the character of God

142
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:43,180
 over the circumstance they find themselves in.

143
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,900
 And every move of personal transformation in your life

144
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,980
 will happen as we shift towards this worship

145
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:54,300
 of his character over our circumstance.

146
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,500
 Not an easy thing to do,

147
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,580
 but something glorious when we do it.

148
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,940
 And here's the fourth thing.

149
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,380
 We said this, we must understand

150
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,440
 that God's renewal takes time.

151
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,600
 It is a journey of many small, obedient decisions

152
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,740
 within a much larger framework

153
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,540
 of God's purposes in our lives.

154
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,200
 We would love a magic wand to be waved

155
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,300
 and suddenly that trauma goes, but the reality is

156
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,600
 so often it's those small little steps

157
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,080
 that we take each day when we stay obedient

158
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,180
 to the thing that God's called us in our lives,

159
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:25,700
 that God shapes a masterpiece over time.

160
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,180
 Some of the most important things

161
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,740
 that God will ever do in your life,

162
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,080
 it's gonna take some time.

163
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,480
 And sometimes opening ourselves up

164
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,000
 to the journey of that process

165
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,500
 is primary in the season of transformation in our lives.

166
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,700
 So that was last week.

167
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,680
 If you weren't here last week,

168
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,180
 you can jump back online, you can hear it,

169
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,800
 or you can just take a photo of that slide and go,

170
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,140
 I've got it, all right?

171
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:48,240
 So last week we focused on this idea

172
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,140
 that personal transformation begins with this.

173
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:55,840
 Today, I wanna talk about, as we continue this passage,

174
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,440
 I wanna talk about the environment

175
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,740
 by which personal transformation truly happens

176
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,980
 and how we here at the Vine might be able

177
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:07,400
 to create that kind of environment together.

178
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,780
 And to tell you about that, I wanna share a quick story.

179
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,480
 In my early 20s, I worked for a recruitment company.

180
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,880
 It was a headhunting firm,

181
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,640
 an international headhunting company

182
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,640
 that had offices in New York, in Hong Kong, and in Tokyo.

183
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,480
 And it just so happened that when I was about 23 years old,

184
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,200
 most of my clients, most of my candidates

185
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,840
 were based in Tokyo.

186
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,100
 So every eight weeks, I would have a business trip

187
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,540
 up to Tokyo, and for Monday to Friday,

188
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,740
 I would be in the Tokyo office,

189
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,280
 and I'd be meeting with my clients,

190
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,480
 meeting with my candidates and doing all that.

191
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,540
 Then I'd come back to Hong Kong.

192
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,800
 But on this one particular trip,

193
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,300
 the company up in Japan asked me to stay for two weeks,

194
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,980
 which meant that I was gonna, for the first time,

195
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,780
 stay over the weekend in Tokyo.

196
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:50,580
 And I had come to Christ about three years prior to this.

197
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,700
 So I came to Jesus at university

198
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,580
 when I was in my early 20s.

199
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:58,480
 Now I'm 23, I'm in Tokyo, I'm staying over the weekend.

200
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,980
 And I decided I wanted to go and visit a church,

201
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,680
 not knowing anything really about the Christian context

202
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,180
 in Japan or about churches in general.

203
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,340
 And you also have to remember,

204
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,640
 I'm kind of dating myself here,

205
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,340
 but this was quite a while ago, okay, when I was 23.

206
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:15,380
 So the interwebs was not quite the thing that it is today.

207
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,200
 It existed, okay, we used it,

208
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,600
 but there was no Google Maps,

209
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,200
 there was no kind of stuff like that,

210
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,780
 none of that existed yet.

211
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,240
 So I did the smart thing,

212
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,680
 I turned to my Japanese colleague in the office,

213
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,380
 and I said, "Hey, would you make some phone calls for me

214
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,540
 "and find out if there's a church near where I'm staying?"

215
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,840
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm just on, I'm just on, okay, okay."

216
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,700
 (audience laughing)

217
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,340
 So he makes some phone calls across the day,

218
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,400
 and at the end of the day, he comes to me,

219
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,500
 he's like, "Oh, Andrew-san," he goes,

220
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,000
 "I find a church for you."

221
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,080
 And I'm like, "Oh, that's great."

222
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,500
 He's like, "It's only a 10-minute walk

223
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,000
 "from your hotel where you're staying, fantastic."

224
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,900
 He says, "It's on the 14th floor of this industrial building,"

225
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,980
 and he gave me the details, he wrote it all out for me.

226
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,200
 So sure enough, on the Sunday,

227
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,340
 I think the service started at like 9.30 or 10,

228
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,800
 I can't fully remember, but I was there on time,

229
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,340
 got in the lift, I went up,

230
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,780
 the doors of the lift opened on the 14th floor,

231
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,480
 and I looked at what was in front of me,

232
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,140
 and I immediately began to think,

233
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,580
 I might need to fire my colleague.

234
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:12,140
 (audience laughing)

235
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:16,240
 In front of me was this old Japanese lady, beautiful lady,

236
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,400
 probably in her late 70s, early 80s,

237
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,500
 wearing a very formal Japanese outfit,

238
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,680
 hunched a little bit because of her age.

239
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,580
 When she saw the doors open, her eyes just lit up.

240
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,200
 She was so excited.

241
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,700
 She's like, "A foreigner has come to our church.

242
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,940
 Like revival is breaking out."

243
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,280
 And she gives me like this little brochure

244
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,880
 that was all in Japanese.

245
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,900
 She opens this door and leads me into this room.

246
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,840
 I go into this room,

247
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,380
 there's probably about 50 chairs in this room,

248
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,200
 a small kind of room, about 50 chairs.

249
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,300
 There's about 15 people standing in the room.

250
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,140
 As I come in, all 15 people turn around,

251
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,100
 and I immediately realized that the youngest person

252
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,440
 in that room other than me was probably about 78.

253
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,140
 (audience laughing)

254
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,880
 And they were all super like conservative,

255
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,100
 old Japanese people.

256
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,500
 And they all stared at me with eyes lit up,

257
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,640
 just like the lady at the entrance,

258
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,740
 and they all rushed over me.

259
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,200
 And it was that awkward moment,

260
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,700
 when you're not Japanese, you don't know what to do.

261
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,180
 It's like, do you bow?

262
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,500
 They're all bowing.

263
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,040
 They're all welcoming me.

264
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,640
 They're speaking Japanese.

265
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,040
 I don't speak Japanese.

266
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,280
 They obviously don't speak much English.

267
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,840
 Super awkward, but everybody's being super friendly,

268
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,200
 super nice, and I'm like, okay, I guess I'll go.

269
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,040
 I can't leave now.

270
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,680
 Like, that would be the worst thing ever.

271
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,500
 See you guys.

272
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,140
 Like, nice to, you know.

273
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,880
 So I'm like, I'm stuck.

274
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,280
 Anyway, this guy, probably about 82, 83,

275
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,440
 he grabbed me and he pulled me down the aisle.

276
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,640
 He stood next to me.

277
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,580
 He's like, oh, oh, oh, oh, you know, like this.

278
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,180
 (audience laughing)

279
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,680
 And then worship started.

280
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,900
 Now, when worship started, half of the congregation

281
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,600
 got up on stage, 'cause they were the worship team, right?

282
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,060
 So there was like six of us left, six on the stage.

283
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,640
 They had like keyboardists and drummers

284
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,000
 and guitarists and singers.

285
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,560
 Over the next 15 minutes,

286
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,400
 it's hard to describe to you that experience,

287
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,200
 but I would say it like this.

288
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,200
 It was very easily the worst worship

289
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,440
 I have ever heard in my life.

290
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,540
 Like, not just 23, but now that I'm 50, okay?

291
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:25,100
 The worst, the guitar player, he gets so old,

292
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,000
 he could barely fret a chord, okay?

293
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,640
 The pianist, I think, was deaf

294
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,000
 because they were pounding the keys as hard as they could.

295
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,440
 The drummer must have probably been able to drum

296
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,440
 50 years ago, but right now,

297
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,100
 he could not find a rhythm at all.

298
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,040
 And I realized every single person had decided

299
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,140
 that they had a song they wanted to bring to worship,

300
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,500
 but none of them have talked to each other about it,

301
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,580
 and they're all just playing whatever they want to play.

302
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,800
 And I haven't even told you yet about the singers.

303
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,800
 (congregation laughing)

304
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,900
 They were terrible, like so bad,

305
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,080
 like couldn't hold a tune, couldn't do anything.

306
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,200
 And I'm standing there thinking,

307
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,740
 this is the worst thing I've ever heard.

308
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,740
 And I turned to the guy next to me,

309
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,540
 and I'm about to go like, (imitates drumming)

310
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,880
 like this, and he's like, he's like lost like 30 years.

311
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,840
 He's jumping up in the air.

312
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,140
 His arms are pumped up in the air.

313
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,180
 And I'm thinking, what is going on?

314
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,280
 For me, this is the kind of worship

315
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,140
 that makes Jesus not want to come back to the world.

316
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,680
 (congregation laughing)

317
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,720
 It's the kind of worship that keeps Jesus away.

318
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,680
 I don't want to be anywhere near those humans.

319
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,980
 But this guy's going like crazy,

320
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,740
 and he's shouting something.

321
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,580
 Here's what he's shouting.

322
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,540
 He's going, he's saying,

323
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:45,540
 (speaking in foreign language)

324
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,040
 He turns to me, he grabs me by the arms.

325
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,940
 (speaking in foreign language)

326
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:54,280
 He looked like really angry, like (speaking in foreign language)

327
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,580
 I'm thinking maybe, I have no idea what (speaking in foreign language)

328
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,980
 but I'm thinking maybe it's the name

329
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,300
 of the actual worship pastor who was sick

330
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,840
 and didn't show up that day.

331
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:06,680
 And he's like, (speaking in foreign language)

332
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,980
 I'm like, yes, (speaking in foreign language)

333
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,380
 I wish he was here too.

334
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,500
 But he's screaming.

335
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,240
 And the reason why I remember (speaking in foreign language)

336
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,500
 is 'cause he said it like 100 times, top of his lung,

337
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,740
 (speaking in foreign language)

338
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,180
 Monday morning, I'm back at the office,

339
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,880
 and I find my colleague.

340
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,940
 (congregation laughing)

341
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,340
 And after slapping him around a little bit,

342
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,440
 I said to him, I said, can you define a word for me?

343
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,300
 I heard at this church this word, (speaking in foreign language)

344
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,580
 What does (speaking in foreign language) mean?

345
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,840
 And he's like, oh, this is interesting.

346
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,300
 This is not a standard Japanese word.

347
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,440
 It's not a word that I know,

348
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,580
 but it's a conjoint of lots of things coming.

349
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,880
 He starts to explain all this stuff.

350
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,900
 And he's like, it's like lots of different ideas

351
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,540
 brought down into this one word.

352
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,100
 And I'm like, okay, well, what are the ideas?

353
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,900
 And he said, well, there's a shaking, a tearing,

354
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,940
 and then there's like the sky.

355
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,940
 So I said, you mean it's like a shaking the sky?

356
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,300
 He's like, yes, yes, but also like tearing,

357
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,380
 wanting to tear the sky.

358
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,180
 And I'm like, well, could it be like heaven?

359
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,640
 Like tear the heavens, shake the heavens.

360
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,080
 He's like, yes, yes, yes, like shake the heavens.

361
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,380
 It's funny, isn't it?

362
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,240
 How you can have, two people,

363
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,100
 can have exactly the same experience,

364
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,880
 but have completely different reactions

365
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,700
 and perspectives of it.

366
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,280
 I show up in this church with my baggage of worship

367
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,700
 that I had, which was the vines worship.

368
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:30,700
 Oh, yeah, great musicians, perfect sound,

369
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,280
 everybody in tune actually playing the same song,

370
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:38,240
 singing in tune, the beautiful sense

371
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,440
 of God's presence among, I mean, this was me.

372
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,780
 That's what constituted good worship, are you with me?

373
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,540
 So I walk into that room knowing the baggage,

374
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,900
 having the history of that kind of worship,

375
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,940
 and I'm experiencing what I'm experiencing.

376
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,940
 And I'm thinking, this is not worship at all,

377
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,240
 but the Japanese man next to me,

378
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,700
 who maybe has never heard any other kind of worship

379
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,180
 than what was happening in that room.

380
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:03,300
 Maybe that church always, that's just been the way it is.

381
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,700
 It's a bit of a free for all, but he's standing there

382
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:09,080
 and he's like, I'm not here to hear skillful musicians.

383
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,940
 I'm here to praise the one that saved me.

384
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,180
 And I'm gonna stand here and go,

385
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,340
 (speaking in foreign language)

386
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:20,400
 rape open the heavens, Lord, bring your glory to this earth.

387
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,080
 And I don't care what the musicians are doing

388
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:27,300
 and how it sounds, it's about my heart and honoring the one,

389
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,680
 even if we're not honoring him with the skills.

390
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,500
 (congregation laughing)

391
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,880
 Rip open, shake open the heavens.

392
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,280
 I, I wanted to run away.

393
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,940
 That church, we're running in.

394
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,880
 I wanted to weep.

395
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,400
 They wanted to worship.

396
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:52,000
 And as we get back to this moment

397
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,780
 that Ezra's describing for us in chapter three,

398
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,180
 as this incredible thing's happening

399
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,900
 with the rebuilding of the temple,

400
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:03,380
 almost exactly the same thing happens here.

401
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,540
 And as we begin to unpack the reality

402
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,240
 of what is happening in these moments,

403
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,800
 I think we can see something quite profound

404
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,540
 that might help to shape our personal growth in moment two.

405
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,980
 Let me read this to you from Ezra three,

406
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,800
 picking up from where we read last week.

407
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,400
 When the builders laid the foundation

408
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,840
 of the temple of the Lord, the priests in their vestments

409
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,440
 and with trumpets and the Levites,

410
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,480
 the sons of Asper and the symbols,

411
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,800
 took their places to praise the Lord

412
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,380
 as prescribed by David, King of Israel.

413
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,300
 With praise and thanksgiving, they sang to the Lord.

414
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:35,040
 He is good, his love endures forever.

415
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,880
 And all the people gave a great shout of praise to the Lord

416
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,100
 because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid.

417
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,080
 Now listen to this.

418
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,840
 But many of the older priests and Levites and family heads

419
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:50,000
 who had seen the former temple wept aloud

420
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,440
 when they saw the foundations of this temple being laid.

421
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,240
 While many others shouted for joy.

422
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,040
 No one could distinguish the sounds of the shouts of joy

423
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,600
 from the sound of weeping

424
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,140
 because the people made so much noise.

425
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,440
 Fathers, we open this up for each person here.

426
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,840
 I pray that Lord, you would do something profound for us

427
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:16,040
 as we honour the reality of every person's story.

428
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,800
 And we thank you for this in Jesus' name, amen.

429
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,500
 One group of people, two very different reactions.

430
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,000
 The whole group seeing the same thing.

431
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,280
 They see the rubble of Jerusalem lying around them.

432
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,180
 They see the stones being brought in to be laid in the temple.

433
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:36,280
 Everybody seeing the same thing, two very different reactions.

434
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,480
 On the one side, there are these older people.

435
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,700
 Now, actually Ezra tells us something really important

436
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,540
 in the text.

437
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,000
 He says, they're so old.

438
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,940
 He doesn't quite say it that way,

439
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,240
 but that's my way of saying it.

440
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,040
 They're so old that they actually had seen the former temple.

441
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,140
 Now, remember the history here.

442
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:53,240
 They were in exile for 70 years.

443
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,440
 So anybody returning back to Jerusalem

444
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,980
 who was over the age of about 74,

445
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,200
 in their early 80s into their 90s,

446
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,080
 they would have seen the former temple.

447
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,380
 Not only that, but they probably would have worshipped

448
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,600
 in the former temple.

449
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,840
 And they would have seen this glorious temple.

450
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,280
 There's an image here coming up behind me,

451
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,280
 which is just this beautiful artist rendition

452
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,200
 from the Bible Society of what that temple

453
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,800
 would have looked like.

454
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,300
 It was one of the most glorious architectural wonders

455
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,380
 of that ancient world.

456
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,200
 And these people, these older Israelites,

457
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,440
 Levites and priests and family heads,

458
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,340
 had with their own eyes seen the glory of that temple.

459
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,940
 Not only that, but they would have experienced

460
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,840
 the power of God's presence within it.

461
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,580
 Now, I wanna just give you a sense

462
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,640
 of what the power of that presence was like

463
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,240
 by reading you the short passage

464
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,900
 about the dedication of the first temple.

465
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,180
 Now, this was years, years before.

466
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,500
 Obviously, none of these people were there for that moment.

467
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,000
 But this is the moment where Solomon

468
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,100
 dedicates the temple, that temple you're seeing

469
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:54,980
 on the screen.

470
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,780
 This is 2 Chronicles 7, verses one to three.

471
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,340
 "When Solomon finished praying,

472
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,040
 "fire came down from heaven

473
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,700
 "and consumed the burnt offering and sacrifices,

474
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,500
 "and the glory of the Lord filled the temple.

475
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,500
 "The priest could not enter the temple of the Lord

476
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,880
 "because the glory of the Lord filled it.

477
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,880
 "When all the Israelites saw the fire coming down

478
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,500
 "and the glory of the Lord above the temple,

479
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,740
 "they knelt on the pavement with their faces to the ground

480
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,480
 "and they worshipped and gave thanks to the Lord,

481
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,080
 "saying, 'He is good, His love endures forever.'"

482
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,580
 So here's the interesting thing.

483
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,780
 The older Levites and priests now in Ezra's time,

484
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,180
 obviously, they weren't there in that moment

485
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,640
 of the first dedication of the temple.

486
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,940
 But 'cause they're the Levites and the priests,

487
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,940
 they know the story, they know exactly what's happened,

488
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,100
 they know what was happening,

489
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,500
 and they're now standing in the rubble of that temple

490
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,600
 and they're weeping.

491
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,040
 And they're weeping because guess what?

492
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,780
 The people of Israel are singing the same song,

493
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,000
 but it's not having the same result.

494
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,440
 Notice in the Ezra passage,

495
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,540
 Ezra said that the people sing the same thing.

496
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:08,100
 "He is good, His love endures forever."

497
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,640
 And these older ones who know that that was sung

498
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,040
 when the first temple was laid,

499
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,540
 they're looking at this second temple

500
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,780
 and they're like, "Are we crazy?

501
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,400
 "Can you not see the rubble that's around us?

502
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,780
 "I remember what it used to look like.

503
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:23,600
 "I remember in my mind the glory of this temple.

504
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,440
 "I felt the power of the presence of God

505
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,680
 "who filled that temple up until the moment

506
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,600
 "that the Babylonians tore it down.

507
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,600
 "And now we're standing here and you're going,

508
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,140
 "'Woo-hoo, He is good.'"

509
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:38,280
 And they're thinking, "No, everything is lost.

510
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,880
 "It's all gone.

511
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,480
 "This is not good.

512
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,480
 "We saw it before, we knew how great it was,

513
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,940
 "but right here, it isn't great anymore."

514
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:50,180
 They're weeping for what they have lost.

515
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:54,880
 They're weeping, not looking forward and going,

516
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,240
 "Hey, here's what God's about to do."

517
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,940
 They're weeping 'cause all they can think about

518
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,000
 is what they've lost.

519
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,400
 They're not in a situation where they're thinking

520
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,780
 about what they're about to gain.

521
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,480
 They're weeping because of just all the things

522
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,800
 that they've already lost.

523
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:15,680
 I wonder if that resonates with any of you here.

524
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,540
 I know it does for me.

525
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,780
 I know it's quite easy to think that my best years

526
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:24,140
 of my life are already in the rear view mirror.

527
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,880
 Like those moments back in the old days.

528
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,780
 Some people in my generation and above,

529
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,280
 we have this phrase, if you're young here,

530
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,340
 it will annoy you, I'm sure.

531
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,640
 And you've heard it many times.

532
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,200
 Oh, in our day.

533
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,840
 Well, if only you'd been in my time.

534
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,400
 In our day, there was no social media.

535
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,780
 People actually talked to each other.

536
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,400
 It was great.

537
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,540
 We actually had community in my day,

538
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,640
 you know, whatever it might be.

539
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,340
 Like we know what it's like, isn't it?

540
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:51,800
 To look back on the past with rose tinted spectacles.

541
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,880
 To look back and go, oh man, I remember those days.

542
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,740
 Oh, that was great.

543
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:58,280
 It's not so great anymore, but it was awesome back there.

544
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,140
 We do this not just in terms of history and experience.

545
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,780
 We do this in terms of relationships.

546
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,740
 How many of us here might be honest and say,

547
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,980
 man, I wish my husband would be like he was

548
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,240
 when we first got married.

549
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,040
 I wish my relationship was as romantic

550
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,880
 as it was when we first started dating.

551
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,480
 Now it feels like my spouse doesn't even look at me.

552
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,740
 As humans, we have this tendency

553
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,920
 to always look back on the things in the past

554
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,020
 with these rose colored glasses,

555
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,680
 kind of being selective about what we remember

556
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,140
 and trying to pull that to kind of say something

557
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,320
 about what it is today.

558
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,240
 But when you look back and all your focus is back

559
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,440
 to the glory of something in the past,

560
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,520
 here's what happens.

561
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,620
 You become blind to the importance

562
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,840
 of your presence in future.

563
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,040
 You just get consumed by all this stuff over here

564
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,120
 and it stops you from actually moving forward.

565
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,120
 See, in seasons of personal transformation,

566
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,940
 it's tempting to idolize the past,

567
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,740
 demonize the presence and fear the future.

568
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:02,520
 It's really tempting for us to do that.

569
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,240
 And this is, I think, what the older Israelites

570
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,240
 and the priests are in danger of doing in this moment.

571
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,840
 They're idolizing the past.

572
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,420
 Oh man, if you had seen that previous temple,

573
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,540
 if you had seen the power that was there,

574
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:18,480
 oh, and you think this is good, you're worshiping to this?

575
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,380
 It's like me in that church in Japan.

576
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:23,080
 Really, you guys, you're worshiping to this?

577
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,840
 And there's this moment, isn't there,

578
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,280
 where we bring the baggage and we say,

579
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,980
 well, if it's not like it was back then,

580
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,280
 well, it can't be any good.

581
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,520
 And the priests and the Levites,

582
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,520
 they're in danger in this moment of weeping

583
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,240
 from completely missing the new thing God wants to do.

584
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,920
 And they're so connected back to the pain

585
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,180
 of what they've lost that they can't even see

586
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,020
 what they're about to gain.

587
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,220
 Not only that, but I think they're also in danger

588
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:52,440
 of wanting to stop the others from building.

589
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,440
 Like, there's no point even trying.

590
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,480
 We can't get back.

591
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,740
 That was the glorious moment.

592
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,680
 That was the great temple.

593
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,480
 Look, just put your tools down.

594
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,880
 There's no spirit here.

595
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,320
 There's no power here.

596
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,380
 Let's just give up.

597
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,480
 We're just singing words without anything.

598
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,960
 They're in danger of allowing the missing

599
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,220
 of the thing in the past to actually begin to say,

600
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,680
 we're not even gonna bother to move forward

601
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,520
 with the present.

602
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:20,020
 See, when you allow the grief of your past

603
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,860
 to continue to speak louder to you

604
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,460
 than the hope of your future,

605
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,980
 you are always going to end up in a situation

606
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,960
 where you're likely to resist and to not embrace

607
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,820
 the very transformation that God wants to do in your life.

608
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,460
 And in this moment, I think this is where

609
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:41,660
 these older people are, two feet here,

610
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:46,660
 and God's here saying, watch what I'm about to do.

611
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:50,760
 But we can actually resist the transformation

612
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,420
 God wants to bring us.

613
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,860
 If we're trying to get ourselves back

614
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,460
 to an old version of ourselves.

615
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,520
 The Hebrew word for restoration in scripture

616
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,820
 is not go back.

617
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,760
 You know, like you think about it with a car.

618
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,860
 What is it like to restore an old car?

619
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:07,160
 The idea is to make it look as good as it did originally.

620
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,620
 That's not the Hebrew word.

621
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,460
 Restoration in scripture is not about trying to get you back

622
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,520
 to the perfect image of the thing in the past.

623
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,820
 It's actually about taking you forward to the new thing.

624
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,760
 Paul would say, anybody who is in Christ Jesus is what?

625
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,920
 A new creation.

626
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,520
 The old is gone, the new has come.

627
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,620
 But here's the older people in Israel,

628
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:28,420
 and they're weeping for what has been lost

629
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:32,220
 when God's saying, can't you see what you're about to gain?

630
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,980
 Now, stay with me for a second,

631
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:38,980
 because I'm not saying that weeping is wrong.

632
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,780
 I'm not saying that mourning is bad,

633
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,460
 that we shouldn't feel emotions and hurt and pain,

634
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,680
 and we shouldn't process that.

635
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,880
 In fact, it's completely the opposite of that.

636
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,220
 Scripture has so much to say about the wonder

637
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,860
 of what it is for us humans to feel and have emotion

638
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,680
 and to know pain and to know trauma,

639
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,820
 and to have to try to process it.

640
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,220
 Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount,

641
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,480
 Matthew 5, 4 says to everybody around him,

642
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,420
 he said, "Blessed are those who mourn,

643
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,580
 for they will be comforted."

644
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:09,120
 In other words, it's okay to have pain.

645
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,060
 It's okay to look back and go,

646
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,460
 man, that was something great there that I've lost.

647
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:17,760
 It's all right to feel the disappointment and the hurt.

648
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,320
 In fact, the Christian religion

649
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,720
 is one of the most beautiful religions,

650
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,460
 because rather than trying to simply explain our suffering,

651
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,180
 the Christian religion has a God

652
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,320
 who joins us in that suffering.

653
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,460
 That's a radical thing.

654
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,600
 There's no other religion,

655
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,160
 there's no other faith in the world where that happens,

656
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,460
 where God will come and be a part of the pain

657
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,160
 and the suffering of this world.

658
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:43,460
 Jesus himself weeps out loud bitterly

659
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,860
 when his best friend, Lazarus, dies.

660
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:49,560
 He feels the pain and he doesn't try to hide it,

661
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:53,200
 even though he knows he's about to bring him back to life.

662
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,460
 Get your head around that one for a moment.

663
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,900
 He weeps in the Garden of Gethsemane,

664
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,100
 knowing the weight of what it's going to be

665
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,360
 to take the sin of the world on his shoulders

666
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,560
 and a desperate cry before his father

667
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,960
 if there's any other way.

668
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,620
 And he weeps and weeps in that moment.

669
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:11,100
 And yet he knows that the Lord, his father,

670
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,660
 is still going to be glorified.

671
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,920
 He knows the victory is there,

672
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,000
 but he still finds a place to weep.

673
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,620
 This is the beautiful thing about our faith.

674
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:24,020
 In Jesus, we do not just have a God of the sufferers,

675
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:26,220
 we have a God who suffers.

676
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,220
 Come on, church.

677
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,920
 That's a profound thought.

678
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:36,860
 That means that in my suffering, in my pain, in my hurt,

679
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,420
 in the things that I'm holding in my spirit,

680
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,760
 I've got a God who understands that.

681
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,520
 I've got a God who's not sitting on a cloud going,

682
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,820
 oh yeah, yeah, you suffer, that must be hard.

683
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:48,500
 I've got a God who's walked in my shoes,

684
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,600
 knows that pain, felt it himself,

685
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,760
 worse than I will ever find it.

686
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,800
 And so I have somebody to turn to

687
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,560
 who understands what's going on in my life

688
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,760
 and can meet me in the reality of the pain

689
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:03,000
 and the brokenness that I feel that liberates me to mourn,

690
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,920
 that allows me to bring my grief.

691
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,720
 This is why we have the lament Psalms in the Psalms.

692
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,720
 It's why we have these beautiful poems

693
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,700
 where God's people say, why have you forsaken me?

694
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,920
 Where are you, God?

695
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,060
 Why have you left me?

696
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,000
 Why have you gone?

697
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,560
 And we begin to have these beautiful expressions.

698
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,760
 And if I was writing the Bible and putting it together,

699
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,000
 I would have taken those things and left them out.

700
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,860
 Like, oh, that's a bit harsh.

701
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,360
 You can't speak to God that way.

702
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,020
 Let's just put that one aside.

703
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:31,760
 No, no, they're in the scriptures to give us permission

704
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,420
 to bring our big feelings to God,

705
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:37,000
 to not bury them under the ground or try to push them away

706
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,360
 or pretend that they're not there.

707
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,320
 We have a God who's joined us in our suffering.

708
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,960
 Our suffering always has a place with him.

709
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,660
 I don't need to run from it.

710
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,120
 I don't need to hide from it.

711
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,500
 Equally though, I don't need to let it overwhelm me

712
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,920
 to the point where I can no longer see

713
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,720
 what God's doing in the midst of it.

714
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,500
 - Yeah.

715
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,420
 - You see, when we weep before God, here's what we do.

716
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:06,360
 We acknowledge our humanity and his divinity.

717
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:11,000
 We proclaim through our tears, faith and trust

718
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,660
 that he alone is able to comfort and heal.

719
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:17,500
 That's the wonder of what it is to weep.

720
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,800
 That's the beauty of what it is to offer it.

721
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,460
 And in this moment, yes, I do think that they're weeping

722
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,220
 because of what they feel they've lost.

723
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,960
 But I think there's a bigger point

724
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,500
 to their weeping in this moment.

725
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,120
 They're weeping because they realize

726
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:35,160
 that they are aligning themselves to the pain

727
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,660
 that is on the father's heart.

728
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:39,120
 You see, they're weeping for what I would argue

729
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,660
 is something called godly sorrow.

730
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,960
 Got to remember the history again.

731
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,200
 For 70 years, they're in exile.

732
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,560
 And during that time, they're reflecting

733
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,420
 and they're thinking about what happened.

734
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,620
 And they're asking one critical question.

735
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:57,460
 Why did the walls come down around Jerusalem?

736
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:00,420
 Why did the temple get destroyed?

737
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,620
 And the prophets and the artisans

738
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:05,620
 and the writers of the Psalms in that time, Psalm 131,

739
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,820
 "By the rivers of Babylon, we sat and wept

740
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,520
 when we remembered Zion."

741
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,520
 Their writers and their poets and their artists

742
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,560
 helped them to understand that the reason

743
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:18,100
 why they're in exile is not because God's abandoned them,

744
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,900
 not because God's turned his back on them,

745
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,360
 which is what they thought originally.

746
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,360
 But as they process it, think about it,

747
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,860
 spiritually God speaks in them,

748
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:29,520
 they realize they're in that place because of their choices.

749
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,460
 And the prophets begin to say, "Idolatry and injustice."

750
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,020
 Idolatry in terms of how they were sharing their heart

751
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:40,200
 no longer with Yahweh, but with other gods and deities.

752
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,160
 Injustice where through that, they were treating themselves

753
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,860
 and others around them poorly and wrongly.

754
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,060
 And because idolatry and injustice

755
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:52,420
 was so ripe in their midst, God brings the actions,

756
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:56,200
 the consequences to their sinful choices.

757
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,660
 And I think what's happening here for the older priests,

758
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:02,300
 as they're standing in the rubble, they're weeping,

759
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,760
 not just because they feel like they've lost something,

760
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:09,760
 they're weeping because they realize this is our fault.

761
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:15,920
 We did this, us.

762
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,300
 And I think there's something happening in their hearts

763
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,600
 that is aligning them to the heart of God.

764
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,400
 They're beginning to see sin the way that God sees it,

765
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,160
 and they're beginning to bring these tears of repentance.

766
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,200
 These beautiful, this is not the kind of tears of like,

767
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,460
 "Oh my gosh, I'm so bad, I've screwed up,

768
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,260
 I'm such a terrible person."

769
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:38,960
 This is like, I see finally what God sees about brokenness

770
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,460
 and idolatry and injustice, and it is not right.

771
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:45,320
 And it breaks my heart like it breaks God's heart.

772
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,960
 And it breaks me even more

773
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,800
 'cause I realized I was the one that did this.

774
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,220
 And Lord, I weep because as I look at the rubble,

775
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:57,060
 I know that we brought the walls down.

776
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:03,760
 And this profound sense of godly sorrow,

777
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,760
 not to beat myself up 'cause I'm the worst in the world,

778
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:11,660
 but a beautiful recognition that I finally agree with God,

779
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:15,300
 and I know that he can liberate me,

780
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,460
 that he can forgive me and give me grace and mercy,

781
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,300
 brings me to tears.

782
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,960
 Some of you here, it's really important you hear this.

783
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,600
 Some of you here, your own journey

784
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,100
 and personal transformation will not begin

785
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,600
 until you actually have the courage to agree

786
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,520
 with how God sees sin and really, truly grieve

787
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,460
 its persistent presence in your life.

788
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:42,260
 I know it's not an easy word, but that's truth.

789
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:46,560
 Some of us, until we actually find ourselves

790
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,120
 like those Levites and the priests, man,

791
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,260
 I'm so sorry, Lord.

792
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:56,720
 I'm finally admitting and owning that this happened.

793
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,960
 And Lord, I come to you because I have the courage

794
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,700
 to agree with you and how I see myself.

795
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,620
 I'm sorry, Lord.

796
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:08,060
 But I'm not just sorry as in like, oh, I'm the worst.

797
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:11,220
 I'm sorry because I know I don't deserve it.

798
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,800
 I don't understand it, but there is grace

799
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,500
 and there is mercy in you and you forgive me.

800
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,020
 And when I know that I don't deserve your forgiveness,

801
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:22,100
 but you give it to me, it makes the tears come more.

802
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:28,260
 And there's this beautiful moment

803
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:31,360
 where these people are weeping,

804
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,460
 maybe for the first time and saying,

805
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,860
 Lord, would you forgive us?

806
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:42,100
 I love how the fact that Ezra takes that moment

807
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,200
 and he tells us that right alongside of it,

808
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,700
 there's a whole bunch of young people praising Jesus,

809
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,600
 praising the Lord, so excited about what's happening.

810
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,720
 Both of these things are right in the same moment.

811
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,520
 It was right for the older people to go,

812
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,660
 oh man, I've lost something.

813
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,520
 Oh man, we've done something.

814
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,920
 Lord, we're sorry.

815
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,560
 But it was also right for the young ones to stand around

816
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,220
 and go, isn't he good?

817
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,220
 Isn't he great?

818
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,160
 He is good.

819
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,960
 His love does endure forever

820
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,520
 'cause he's about to start a new process within us.

821
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,960
 This starting point of weeping

822
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,020
 is the beginning point of praising.

823
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:17,100
 As we bring weeping and worshiping side by side,

824
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,920
 something truly transformative

825
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,360
 begins to happen in our lives.

826
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,060
 We truly begin to become the people

827
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,820
 that God has always called us to be.

828
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:27,820
 This is the very soundtrack to what change is in our lives.

829
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,460
 It's not, we often think that personal transformation

830
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,860
 is linear, I'm just gonna have a season of weeping,

831
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:33,800
 weeping, weeping, weeping,

832
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,100
 and then boom, I'm in eternity of praise.

833
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,720
 The human experience isn't that way.

834
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,720
 Our human experience is weeping and worship side by side.

835
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,500
 Days where we feel great, days where we're struggling.

836
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:51,820
 Maybe even in the same day, moments of joy

837
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:55,600
 coupled with moments of grief.

838
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,960
 And what we're seeing in this passage

839
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,000
 is when we allow that to happen,

840
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,800
 when we don't shy away from it,

841
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,300
 when we don't try to bury it,

842
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,860
 when we bring worship and weeping mingled together,

843
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:09,000
 something profound happens.

844
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,500
 And the greatest moments of personal transformation happen

845
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,520
 when those two things are allowed to exist

846
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,320
 in our lives together.

847
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:23,300
 Some of your greatest joys can only be formed

848
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,900
 out of your deepest pain.

849
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,720
 Come on, church.

850
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:31,160
 Some of your greatest joys can only be found,

851
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,820
 forged in you out of your deepest pain.

852
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,520
 When I was 32 years old,

853
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,720
 I received the diagnosis of azuspermia,

854
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,220
 which means that I am unable

855
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,240
 to father children biologically.

856
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,720
 And this was at the end of an eight-year journey

857
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,820
 when my wife and I were trying to have biological family,

858
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:53,880
 all the dreams that we had in our heart for children.

859
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,280
 I've told this story many times,

860
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,540
 but that was my deepest pain.

861
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:01,620
 I began to second guess who I was as a man.

862
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:04,520
 I began to second guess who I was as a husband.

863
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:07,580
 I really struggled with not liking God in that moment,

864
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,940
 feeling like, why did he create me with a desire

865
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:12,340
 to have a family and then make me physically unable

866
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,480
 to do it?

867
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,240
 Like, is God some joker up in heaven

868
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,180
 who's just having fun playing with my life?

869
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:22,580
 I was in this place of darkness, deep hurt and deep pain.

870
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:27,120
 And in those days, I found it really hard to readjust.

871
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:30,780
 But I can't even begin to describe to you what it was like

872
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:34,140
 the moment that my wife and I showed up at Mother's Choice

873
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:37,680
 and we met Mia, our adopted daughter, for the first time.

874
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:43,080
 The greatest joy I have ever experienced

875
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,720
 in this little half Nepalese and half Indonesian,

876
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,480
 gorgeous little 60-month-old girl.

877
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:51,220
 And although I thought my family would be built biologically,

878
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:53,980
 God has built this family through other ways

879
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,220
 that are beautiful and profound.

880
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:01,220
 And my greatest joy, Mia, has come from my deepest pain.

881
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,820
 And it's a wonderful thing.

882
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:09,880
 Worship and weeping side by side.

883
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,940
 And I love the way that Ezra describes this for us

884
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:15,180
 in this moment, 'cause I think this is really important.

885
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:18,220
 Verse 13, "No one could distinguish the sounds

886
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:21,320
 "of the shouts of joy from the sound of weeping

887
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,240
 "because people made such a noise."

888
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,640
 Could you imagine the moment where you're before this rubble

889
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,080
 and everybody is either praising at the top of their voices

890
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:33,020
 or wailing and weeping at the top of their voices.

891
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:35,920
 And these things come together in such a way

892
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,480
 that they blend together and create this other kind of sound

893
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,940
 where you can't distinguish between the two.

894
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:46,180
 One of the ways I would describe it to you is this.

895
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:49,380
 Worship and weeping may be different notes,

896
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:52,280
 but they are found on the same scale.

897
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,540
 And when they play together,

898
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:58,980
 they produce this unexpected but profound harmony.

899
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:01,080
 That is the sound of restoration.

900
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,740
 And could you imagine a community

901
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,840
 where both weeping and worshiping can happen

902
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,140
 as much as it happens, so much that it all blends in together

903
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,040
 so that no one stands out?

904
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,040
 I mean, I don't know if you've ever been

905
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,920
 in one of those church services, maybe here at the Vine,

906
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,840
 where you're standing around

907
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,280
 and suddenly someone next to you

908
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,540
 starts wailing their eyes out.

909
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:22,540
 It's like, "Oh, that's awkward.

910
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,980
 "Oh, that's kind of weird.

911
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,440
 "Why is that person doing that?

912
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,380
 "I'm kind of uncomfortable right now."

913
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,340
 Or maybe you come into church here on a Sunday

914
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,920
 and you're feeling like, "Man, that was a tough week.

915
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,180
 "Things are going really bad."

916
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,040
 Maybe you've just had some bad news and you come in

917
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,140
 and the person you happen to sit next to you

918
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,540
 is the one who's the happiest

919
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,780
 and the loudest in their worship.

920
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:41,580
 And you're like, "Oh my gosh, Lord, I wanna run away."

921
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:45,880
 When it's just one or two people,

922
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,680
 it stands out and feels awkward for everybody.

923
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,080
 But imagine a community

924
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,940
 where everyone has permission to worship or weep,

925
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,040
 where everyone can come to church

926
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,880
 with whatever's going on in their lives

927
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,980
 and go, "This is a safe place for me to let it out.

928
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:03,240
 "This is a safe place for me to put my hand up

929
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,220
 "and say, 'I need prayer.'

930
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,280
 "This is a safe place to weep

931
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,120
 "because there's some godly sorrow

932
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,380
 "that I'm wrestling with my life.

933
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:12,440
 "This is a safe place to praise as loud as I want.

934
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,020
 "I can do it because everything is happening together."

935
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,580
 Whether in our gatherings like this, in our small groups,

936
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,740
 no matter how it might happen,

937
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:21,940
 there's such a cacophony of worship and weeping

938
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:26,220
 that a harmony is created and everybody can grow

939
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:29,640
 because they're welcomed, they're safe, they're loved,

940
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:33,520
 and they can be just who in that moment they are.

941
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,720
 That, my friends,

942
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:39,880
 that, my friends, is worth a golf clap.

943
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:43,520
 Nice par.

944
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,620
 That, my friends, is church.

945
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:47,920
 That's what I want the Lord to read.

946
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,180
 So I'm gonna close with this.

947
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:51,180
 I'm gonna close with three ways

948
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:54,140
 that I think we at The Vine can actually invest into this,

949
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:57,720
 that we can make a space here for restoration and renewal.

950
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,620
 Here it is.

951
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:01,320
 Number one, we should always treat people around us

952
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,120
 with dignity, respect, and value.

953
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,620
 Can I have an amen?

954
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,980
 Isn't it wonderful that people can come in here

955
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,580
 smelling really badly?

956
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:12,880
 Isn't it wonderful that people can come in here

957
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,720
 really down and depressed and heavy?

958
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,380
 Isn't it wonderful that people can come in here

959
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:21,080
 with a promotion that week, praising Jesus?

960
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,320
 Like it's amazing that we can respect people,

961
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:27,040
 that one who sings really loudly behind you out of tune,

962
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,040
 and you wanna turn around and go, "Who are you?"

963
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:33,040
 Isn't it wonderful that they can be here?

964
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,440
 Isn't it wonderful that the person next to you

965
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,400
 can wail and cry and you not feel awkward about it?

966
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,200
 Isn't it wonderful that you have a senior pastor

967
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,500
 who claps really loudly all the time

968
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,800
 and it really annoys you?

969
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,240
 Amen?

970
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:50,360
 Isn't it wonderful that we can be together

971
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,100
 and be ourselves and not have to pretend

972
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,740
 to be anything else?

973
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:58,640
 But that will only happen when we feel safe of one another.

974
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,940
 And that will only happen if we give respect

975
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:03,600
 and dignity and value that every person here

976
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,900
 made in the image of God should demand from you.

977
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:10,000
 Here's the second thing.

978
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,560
 While our worship should be orderly and respectful,

979
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,160
 Paul writes about that in 1 Corinthians 14,

980
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:18,400
 we should not expect or force people to believe uniformly.

981
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,840
 We should not expect people to put their hands up

982
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,700
 if they don't want to,

983
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,240
 open their hands if they don't want to,

984
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,400
 sing aloud if they don't want to.

985
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,700
 We should allow space for people to express who they are

986
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,860
 and how they wanna worship in this moment.

987
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:33,140
 Worship and weeping side by side.

988
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:36,140
 The worst thing we could do is try to conform people

989
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:36,960
 to a certain way.

990
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,500
 That doesn't mean we can't have good discipleship,

991
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,540
 we can't have metrics, we can't have culture,

992
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,540
 we have all those things,

993
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,200
 but our heart is to say,

994
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,140
 we're not trying to conform you to behave in a certain way,

995
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:49,100
 we're trying to you to feel like you can come in here

996
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,240
 and shake the heavens

997
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,100
 and whatever that might mean for you.

998
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,200
 Here's the third and final thing.

999
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,000
 Because the God we worship knows us better

1000
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,160
 than we know ourselves,

1001
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,560
 we should not pretend in God's presence.

1002
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,860
 And I think that's something that I think

1003
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:08,300
 I struggle with sometimes, and I'm sure you do too a bit.

1004
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,700
 I'm just gonna shove that under the carpet,

1005
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,240
 I'm just gonna pretend that that's not there,

1006
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,840
 I'm just gonna like, I don't wanna embarrass myself,

1007
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,200
 I don't wanna stand out,

1008
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,440
 so I'm just gonna put my hands up and sing,

1009
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,340
 but I'm feeling like I need to weep,

1010
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,560
 or I'm gonna praise, but the people around me

1011
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,000
 seem like they're having a really hard time,

1012
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,600
 so I better just calm down.

1013
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,660
 How beautiful it would be if we realized

1014
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,640
 that in God's presence,

1015
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,100
 because he knows us better than anyone,

1016
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,640
 we don't need to pretend.

1017
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,460
 In his presence is the only place in this world

1018
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:40,540
 where you are completely free to be who you are.

1019
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:41,660
 Everywhere else, in your workplace,

1020
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,000
 in your family and other places,

1021
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,440
 you will find pressure to try to conform to something.

1022
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,900
 You do not need to conform in God's presence

1023
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,640
 to anything other than Jesus Christ.

1024
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,460
 - Yeah.

1025
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:56,800
 - Imagine what that would feel like.

1026
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,100
 That would be a community of transformation

1027
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:04,740
 where people could come in here and heal and receive

1028
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:09,740
 and have promises and forgiveness and life and celebration,

1029
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:12,840
 and together, we would become the people

1030
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,500
 that God has called us to be.

1031
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:20,500
 Takenu Osaku, shake the heavens, Lord.

1032
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:24,700
 Would your power come down and change us, amen?

1033
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:28,200
 (congregation applauding)

1034
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:32,820
 You don't have to open your hands

1035
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:34,800
 'cause you are free to behave however you want,

1036
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,720
 but I wanna pray for us.

1037
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,560
 Can we pray?

1038
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:43,620
 Holy Spirit, here we are.

1039
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:48,500
 And I want you personally just to take a moment.

1040
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,020
 This is where you are.

1041
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:57,160
 In this moment, you don't need to be anyone else

1042
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,000
 other than you.

1043
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:05,400
 You come to the throne of God's grace just as you are.

1044
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:11,500
 Father, we just come against the enemy's strategy

1045
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,820
 for pretense.

1046
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:19,120
 And Father, we just come naked and unashamed before you.

1047
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,580
 (gentle music)

1048
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:26,760
 Father, for those in this room in this moment

1049
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,020
 who need to weep,

1050
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:33,880
 maybe a godly sorrow that sits on them,

1051
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:38,560
 that beautiful and profound work of renewal and repentance.

1052
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:44,380
 Or maybe it's just the grief of something lost

1053
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:45,780
 that needs to be mourned.

1054
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,640
 Father, would you just come now by your Spirit?

1055
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:59,360
 The Lord would say you have permission to hurt and heal,

1056
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:02,120
 to be who you are.

1057
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,600
 This is a safe place.

1058
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,880
 So Lord, for those in this moment

1059
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,600
 that want to just be in your presence,

1060
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:13,800
 just weep, take that time.

1061
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,120
 Would you just give them that space now?

1062
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:18,200
 Thank you, Jesus.

1063
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:22,280
 Now, maybe some of you here too,

1064
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:27,000
 where that joy and that praise is bubbling out of you.

1065
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,040
 And this is the time for you just to come before the Lord

1066
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,620
 in your heart and just praise Him, thank Him.

1067
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:34,640
 He is good, His love endures forever.

1068
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:39,000
 To make space for Him to move in us and through us that way.

1069
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,620
 Whether it is the need to weep or the need to worship.

1070
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:46,520
 I wanna invite you just to take a moment

1071
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,080
 and just come Holy Spirit, come.

1072
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:56,360
 Thank you Lord that you meet us where we're at.

1073
00:45:56,360 --> 00:46:00,420
 Thank you for your grace.

1074
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:03,000
 (gentle music)

1075
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:20,220
 So gonna invite the prayer team just to be present with us.

1076
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:26,460
 I wanna invite you just to sit in the presence of the Lord

1077
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:27,460
 if you would like to.

1078
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:30,140
 In a moment, we're just gonna close the service.

1079
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:32,760
 If you need to go, we totally respect and understand that,

1080
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,020
 but we just ask that you would go quietly

1081
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:38,180
 and just respect those that would wanna remain.

1082
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:39,620
 And whether that's just to praise Him

1083
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:43,060
 or to just come before Him with that grief,

1084
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:45,460
 we're gonna make space for that.

1085
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:47,020
 If you'd like to come forward for prayer,

1086
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:49,780
 we'll have a team that's available to pray for you.

1087
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:51,180
 If you wanna just sit where you are

1088
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:53,940
 and just let the worship kind of play over you

1089
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,780
 and just take your own time to pray.

1090
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:57,900
 If you wanna pray with the people around you

1091
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,300
 that you've come with, whatever it might be,

1092
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:03,100
 if you need to leave, you're blessed to leave.

1093
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:04,900
 But I wanna just pray in this moment now.

1094
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,700
 Father, as we just close this time, Lord,

1095
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:08,620
 for those that need to go,

1096
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:10,540
 we bless them into the week ahead.

1097
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:13,580
 For those that you want to stay, to just receive,

1098
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:16,420
 to be prayed for, just to sit in your presence,

1099
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:17,540
 we pray for that space.

1100
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:20,660
 Lord, we thank you that this is a community

1101
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:24,820
 of transformation, a safe place for all.

1102
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:26,660
 We thank you for this in Jesus' name.

1103
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:29,180
 So if you'd like to receive prayer,

1104
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,460
 feel free to come forward for prayer.

1105
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:34,060
 If you wanna stay, just stay, relax.

1106
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:35,500
 If you need to go, bless you.

1107
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:39,060
 (gentle music)

1108
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:41,660
 (gentle music)

1109
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:44,260
 (gentle music)

1110
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:46,820
 (phone beeps)

1111
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:50,340
 (phone beeps)

1112
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:53,940
 (phone beeps)

1113
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:57,540
 (phone beeps)

1114
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:00,120
 (gentle music)
