2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:10,960
 -March 26, 1, 362, 26.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,960
 When Jesus went with his disciples to a place

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,440
 called Bethany, and he said to them,

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,440
 sit here while I go over there and pray.

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,920
 He took Peter and the two sons of Stephen along with him.

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,400
 And he began to be sorrowful and troubled.

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,400
 Then he said to them, my soul is overwhelmed with sorrow

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,400
 to the point of death.

10
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,880
 Stay here and keep watch with me.

11
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,880
 Going a little farther, he fell with his face

12
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,360
 to the ground and prayed.

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,360
 My Father, be as good as possible,

14
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,860
 bring this cup to me to confirm me, yet not as I will,

15
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,360
 but as you will.

16
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,360
 Then he returned to his disciples

17
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,360
 and found their speech.

18
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,360
 Could you men keep watch with me while I travel?

19
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,360
 He asked Peter.

20
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,860
 Most men pray, so that you will not fall into temptation.

21
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,860
 But the courage in you, my friend,

22
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,360
 shall suffice to keep.

23
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,860
 He went from where he was to my bedtower.

24
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:22,360
 My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken

25
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:27,360
 away from this my children, then your will be done.

26
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,360
 But if you do not, we are going to call them to the kitchen,

27
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,360
 because they are our servants.

28
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,360
 So he left them and went away to my school

29
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,360
 and enjoyed his own time, sleeping with him today.

30
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,360
 Then he returned to his disciples and said,

31
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,860
 are you still from the kingdom of heaven?

32
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,360
 Well, as all of us do, there are some who say

33
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,860
 that they were born into a high and strong kingdom.

34
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,360
 But let us go.

35
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,860
 In his arms, my Lord, he said,

36
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,860
 For he is God, who brings death to those who die.

37
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,360
 He does not have to pass away, my friend.

38
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,360
 If you know the God who gives you death,

39
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,360
 it is not the God who gives you death.

40
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,860
 You can worship him.

41
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,860
 He has no death.

42
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,360
 I also know he is a God who is here.

43
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,860
 I will stop doing what he does.

44
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,860
 I will not deny him any words.

45
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,360
 He did all this for me, and he did not.

46
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,360
 I think this must be a promise to the kingdom of heaven.

47
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,360
 I have also learned more than you,

48
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,360
 that you are like a slave for me,

49
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,360
 and you are the slave for those who exclude me

50
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,360
 and take me, and I shall have nothing left.

51
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,860
 You are all taught by the Father, I would say,

52
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,860
 that the Father gave you a hero,

53
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,860
 and he gave you a man to defend.

54
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,860
 You get those people around you,

55
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,360
 and you are all in the same side,

56
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,360
 but you are still on the way to the end.

57
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,860
 But what has happened in the communities

58
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,860
 is that you have always been acclimated to the Father's right

59
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,360
 as a judge, as a leader.

60
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,860
 He came to Spain,

61
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,360
 and I have always known him well as a father

62
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,860
 to you, James Brown, my friend.

63
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,860
 He said, "Across the first 10 feet,

64
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,860
 "I will have my son.

65
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,860
 "He will walk to all the crosses,

66
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,860
 "I will take him to the cross,

67
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,860
 "and I will lift him up."

68
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,860
 Well, so this is the first time in a week

69
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:22,860
 that I have heard of the same thing Trump has said.

70
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,860
 And it is by no such profit.

71
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,860
 Neither is it the end of the game.

72
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,860
 It is a trial that will bring us through

73
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,860
 to the place we have to go in the future.

74
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,360
 But for now, this is the worst I have ever seen so far.

75
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,860
 It is a secret, but it is not a thing

76
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,860
 you can contest it.

77
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,860
 I have never seen it.

78
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,860
 And I have spent about eight weeks learning.

79
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,860
 I have read about it from all over the United States.

80
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,860
 This is not a law.

81
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,860
 It is not a law.

82
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,860
 It is a myth.

83
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,860
 But every time I think about it,

84
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,860
 I find that the law is not a thing

85
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,860
 you can contest it.

86
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,860
 It is a fact that the United States

87
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,860
 has a very strong judicial system.

88
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,860
 It is not a person-to-person.

89
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,860
 So what should we do?

90
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,860
 What should we do?

91
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,860
 I was a former district judge of the blacks.

92
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,860
 The court knew that it was a thing.

93
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,860
 So what should we do?

94
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,860
 I see you in the Senate.

95
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,860
 I read your article.

96
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,860
 I see you in the Supreme Court.

97
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,860
 I don't think it is a thing that is being contested.

98
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,860
 It is a thing.

99
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,860
 And all the great experts

100
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,860
 use it as a point to disguise the truth.

101
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,860
 We are not a better party

102
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,860
 than the other system that we believe

103
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,860
 to be allowed to interfere in the law.

104
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,860
 I love the remarks that you make about the case of this.

105
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,860
 Now I think about the facts that you have to turn

106
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,860
 the law for the great history of the Native American group.

107
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,860
 The law was passed off as one of the four designations.

108
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,860
 And it is a thing.

109
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,860
 It is a thing.

110
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,860
 In fact, many of our presidents and senators

111
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:05,860
 used to be sniffing and trying to win the government over.

112
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,860
 If you point to the Supreme Court,

113
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,860
 it is not a thing.

114
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,860
 It is a law.

115
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,860
 We did not ask you to do that.

116
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,860
 And I know that is the privilege of the party

117
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,860
 that you can change the development of the country

118
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,860
 to do what you are allowed to do.

119
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,860
 I think it is not the greatest responsibility of the party.

120
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,860
 I see you in the Supreme Court.

121
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,860
 I see you in the Supreme Court.

122
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,860
 It is the part of the Supreme Court that we can trust.

123
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,860
 It is the part of the Supreme Court that we can trust.

124
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,860
 And I think that is the privilege of the party.

125
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,860
 I think that is the privilege of the party.

126
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,860
 I think that is the privilege of the party.

127
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,860
 I think that is the privilege of the party.

128
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,860
 I think that is the privilege of the party.

129
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,860
 I think that is the privilege of the party.

130
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,860
 I think that is the privilege of the party.

131
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,860
 I think that is the privilege of the party.

132
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,860
 I think that is the privilege of the party.

133
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,860
 I think that is the privilege of the party.

 I think that is the privilege of the party.

00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,860
 I think that is the privilege of the party.

136
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,860
 I think that is the privilege of the party.

137
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,860
 I think that is the privilege of the party.

138
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,860
 I think that is the privilege of the party.

139
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,860
 I think that is the privilege of the party.

140
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,860
 I think that is the privilege of the party.

00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,860
 I think that is the privilege of the party.

142
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,860
 I think that is the privilege of the party.

143
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,860
 I think that is the privilege of the party.

144
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,860
 I think that is the privilege of the party.

145
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,860
 I think that is the privilege of the party.

 I think that is the privilege of the party.

 I think that is the privilege of the party.

00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,860
 I think that is the privilege of the party.

00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,860
 I think that is the privilege of the party.
