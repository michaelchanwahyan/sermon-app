[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920]   and we pray in Jesus name amen thank you Susanna.
[00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:10.400]   Good afternoon how's everybody going?
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:18.880]   Great nice they've been here through three services so that's encouraging Alison.
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:26.560]   I get the privilege of finishing off this series of encounters with God
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:38.720]   and before we start I just want to share with you that if you came expecting a normal just service
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:45.520]   then you're going to be disappointed because God responds to the desperate. He responds to the
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.440]   longing of our hearts and so if you're sitting here today and you've come longing for something
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.560]   or desperate for something or just in a place of despair then God will meet you in that place.
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:06.640]   He promises to. Some weeks ago during worship Emma said that the one thing that all of the
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.480]   encounters we've been looking at during this series had in common was desperation.
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.960]   Desperation what is it and how does it connect with encounters with God?
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.720]   Today we're going to look at the story of Hannah so strap yourself in because we're
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.680]   going to be reading some passages of scripture. We're going to start with 1 Samuel 1 1 to 10.
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:37.840]   Now there was a certain man of Ramatham, Zohem of the mountains of Ephraim and his name was Elkanah
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:46.560]   the son of Jerahim the son of Elu, Eluhu the son of Tohu the son of Zuv and Ephraimite and he had
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.520]   two wives the name of one was Hannah and the name of the other was Peninnah. Peninnah had children
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:01.680]   but Hannah had no children. This man went up from his city yearly to worship and sacrifice to the
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:09.520]   Lord of hosts in Shiloh. Also the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas the priests of the Lord were
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.680]   there and whenever the time came for Elkanah to make an offering he would give portions to Peninnah
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.760]   his wife and to all his sons and daughters but to Hannah he would give a double portion
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:31.120]   for he loved Hannah although the Lord had closed her womb and her rival also provoked her severely
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:38.720]   to make her miserable because the Lord had closed her womb. So it was year by year when she went up
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:46.560]   to the house of the Lord that she provoked her therefore she wept and did not eat. Then Elkanah
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:53.440]   her husband said to her, "Hannah why do you weep? Why do you not eat and why is your heart grieved?
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:00.640]   Am I not better to you than ten sons?" So Hannah arose after they finished eating and drinking in
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.320]   Shiloh. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat by the doorpost of the tabernacle of the Lord
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:13.440]   and she was in bitterness of soul and prayed to the Lord and wept in anguish.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:20.880]   The writer makes sure that the very first thing that we learn about Hannah is that she has no
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:30.640]   children. Elkanah has two wives Peninnah and Hannah. Peninnah we are told has had children
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:39.440]   but Hannah has none. Now why is this significant? In Hannah's day it was considered so shameful to
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:47.680]   be barren that your husband could divorce you. A barren woman could be treated harshly by the
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:55.120]   community she lived in because children were seen as a blessing and if you couldn't have children
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:04.480]   you're perceived as the opposite of being blessed. 1 Samuel 1 8 and verse 10 captures the essence of
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:13.680]   desperation. Hannah why do you weep? Why do you not eat? Why is your heart grieved? And it goes
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:21.040]   on to say in verse 10, "Hannah was in bitterness of soul and prayed to the Lord and wept in anguish."
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:32.800]   Desperation is a state of extreme distress, extreme anxiety or despair caused by a feeling
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:41.360]   of complete helplessness or absence of hope. Hannah was desperate, she was in despair. Her
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:48.080]   husband's other wife Peninnah severely and deliberately provokes her to make her miserable.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:55.440]   The Bible tells us that she has endured this for years. Hannah is suffering from
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:03.280]   "merat nefesh" which means a bitter soul and "ani" which means affliction. Let's take a
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:10.400]   moment to examine the reason why Hannah is experiencing affliction. The Bible says the Lord
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:20.160]   had closed her womb. She is childless because of the Lord. She is suffering because the Lord
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:26.800]   is allowing it. In the Bible all forms of fertility are presented as gifts from God,
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:34.720]   so why was God keeping Hannah childless and allowing her to endure ridicule from the society
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:42.320]   she lived in? Now it's important to understand that God doesn't use infertility as a punishment,
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:51.120]   but in Hannah's case he was withholding children from her. Before we explore this further we need
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:56.800]   to understand that Hannah's not the only one in the Bible who suffers affliction or suffers
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.400]   from a bitter soul. Naomi, after the death of her sons and her husband,
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:09.440]   renames herself Mara which means bitter. Job speaks in the bitterness of his spirit after
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:15.840]   enduring the loss of his family and all that he owned. And yet all these desperate people have
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:24.240]   one thing in common. Their desperation drives them to encounter God and to discover that God
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:31.680]   can work through their afflictions to bring them to a place of greater surrender and fruitfulness.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:38.240]   Hannah's desperation drove her to encounter God. It could have driven her away,
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:47.040]   but instead she pushes in closer. She cries out, "Remember me." She chooses to trust and she pours
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:55.840]   out her soul to God. Let's hear her words. 1 Samuel 1 verses 11 to 18. Then Hannah made a vow
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.880]   and said, "Oh Lord of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your maidservant and
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:07.920]   remember me and not forget your maidservant and will give your maidservant a male child,
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:14.560]   then I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life and no razors shall come upon his head."
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:20.080]   And it happened as she continued praying before the Lord that Eli watched her mouth.
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:28.480]   Now Hannah spoke in her heart, only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore,
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:34.800]   Eli thought she was drunk. So Eli said to her, "How long will you be drunk? Put your wine away
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:41.120]   from you." But Hannah answered and said, "No, my Lord, I am a woman of sorrowful spirit. I've drunk
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:47.360]   neither wine nor intoxicating drink, but have poured out my soul before the Lord. Do not consider
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:53.600]   your maidservant a wicked woman for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief I have spoken
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:08:00.800]   until now." Then Eli answered and said, "Go in peace and the God of Israel grant your petition
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:06.640]   which you have asked of him." And she said, "Let your maidservant find favor in your sight."
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:12.800]   So the woman went her way and ate and her face was no longer sad."
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:20.480]   Just want to pause for a minute and take a moment to learn something from this passage.
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:28.000]   You know, when people are desperate and grieving and in despair, they are not themselves.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:35.120]   And it can be easy to misunderstand them. And it can be easy to judge them.
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:43.760]   But we see in this passage that Eli comes to a place at the end where instead of judging her
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:51.840]   like he did at first, he changes into a place where he becomes a source of blessing to Hannah.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:58.720]   And he speaks peace over her. And when she leaves, her face is no longer sad.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:05.840]   In our life as we walk, at times we will be desperate and at times though we will be
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:14.800]   surrounded by people who are desperate. May we learn from this to be slow to judge, not to judge
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:20.640]   at all, but rather to be people who respond in compassion and be a source of blessing to them.
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:27.440]   Hannah's desperation and barrenness prompted her to make commitments and vows that she would never
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:35.440]   have made otherwise. Maybe we need to understand just how desperate our condition is, how fragile
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:43.280]   our lives can be. Because unless we do, we are never going to see our equally desperate need for God.
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:50.560]   Desperation is characterized by a sense of urgency or a need for immediate relief.
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:59.600]   Desperation has a purpose. Desperation is meant to drive us into the arms of God.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:07.520]   At the end of 2007, my husband Glenn and my four children, we packed up our lives in Darwin
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:13.920]   and we returned to Queensland in Australia to say our final goodbyes to family and friends.
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:20.720]   We were moving to Hong Kong to continue our work with a Christian NGO in China.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:28.480]   We were moving in response to God's leading. And everything had been miraculous up to this point.
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:35.600]   We had been gifted money out of the blue that had covered all of our expenses and all of our plane
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:44.000]   tickets. We arrived in Queensland and our planned month stay before we left for Hong Kong turned
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:53.200]   into another month. And then another month. Something had caused a hold up with our visas
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:11:02.160]   and no one could give us a clear answer to what was going on. We had four kids aged between three
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:11.520]   and eleven and we were living like nomads, moving between friends and family, sleeping on mattresses
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:19.600]   on the floor out on farms. Me trying to teach our kids, because obviously they, we thought they'd
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:24.080]   only be out of school for a short time, but suddenly it was way longer than what we intended.
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:31.280]   And that one planned month turned into eight long months of waiting.
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:38.800]   I distinctly remember when we reached the eight month mark and it didn't seem to be an end in
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:45.840]   sight. We were at my parents' house and I went into the toilet and I just sat in there. Now,
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:51.520]   those of you with kids will know that that's sometimes the only place you can get some privacy
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:58.800]   and maybe not even then. And I remember feeling so desperate and I remember crying out to God in
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:06.880]   anguish. I reminded him that it was him that had brought us this far. It was in response to his
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:14.880]   leading that we were in this place, this land of in-between. Do you know that land where you're
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:20.640]   not where you once were and you're not yet where you're going and you're in this, stuck in this
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:29.440]   middle place, this land of in-between. I told God I didn't understand why were we having to wait,
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:36.560]   why were we suffering? I couldn't take it anymore. I found myself surrendering afresh,
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:45.120]   my family, my agenda, my future. I told God you have to come through.
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:52.400]   It was that same week that we heard that our visa applications had been approved.
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:13:01.120]   When we arrived in Hong Kong, I saw our kids who had endured such change in those eight months,
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:11.680]   quickly adapt. They quickly adapted to Hong Kong, it felt so easy. I can still remember that first
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:17.680]   night in Hong Kong. Up to that point, one of my children had been waking every single night and
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:23.360]   she was five years old. And I remember that first night in Hong Kong, she slept through.
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:29.680]   And I was like, "What? We're in Australia, you know, we're in a new country, we're in a new house,
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:37.360]   she's in a new bed." And she slept through. It felt like perfect timing in a hundred different ways.
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:46.640]   You see, desperation has a season and a purpose. Desperation is meant to lead us to an encounter
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:54.640]   with God, a place where we discover hope, a place where we discover peace, a place where we discover
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:14:02.960]   we can depend on God, a place where we can experience greater fruitfulness. Hannah's
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:11.040]   desperation drives her to God. She prays to the Lord, she weeps bitterly, she makes a vow saying,
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:17.680]   "Lord Almighty, if you only look on your servant's misery and remember me and not forget me,
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:26.160]   but give me a son, I will give him to you all the days of his life." Hannah's desperation drove her
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:36.000]   to God. Where does your desperation drive you? Is your desperation causing you to try to figure out
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:43.200]   your life on your own? Is it driving you to places that you were never meant to go?
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:53.840]   Or is your desperation causing you to rely on things you were never meant to place your trust in?
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:15:04.160]   You see, there are people in the Bible like Jonah, whose desperation drove them to dark places.
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:13.280]   His desperation drove him into the darkness of the belly of a big fish. Has your desperation driven
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:22.640]   you into some dark places? When we choose to let our desperation drive us to God, we encounter him.
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:33.600]   Why? Because he hears the cries of the desperate and he responds. He promises. He says, "If you draw
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:44.560]   near to me, I will draw near to you." God doesn't break his promises. Psalm 107 reminds us that no
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:51.040]   matter the cause of our desperation, when we cry out to the Lord, he hears us and he delivers us
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:16:00.160]   from our distress. Psalm 147 verse 3 says, "He heals the brokenhearted and he binds up our wounds."
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:08.960]   Hannah cries out to God. Her desperation causes her to encounter God and experience his faithfulness.
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:16.960]   She regains her hope and her life becomes far more fruitful than she could have ever dreamed.
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:25.120]   Let's pick up the story from 1 Samuel 1 verses 19 to 28. "Then they rose early in the morning
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:31.200]   and worshipped before the Lord and returned and came to their house at Ramah. And Elkanah knew
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:37.760]   Hannah his wife and the Lord remembered her. So it came to pass in the process of time that Hannah
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:45.120]   conceived and bore a son and called his name Samuel saying, 'Because I have asked for him from the Lord.'
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:52.160]   Now the man Elkanah and all his house went up to offer to the Lord the yearly sacrifice and his
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:58.640]   vow. But Hannah did not go up for she said to her husband, 'Not until the child is weaned, then I
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:05.120]   will take him that he may appear for the Lord and remain there forever.' So Elkanah her husband said
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:10.240]   to her, 'Do what seems best to you. Wait until you've weaned him. Only let the Lord establish
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:17.200]   his word.' Then the woman stayed and nursed her son until she had weaned him. Now when she had
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:23.280]   weaned him she took him up with her with three bulls, one ephah of flour and a skin of wine
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:30.800]   and brought him to the place of the Lord in Shiloh and the child was young. Then they slaughtered a
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:37.520]   bull and brought the child to Eli and she said, 'Oh my Lord as your soul lives my Lord, I am the woman
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:43.520]   who stood by you here praying to the Lord. For this child I prayed and the Lord has granted me
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:51.680]   my petition which I asked of him. Therefore I also have lent him to the Lord. As long as he lives he
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:18:00.480]   shall be lent to the Lord.' So they worshipped the Lord there. Hannah receives a son. She names him
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:09.280]   Samuel, meaning God has heard and God redeems all her affliction and redeems all her suffering by
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:18.560]   unveiling his wondrous plan. You see Samuel goes on to serve as a priest and becomes the first prophet
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:29.520]   and the last judge of Israel. Samuel's life was pivotal in Israel's history. If Hannah had not
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:37.680]   walked the journey she did, would she have been willing to surrender the one thing she wanted
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:43.760]   more than anything in the world, a child? I don't think so.
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:52.720]   Some of you here today are wrestling with God because he is challenging you to surrender.
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:19:01.280]   Challenging you to surrender something in your life that is very precious to you. It might be
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:10.640]   your freedom. It might be a dream for a spouse or a dream for a child. He might be challenging you
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:18.560]   about an unhealthy relationship that he wants you to let go of. It might be a job that has become
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:26.640]   everything to you, all-consuming. And right now you're sitting here and you know what it's like
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:36.080]   to feel afflicted, to feel like you have no peace. Let your desperation drive you to God.
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:42.160]   Drive you to surrender all those things into his hands.
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:51.600]   Like Hannah, God's plans for you are better and far surpass your own.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:59.440]   Continue or choose to trust like Hannah did that his plans for you are to prosper you,
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:08.560]   to give you a future and a hope. Hannah surrenders Samuel because she understands the source of all
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:17.440]   good things is God. There's a lesson here. We should not hold on tightly to the things God gives us.
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:27.840]   Be willing to have open hands and a surrendered heart. Hannah in her surrender discovers
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:37.200]   that when we surrender, God pours so much more into our lives. Listen to her prayer after she
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:45.440]   surrenders Samuel to the temple. "My heart rejoices in the Lord. In the Lord my horn is lifted high.
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:52.240]   My mouth boasts over my enemies, for I delight in your deliverance. There is no one wholly like
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:21:01.120]   the Lord. There is no one besides you. There is no rock like our God. Do not keep talking so proudly
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:08.960]   or let your mouth speak such arrogance, for the Lord is a God who knows, and by him deeds are weighed.
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:17.120]   The bows of the warriors are broken, but those who stumbled are armed with strength. Those who
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:23.680]   were full hire themselves out for food, but those who were hungry are hungry no more.
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:31.280]   She who was barren has born seven children, but she who has had many sons pines away. The Lord
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:37.600]   brings death and makes alive. He brings down to the grave and raises up. The Lord sends poverty
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:45.280]   and wealth. He humbles and he exalts. He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:52.800]   the ash heap. He seats them with princes and has them inherit a throne of honor. For the foundations
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:22:00.480]   of the earth are the Lord's, and on them he has set the world. He will guard the feet of his faithful
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:07.680]   servants, but the wicked will be silenced in the place of darkness. It is not by strength that one
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:13.840]   prevails. Those who oppose the Lord will be broken. The most high will thunder from heaven. The Lord
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:20.160]   will judge the ends of the earth. He will give strength to his king and exalt the horn of his
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:28.720]   anointed. Hannah worships God because she gets a glimpse of his sovereignty and how everything in
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:37.200]   our lives can be worked together for good when we are willing to live a surrendered life. Hannah
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:46.720]   goes on to be blessed with five more children. God never intended her to stay barren, and he never
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:55.680]   intended her to stay desperate, and neither does he desire that for you. If you are feeling barren,
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:23:05.600]   if you are feeling empty or closed up or shut up or lifeless or hopeless, helpless, unfruitful,
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:12.480]   desperate, in despair, if you've been praying and longing for something for so long and feel as
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:23.200]   though God's forgotten you, know that all of this has a season and a purpose. You were never meant
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:31.840]   to stay in this place of desperation. Let it lead you to an encounter with God. Like Hannah, pour
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:38.880]   out your soul and cry out, "Remember me." Would you stand with me today?
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:47.920]   Would you close your eyes?
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:03.360]   Hannah's desperation was not of her own making. God had woven it into her story
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:12.400]   to bring her to a place of surrender, to draw her into his greater story and purpose.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:20.880]   Some of you here today are like Hannah. You are experiencing desperation, but it is not of your
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:28.240]   own making. God has woven it into your story to bring you to a place of surrender.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:33.760]   But some of you here today, you are experiencing desperation,
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:39.120]   deep dissatisfaction, and it is of your own making.
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:45.760]   Your choices have led you into some dark places, some empty places,
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:54.480]   places that lure you with the promise of so much but leave you hollow and ashamed.
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:25:00.880]   Let your desperation drive you into the arms of God.
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:07.120]   And some today, you are not desperate enough.
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:13.840]   You're complacent. You're letting life just wash over you.
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:22.480]   The words directionless, meaningless, these are words you know well.
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:35.600]   Ephesians 5, 14 says, "Awake, you who sleep. Arise from the dead, and Christ will give you light."
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:47.360]   Encounter God today. Surrender and receive his light. Receive his presence.
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:55.920]   We're going to create some space, and the worship team is going to lead us.
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:59.920]   We're going to create some space to encounter God, and I want to leave this picture with you.
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:07.520]   I was reminded this morning on the bus on the way in of a story found in Ezekiel.
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:17.360]   In Ezekiel, he sees water coming out from the doors, under the doors of the temple.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:23.840]   These rivers of water are the presence of God.
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:37.040]   And a man calls Ezekiel to walk into the water, and at first he walks up to his ankles.
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:42.320]   And then the man measures some more and calls him deeper, and he walks up to his knees.
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:47.520]   And then the man calls him deeper, and he's up to his waist.
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:59.760]   And then he sees to go deeper will mean that his feet will no longer be on the ground.
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:08.720]   He'll be completely at the mercy of God's presence, having surrendered all control.
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:17.600]   And my challenge to you today is to locate where you are.
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:23.680]   Are you on the bank, far from the presence of God?
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.960]   Or are you up to your ankles?
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:35.040]   We were never meant to stay in the shallows,
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:38.960]   and we were never meant to stay on the bank far from God.
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:48.960]   He calls us to come close, to walk bravely and deeply into his presence,
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:54.960]   to surrender all the things we rely on, the things that we think keep us safe,
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:28:00.320]   the things that we think satisfy us, to let them all go,
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:07.760]   and to become be completely immersed and surrounded by his presence.
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:15.200]   So as we worship today, I encourage you, just open your hands,
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:19.200]   be like Hannah, say, "God, remember me."
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:25.520]   Choose to walk into an encounter with God today.
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:36.640]   He promises that he will meet you there if you come of your own free choice and cry out to him.
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:44.960]   [Music]
