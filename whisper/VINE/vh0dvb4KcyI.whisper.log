[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320]   So good to be with you this morning.
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.920]   My name's Andrew, I'm one of the pastors here at The Vine.
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.120]   And if you're new to The Vine, welcome,
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.960]   we're so glad you're here.
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.480]   Maybe you're new to the city,
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.920]   getting settled into Hong Kong.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.560]   And if that's the case and you're looking for a church,
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.960]   there's a lot of great churches in our city,
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.160]   we encourage you to have a look around
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.700]   and experience some of the different churches in the city.
[00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.840]   But if this becomes your home, we're glad that it will be.
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.800]   And we're here to serve and to help you to feel at home
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.240]   as quickly as possible.
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.880]   Maybe you're visiting the city,
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.480]   maybe you're here for the summer.
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.080]   I'm not sure why you came in the summer,
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.720]   but you're here for the summer, praise the Lord.
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.460]   You like humidity, glad you're here.
[00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.080]   Maybe you're visiting friends and family,
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.800]   we're glad that you are a part of this as well.
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.600]   So welcome to The Vine.
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.080]   I'm really excited this morning
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.640]   because I've got a word in my spirit for us.
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.320]   This is a one-off word.
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.080]   Here at The Vine, we predominantly preach in series,
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.560]   whether that's a four-week series, an eight-week series,
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.600]   a 10-week series, but we normally have a book
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.680]   of the Bible we go through or a theme of the scripture
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.160]   that we wanna explore.
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.400]   But every once in a while between the series,
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.160]   we have these moments where we can have a one-off
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.360]   where I'm able to bring a word to you as a community
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.880]   that I've been sensing.
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.720]   And you have to pray for me to get through this one
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.560]   without crying.
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.440]   I'm feeling a little bit emotional
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.200]   as I come into the pulpit here this morning with you.
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.920]   Because this word is one that I feel like the Holy Spirit
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.120]   just has been working in my own life over many years.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.080]   One that I desperately need to hear this morning.
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.640]   I feel like I'm gonna be preaching to myself.
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.920]   So I get a bit animated.
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.320]   It's because I need to really do some work in myself.
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.760]   Yeah, it's a word for us as a community.
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.280]   And I pray that it will be a word that will shape
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.600]   something fresh in you here this morning.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.680]   And we wanna lean into ministry here at The Vine.
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.280]   And so after the word, we're gonna have a time
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.440]   for ministry together.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.440]   I wanna preach to you from a passage from Matthew.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.680]   Matthew chapter 11, one of Jesus' most beautiful promises.
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.040]   And I wanna read this to you from Matthew 11,
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.960]   verses 28 to 30.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.560]   Jesus says this.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.560]   He says, "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened,
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.120]   and I will give you rest."
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.040]   It's not one of the most profoundly beautiful promises
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.920]   in scripture.
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.960]   He says, "Take my yoke upon you and learn from me,
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.080]   for I'm gentle and humble in heart,
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.160]   and you will find rest for your souls.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.880]   For my yoke is easy and my burden is light."
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.000]   Fathers, we open up your scripture here this morning.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.200]   I wanna pray that you would open us to you.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.920]   Father, each one of us comes before you now
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.400]   with whatever weariness or burden we are feeling.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.720]   And I know that for all of us.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.920]   I know that for me.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.040]   Lord, I know that for me.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.320]   I am this way before you.
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.960]   Lord, we thank you for your promises in scripture
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.320]   that you meet us where we're at.
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.000]   And Father, this incredible promise
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.840]   that you will bring rest.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.600]   Lord, we ask that you would speak to us from your word.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.200]   We thank you for this in Jesus' name.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.640]   Everyone says.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.360]   This is one of the most famous passages
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.960]   that Jesus has in scripture.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.360]   It's one that you've probably heard many times,
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.560]   perhaps one that you've seen around the place.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.920]   This is one that's been reproduced
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.680]   in lots of cheesy Christian ways as much as possible.
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.960]   Fridge magnets, bumper stickers, t-shirts,
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.080]   coffee mugs, you name it.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.520]   You've probably seen this on Instagram
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.720]   in your feed at some point.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.640]   In fact, I myself posted this to my feed during this week.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.880]   We see this around a lot.
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.280]   It's a famous promise and passage of scripture from Jesus.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.080]   And it's famous for a very important reason.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.040]   It's famous for a very critical reason
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.760]   because Jesus here is speaking of a need
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.560]   that sits within every single human person.
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.760]   A need that is deep within us,
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.040]   a need that cries out for being met.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.920]   It's a need that I think is even more prevalent now
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.960]   in the modern world than even perhaps that it was
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.000]   in the time when Jesus spoke it in the first century.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.600]   And it's the need for rest.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.000]   Oh man, rest.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.760]   This need to find a place where we can go to deal
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.320]   with the fact that we are overwhelmed and stressed
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.800]   and exhausted almost all the time.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.860]   I mean, I don't know about you,
[00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.920]   but this is a word, isn't it, for us?
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.280]   It's a word for any of us who knows what it is
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.440]   to feel stressed or burnt out or exhausted or overworked
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.480]   or that feeling inside of us to need to strive,
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.400]   to prove ourselves to others, to make other people love us,
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.240]   to show that we're successful or strong
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.960]   or whatever it might be.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.260]   It's a word, isn't it, in season for any of us
[00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.880]   that have ever felt that way
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.240]   and probably for the majority of us in this room
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.320]   who feel that way right now.
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.180]   I think actually what Jesus probably should have done
[00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.400]   when he said this is just preface it with,
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.240]   and now a word for the people of Hong Kong.
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.700]   Come on, church.
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.800]   Like a now a word for people of this crazy city
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.040]   of the future where everybody's gonna be going
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.880]   and going and going.
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.280]   Everybody's gonna be trying to earn and create and produce,
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.240]   and they're gonna be overworked, overstimulated,
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.280]   overstressed, but the people of Hong Kong, come to me.
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.840]   All you who are weary and burdened,
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.080]   and I will give you rest.
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.320]   And we hear this word,
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.080]   and something inside of us cries out, doesn't it,
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.280]   and says, that's a word for me.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.440]   Oh, yes and amen.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.040]   Lord, give me more.
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.360]   The problem is, the problem is,
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.440]   is that what we think Jesus is speaking about here
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.720]   isn't actually what Jesus is speaking about.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.160]   In fact, another way of saying it is,
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.340]   what we want Jesus to be speaking about here
[00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.160]   is not actually what Jesus is speaking about.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.660]   What we hope Jesus is speaking about
[00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.200]   is not actually what he's speaking about.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.580]   Because if you read this from a modern context,
[00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.280]   like we all so naturally do,
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.160]   open up Matthew 11, read this passage from the lens
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.560]   and the thought of our modern world.
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.560]   When we hear Jesus say, come to me,
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.880]   all you who are weary and burdened,
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.200]   and I will give you rest.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.320]   Here's what we hear.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.480]   We hear permanent vacation.
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.680]   We hear this excitement in our hearts
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.260]   'cause we hear, great, Jesus is inviting us
[00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.180]   to drinks on a beach in Bali.
[00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.740]   Like, that's what I need.
[00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.120]   'Cause Jesus knows that I'm overworked,
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.080]   overstimulated, overproducing.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.040]   He knows that I'm striving so hard to do all these things.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.840]   He knows that the one thing I need
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.760]   is just to get rid of it all,
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.320]   get it all out of my life,
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.240]   get myself to the point where I have no responsibilities,
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.640]   no work, no stress, no burden,
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.440]   and I can be come by ironing with Jesus forever.
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.400]   So we read this and he says rest,
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.960]   and we're thinking the cessation of everything,
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.820]   particularly the cessation of work,
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:58.160]   because work is what is exhausting me.
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.980]   Relationships are exhausting me.
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.800]   Trying to prove myself is exhausting me.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.160]   I mean, if I can just get rid of all of that stuff,
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.600]   if I can cease my work
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.440]   and just take a permanent vacation with Jesus,
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.340]   let's get rid of Martha and let's be merry forever.
[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:18.320]   Like, that's how we read this passage.
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.960]   And we get excited 'cause we think
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.960]   Jesus is inviting us to a holiday,
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:26.420]   but Jesus is doing everything but inviting you to a holiday.
[00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:32.200]   In fact, what Jesus is inviting us to
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:36.120]   is something so much grander, so much more beautiful,
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.920]   so much more profound,
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.240]   so much more life transforming
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.440]   than just a simple break from it all.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.160]   And in fact, when you catch a glimpse,
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.180]   just a little glimpse of what it is
[00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.880]   that Jesus is inviting us to in this scripture,
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.840]   here's the reaction we find.
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:56.720]   We find ourselves no longer needing to escape the world,
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:00.520]   but desperately wanting to lean into the world.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.880]   Come on, church.
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.200]   When we really understand what Jesus is asking here
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.300]   and offering here,
[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.880]   we find ourselves being liberated, in fact,
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.520]   from the desire to wanna kind of get rid of the world
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.840]   and set the world aside and cease everything.
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.440]   And we actually find ourselves going, how do I do more?
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.480]   How do I lean in?
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:17.520]   How do I serve?
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.400]   How do I partner with God for the kingdom in this world?
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.280]   And we find ourselves going from a, I need a vacation
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.620]   to saying, Lord, give me life.
[00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:28.440]   Oh, I'm glad I'm the only one here
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.080]   who's excited this morning.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.400]   Come on, church.
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.920]   'Cause you're not excited, and I get it,
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.160]   because we're tired.
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.460]   We're exhausted.
[00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:41.800]   And the idea of a break from it all
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:44.120]   sounds like what we need.
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:48.280]   And Jesus says, I'm not giving you rest from your work.
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.480]   I'm giving you rest for your soul.
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:56.680]   Oh, for the thing that really needs it.
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:00.520]   You gotta understand that when Jesus says these words,
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.400]   he's not actually speaking to the church in Hong Kong.
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.960]   He's not actually speaking to some future city
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.440]   that's gonna be stressed out and burnt out.
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.840]   He's speaking to a bunch of farmers in Galilee.
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.240]   He's speaking to a bunch of people
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.720]   who were just average, normal people.
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:14.920]   He's speaking to a bunch of people
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.600]   who are living in a time of empire,
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.680]   people who are under the oppression
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.640]   of a much larger, bigger power and force.
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.400]   He's speaking to Jewish people,
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.720]   to Jewish people who understood the Old Testament scriptures
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.400]   and the narrative of God, who, when they heard Jesus say rest,
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.480]   they're not thinking beach, barley, and a pina colada.
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.560]   They're thinking this could be the Messiah.
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.480]   They're thinking to themselves,
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.080]   we understand what the Bible has always been saying
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:47.000]   about this idea of one day God stepping back into the world
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.960]   and bringing life again to a weary and broken world.
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.760]   And here's one who's saying, come to me,
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.720]   and I will give you that kind of release,
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.160]   that kind of rest that isn't just gonna be sold
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.480]   by some physical ceasing of activity,
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.240]   but the sort of rest that is gonna magically
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.840]   transform your life forever.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:03.960]   And they're thinking to themselves,
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:08.760]   could this one be actually the Son of God?
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:13.840]   So to understand what Jesus was meaning here by rest
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.040]   and how that will totally transform your thinking
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.880]   about your need for rest,
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:19.800]   we have to go all the way back
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.480]   to my favorite three chapters of the scripture.
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.400]   Does anybody know what my favorite
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.640]   three chapters of the scripture are?
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.280]   I know Tony does 'cause he's already laughing about it.
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:29.040]   Anyone else know my favorite three chapters of scripture?
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.760]   Genesis, which ones?
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.120]   One, two, three, amen, Jennifer, star.
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.480]   She's on staff, that doesn't count, but star.
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.960]   My favorite three chapters of scripture,
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:39.800]   Genesis one, two, and three,
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.840]   because within there we see God do so much
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.160]   to create what he wants in this world
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.240]   and the travesty of how sin breaks it
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.720]   and then the longing for it to be renewed.
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.640]   So if we wanna understand what Jesus is speaking about here
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.800]   when he's saying, I can give you rest for your soul,
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.440]   we gotta go all the way back to Genesis one and two.
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.360]   The beautiful thing about Genesis one and two
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.320]   is in there we see a picture of God's creation of the world,
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.400]   the way in which he creates and shapes the world.
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.280]   And we saw this quite a bit in our series on justice
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.160]   just this past month.
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.680]   But the pinnacle of that creation, of course,
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.120]   is the creation of humanity,
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.200]   this climactic work that he creates
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.040]   and he places us as his image.
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.040]   And notice what he does,
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.920]   he then places us within the garden
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.840]   and then he speaks powerfully two things.
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.360]   He speaks and demonstrates two things
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.240]   that are basically the two essential things
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.240]   that human beings need for flourishing.
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:34.280]   If you're taking notes, and you should be taking notes,
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:35.640]   and you can use your phone in here
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.720]   but not be on Instagram, YouTube or anything like that,
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.400]   but if you're taking notes, mark this down,
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.280]   I'm gonna now teach you the two essential things
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.920]   that every human being needs for flourishing.
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:48.720]   In Genesis one and two, the Lord creates this force.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:52.240]   These are two rhythms that if you can get right in your life
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.480]   will cause you to flourish.
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.640]   The first is the rhythm of work
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.800]   and the second is the rhythm of rest.
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:01.240]   First, let's start with the idea of the rhythm of work.
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.640]   God creates humanity
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.040]   and he doesn't invite humanity into Bali on vacation.
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:09.560]   He creates humanity and he places humanity into a garden.
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.480]   And he says to humanity in that garden,
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.440]   he says, "Look around this creation I've created you,
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.800]   "you're made in my image.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:18.040]   "Now I want you to partner with me, being image of me,
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.600]   "I want you to partner with me
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:23.840]   "in the kind of flourishing of creation that is around you."
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.040]   So it's an invitation to work,
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.960]   work in partnership with God
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.400]   so that we can take his creation
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.520]   and bring that creation into its greatest expression
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.960]   in the same way that when God created,
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.800]   the Holy Spirit took something that was formless,
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.720]   gave it form and brought it into its fullness.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.120]   Now God takes humanity, places it in the garden
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.240]   and it says, "Do the same.
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.160]   "You're made in my image.
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.000]   "Now I want you to partner with me
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.880]   "in enabling creation to find its fullness
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:51.960]   "and its flourishing.
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.400]   "There's work for you to do."
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.480]   And that in those days was that work of planting,
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.720]   of preparing the soil, of watering, of growing,
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:04.000]   of reaping crop, of making the world produce its fruit.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.960]   Adam and Eve are given work that not only flourishes them,
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.880]   but flourishes creation around them.
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:15.960]   And God steps back and says, "That's good."
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:20.240]   There's a rhythm of work that's important for us to know
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:24.480]   that was there before sin came to the picture.
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.960]   The second rhythm he creates is the rhythm of rest.
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.520]   Can I have an amen?
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.880]   It's not all work, you also get rest.
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.280]   And in creating this rhythm of rest,
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.960]   God does so by demonstrating and doing it in two ways.
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.120]   First of all, he does it through the order
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.120]   by which he creates.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.680]   I wonder if you've ever recognized this,
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.040]   but in Genesis 1 and 2,
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:47.360]   when God gets to the end of his created day,
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.720]   he says this phrase, he says,
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:53.400]   "And then there was night and there was day the first day."
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.400]   Or it says, "And then there was evening and morning
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.960]   "the second day, evening and morning the third day."
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.840]   Which if you stop for a moment and read it,
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.600]   you would realize, isn't that around the wrong way?
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:03.440]   Like, shouldn't it be,
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.400]   "And then there was day and night the first day."
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.280]   But you gotta understand that when God creates,
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.240]   he creates a rhythm of rest where he says,
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.640]   "You wanna know how human beings flourish?
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:17.480]   "There was evening and there was morning the first day."
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:20.160]   In other words, this is how human beings flourish.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:25.080]   They flourish working out of rest, not into rest.
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.600]   Oh, may that change your life.
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.120]   Because here's how we all work.
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:32.140]   We desperately work into rest, don't we?
[00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:33.920]   Like we work really hard, really hard, really hard,
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.640]   but it's okay because we booked that trip to Bali
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:36.520]   and we're gonna be on that beach
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.040]   and we're gonna drink that pina colada,
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.520]   but we're working, working, working, working, working
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.360]   so that we can get to our vacation, collapse on the beach
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.920]   and go, "Thank goodness I'm alive."
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:47.320]   We work into rest on a daily basis.
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.880]   You work really hard in your work
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.880]   and then you get home to watch Netflix.
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.040]   We work into rest,
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.440]   but God's created the world to work out of rest.
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.280]   He's like, "You wanna know what it is
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:57.520]   "to flourish as human beings?
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:01.720]   "Work out how rest becomes a propelling into what is good
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:04.800]   "rather than rest being where you go when you're exhausted."
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:09.520]   I learned this a few years ago because in my early years,
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:12.080]   I was a banker and I worked for an investment bank.
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:14.240]   I was pretty stressed when I was a banker
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:15.640]   working in investment banking,
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.200]   but I had never experienced stress
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.520]   until I'd become a pastor.
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:24.320]   You are all very stressful.
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.280]   So I became very stressed when I became a pastor.
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:31.000]   Over a few years, I recognized that I was having a big toll
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.360]   on my physical health.
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.840]   It was a big toll on my physical health
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:38.160]   because everything was beginning to work in my body
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.760]   and in my system in a bad way.
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.520]   I started getting irritable bowel syndrome.
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:42.560]   My stomach was really bad.
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:45.200]   And it got to the point where I had to go to a doctor.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.120]   And I went to the doctor and I said to the doctor,
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.120]   "Look, I think I might have stomach cancer.
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:49.960]   "There's something going on.
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:50.840]   "I don't know what it is."
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.240]   And the doctor's like, "Well, let's do some tests."
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.080]   We did some tests.
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:55.040]   And I came back and he's like, "You're perfectly fine.
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.320]   "Physically, you're absolutely fine.
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.560]   "There's nothing in your stomach.
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:58.680]   "There's nothing there at all."
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:00.360]   So I'm like, "Well, doctor, what's going on?"
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.920]   He's like, "Well, tell me about your work week."
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.960]   So I told him, I'm like, "Well, I start work on Tuesdays
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.240]   "and I work Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.880]   "Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.440]   "And then Sunday's my busiest day.
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.600]   "And it's a crazy day.
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.080]   "And by the time I finish all the sermons
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.440]   "and all the services and everything,
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:15.720]   "I collapse into Monday.
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.040]   "Monday's my day off, praise the Lord."
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:22.680]   And he's like, "So you're telling me you work into rest?"
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:25.080]   He's like, "You should be working out of rest."
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.000]   I'm like, "What do you mean?"
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.400]   He's like, "Don't have a day off on Monday.
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.640]   "Have a day off on Friday."
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.680]   I'm like, "You don't understand.
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:32.960]   "I can't, like, the rhythm in our office,
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.000]   "we have days off on Monday.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:34.840]   "We don't have..."
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.000]   He's like, "Who's the boss?"
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:40.360]   (congregation laughing)
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.120]   Jesus?
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.640]   I said, "Well, I'm kind of the boss."
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.200]   He's like, "Well, then change it."
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.960]   So I did, I changed my day off from Monday to Friday.
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.880]   And as soon as I changed my day off from Friday,
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:54.120]   what it means is now I work Sunday, Monday,
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.520]   Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday is my day off.
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:57.640]   Saturday I work if I need to,
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:58.800]   if there's a wedding or whatever.
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.120]   And then I come in on Sunday.
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.800]   And you gotta believe it that I'm working now
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:02.800]   out of a place of rest.
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.640]   So when I come in on a Sunday, man, I'm fired up.
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:07.520]   I'm ready to go.
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:08.840]   Like, I'm so excited.
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:13.800]   And I know, I know that all of you are exhausted
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:16.800]   and you don't feel like I do and I get it.
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.520]   And you're gonna wanna go to work tomorrow
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:19.680]   and ask your boss for Friday off.
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.040]   It's not gonna work probably for you.
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.000]   But I want you to hear the scripture here.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.360]   What God is saying is that there's an ordained rhythm
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:29.680]   in this world where if you can somehow change your attitude
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:32.440]   and your thinking, somehow change the rhythms of your work
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:35.360]   and begin to think I'm working out of a place of rest,
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:38.160]   not working into a place of rest,
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.880]   you will find the greatest flourishing
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.280]   that God has ever given you.
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.440]   Just a few months later, my stomach cleared up.
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.960]   No IBS, never had it ever since.
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.840]   I'm still as stressed as I ever was.
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.360]   But I'm working from a place of rest,
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.960]   not working into a place of rest.
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.560]   So that's the first thing that the Lord does.
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:55.600]   Here's the second thing he does.
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.560]   Right at the end on the seventh day,
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:58.800]   the Bible gives us this beautiful thing.
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.480]   It says, "And then he rested from all of his work."
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.240]   So on the seventh day, the Lord does nothing, if you will.
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.080]   He rests.
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.360]   Now the Hebrew word there for rest
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.680]   is actually the word for cease.
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.240]   So what he does here is he ceases from his work.
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:18.120]   Now, it's easy for us to project the idea of Sabbath
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.840]   into this moment, but we have to stop from doing that
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:24.800]   because Sabbath, this is the moment that drives the idea
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.440]   and the institution of Sabbath,
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:29.200]   which comes later in Exodus with the law that's given
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.840]   and the way that God works with the Jewish people
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:31.840]   in their freedom.
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:34.680]   And Sabbath gets instituted because of this moment.
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.560]   But what you've got to realize is that in this moment,
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:40.840]   God is not Sabbathing because he's exhausted.
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.480]   He didn't get to the end of those six days of creation
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:45.080]   and go, "Oh my goodness, I'm so tired, so weary, so burdened.
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:46.600]   I need to sit down for a moment
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.680]   and just breathe it all in," right?
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.440]   He gets to the end of his week, and here's the thing.
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.400]   He's not tired and exhausted so he needs rest.
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:59.240]   He ceases his work because nothing more needs to be done.
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.760]   In other words, the world is just
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.000]   as he always envisioned it to be.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.640]   It's operating how he's always wanted it to be.
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.760]   Like a painter, think of it this way.
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:12.240]   Like a painter who's been spending months
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:15.960]   putting paint on a canvas and brushing brushstrokes,
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.840]   and then at the end of those months,
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:21.200]   finally puts the last brush on the painting
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:23.440]   and steps back and looks at the painting and goes,
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:25.720]   "Oh my goodness, it's done,"
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.800]   and then puts the paintbrush down.
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.680]   Not because they're tired and exhausted
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:30.840]   and it's all been bad,
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.440]   but because there's this glorious picture in front
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.840]   that is just how they always dreamed it to be
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.800]   and nothing more needs to be added.
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.240]   Are you with me?
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:44.320]   So the Lord rests, ceases,
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.840]   because everything is just as it is to be.
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:51.240]   This, my friends, is the idea of shalom.
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.800]   What we see actually at the end
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:55.360]   of the creation narrative of Genesis 1 and 2
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.280]   is not the institution of Sabbath.
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.960]   It is the exclamation of shalom.
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.480]   So when we go back to Matthew 11
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.680]   and Jesus says, "Come to me,
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:05.120]   "all you who are weary and burdened,
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.560]   "and I will give you rest,"
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:10.160]   Jesus is not speaking about Sabbath rest.
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.640]   He's not speaking in that passage about,
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.480]   "Man, I know you're tired, you just need a day off.
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:14.680]   "We're gonna give you a day off
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.800]   "and then we're gonna get back into it."
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.520]   He's actually not talking about Sabbath.
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.920]   Jesus speaks about Sabbath in lots of other places
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:24.000]   and He actually redeems and reconstructs what Sabbath is.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.360]   He does that, but in this moment, it's not about Sabbath.
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:28.120]   This is about shalom.
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:31.120]   This is why He says, "It's a rest for your souls."
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.520]   In other words, what Jesus is doing
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:34.520]   is going right back to Genesis 1 and 2
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:37.040]   and He's seeing the picture of these rhythms
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:39.040]   that have been created for humanity to flourish,
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.160]   the rhythm of work and the rhythm of rest,
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.760]   and how we are to operate out of a place of rest
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:45.400]   into the world that He's created
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:48.000]   so that we can do the good works that He's placed upon us.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.720]   And He sees a burnt out and exhausted group of people.
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.440]   And He says, "There is the rest
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:54.120]   "that Scripture has longed for,
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.440]   "that it spoke about in Genesis 1 and 2."
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.960]   He says, "If you come to me when you're weary and burdened,
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.560]   "I will give you shalom.
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.720]   "I will give you this kind of rest,
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.280]   "not just a break from your work
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.200]   "so that you can go back and be more stressed,
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.040]   "but actually a change within you
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:13.000]   "that will forever bring you into a place of peace."
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.320]   And He's like, "I want you to operate out of peace."
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:23.000]   But then Genesis 3 happens.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   Genesis 3 changes everything again,
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:25.920]   because there's Adam and Eve,
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:26.760]   and they take of that fruit
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.280]   from the knowledge of the tree of good and evil,
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.280]   and everything changes.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.840]   Sin enters the situation,
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.920]   and those rhythms that were created
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:35.440]   for the flourishing of humanity,
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.360]   the rhythm of work and the rhythm of rest
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.640]   is totally changed in that moment.
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:41.680]   And those four relational contexts
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:42.520]   that we've been speaking about
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:45.120]   in this Justice series just recently,
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.960]   us with God, us with ourselves,
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.920]   us with others, us with creation,
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:51.720]   those four things are completely changed in that moment.
[00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:53.920]   All of them are disrupted and broken,
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.960]   and life is never the same again.
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.360]   And in this reality of sin,
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.520]   both the pleasure of work
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:03.520]   and the reality of rest are disrupted.
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:04.720]   Let me show you specifically
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.760]   how this happens from Genesis 3.
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:11.600]   I wanna show you verses just 19 to 20.
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.120]   He says this.
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.840]   He says, sorry, 17, we're gonna start in 17.
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:18.400]   He says, "Cursed is the ground because of you.
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.560]   "Through painful toil, you will eat of it
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:22.040]   "all the days of your life.
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.400]   "It will produce thorns and thistles for you,
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.560]   "and you will eat the plants of the field.
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:29.800]   "By the sweat of your brow, you will eat your food,
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.760]   "and you will return to the ground.
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.880]   "Since from it you are taken.
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:37.880]   "For dust you are, and to dust you will return."
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.840]   God shows up in the garden post-sin,
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:40.760]   and there's Adam and Eve,
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.480]   and they are broken in their relationship with him,
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.320]   in their relationship with themselves,
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:44.200]   their relationship with others,
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.400]   their relationship with creation.
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.720]   And in the disarray of all that sin,
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:48.560]   God shows up and says,
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:51.680]   you've gotta understand that there are consequences to that.
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.120]   You've gotta understand that now things
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.120]   are going to be differently.
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:56.760]   And he says, "The curse, the ground is now cursed,"
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.000]   notice, "because of you."
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.760]   And suddenly, where work was a rhythm
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.920]   designed for humanity to bring it into flourishing,
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.440]   now work is going to do these things.
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:11.600]   It's gonna be a toil of pain on you.
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.840]   There are gonna be thorns and thistles at work.
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.960]   It's gonna be the sweat of your brow.
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:20.360]   It's gonna be exhausting and tiring and bickering,
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:21.760]   and it's not gonna work out
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:23.240]   how you thought it was gonna work out.
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.080]   Sin has so broken it.
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.880]   And I want you to see something really important here.
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:30.080]   What God is saying is not that work is evil,
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:31.280]   but that we are evil.
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:36.480]   Not that work is sinful, but that we are sinful.
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:39.600]   And because we are sinful, suddenly everything has changed,
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:42.680]   and no longer what was supposed to bring us into flourishing
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:46.600]   now is gonna feel like it's sucking life from us.
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.040]   This is profound.
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.880]   Think about it in the four relational contexts
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.400]   that we've been speaking about.
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.120]   See, when our relationship with God breaks,
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.480]   here's what happens.
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:58.040]   We don't like that.
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:00.520]   We feel alone and we feel left behind,
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.360]   and here's what we do as human beings.
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:03.840]   When that relationship breaks,
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:06.640]   we try to become God ourselves.
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:10.640]   We take on board for ourselves the control of the world.
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.240]   Rather than leaving that to God,
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.440]   we begin to take it on ourselves.
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:15.400]   We say, "Well, I guess I need to provide for myself.
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:16.440]   "I need to work hard.
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:17.800]   "I need to provide for my family.
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:18.880]   "I need to be in control.
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.560]   "I need to make sure that everything is perfect,
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:21.720]   "just the way it should be."
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.840]   And we wonder why we're exhausted.
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:27.560]   And when our relationship with ourselves breaks
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.560]   because of sin, here's the reality.
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:32.360]   Suddenly the Bible has this kind of definition.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:36.120]   It says that we suddenly get this orphan spirit in us.
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:37.960]   And the orphan spirit is because we feel like
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:41.720]   God has left us, so we feel like we are abandoned
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.160]   in this world, and because of that,
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.880]   we begin to do all that we can to plug the gap
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.480]   of that abandonment.
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:49.400]   So we try to prove ourselves.
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:52.080]   We try to show the world that we are deserving
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.040]   of being loved.
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:54.800]   We try to work hard so that people think,
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.080]   "Oh, we're successful."
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.160]   We wanna project an image,
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.960]   even though we know deep down inside we're still broken.
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:04.720]   The orphan spirit causes us to prove ourselves,
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.400]   and we're wondering why we're exhausted.
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:10.960]   And then when our relationship with others breaks down
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.760]   because we no longer have that relationship
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.680]   with God, we no longer have the security in ourselves,
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:18.160]   we start looking for security in the people around us.
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:19.960]   We overdate.
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.120]   We get into too many relationships.
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:25.080]   We're seeking for somebody to make us feel good,
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:26.320]   somebody to try to love us,
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:28.440]   somebody that we think that we can kind of
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.920]   be their best friend or be in relationship with them
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:32.760]   in a way that's gonna make us feel good
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:34.280]   about the brokenness in ourselves.
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:38.760]   And so we're using people to plug the hole in ourselves,
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:41.080]   and we wonder why we're exhausted.
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.560]   And then when our relationship with creation breaks down,
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:45.520]   two things will happen.
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.880]   Either we'll just not care about creation,
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.520]   we'll avoid it, we'll exploit it,
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.320]   we'll treat it how we want,
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.440]   and therefore in the long term we will suffer.
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.240]   Or we do the opposite.
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:56.960]   We worship creation.
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.200]   We look for creation as our salvation.
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.520]   We turn to creation as the place
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:02.800]   that's gonna redeem and renew us,
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:04.920]   and we begin to worship it through new age
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:06.600]   and the worship of mother nature
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:09.120]   and getting in touch with the spiritual essence
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:10.120]   of nature around us.
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:12.080]   And we think that that's where it's all gonna go,
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:13.840]   and we wonder why we're exhausted.
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:17.960]   This, my friends, is what I would call a striving mentality.
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:20.080]   And every single one of us,
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.240]   the reason why we are exhausted
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.800]   is not because you work hard, and I'm sure you do,
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.880]   and I'm sure hard work is tiring.
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.080]   The reason why you're really exhausted
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:30.760]   is because of your striving.
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:35.680]   You see, where we were once operating
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:40.680]   out of a place of rest into a place of thriving before sin,
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.760]   now we're operating out of a place of disorder
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:47.240]   into a place of striving because of sin.
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:48.400]   Are you with me?
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.720]   So before where we had this beautiful rhythm
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:54.600]   of work and rest and no sin to break it down,
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:55.840]   we felt fully alive,
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:59.440]   now we're trying to plug all the gaps ourselves.
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.880]   We're trying to reach out and find ways
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.640]   to feel better about our brokenness.
[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:05.920]   We're trying to ensure that no one else around us
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:07.960]   sees what's truly going on inside,
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:10.840]   and we're in this place of doing all of that
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:12.040]   in our own strength,
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:14.920]   and it's because we are striving and driving
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.960]   to try to prove when actually that's just leading us
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:21.400]   into a place of greater and greater exhaustion.
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:25.160]   And when all of this sits together in one,
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:30.080]   we begin to understand why it is that Jesus says
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:32.520]   what He says to those people in Galilee
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:34.880]   back in the first century, all those years ago.
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:40.920]   You see, whenever we try to strive
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:46.360]   to restore what is broken inside of us because of our sin,
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:49.000]   and we look to any other source
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.240]   other than Jesus Himself to do that,
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:54.720]   you will only ever become more and more exhausted
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.400]   and less and less free.
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:58.920]   Come on church.
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:02.960]   That's the reality of what our world is like.
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.560]   That's the reality of all of our lives.
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:09.360]   If we try to plug and restore in any other source
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:12.040]   other than Jesus, we're only gonna get more exhausted.
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.160]   We're only gonna get more and more less free,
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.640]   more bound, more enslaved, more exploited,
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:18.720]   more tired, more exhausted.
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:21.720]   Our life is not gonna look how it was meant to be.
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:24.160]   And so Jesus shows up to these burnt out,
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:26.560]   exhausted, tired people in Galilee,
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:30.160]   and He says, "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened.
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.880]   "I will give you rest."
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.200]   I wonder if that takes on now
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:38.000]   a slightly different perspective.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.960]   Jesus is not offering a holiday to Bali
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:42.000]   as good as holidays to Bali are.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.320]   He's offering something much more important,
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:49.080]   a freedom within yourself
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:51.360]   where you're operating out of rest, not into rest,
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.840]   where you found peace in a way that truly is transformative,
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:59.040]   where even your work begins to find fresh life.
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:01.200]   Notice what He says.
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:05.080]   He says, "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened."
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:06.600]   The word weary here literally means
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:09.160]   to toil to a point of exhaustion,
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:11.600]   to try in our own strength to achieve.
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:15.400]   The word burden here means to carry a heavy weight upon us,
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:18.680]   to be overburdened by responsibilities and life.
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:23.120]   Jesus only uses these two words here in all of the Gospels.
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:25.080]   Never mentions these words ever again.
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.640]   It's just in this teaching
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.320]   'cause He's trying to touch that striving mentality
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:31.040]   that we all hold because of sin.
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.440]   And the reality that we're weighed down and burdened
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.680]   by the heaviness of life.
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:37.320]   And He says, "This is human experience,
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:38.800]   but it does not have to be.
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:41.840]   This is human experience weighed down by sin.
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:44.320]   But I have gone to the cross, I have raised again,
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.720]   I have liberated, I've set the world free.
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:50.760]   If you come to me, all you who are weary and burdened,
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:52.200]   I will give you that rest,
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:55.000]   a rest that will renew your spirit in your life
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.320]   so that you're not trying to escape the world
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:58.800]   because you're exhausted,
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.400]   you're leaning in because you're excited."
[00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:08.000]   I love how He says here, "Come to me."
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.400]   Simple.
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.840]   Jesus does not offer a 12-step plan
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:15.040]   to be able to manage the stress better in your life.
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:16.520]   He does not offer a strategy
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:18.880]   to help you to reduce your striving
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:20.120]   so that you can feel a little bit better.
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:22.680]   He's not trying to give you like a roadmap
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:24.600]   so that you can just get to your next vacation
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:25.800]   and feel a little bit better
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:27.440]   and then get back into the rat race.
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:28.560]   No, He's not doing that.
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:31.080]   Jesus does not want you to manage your striving.
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:33.200]   He wants you to eliminate striving.
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.880]   He wants you to be completely free
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:37.680]   from the thing that is weighing you down.
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:38.880]   So He says these beautiful words.
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:41.200]   He says, "Come to me."
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.200]   In other words, relationship with Him
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:45.480]   is what sets us free from that striving,
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:46.880]   recognizing that on the cross,
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:49.840]   He paid the price for the heaviness and the weight of sin,
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:51.160]   that in His resurrection,
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:53.720]   He offers grace and freedom from anyone
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.360]   who can turn towards Him.
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:58.320]   And He says to everybody, "Just come to me.
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.600]   I'm not hard to find," He's saying.
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:04.160]   You don't have to go on some big, long pilgrimage search.
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.320]   All you literally do is need to say,
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.120]   "Jesus, would you help me?"
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:11.480]   In other words, He's saying, "I'm available right here,
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:14.120]   right now, today, for whatever it is
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:16.080]   that is weighing you down, burdening you,
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.280]   strength, kind of that pressure upon you.
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:22.160]   I am here to set you free."
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.000]   Notice what He says.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.120]   He says, "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened."
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:27.640]   He didn't say, "Come to me
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:30.360]   when you're feeling better about yourself."
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:32.480]   He didn't say, "Come to me when everything's going right,
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.640]   when you've dealt with some stuff,
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:35.320]   when you've offloaded some of the weight,
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:36.400]   then come to me."
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:40.000]   No, He says, "Come to me just as you are right now."
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:40.920]   It's like Jesus is saying,
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:43.160]   "The only qualification you need
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:46.880]   to be in relationship with me is weariness and burden."
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:51.120]   And if you feel weary and burdened and exhausted and tired
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:52.800]   and overworked and overstimulated
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:54.400]   and feel like you're at the end of yourself,
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:57.720]   well, then you're primed for relationship with Jesus.
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:01.720]   The needier you are, the more perfect you are for Jesus.
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:03.400]   Come on, church.
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:07.480]   The needier you are, the more perfect you are for Jesus,
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:09.240]   for what He wants to do in your life.
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:11.400]   He says, "Come to me, all you who are weary
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:14.160]   and burdened right now, and I will give you rest."
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:15.200]   Not in the future,
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.080]   not in some kind of thing that's down the line,
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:18.880]   not after you've done a five-step program,
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:20.880]   not after you've done 12 Bible studies.
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:23.160]   I'm gonna give you rest right now.
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:26.080]   And that rest is gonna set you free.
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:27.600]   That rest is gonna change it all.
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:29.880]   And you might still need some physical break
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:30.880]   from time to time,
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:33.280]   but when you get the kind of rest I'm talking about,
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:35.440]   the kind of rest that goes into your soul,
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:39.240]   your primary purpose in life is not to work, to rest.
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:42.960]   Your primary purpose in life is to rest, to work.
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:45.320]   Come on, church.
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:48.200]   And what kind of work?
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:51.680]   The Sermon on the Mount, the Great Commission.
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:53.760]   And yes, being a banker and a lawyer and a teacher
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:55.760]   and a graphic designer and a nurse and a doctor
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:57.920]   and whatever it is that you might be in this room,
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:59.520]   all of that work has value.
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:01.480]   All of that work can produce the world
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:03.080]   to be a flourishing place,
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:05.000]   like the rhythm that it was created to be
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.440]   in Genesis 1 and 2.
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:10.240]   But the only way you get there is through Jesus Christ.
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:14.360]   Otherwise, you are stuck in your striving,
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:18.720]   in your sin, in your brokenness,
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:23.160]   in that orphan spirit trying to get everybody to like you.
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:25.280]   There is nothing more exhausting
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:27.440]   than trying to get people to like you
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:31.200]   because you don't really probably at times are easy to like.
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.760]   But guess what?
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:37.960]   Jesus likes you, loves you,
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:40.400]   loves you just the way you are right now.
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:43.840]   Doesn't love the brokenness or the sin that's in our lives,
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:46.880]   but loves you and sees you free
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:49.880]   and says, "All you have to do is come to me."
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:53.600]   He then says this word, he says,
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.120]   and this is quite funny.
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:59.000]   He says, "Take my yoke upon you and learn from me,
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.040]   "for I'm gentle and humble in heart,
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:03.320]   "and you will find rest for your souls,
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:06.440]   "for my yoke is easy and my burden is light."
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.280]   I love this.
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:09.160]   He says, "Take my yoke upon you,"
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:11.440]   which is really bizarre, so counterintuitive.
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:13.520]   It seems actually counterproductive
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:16.320]   'cause Jesus has said, "Come to me and I will give you rest."
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:19.080]   And now he said, "Take my yoke."
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:20.440]   It's like, hang on, Jesus, what is it?
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:21.760]   Is it rest or work?
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:25.560]   Is it rest or freedom or rest?
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:27.080]   You can't tell me you're gonna give me rest
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:29.800]   and then tell me that I'm gonna be yoked again.
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:31.640]   But you have to understand what Jesus is saying here.
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:32.560]   He's saying, "You've gotta understand
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:35.480]   "that when you're yoked to something,
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:37.080]   "it's gonna burn you out
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:41.160]   "unless the thing that you are yoked to is my yoke,
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:43.880]   "me, myself."
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:45.000]   If you don't know what a yoke is,
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.680]   a yoke was in the first century
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:49.400]   and is still used in farming rural communities today.
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:52.520]   It is a wooden beam that goes across two animals,
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:53.760]   usually two oxen.
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:56.000]   And the wooden beam goes across them like this.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.280]   And there's like a little hoop here
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:58.120]   and a little hoop there.
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:00.080]   And the neck of the oxen's go through the hoop.
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:03.640]   And usually two oxen will be used to like plow a field
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:06.800]   or to carry a cart to market with the produce to market,
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:07.720]   whatever it might be.
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:09.200]   Now, interestingly, notice this,
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:10.960]   those yokes were made of wood.
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:13.280]   Guess who made the yokes in the first century?
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:14.480]   It was the carpenters.
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:18.080]   Should be making connections and dots there, guys.
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.280]   (audience laughing)
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:21.640]   Jesus did not make rocking chairs
[00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:24.320]   for grannies on the balcony, okay?
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.160]   Jesus made farming equipment.
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.280]   That's what a carpenter in Galilee
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:29.400]   and around that area in the first century,
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.400]   they made farming equipment.
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.920]   So no doubt, Jesus had made a bunch of these yokes
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:34.440]   over his career as a carpenter.
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:36.280]   So he says to the people who are farmers,
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:37.520]   he says, "It's like this yoke."
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:38.840]   Now, here's the interesting thing.
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:40.440]   Farmers would know this, but we don't
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:41.960]   because we live in modern Hong Kong.
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:43.760]   But in the first century, farmers understood
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:46.160]   that when you had a yoke, there were two animals
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:47.080]   that were yoked to it.
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:50.160]   There was one animal who was a big, strong ox,
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:54.040]   and then there was another ox who was slightly less strong.
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:56.200]   Now, the reason why a farmer would bring
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:57.880]   two animals like that together,
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:00.000]   a strong one and a slightly less strong,
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.760]   is 'cause the farmer is working for the long-term.
[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:06.560]   And he wants to train up the slightly less strong oxen
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:08.840]   to one day go and be the strong oxen
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:11.440]   for another less strong oxen.
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:14.320]   If they took two strong oxen together all the time,
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:18.000]   there's no passing or learning on that process.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.720]   So when you yoked animals,
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:21.480]   you took a strong one on the right side,
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.320]   a less strong one on the left side.
[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:26.040]   The one on the right side had a noose in the yoke
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.240]   that was very tight,
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:29.720]   which meant that he would carry more of the weight.
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:32.680]   The one on the other side, the noose was looser,
[00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:34.840]   meaning that they didn't carry as much weight,
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:36.160]   but still carried some weight.
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:38.840]   And so Jesus is saying, "Take my yoke upon you."
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:41.040]   What he's saying is, "I'm on the right side
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:44.560]   "here, it's my yoke, you're sharing it with me.
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:47.680]   "It's tight around me because I can take on board
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:48.720]   "all of the weight.
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:51.360]   "You though, still have some weight to carry.
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:53.160]   "You still have a partnership here.
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:54.960]   "You're still a part of it, but don't worry.
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:57.520]   "I'm gonna carry the majority of your weight,
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:59.480]   "but there's still a weight that'll be upon you.
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:01.560]   "But don't freak out, I'm right alongside you.
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:02.680]   "We're doing this together.
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:06.440]   "It's a partnership towards what I wanna see
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:08.000]   "you flourishing in this world."
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.840]   That should remind you of Genesis 1 and 2,
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:11.440]   when God creates the world,
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.920]   he creates us in partnership with him
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:16.000]   so that we bring the world into flourishing.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.080]   Then Jesus says to these people in Galilee,
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:19.600]   "Come to me, all you who are in burden,
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:20.560]   "and I will give you rest.
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:21.960]   "Here's how I will give you rest.
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:24.320]   "I will carry some of your load.
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:26.000]   "I will carry the heavy weight.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.960]   "I will carry the majority of the stress.
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:30.000]   "I will stand beside you, walk alongside you.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.360]   "I will fight battles for you that you didn't even know.
[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:33.800]   "But you gotta recognise that we are
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.080]   "in partnership together.
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:36.360]   "There's still work to be done.
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:38.120]   "There's still joy ahead,
[00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:39.400]   "but you're gonna partner with me
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:40.760]   "and I'm gonna carry the heavy load.
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:42.400]   "You're gonna carry the light load,
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.400]   "but we are working in partnership together."
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.760]   This is why Jesus says, "Learn from me."
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:51.080]   He says, "Take my yoke and learn from me.
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:52.560]   "You're an apprentice with me.
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.520]   "You're the lighter oxen, if you will.
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:56.800]   "One day, you're gonna carry the heavier load.
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.080]   "One day, you're gonna grow to become
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:59.480]   "more and more like Christ Jesus,
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:00.760]   "attained to the whole measure
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:01.840]   "of the wholeness of Christ,
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:03.200]   "as it says in Ephesians 4."
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:07.400]   But he's saying, "Right now, be yoked to me.
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.560]   "I've got you.
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:10.360]   "I'm walking with you.
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:12.000]   "I'm beside you."
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.200]   Which is a truly liberating thought
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:16.960]   that we can be yoked to him
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:19.600]   and find ourselves in a place
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:21.360]   where that partnership is renewed,
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:25.640]   where sin put us in a place of striving.
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:30.240]   Jesus now puts us in a place again of thriving,
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:33.960]   not by the cessation of work,
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:37.480]   but by the re-understanding and the renewal of it.
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:41.080]   You see, before, when it was all about sin,
[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:44.840]   our rest was hard for us.
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:46.400]   We wanted it physically.
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:50.360]   But what Jesus offers us is something far more profound,
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:53.240]   the rest within us, within our soul,
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:54.160]   that changes everything.
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:55.800]   This is biblical rest,
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:39:00.560]   not this kind of invitation to the cessation of work
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:02.840]   because we're exhausted from our striving,
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:05.320]   but the invitation to the renewal of work
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:08.280]   because we have eliminated our striving.
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:09.840]   Isn't that beautiful?
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:11.760]   Isn't that such a wonderful way
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:14.000]   to think about what Jesus is offering here?
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.840]   So when he says to them,
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:20.360]   "My yoke is easy and my burden is light."
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:23.120]   The word for easy there means to be well-fitted to you,
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:25.120]   well-structured just for you.
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:27.920]   He's like, "This is the way it was made for you."
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:30.960]   I want you to see something really important.
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:33.720]   What Jesus is essentially teaching is this.
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:36.880]   There is no such thing as a yokeless life.
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:39.640]   And I think that's so important.
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:41.880]   That's gonna revolutionize some of your thinking here.
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:44.560]   There is no such thing as a yokeless life,
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:46.680]   a life where you don't have any responsibilities,
[00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:48.720]   a life where it is a permanent vacation,
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:51.160]   a life where you're just chilling with Jesus all the time.
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:54.280]   No, actually, you've been saved and redeemed and created
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:56.120]   because God's got purpose for you.
[00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:58.120]   The Sermon on the Mount, the Great Commission,
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:39:59.800]   he wants you to roll up your sleeves.
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:01.680]   There's a gospel to take to the world.
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:03.920]   There's justice to be seen around us.
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:06.600]   Now, if we try to do all those things in our own strength,
[00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:09.520]   apart from Jesus, we will be striving and exhausted
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:10.800]   and desperately need rest.
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:13.520]   But when we do those, yoke to Jesus,
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:15.640]   where he carries the heavier load,
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:17.840]   we find ourselves fully becoming the people
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:18.960]   we were created to be.
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:21.720]   And God steps back and says, "That's not Sabbath,
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:22.760]   that's Shalom.
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:26.880]   Oh, come to me, all you who are weary and burdened,
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.680]   because I haven't just got a Sabbath,
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:30.560]   a one day where you can recover
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:32.680]   as much as that's needed and Sabbath is good.
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:37.040]   I've got Shalom, a eternity by which you're redefined."
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:41.000]   There's no such thing as a yokeless life.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.520]   If you're in this room today, like I am,
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:51.320]   and you're feeling exhausted, burnt out, tired,
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:53.800]   overwhelmed, overstimulated,
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:56.240]   desperately in need of a vacation,
[00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:58.840]   you have to ask yourself,
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:00.720]   what is it that you are yoke to?
[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:02.440]   Because you're not yoke to Jesus.
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:07.920]   That's a strong word, but I'm just saying it straight up.
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:11.640]   And this is the great question this passage asks us,
[00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:16.200]   what is it that I am currently yoke to?
[00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:17.960]   And you have to realize that sometimes you can be yoke
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:19.760]   to what looks on the surface like good things,
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:20.960]   but they're not Jesus.
[00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:24.040]   And no matter even if you're yoke to good things,
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:24.880]   if they're not Jesus,
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:27.080]   you are only eventually gonna get exhausted
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:29.640]   and weighed down once again.
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:32.440]   Some of you in this room, you're yoke to the vine.
[00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:34.680]   That's not good, we're not Jesus.
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:38.600]   Some of you in this room, you're yoke to a relationship.
[00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:42.000]   That's not good, that person is not Jesus.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   Some of you who are yoke to work, yoke to success,
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.920]   yoke to making a name for yourself,
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:50.520]   that's not good because that's not Jesus.
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:52.320]   And it's not that we don't want you to love your church,
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:53.760]   we want you to love your church.
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:54.600]   It's not that we don't want you
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:55.960]   to have great relationships in your life.
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:56.960]   Of course we want you to.
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.600]   It's not that you can't have a great job
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:00.800]   and work hard and get promoted and earn a lot of money.
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:01.920]   That's absolutely fine.
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:04.760]   But when those things become the thing that you're yoke to,
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:07.960]   you will live a life of exhaustion and burnout and tiredness
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:09.680]   and you will not be working with Jesus
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:11.840]   for the renewable things.
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:14.280]   The only way we change the rat race,
[00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:16.640]   the only way we get off the spinning wheel
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:17.920]   is we recognize that Jesus says,
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:20.200]   "Come to me, all you who are worried and burdened,
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:23.040]   "and I will give you rest."
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:25.840]   I'm the only one that can give you rest.
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:29.280]   For my heart is gentle, my heart is humble,
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:30.760]   and the rest that I give you
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:32.600]   is not a pina colada on the beach in Bali,
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:36.920]   it literally is a rest for your soul.
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:39.160]   And when you receive that rest,
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:42.720]   you don't wanna check out of the world,
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:44.840]   you want to lean in.
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:49.240]   My prayer for you is that that's where you will be.
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:51.320]   And if you're anything like me
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:53.440]   and you know what it is to be exhausted and burdened
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:56.560]   and weary and stressed, you're in a great place
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:43:00.840]   because you are qualified then for a relationship with Jesus.
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:04.120]   The one thing that will truly give you rest, amen?
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:06.280]   Would you stand with me?
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:07.880]   And I would love to pray for us.
[00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:16.600]   Father, we are just so grateful
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:18.960]   for your presence here in this room.
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:24.440]   Grateful for the fact that you are with us, close to us.
[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:29.280]   Grateful that for those of us who are weary and burdened,
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:36.080]   the kind of rest that we really need is found in you.
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:41.240]   I wonder if this is important for you here this morning,
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:44.400]   if you're feeling this and if this is speaking to you,
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:45.960]   if you know what it is to be weary and burdened
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:47.480]   in this moment, I wonder whether you just open
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:48.600]   your hands before you.
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:51.180]   (gentle music)
[00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:57.440]   The Holy Spirit would say a challenging thing to you
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:58.480]   as your hands are open.
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:01.400]   First of all, you would say, I love you, I've got you.
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:04.800]   I can break the back of striving
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:08.040]   and that weary and burden that you feel right now,
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:11.360]   I can lift it off you in the name of Jesus.
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:14.920]   I'm the strong oxen that is by your side,
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:16.600]   carrying the heavy load.
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:20.680]   Maybe the starting point for some of you here this morning
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:22.140]   is just, Lord, would you come?
[00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:24.360]   I can't take it anymore.
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:27.960]   Just take a moment for some of you in this room,
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:29.440]   watching online in the overflow,
[00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:32.420]   Lord, I just, I can't take it anymore.
[00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:36.740]   I'm exhausted, burnt out.
[00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:40.900]   I'm codependent on relationships I shouldn't be.
[00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:45.480]   I'm looking for salvation in all the wrong places.
[00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:48.740]   I'm just tired 'cause of my boss.
[00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:52.480]   Could be for many reasons, but you're standing here
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:54.080]   and you're like, Lord, would you come?
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:56.020]   I can't do this, I need you.
[00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:57.060]   I need you to lift.
[00:44:57.060 --> 00:45:00.900]   I need you to lift it off of me in Jesus' name, lift it off.
[00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:04.260]   Father, I pray for my brothers and sisters here.
[00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:07.260]   Lord, my heart goes out to each one.
[00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:09.420]   Lord, would you lift off of their shoulders right now
[00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:10.700]   in the name of Jesus?
[00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:14.700]   The heaviness that striving has placed upon them.
[00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:20.020]   The heaviness that sin has placed upon us.
[00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:24.140]   The sin that we've chosen ourselves.
[00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:28.640]   The sin that others have done that has impacted us.
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:31.100]   Lord, would you liberate us?
[00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:33.680]   Lord, we come to you.
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:37.020]   And maybe for you, if this is resonating,
[00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:38.660]   that's a prayer just to pray right now.
[00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:42.460]   Lord, I come to you, I come to you.
[00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:43.660]   I can't take it anymore.
[00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:47.860]   I need you, I gotta have you step in
[00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:48.960]   and take this from me.
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:56.260]   And then the next thing I want you to do
[00:45:56.260 --> 00:45:57.980]   as you're in this place of prayer
[00:45:57.980 --> 00:46:00.340]   is just ask the Holy Spirit to show you
[00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:02.460]   what it is that you're currently yoked to.
[00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:10.620]   And you know that thing, it's gonna resonate in your spirit
[00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:12.780]   as soon as the Lord shows it to you.
[00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:13.620]   And you're gonna be like,
[00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:16.820]   I have an unhealthy attachment to success,
[00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:20.300]   an unhealthy attachment to this woman or this man,
[00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:22.780]   an unhealthy attachment to this website,
[00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:26.780]   an unhealthy attachment to whatever it might be
[00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:27.980]   in your life.
[00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:30.300]   And you know you're yoked to that thing.
[00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:32.540]   And as long as you remain yoked to that thing,
[00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:34.340]   you will feel the weight of it
[00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:37.340]   'cause it is not designed to carry the weight like Jesus is.
[00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:40.760]   (gentle music)
[00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:44.300]   And as the Holy Spirit shows you
[00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:45.940]   what it is that you are yoked to,
[00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:48.780]   this is where we allow the ministry of the Spirit to come,
[00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:52.740]   to liberate His people and His church
[00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:55.680]   from the weary and the burdens that we carry,
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:58.980]   to recognize that we're not given by Jesus
[00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:02.180]   a responsibility-free life or a perfect life
[00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:03.820]   that's never gonna be stressful,
[00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:05.860]   but to realize that we are never gonna go
[00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:07.020]   through that stress alone,
[00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:08.860]   that if we are yoked to Him,
[00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:11.400]   if our relationship is rooted in Him,
[00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:13.660]   if we are finding Him as our greatest joy
[00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:14.980]   and our greatest strength,
[00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:17.700]   even when we go through the valley of the shadow of death,
[00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:19.580]   it will not overcome us,
[00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:22.740]   for He will be right there with us.
[00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:29.780]   I wonder if we could just invite the prayer team to come.
[00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:33.340]   And I wonder whether we could just do this right now.
[00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:35.100]   You know, normally you do this at the end of the service,
[00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:36.500]   but I just feel like the Holy Spirit
[00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:37.700]   wants us to minister.
[00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:41.340]   And I know that some of you may need to go in a moment.
[00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:42.420]   We'll dismiss you in a moment,
[00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:43.680]   but this is a ministry time.
[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:45.100]   This is where the Holy Spirit,
[00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:46.520]   if this is speaking to you today,
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:48.300]   don't leave here without the opportunity
[00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:49.900]   to do some business with Jesus.
[00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:55.340]   And so we have a prayer team already here at the front.
[00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:57.420]   So I wanna invite you just to come and receive prayer.
[00:47:57.420 --> 00:48:00.020]   If you know you need prayer today, don't wait.
[00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:03.220]   Just come forward now and just come to our prayer team.
[00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:05.220]   And we will stay as long as it takes
[00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:06.980]   to pray for everybody that needs prayer.
[00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:08.540]   We wanna lay our hands on you.
[00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:10.220]   We wanna speak life over you.
[00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:12.540]   We wanna release the burdens that you're carrying.
[00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:14.140]   We wanna stand beside you.
[00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:16.340]   We wanna reignite rest,
[00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:17.340]   bring you back to the way
[00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:19.300]   that you were originally created to be.
[00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:21.900]   So come on church, I'm serious.
[00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:23.580]   If you'd like prayer, come forward.
[00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:25.340]   Come on.
[00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:28.220]   That's right, just start coming forward.
[00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:30.140]   We're gonna pray for you all.
[00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:31.860]   You can just come and stand with one of our prayer team.
[00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:33.260]   They're gonna pray with you.
[00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:34.860]   Anyone else want prayer?
[00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:36.340]   If we could have some extra people on the prayer team,
[00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:37.860]   that would also be helpful.
[00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:39.660]   Alana, would you mind praying for people?
[00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:40.480]   Anyone else?
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:41.400]   Come on.
[00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:43.820]   In the upper house, you guys can come down as well.
[00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:44.740]   If you're in the overflow,
[00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:46.620]   you can come out and pray as well.
[00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:48.520]   We wanna pray for every single person.
[00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:52.140]   That's great.
[00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:54.340]   Brilliant.
[00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:55.300]   All right, we need more people to pray.
[00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:56.660]   Is anybody willing to pray?
[00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:59.140]   Somebody?
[00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:00.400]   Sean, come on buddy.
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:01.500]   Yeah, mate, thanks.
[00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:02.540]   If you're willing to pray for people,
[00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:03.820]   would you come forward as well?
[00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:04.780]   If you're willing to pray for people,
[00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:06.580]   just put your hand up as you come forward
[00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:07.740]   and we're gonna make sure that everybody's,
[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:09.180]   you're willing to pray for someone?
[00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:10.100]   You're willing to pray for someone?
[00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:11.780]   All right, keep coming forward guys.
[00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:12.820]   Sean, would you start praying?
[00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:13.660]   Yeah, great.
[00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:15.500]   You wanna pray?
[00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:18.980]   Okay, you can pray for this guy.
[00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:20.500]   Anyone else like prayer?
[00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:21.580]   Thanks, Nathan.
[00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:22.540]   If our elders are here,
[00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:24.380]   anybody from our staff, prayer team.
[00:49:24.380 --> 00:49:28.840]   And maybe if you're still here,
[00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:29.940]   you can just stretch out your hands
[00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:30.980]   or just begin to pray for yourself.
[00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:32.700]   You can even pray for people around you.
[00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:35.300]   We're just gonna take a moment to really do this together.
[00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:38.300]   Okay, we need some more prayers.
[00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:39.340]   Yeah, okay.
[00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:40.180]   Can you come?
[00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:42.580]   There's a lady just over here who's gonna pray for you.
[00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:44.620]   Awesome.
[00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:52.340]   Okay.
[00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:53.780]   All right, there's a lot of people here in this line
[00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:54.980]   that wanna get prayed for.
[00:49:54.980 --> 00:49:56.980]   So we're gonna pray for them.
[00:49:56.980 --> 00:49:59.660]   If you need to go, we wanna bless you to go.
[00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:01.540]   But can I ask, just say something.
[00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:03.780]   Can you just go as quietly as you can if you need to go?
[00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:05.460]   I hope this has been helpful for you.
[00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:07.100]   I'm sure the Lord also spoke to you.
[00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:08.220]   So you can go into the week,
[00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:10.420]   think about what it is to operate out of a place of rest.
[00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:12.180]   Think about what it is that you've been yoked to.
[00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:13.900]   The Lord is gonna continue to set you free.
[00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:15.300]   If you wanna remain, remain.
[00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:16.140]   We will pray for you.
[00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:17.380]   If you wanna help pray for people,
[00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:19.180]   please remain and pray for people.
[00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:20.820]   We're gonna do this together, amen?
[00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:21.660]   God bless everyone.
[00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:22.620]   We'll see you guys next week.
[00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:23.460]   Thank you.
[00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:26.820]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
