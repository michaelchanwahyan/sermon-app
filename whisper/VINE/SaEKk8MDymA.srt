 ♪ And if it's deeper, what is deeper ♪

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,520
 ♪ You sink or swim, I'm the one ♪

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,040
 - Cool, we're back.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,860
 I just have a couple of announcements for all of us.

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:16,400
 Oh, my throat is not doing too well today.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,120
 Just a couple of announcements for us this week.

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,840
 There are a few things we want to bring to your attention.

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,520
 There are things that we,

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,840
 there's different events we want to see you at.

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,600
 First one, it's our prayer meeting.

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,720
 So anybody has been to a church prayer meeting before?

12
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,000
 It happens every month.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,780
 It's happening again this Tuesday evening.

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,320
 And this month we have a special theme.

15
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,860
 It's about the good news in Christ alone.

16
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,720
 As you know, we're going through the book of Galatians

17
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,720
 in a sermon series,

18
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,580
 and we would have a bit of time,

19
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,280
 spending some time in the Word,

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,960
 and allow the Word to lead us into a time of prayer as well.

21
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,960
 Of course, there will be a facilitator,

22
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,640
 and I believe that will be Deborah this month.

23
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,720
 And so I do want to invite you all

24
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,560
 to come and join us in prayer.

25
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,560
 And next week, there's going to be bring your own lunch.

26
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,080
 It's a monthly event.

27
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,240
 We do this every month to what's like end of month,

28
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,160
 or maybe the fourth week of the month.

29
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,520
 It's a great opportunity for us to not just meet people

30
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,360
 whom we always sit next to,

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,800
 but you will see different people in the church.

32
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,000
 A couple weeks ago, maybe two weeks ago,

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,080
 we had a volunteer appreciation event,

34
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,140
 and I saw everyone.

35
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,040
 I'm like, "Yes, I know this person, I know that person."

36
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,400
 But when I was there, I saw two people.

37
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,600
 They just talked to each other

38
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,280
 and started to introduce themselves and say,

39
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,280
 "Hi, my name is A."

40
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,280
 "Oh, yes, my name."

41
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,600
 I'm like, "You two don't know each other?

42
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,320
 "Oh, that's new for me."

43
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,680
 And I just realized, yes, as a church, it's growing.

44
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,560
 We have more people here,

45
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,520
 and so we do want to stay in touch with all of you.

46
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,520
 But at the same time, we do also want to build this moment

47
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,360
 for us to connect with each other,

48
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,160
 with people whom you don't normally sit with at the service,

49
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,120
 you don't normally talk to.

50
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,760
 Yes, of course, you don't talk to people at the service,

51
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,640
 right?

52
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,480
 You don't, right?

53
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,600
 Yeah, 'cause we don't talk to people at the service.

54
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,860
 Anyway, but anyway, yes, that's our heart.

55
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,080
 We do want to connect all of us,

56
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,260
 because church is not a 90-minute service on a Sunday.

57
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,000
 It's not just you sitting here listening to someone

58
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,520
 or just following the lyrics on the screen.

59
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,840
 Church is a community.

60
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,400
 It's the people of God.

61
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,040
 And if we don't get to know one another,

62
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,160
 how can we become a community, right?

63
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,220
 So our heart is to build up this community

64
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,640
 for us to get to know one another

65
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,360
 so we can support one another,

66
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,700
 we can pray with one another,

67
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,040
 and we could just simply talk to,

68
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,860
 have lunch with one another.

69
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,200
 That's what we want to do.

70
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:49,200
 So next Sunday after the English service,

71
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,120
 and you can just go and grab some lunch and come back.

72
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,960
 If you could stay and help us set this place up,

73
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,700
 that's amazing as well.

74
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,440
 Bring your own lunch next Sunday.

75
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,440
 We do also have a very exciting event coming up.

76
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,040
 If there are any young people in your family,

77
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,560
 any young people, like you know any young people,

78
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,000
 or if you feel you're still very young,

79
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,680
 okay, we do have an age limit though, yes.

80
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,240
 We're launching, anyway,

81
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,020
 we're launching a youth ministry event.

82
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,160
 This is gonna be the first one.

83
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,520
 It's on, is that a date?

84
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,160
 No, there's no date here, okay.

85
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,920
 But because we want you to pay attention

86
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,960
 to the announcement, so I'm gonna tell you the date.

87
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,200
 It's on the 30th of June.

88
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,160
 That will be the last Sunday of this month,

89
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,880
 and you, okay, maybe not every one of you,

90
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:42,080
 but if you're under 18, maybe 12 to 18, around this age,

91
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,120
 we do want to invite you to come along.

92
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,520
 And if you have any teenagers around you,

93
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,800
 we would love you to invite them

94
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,440
 to come to this meeting as well.

95
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,880
 We're starting a youth group.

96
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,840
 We do want to have fun with our young people,

97
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,280
 and we do want to experience the love of God with them.

98
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,280
 So yes, if you are a teenager, you can sign up directly.

99
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,620
 If you're not a teenager, but you know some teenager,

100
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,160
 you can also sign up for them.

101
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,840
 And we do want you to sign up,

102
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,120
 because you know, there are a lot of people

103
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,840
 who want to volunteer, but we do want to keep the ratio

104
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,580
 between volunteers and young people

105
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,720
 to an appropriate ratio, you know?

106
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,280
 You don't want to overwhelm young people

107
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,160
 with like 15 adults standing here, and you know.

108
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,620
 So the only way the adults could join,

109
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,080
 it's when we have enough teenagers there.

110
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,440
 So a lot of adults, they actually want to join in

111
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,400
 to volunteer.

112
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,600
 If you could register in advance,

113
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,440
 then we know we have enough numbers of young people,

114
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,720
 then we can say, yes, loving adults,

115
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,360
 you're welcome to join us,

116
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,480
 and you can have pizzas with us as well.

117
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,120
 I guess that's why they come, right?

118
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,900
 So yes, please, if you know you could attend,

119
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,380
 please do sign up in advance.

120
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,900
 We'd love to see the young people there.

121
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,860
 And so sign up for the young people around you as well.

122
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,820
 Okay, that's all for this week.

123
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,300
 We're gonna enter into another round of worship

124
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,780
 through our offering today.

125
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,100
 Our welcome team, they will be passing on the buckets

126
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:10,940
 at the moment.

127
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:15,280
 If you are giving by cash or checks,

128
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,180
 and these are just physical ways,

129
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,780
 you can put it in the buckets.

130
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,760
 If you are scanning,

131
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,420
 QR codes using digital ways, they are all on the screen.

132
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:29,420
 I was told the Alipay QR code may not be working.

133
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,980
 If you can use other means, that would be great.

134
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,940
 If not, you may have to try,

135
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,060
 and if it doesn't work,

136
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,880
 you have to give us some time to try and fix it.

137
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,520
 We just spotted it like minutes ago.

138
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,460
 But yeah, shall we pray for our offering?

139
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,440
 Let's do that.

140
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,120
 Father, we just wanna thank you for your love,

141
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,240
 your generosity in our lives,

142
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,360
 and we wanna thank you for being there,

143
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,160
 showing up in our lives,

144
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,840
 and we wanna thank you for the sacrificial love

145
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,920
 that is witnessed on the cross of Jesus.

146
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,120
 And so today, Father, we come before you with thanksgiving,

147
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,000
 with a heart of gratitude.

148
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,280
 We also pray that the things that we sow into the bucket,

149
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,800
 or we sow into the church community,

150
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,760
 we pray that these resources will be multiplied,

151
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,960
 and it will be able to bless those around us

152
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,720
 in this community, in this city,

153
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,920
 and we pray all that in Jesus' name.

154
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,760
 Everybody say, amen.

155
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,120
 Amen.

156
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,320
 It's my honor and pleasure to introduce our speaker today.

157
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,480
 She comes from Wan Chai.

158
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,960
 You may have met her before.

159
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,040
 She comes occasionally.

160
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,720
 Let's welcome Pastor Jennifer onto the stage.

161
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,560
 - Hi.

162
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,400
 (audience applauding)

163
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,800
 - It's good to see you all again.

164
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,880
 - Yes. - After three months,

165
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,680
 I think. - Three months.

166
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,400
 It's been so long. - Yeah.

167
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,040
 - Were you at the Chinese or English last time?

168
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,160
 - Cantonese. - Cantonese.

169
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,480
 So it's been even longer for our English congregation.

170
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,600
 So if you don't know yet,

171
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,960
 Pastor Jennifer, she's one of the pastors in Wan Chai.

172
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,960
 If you don't know yet,

173
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,600
 we do have a church also called The Vine in Wan Chai.

174
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,640
 They planted us.

175
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,840
 So we, yes, we're one church,

176
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,440
 but in two different locations,

177
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,480
 and that's why we can invite our Wan Chai pastors

178
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,680
 to come and preach occasionally.

179
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,440
 So why don't we stretch our hands to Pastor Jennifer?

180
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,960
 Let's pray for her.

181
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,880
 Father, we thank you for Pastor Jennifer,

182
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,720
 for who she is,

183
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,720
 for her heart to bring your word to your people.

184
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,720
 And so today, Father, we just pray

185
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,560
 that you would speak through her loud and clear.

186
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,240
 You would bring forth this message

187
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,800
 through not just her lips,

188
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,440
 but also through who she is, her whole being.

189
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,200
 And we pray that you would anoint our ears

190
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,880
 to listen to this message,

191
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,120
 to follow your word.

192
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,840
 In Jesus' name we pray.

193
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,680
 - Amen. - Amen.

194
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,960
 - Thank you, Chapman.

195
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,360
 Good to see you all, and happy Father's Day.

196
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,360
 And I hope you guys will enjoy celebrating Father's Day.

197
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,240
 So why don't I just start off

198
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,400
 with telling a little bit about my father.

199
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,160
 So if I have to describe my dad,

200
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,320
 he has always been a very handy person.

201
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,880
 He likes assembling things at home.

202
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,200
 He likes fixing things.

203
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,400
 Sometimes when I leave home,

204
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,160
 go to work and go back home,

205
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,680
 something is fixed in my room,

206
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,560
 and that's amazing, right?

207
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,560
 So growing up, he has been helping me a lot in that area.

208
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,880
 But on the other hand,

209
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,760
 when he sees me doing things like that,

210
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,800
 maybe screwing things at home,

211
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,640
 maybe opening a can or opening a coconut,

212
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,320
 he will say, "Why are you so foolish

213
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,200
 "that you are doing it in a wrong way,

214
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,120
 "wasting all your energy to do that?

215
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,320
 "Let me do it."

216
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,560
 And then I'm like, "Okay, sure."

217
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,400
 And I'm a happy fool since at the end he would help me

218
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,600
 and I don't need to do that stuff.

219
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,240
 But it's not always a happy experience

220
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,000
 to be called foolish, right?

221
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,720
 I wonder how would you feel

222
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,200
 when someone call you foolish in any occasion?

223
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,840
 And why am I starting off like this?

224
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,840
 Because as we continue to read Galatians together,

225
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,640
 in chapter three is our today's passage,

226
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,080
 Paul starts off with calling the Galatians foolish.

227
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,720
 And like when Paul,

228
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,840
 like last time we went,

229
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,520
 Tim went through the chapter two with us

230
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,440
 and like saying that we die to a new way to live.

231
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,600
 And Paul continues to explain

232
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,560
 what's the new way to live by the Holy Spirit.

233
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,000
 So Paul was calling them foolish

234
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,600
 because they neglect the Holy Spirit

235
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,720
 and make a confrontation to them.

236
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,200
 So this is the passage that we're going through.

237
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,720
 So let's take a deeper look

238
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,000
 into first one to five in chapter three.

239
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 So, "You foolish Galatians who has bewitched you.

240
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,160
 "It was before your eyes

241
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:14,160
 "that Jesus Christ was publicly exhibited and as crucified.

242
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,600
 "The only thing I want to learn from you is this.

243
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,880
 "Did you receive the Spirit by doing the works of law

244
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,520
 "or by believing what you heard?

245
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,080
 "Are you so foolish?

246
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,560
 "Having started with the Spirit,

247
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,360
 "are you now ending with the flesh?

248
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,840
 "Did you experience so much for nothing?

249
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,560
 "If it really was for nothing,

250
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,360
 "well then, does God supply you with the Spirit

251
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,640
 "and work miracles among you

252
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,800
 "by your doing the works of law

253
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,360
 "or by your believing what you heard?"

254
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,800
 So we see that Paul is asking the Galatians

255
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,320
 many questions in one go

256
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,960
 and then like, oh, we're in trouble

257
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,480
 if someone speaks to us like that.

258
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,480
 But as we know that when Paul is writing a letter,

259
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,760
 he is always addressing some issues in a church.

260
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:15,120
 So in this passage, we see from the questions that he asks,

261
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,040
 Paul is addressing the issue of legalism.

262
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,560
 He is arguing against a belief that the Spirit

263
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,000
 is received by doing the works of law.

264
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,120
 And so that we know that there were teachings

265
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,520
 in Galatians perhaps that Christians need

266
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,800
 to observe the Jewish law

267
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,840
 and maybe they need to get circumcised as well.

268
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,280
 So to address this belief,

269
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,440
 Paul is asking the Christians in Galatia

270
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,480
 to recall the experience.

271
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,840
 Like actually, how did you receive the Spirit

272
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,000
 in the beginning?

273
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,720
 Maybe that's the questions for us too.

274
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,040
 How did we receive at the beginning?

275
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:01,040
 And so we see that Paul assumes that we should know

276
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,640
 that we receive the Holy Spirit by our believing in Jesus,

277
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,360
 not by the works of law, right?

278
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,360
 And which is very critical to both Galatians and to us all.

279
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,640
 We must understand that the Spirit,

280
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,500
 the Holy Spirit is given to all the believers

281
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,480
 from the day we believe in Jesus

282
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,720
 instead of what we have done.

283
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,480
 In other words, we can never earn the Holy Spirit.

284
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,620
 It is by the grace of God that we receive Him.

285
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,400
 And it is the intention of God

286
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,120
 to send the Holy Spirit to us as well

287
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,880
 as what Jesus said in John,

288
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,000
 the Holy Spirit, he called him as a helper

289
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,720
 which is sent to us.

290
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,880
 As we start living as Christians,

291
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,120
 like when we recall our very first experience

292
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,040
 as a Christian, we don't know what to do, right?

293
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,660
 We don't know as Christians how we should act,

294
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:02,100
 how we should pray, how we should have our relationship

295
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,320
 with Jesus and with other people.

296
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,560
 So that's why God sent us a helper to do that,

297
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,840
 to give us guidance.

298
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,340
 Maybe like when we start this new way of living,

299
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:17,560
 the Holy Spirit does not only give us guidance

300
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,100
 and also the strength, the energy,

301
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,560
 whatever we need when we are in this spiritual journey.

302
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,340
 So isn't it amazing, right?

303
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,460
 Having the Holy Spirit with us.

304
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:31,380
 And so this is why in verse four,

305
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,420
 Paul asked whether they are foolish

306
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,700
 because we already have the Spirit, right?

307
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,860
 Are you still doing the works of flaw?

308
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:42,860
 And this is also the meaning of like finishing by the flesh,

309
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,860
 which means we are using our energy,

310
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,380
 our strength to try to please God

311
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:53,260
 and try to follow the law, the Jewish law to do our work.

312
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:58,260
 And so, Paul is speaking against those

313
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:04,640
 who try to operate their faith through the works of law.

314
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:09,100
 This was what happened before God sent the Holy Spirit

315
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,900
 and the Jewish people,

316
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,780
 they needed to follow the laws as a community.

317
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:18,860
 Indeed, the law give us guidance on how we live,

318
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,460
 but we need to operate with our own strength.

319
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,220
 Like the law is there, but we need to use our strength,

320
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,500
 use our understanding to understand them

321
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,540
 and use our strength to follow them as well.

322
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:33,980
 And we see here, like comparing to the new way

323
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,540
 that we have received the Holy Spirit,

324
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,300
 the Holy Spirit will give us the guidance

325
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,880
 and give us the strength to follow the will of God.

326
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,140
 The old way is we see the laws,

327
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,580
 but we use our own strength to follow it.

328
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:51,260
 This is the comparison that Paul is trying to do.

329
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:55,500
 So we might wonder what is wrong,

330
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,300
 like by observing the law,

331
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,860
 the law is given by God himself, right?

332
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:07,340
 So I would say, indeed, the law is written and given by God,

333
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:12,180
 but the law is not God himself.

334
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,160
 But the Holy Spirit is.

335
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:20,160
 And there's always limitation in legal writing or in law

336
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,560
 because they are limited by the context and culture.

337
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,360
 Just imagine back in those days,

338
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,320
 they won't know what is aviation law.

339
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:33,640
 They won't know what is IT or internet security.

340
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,320
 That is a limitation in the law

341
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,600
 because we can't understand the law

342
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,940
 without culture and without situation.

343
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:45,160
 So maybe it's a little bit vague to understand that.

344
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,200
 So let me share an example

345
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,960
 when I worked in the legal industry.

346
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,960
 So before I started working as a staff at the fine,

347
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,880
 I was a paralegal in our company.

348
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,000
 So that means I worked for a legal department.

349
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,120
 Most of my colleagues, they don't have a legal background.

350
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,720
 So only myself and the lawyer, we have the legal background

351
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,560
 and we kind of oversee the legal issues

352
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,320
 of the whole company.

353
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,320
 So apart from reviewing all the contracts we need to do,

354
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:24,000
 one of the major duty of us

355
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,640
 were to review the internal policies

356
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,440
 and to train my colleagues on this knowledge

357
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,600
 and why they need to follow that policies.

358
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,560
 So my company has a Asian background.

359
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,020
 I won't say which region so that you can't guess.

360
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:47,120
 But yeah, and then I was reviewing and writing the policy

361
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,760
 for privacy and personal data.

362
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,720
 And then I need to do a training with them as well.

363
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,720
 So as Asians, sometimes we might not be super sensitive

364
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,960
 about respecting people's personal life

365
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,480
 or maybe we ask questions about family

366
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,240
 without noticing that they might not feel comfortable

367
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,240
 with sharing with that.

368
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,400
 That was the situation of my company among my colleagues.

369
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,840
 So that's why I needed to write that policy

370
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,640
 and try to educate them.

371
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,320
 So when I was doing the training with them,

372
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,800
 I share like, oh, we need to respect other people's privacy.

373
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,680
 So if people are not very comfortable with sharing,

374
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,640
 like try not to ask them too personal questions

375
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,240
 or don't expect that they must answer you,

376
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,000
 your question regarding their privacy.

377
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,280
 And also you need to know that you also have a right

378
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,560
 not to tell other people about your privacy as well.

379
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:46,280
 I think I was like doing my best to explain that to them

380
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,920
 and try to make it very clear with all the examples.

381
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,400
 And then after the training, I asked them like,

382
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,720
 so what's about the new policy?

383
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,920
 And then they said, so I can never ask people's privacy.

384
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,760
 Right?

385
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,600
 And I'm like, oh gosh, why?

386
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,920
 But I really learned a lot how people,

387
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,080
 how human learn about this stuff,

388
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,920
 because not everyone is a professional on legal knowledge

389
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:16,920
 that I need to explain it in a way that other people can,

390
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,080
 like they people can understand.

391
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,480
 And then I realized like, it's a very much a human tendency

392
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,560
 that we reduce something as a concept

393
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,520
 to something that what we should do

394
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,200
 or what we should not do.

395
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,600
 It is way easier for people to understand like that.

396
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,120
 And this can happen to our faith as Christians as well.

397
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,840
 Sometimes we might just reduce God's wills

398
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,120
 to some laws or rules and be satisfied

399
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,640
 with following instructions in our faith journey.

400
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,400
 And which is why Paul is trying to write this letter

401
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,760
 to the Galatians.

402
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,800
 So going back to Paul's argument,

403
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,240
 the law itself is not bad.

404
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:08,240
 However, if our faith is operated through observing the law,

405
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,960
 we are going backward.

406
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,200
 We are going back to the old way.

407
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,840
 And this is the issues that concerns him.

408
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,960
 So how do we not continue our faith with our flesh

409
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,680
 is somewhat like the important questions

410
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,080
 that we need to explore today.

411
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,920
 I would say first thing, we need to acknowledge

412
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:32,920
 that our faith is never about just obeying the laws

413
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,280
 or living a restricted life.

414
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,120
 And, but it is a relationship with God.

415
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,640
 We live a life which is centered by God.

416
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,880
 And we do not maintain any type of relationship

417
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,280
 just by following instructions or laws, right?

418
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,680
 Instead, we need to understand the person.

419
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,800
 We need to understand God's.

420
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,360
 Thinking God's will and God's heart for us,

421
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,720
 which was the original purpose of the law.

422
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,360
 It allows us to understand God a little bit

423
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,640
 and what pleases him.

424
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,640
 Like what is it look like to be living as a God's people,

425
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,040
 as a community together.

426
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:24,040
 But let's bear in mind that God did not give his spirit

427
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,720
 before Jesus resurrected.

428
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,080
 So it only happened after the resurrection of Jesus.

429
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,000
 Imagine that like there was no law at all given by Moses.

430
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,560
 God just tell them like, you need to love me

431
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,440
 with all your heart or your mind and love your neighbor.

432
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,360
 And this very ambiguous, right?

433
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,360
 Just by hearing that maybe there are

434
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,960
 1 million different interpretations on this commandment,

435
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,320
 how to love God.

436
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,680
 So there was a purpose of the laws

437
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,320
 to give us a little bit more details

438
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,640
 in a more concrete way that how we exactly,

439
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,120
 what we can do to love God and love our neighbor

440
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,120
 as a community of God's people.

441
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:15,400
 So, but now we have, and the Galatians

442
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,520
 have received the spirit.

443
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,040
 And the spirit is God himself.

444
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,720
 So receiving the spirit means that he himself

445
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,920
 can give us the guidance, he himself can teach us

446
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,840
 on how exactly we can understand his will

447
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,560
 according to each person's journey, right?

448
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,840
 Each person will understand him in a different way,

449
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,000
 interact him with a different way.

450
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,600
 So why would the Christians ignore the Holy Spirit

451
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,800
 and try to please him with our own effort

452
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,800
 to observe the laws and with our own strength?

453
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,840
 So Paul gives us a little bit more explanation

454
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,720
 on this area.

455
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,760
 So let's continue to read the passage

456
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,520
 from verse six to verse 14.

457
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:09,000
 Just as Abraham believed God,

458
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,560
 and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.

459
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,960
 So you see, those who believe

460
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,800
 are the descendants of Abraham.

461
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,520
 And the scripture, for seeing that God would justify

462
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:26,960
 the Gentiles by faith, declared the gospel beforehand

463
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,400
 to Abraham, saying, "All the Gentiles

464
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,080
 "shall be blessed in you."

465
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,520
 For this reason, those who believe

466
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,240
 are blessed with Abraham who believed.

467
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:44,160
 For all who rely on the works of law are under a curse,

468
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,520
 for it is written, "Cursed is everyone

469
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,040
 "who does not observe and obey all the things

470
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,320
 "written in the book of the law."

471
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:58,360
 Now it is evident that no one is justified

472
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,880
 before God by the law, for the one who is righteous

473
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,120
 will live by faith.

474
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,520
 But the law does not rest on faith.

475
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,520
 On the contrary, whoever does the works of law

476
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,520
 will live by them.

477
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,720
 Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law

478
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,360
 by becoming a curse for us.

479
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,440
 For it is written, "Cursed is everyone

480
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,640
 "who hangs on a tree."

481
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,360
 In order that in Christ Jesus,

482
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,960
 the blessing of Abraham might come to Gentiles

483
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,920
 so that we might receive the promise

484
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,120
 of the spirit through faith.

485
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,160
 It is a little bit long and complicated,

486
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,600
 but I will try to make it simple for us all

487
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,040
 to understand this passage.

488
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,640
 So Paul quoted Deuteronomy and tried to

489
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,560
 associate relying on the works of law

490
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,120
 with being cursed.

491
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,440
 So this is the first thing he was trying to say.

492
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,920
 But why would Paul say so?

493
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,120
 He himself was a Pharisee, so he was like,

494
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,960
 study the laws as well.

495
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,720
 And I think there are two reasons.

496
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,800
 Firstly, if we are familiar with the law,

497
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,360
 with the Mosaic law, Jewish law,

498
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,920
 we know that it would be impossible

499
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,680
 to obey all the things written in the book of law, right?

500
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,640
 I think we all agree that it is impossible

501
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,520
 to just observe all the laws written in the Bible.

502
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:28,520
 And so if we rely our faith on doing the works of law,

503
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:32,680
 we will never be righteous before God.

504
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,040
 And we are still in the condition

505
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,640
 that we are not redeemed yet.

506
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,680
 And secondly, and which is more importantly,

507
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,480
 if we rely on the works of law,

508
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:47,160
 behind that it is a mindset that we believe

509
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:52,120
 that we are sufficient before God by obeying his law.

510
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,960
 And we believe that we are capable

511
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,480
 to be righteous with our own effort.

512
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,760
 Eventually, pride will be developed in this mindset,

513
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:07,760
 which is why Paul says, ending with the flesh in verse three.

514
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,520
 But the reality is we can never be righteous before God

515
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,280
 with our own effort as humans.

516
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:21,160
 And again, Paul is comparing this mindset with the faith

517
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:25,360
 and used Abraham as an example in the scripture.

518
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,840
 So Paul says, Abraham believed God

519
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:32,920
 and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.

520
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:36,640
 So Abraham is not righteous or blameless

521
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,240
 from what he has done.

522
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,800
 When we read Genesis, we will see that Abraham

523
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,520
 has done something immoral as well.

524
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,520
 He had lied to the Pharaoh that Sarah is his sister

525
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,520
 so that he can preserve his life.

526
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,560
 And also from his family dynamic,

527
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:01,560
 he has done things that make the situation very complicated

528
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:06,720
 and both Sarah and Hagar and also the two sons suffered.

529
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,920
 But God does not reckon him righteous

530
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:15,480
 because he handled everything perfectly, blamelessly,

531
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,760
 but it is his faith.

532
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,720
 We see that whenever God speaks to Abraham,

533
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,720
 he is willing to obey and he is willing to do the commands

534
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,360
 that God has given him,

535
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,640
 like even though he might not understand

536
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:36,280
 why he needs to do that, including sacrificing Isaac.

537
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,640
 So we see that this is how faith operates.

538
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,480
 It's not about being perfect or blameless before God,

539
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,640
 but it is our faith just to follow God

540
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,960
 whenever he speaks to us and obey him

541
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,960
 whenever he give us the guidance

542
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,400
 or the direction that we need to follow.

543
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:02,520
 So, and now we are also justified by God, just like Abraham.

544
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,160
 And we are called to be the descendants of Abraham

545
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,520
 and be blessed with Abraham.

546
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:14,480
 Now we may wonder what does it mean by being blessed?

547
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,080
 So let's look at Isaiah chapter 43, verse three,

548
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,160
 and it will give a little bit ideas

549
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,960
 on what it means to be blessed.

550
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:28,320
 So first three of Isaiah chapter 44,

551
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,800
 for I will pour water on the thirsty land

552
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,520
 and streams of the dry ground.

553
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:38,560
 I will pour out my spirit on your offspring

554
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,120
 and my blessing on your descendants.

555
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,320
 So from Isaiah, we see that scriptures

556
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,840
 actually links Abraham's blessings

557
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,880
 and the pouring out of the spirit.

558
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,600
 So which means the promise has already come.

559
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,480
 And before the promise has come,

560
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,200
 Jesus, no, before Jesus has redeemed us,

561
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,920
 we are cursed by the law, but now the promise has come.

562
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:13,520
 We are blessed and also we have received the Holy Spirit.

563
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,240
 So why would a redeemed person

564
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,040
 would want to go back to the cursed life?

565
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,360
 He has made the Holy Spirit

566
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,360
 for whoever believes him to receive.

567
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,280
 And receiving the Holy Spirit means

568
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:31,520
 he is teaching us what is right, what is wrong himself.

569
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,080
 And he is teaching us to how to live a life

570
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,080
 that glorifies him as well.

571
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:41,160
 This is very important as we continue in our faith journey.

572
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:49,160
 So indeed, no, as we continue to operate our life

573
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,520
 by doing the works of law,

574
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,120
 we are not continuing our faith journey

575
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,000
 without faith in Jesus.

576
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 Instead, we need to today live under the conviction

577
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,240
 of the Holy Spirit.

578
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,400
 This is the new way that we live.

579
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:11,480
 But I mean, it might seem a little bit distant to us.

580
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,640
 For us today in Hong Kong, we might not observe the...

581
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,320
 I think most of us won't, right?

582
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,640
 We do not, right?

583
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,680
 We eat pork, right?

584
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,240
 And we will not believe that we can be blameless before God

585
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,080
 just by observing the laws of Hong Kong, right?

586
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,960
 Because it is not written by God.

587
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,720
 So we might not be super, like,

588
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:40,720
 find it relevant to ourself to observe the law,

589
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,960
 comparing with our faith.

590
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,800
 But the works of law can appear differently to us today.

591
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,960
 Legalism and pride of believing we are sufficient

592
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,520
 before God can appear other than the works of law.

593
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,360
 For example, maybe following the Christian's customs

594
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:06,160
 or traditions, or following people's expectations

595
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,280
 on how we define a good Christian,

596
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,720
 or like just to maintain our faith

597
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,640
 by our spiritual discipline.

598
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,880
 These could be the works of law looks like today.

599
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,400
 For example, when we come to Sunday service

600
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:26,400
 or CG every week, we pray and do our devotion every day

601
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,640
 or doing our tithe every month.

602
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,960
 These are the things that we do as Christians, right?

603
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:36,600
 And these things also form us as a Christian community

604
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,640
 and are the importance for us to do.

605
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:43,440
 But it will be an issue that we believe

606
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,440
 doing all those things equals to our faith.

607
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:53,000
 As I said before, our faith is not just only doing things

608
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,800
 or following some instructions by our pastors

609
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,000
 or by the law, by the Bible.

610
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 It is like by our conviction, by the Holy Spirit.

611
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:10,280
 And if we are just following, like,

612
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,480
 the human definitions of a good Christian,

613
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,720
 we can start feeling that we are sufficient before God.

614
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:22,720
 We are like good children of God

615
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,000
 by just doing these things.

616
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,400
 And we start to feel good because what we do

617
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,560
 matches the category of what a Christian looks like

618
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:35,080
 and forget that we need the work of the Holy Spirit

619
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,560
 in us and among us.

620
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:40,440
 It almost feel like maybe we have a to-do list

621
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,280
 as a Christians.

622
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,840
 We checked when we go to Sunday service.

623
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,440
 We checked when we pray tonight.

624
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:51,440
 But if we are just doing that to maintain our image

625
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,360
 as a Christian, we are turning away

626
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,160
 from living under the Holy Spirit's conviction

627
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,800
 and to fulfill just the items on our to-do list.

628
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,520
 And again, I'm not saying that if the Holy Spirit in us,

629
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,720
 we don't need to pray at all.

630
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,560
 We don't need to go to a Sunday service.

631
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,840
 Not like that.

632
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,480
 But more of our perspective of seeing them

633
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,880
 and how we position them.

634
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:20,280
 All the things we do will help us to know the heart of God

635
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:24,440
 and also to help us to grow spiritually in Him

636
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,520
 and be more like Jesus.

637
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,240
 But ultimately, it is the Holy Spirit and God

638
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,480
 who make us grow and bring changes in our lives.

639
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,960
 So as we grow to get to know Jesus better,

640
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,640
 we know our faith is more than just doing

641
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,040
 the spiritual things in our life.

642
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,840
 But whatever we do, we do them for Jesus.

643
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,080
 And our whole life is oriented to Jesus.

644
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,760
 This is the ideal world of our faith.

645
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,480
 But sometimes we might feel that we need to use

646
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,280
 our own strength because I'm too busy.

647
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:01,200
 I don't know what I'm even doing in my work and family.

648
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,200
 And I just need to use my own strength

649
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,160
 to continue to follow Jesus.

650
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:10,160
 And forgetting about being convicted by the Holy Spirit,

651
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:14,840
 forgetting about our daily conversation

652
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,280
 and relationship with Him.

653
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,920
 And I have those days too.

654
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:21,520
 I have busy days that I might just forget.

655
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,320
 And using our strength to just push through

656
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,880
 in my faith as well.

657
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,640
 And I want to share my story.

658
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,040
 A few years ago when I was still in seminary.

659
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,480
 So I might have shared my story that I got rejected

660
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,560
 by seminary to do a full-time program.

661
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,520
 And then it was the time that I felt very lost

662
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,160
 and I don't know what I'm doing.

663
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:49,080
 And I don't want to continue my part-time study

664
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,000
 as I got rejected by my seminary already.

665
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,160
 But since I am still going to church,

666
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,840
 I need to be accountable.

667
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,560
 I need to explain to my pastors and my peers

668
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,520
 that what am I doing.

669
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,520
 So I've decided I just continue my study

670
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,960
 because I want to maintain my image as a good Christian.

671
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,120
 So that's what I did.

672
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,240
 Even though I was struggling,

673
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,040
 I still go to school every week.

674
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:16,160
 I try to follow what the professors were saying.

675
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:19,400
 But I was really struggling.

676
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,400
 So I couldn't really start writing one of my papers

677
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,560
 in my course.

678
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,960
 So I have two choices at that time.

679
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,440
 I can either ask my professor

680
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,320
 to give me an extension of the deadline

681
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,560
 or I drop the course.

682
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,400
 So I was struggling.

683
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,640
 I would just, like, according to my profession,

684
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,200
 I was still in law at that time,

685
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,640
 I would just drop it because I've missed the deadline.

686
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,120
 There's no way for me to make me feel good

687
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,960
 to continue and ask for an extension.

688
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,800
 But the Holy Spirit convicted me the other way.

689
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,160
 So I unwillingly, I opened my email

690
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,560
 and then I emailed my professor.

691
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,800
 I still remember how I emailed him.

692
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,360
 So usually you will try to explain,

693
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,600
 I'm too busy these days,

694
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:06,560
 can you give me so and so days of extension

695
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,520
 so that I can submit my paper, right?

696
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,800
 So my email looks like this.

697
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,080
 Oh, hi, professor.

698
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,520
 I have no excuse at all.

699
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,560
 It's purely my poor time management,

700
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,480
 but I couldn't meet the deadline.

701
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,480
 Would you grant two days of extension of the deadline to me?

702
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,960
 And I was like, I was struggling.

703
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,280
 Who would he grant me?

704
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,440
 Like, it's such a bad email and without any excuse

705
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,800
 to ask for an extension and ask for some grace, right?

706
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,480
 But after a few minutes,

707
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,560
 the professor replied me with two words,

708
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,960
 extension granted.

709
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,160
 So I was like, wow, you're so gracious.

710
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,600
 So I spent the next two days to just finish the paper,

711
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,440
 to turn it in, and then it takes a while

712
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,160
 for the paper to get back to us, right,

713
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,320
 for the grace and marked paper.

714
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,960
 So after a few months,

715
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:59,640
 I got my paper back with my professor's grading.

716
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:04,080
 So I opened the paper and it has an A on it.

717
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,720
 So I was like, does my professor forget

718
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,680
 that he needs to give me a great penalty because I'm late?

719
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,840
 So I was about to pull up my email again

720
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,800
 and ask him if he forgets to do that.

721
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:20,200
 But I heard a voice saying to me,

722
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,720
 Jennifer, seriously, must you do that?

723
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:29,720
 And I was very embarrassed at the moment.

724
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,880
 I was in school in the library

725
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,040
 and I realized what I have been doing

726
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,240
 in the whole semester on this,

727
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,640
 especially on this matter is I just try to use

728
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:45,120
 my own strength, my own judgment to continue my faith

729
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:50,120
 without recognizing we are under the grace of God.

730
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,640
 And I even tried to reject his grace.

731
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,240
 You know how stupid I was,

732
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,680
 how foolish I was if I'm using Paul's term.

733
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:04,560
 And I think sometimes when we are like continue

734
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,040
 our faith journey, these days will come.

735
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,120
 Like we think that it's all our responsibility

736
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,440
 to follow God, to do certain things

737
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,040
 and to be good in front of him and forget

738
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:20,320
 that the grace of God is the most important things

739
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,760
 in our faith.

740
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,840
 So, but I'm not saying that we don't need

741
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,080
 to make effort at all.

742
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:29,160
 We don't need to do good works at all.

743
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:34,160
 But we should still give our best in whatever we do.

744
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,280
 But like I said before, these good works

745
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,560
 do not give us life or bring us salvation.

746
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:46,280
 It is the spirit in us that brings us life.

747
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,880
 So instead of attempting to earn the salvation

748
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,080
 through the good works and using our own strength

749
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,600
 to maintain our spiritual life,

750
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,920
 it is the other way around.

751
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:01,760
 Our good works should fall out of the conviction

752
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,760
 by the Holy Spirit in us.

753
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,880
 So I wonder what does it mean to be convicted

754
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,120
 by the Holy Spirit to you personally

755
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:14,120
 in your spiritual journey with Jesus?

756
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:17,160
 And is there any area that you are trying

757
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:21,760
 to use your own strength or own effort to please God?

758
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:28,160
 And you might wonder how do we live a life

759
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,760
 relying on the Holy Spirit instead of our own strength,

760
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,840
 right?

761
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:36,160
 Again, our faith is about our relationship with God,

762
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,640
 how we listen and speak to God daily

763
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,920
 and submit to his will when he speaks to us.

764
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,600
 But first, we need to be sensitive

765
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:50,400
 about how the Holy Spirit speak to us and convict us.

766
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,080
 I would say if you are familiar

767
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,960
 how the Holy Spirit convict you and speak to you,

768
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,640
 please continue to make room for that to happen

769
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,840
 in your spiritual life.

770
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,800
 But if you are not familiar, you're like,

771
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,760
 I am still not sure how God speaks to us

772
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,640
 and how the Holy Spirit convicts me,

773
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,080
 I would have a little bit of suggestion

774
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,600
 on how you can do that and practice that.

775
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:18,200
 But again, it is your personal journey with the Holy Spirit.

776
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,840
 It might look different to each person,

777
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,440
 but it always starts with time,

778
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,800
 spending time with the Holy Spirit,

779
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,200
 spend time to listen to him.

780
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,840
 So I would say when you are doing your daily work

781
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,680
 or with your family, when you have a time,

782
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:39,200
 just ask the Holy Spirit how you can see his work

783
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,800
 and how you can minister his love to the people around you.

784
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,160
 Every day when you have time,

785
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,480
 it could be when you are commuting to work

786
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:51,520
 or when you are making tea in your pantry

787
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,200
 or when you are having a break with your kids

788
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,400
 or even when you're working,

789
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:01,400
 when you remember, ask him how you can see

790
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,240
 God's work moving around you

791
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:07,840
 and how you can minister his love to the people around you.

792
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:11,920
 And the second thing is when you feel you need to pray

793
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,240
 or when you see a need,

794
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:17,240
 maybe it's a person in your workspace or your children,

795
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,920
 pray immediately, even when you're working.

796
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,800
 Don't leave it to my midnight prayer before bed

797
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,040
 because you will forget about it.

798
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,200
 It is not only for remembering his sake,

799
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,560
 but also to invite the Holy Spirit

800
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,680
 to all your aspects to your life.

801
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,160
 So whenever you felt led,

802
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,240
 you feel there's a need, pray immediately.

803
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:43,240
 And again, it is really about your personal wisdom

804
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:48,360
 and relationship with the Holy Spirit.

805
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,600
 And I hope that by daily practice,

806
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,400
 you will eventually get to a point

807
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,600
 that you are familiar with his voice.

808
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:59,000
 You are familiar with how the Holy Spirit will configure you.

809
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,320
 And there's not a shortcut to be sensitive.

810
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,800
 I cannot do that overnight,

811
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,440
 but it is really needs time to practice.

812
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,040
 So as we're closing today,

813
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:13,040
 may I invite you to stand and I would like to pray for us.

814
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:25,080
 As Paul starts, he asks us not to be foolish,

815
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:28,360
 to just use our own strength,

816
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,480
 our own effort to please God

817
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,840
 and to continue our faith journey.

818
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,760
 And, but the reality is we might not,

819
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,200
 we sometimes we're busy and we just forget

820
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,760
 about the conviction or to forget about,

821
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,240
 to spend time with the Holy Spirit.

822
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:54,280
 So I was preparing this sermon these two weeks.

823
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:58,520
 My schedule was very packed and I didn't know

824
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:02,560
 whether I can really finish it

825
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,680
 or whether I can understand the passage well enough.

826
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,920
 And as I was preparing, I was reminded that

827
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,200
 maybe this is the perfect message for you to prepare.

828
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,960
 This is not about just my own strength or own time,

829
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:22,280
 own understanding of God's word, of God's will,

830
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:26,800
 but to depend on the Holy Spirit

831
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,160
 to explain the passage to me, to help me to prepare

832
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,840
 and even to give me strength to continue.

833
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,360
 So I wonder, like, is there any area of your life

834
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:42,080
 you felt very overwhelmed or you're too busy

835
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:47,080
 to be inviting the Holy Spirit in?

836
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:52,760
 If there's anything comes up to your mind,

837
00:42:52,760 --> 00:43:00,000
 let's bring us, let's bring these issues to God right now.

838
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,720
 Let's spend a little bit time to quiet our heart

839
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,560
 and speak to the Holy Spirit.

840
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:30,920
 Yeah, Jesus, we thank you that you have come

841
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,960
 and saved us from the curse by trying to be

842
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,880
 good in front of you, trying to be perfect in front of you.

843
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:48,400
 We thank you that you have sent the Holy Spirit to us

844
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:53,120
 to help us and guide us in our journey of following you.

845
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:56,920
 And it is not always easy to do that.

846
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:02,800
 And Jesus, I just lift up all that we have prayed just now

847
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:08,320
 there are maybe some areas that we forget

848
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:12,680
 to invite you to help us and to invite,

849
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:15,640
 to let your Holy Spirit to work among us.

850
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:19,640
 We now lift them up to you.

851
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:24,640
 May your spirit continue to conflict us in those areas.

852
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:31,320
 And I pray that your voice will be louder than other voices,

853
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,320
 will be louder than our business

854
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:37,840
 and louder with the voices that we hear

855
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,920
 from the earth or from other people.

856
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:45,920
 So Holy Spirit, we invite you to every aspect of our life.

857
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:54,720
 And I invite you to give us guidance and strength

858
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,040
 to do whatever we do.

859
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:02,200
 And we pray that we will live a life that glorifies you.

860
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,560
 And we live a life that depends on you

861
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:08,840
 because this is your intention to come

862
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,320
 and help us to follow you.

863
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:16,240
 Let us not to be foolish in your eyes.

864
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:20,800
 Let us depend on you.

865
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:29,080
 And we thank you for what you have already done in our life.

866
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,680
 We thank you for your goodness.

867
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,520
 We thank you for how you have been leading us

868
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,240
 and guiding us.

869
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:39,480
 And we invite you as one church, as one community

870
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:43,840
 that you will continue to work among us.

871
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,640
 And we pray in Jesus' name.

872
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,720
 Amen.
