[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560]   - Amen, hey, can we thank our worship team
[00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.800]   for just the way they serve.
[00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.340]   Have a seat, have a seat.
[00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.600]   Welcome to the Vine.
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.600]   If you're relatively new with us,
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.120]   my name's Andrew, I'm one of the pastors here.
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.860]   I'm so glad that you're a part of this.
[00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.360]   And we've been in a long series in the book of Exodus.
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.240]   And last week we got to the midpoint
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.440]   of the whole of the book of Exodus, chapters 19 and 20.
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.280]   And in chapters 19 and 20, we see a very important moment
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.480]   that Israel, who have been now set free
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.320]   from the slavery of their past,
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.400]   they now come to God's presence at Mount Sinai.
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.200]   And as they come to God's presence at Mount Sinai,
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.160]   they come into that presence and they realize
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.360]   that all that God has done for them
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.360]   is to bring them to himself.
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.160]   And just like we've been experiencing in worship
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.400]   and just praying just a moment ago
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.400]   that God has done all of that work of liberation,
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.080]   who's come and done the plagues and provided for his people
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.880]   and brought them into his presence,
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.680]   because in his presence, he wants to now speak to them.
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.920]   And what we saw last week was something fascinating
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.480]   that although Israel was now free
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.240]   and were at the presence of God in the mountain,
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.240]   at Mount Sinai, they had a serious issue.
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.480]   And their serious issue was,
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.860]   despite the reality that they were free,
[00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.600]   they had no idea who they were.
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.080]   And God comes to them and says, I've shown you who I am.
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.380]   Now it's time for you to discover who you are.
[00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.360]   And we saw last week that the primary thing
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.920]   that slavery does to all of us,
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.120]   whether that's slavery to sin, slavery to our brokenness,
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.800]   slavery to our past, whatever it is,
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.640]   whatever it is that is enslaving our heart,
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.400]   enslaving our minds, causing us anxiety and stress,
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.240]   whatever that is,
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.100]   it is designed to strip your identity from you.
[00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.280]   The very definition of slavery,
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.840]   when people are trying to enslave people,
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.640]   what they try to do is strip the identity
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.040]   of that person away from them.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.760]   So they have no choice.
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.560]   They have no freedom of expression,
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.040]   their freedom of thought.
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.280]   They're forced to do just what the other person
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.160]   tells them to do.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.280]   And Israel has had that for 200 years.
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.800]   And now they've come to Mount Sinai.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.040]   And they're like, we have no idea who we are
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.720]   because everything has been stripped from us.
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.680]   And we said last week that that's the reality
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.440]   for so many of us in this room as well.
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.960]   That just freeing ourselves from sin
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.280]   as Christ does on the cross
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.560]   means that we're now in a identity vacuum.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.360]   And we're now trying to go, okay, who am I now to be?
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.480]   I know I'm free, but what am I being created free to do?
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.960]   And everything in chapters 19 and 20 of Exodus
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.640]   is God coming to his people and going,
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.800]   this is what you're free for.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.160]   This is now who you are.
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.240]   This is how I now want you to live.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.240]   And he speaks to them about his character
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.520]   that he's placed in them.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.480]   And the first thing that happens, as we saw last week
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.720]   with Moses on Mount Sinai in chapter 19,
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.500]   is God says, here are two things
[00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.440]   that you need to know about yourself.
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.320]   You're a kingdom of priests and you're a holy nation.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.160]   And this dual idea of being a kingdom of priests
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.840]   and a holy nation forms the foundation of Israel's identity
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.280]   but also our identity as well.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.120]   When God speaks about being this idea
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.960]   of a kingdom of priests,
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.940]   the priest really had three functions.
[00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.780]   It was to connect God and the world together.
[00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.880]   They were the ones that interceded and stood in the gap
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.080]   between God and the world.
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.160]   All of the things that they could see happening in the world
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.680]   and they know of God's heart,
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.200]   they wanted to see those two things come together.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.720]   The second thing that the priest would do
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.240]   is that they would invite people
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.200]   to come and experience the presence of God.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.760]   They would create an environment
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.600]   by which people could encounter his presence,
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.280]   knowing that if they could just encounter
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.680]   the presence of God, they would be changed.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.720]   And then the third thing that the priest did
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.580]   is to help them to understand,
[00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.480]   not only is it about being kind of invited
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.400]   into the presence of God,
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.000]   but now we're called to imitate God's character in the world.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.980]   The priests were imitators of the character of God
[00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.840]   so that they could show everyone in the world
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.440]   what God's character and his heart
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.420]   and his love actually looked like.
[00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.040]   So when God says to Moses, here's who you are,
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.440]   you're a kingdom of priests,
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.000]   he's saying, you're a bunch of people
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.360]   that can connect people to God,
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.240]   invite people into his presence,
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.040]   and actually come and do that in a way
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.160]   that imitates the life and the glory
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.800]   and the love and the character of God.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.920]   And then he says, you're a holy nation.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.600]   We saw last week that that meant two primary things.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.240]   It's the idea of being transformed
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.560]   by the power of the spirit of God in us.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.920]   And when we're transformed,
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.440]   we are able to deal with some of that slavery
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.260]   that we carry around with us.
[00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.200]   Some of the faulty thinking that is in our mind,
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.560]   some of the core false beliefs that we hold onto,
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.560]   we're transformed, as the scripture says,
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.800]   by the renewing of our mind.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.080]   The spirit of God transforms us
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.240]   both personally and communally together.
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.180]   But being a holy nation was also about being set apart.
[00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.480]   It was about being set apart for the world,
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.080]   not set apart like be weird in the world,
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.040]   but set apart for the world.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.520]   Not to be a monastery up on a hill that kind of goes,
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.320]   oh, I don't wanna be in that mucky thing called the world.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.600]   Actually, God saves us, creates the church,
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.200]   'cause he wants the church planted in the heart of society,
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.240]   in the heart of the world,
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.940]   and that we would be a community of hope
[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.280]   wrapped around a community of pain.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.640]   That we would be ones who would say,
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.260]   yeah, we're set apart because we wanna offer the world
[00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.360]   an alternative narrative.
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.120]   That where things are stressed and anxious,
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.120]   we can offer peace and hope.
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.920]   When people are angry and violent, we can show another way.
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.440]   Where we can live in such a way
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.980]   that we take the character of God,
[00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.480]   we bring it down to this world,
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.880]   and we say there is another way to live.
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.160]   This is all chapter 19.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.240]   And God says to Israel,
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.120]   this is who you need to know who you are,
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.160]   because I've set you free for a purpose.
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.980]   But the culmination of this comes in chapter 20
[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.920]   that we're looking at today.
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.480]   Because in chapter 20, God takes it a step further.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.000]   He's laid that foundation of priests and holiness,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.020]   but in his presence, he takes it a step further.
[00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.200]   And what he basically says is, look,
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.940]   I've revealed myself through how I've acted amongst you.
[00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.340]   You've seen what I've done,
[00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.280]   and that helps you understand who I am.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.480]   Now I'm gonna speak to you about your actions.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.360]   I'm gonna speak to you about
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.760]   how you should interact with one another,
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.980]   how you should walk with each other,
[00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.160]   how you should be in relationship with me,
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.440]   relationship with yourself,
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.520]   relationship with others, and relationship with the world.
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.520]   And God comes to Moses
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.160]   and does something on the top of Mount Sinai
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:20.980]   that up until that point,
[00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.840]   he had never done before for his people.
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.520]   And the thing that he does changes them forever.
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.200]   The Jewish people today, as well as us Christians,
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.600]   we take so much of who we are
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.880]   in this one moment right here in Exodus 20.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.920]   And to show you what happens in that moment,
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.600]   let me take you back once again
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.900]   to the top of Mount Sinai.
[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:48.480]   (gentle music)
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:07:03.540]   Last episode, we journeyed together
[00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.240]   from the foothills of Mount Sinai
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.440]   right up here to the summit.
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.560]   And we saw Moses's journey in a different light
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.160]   and how difficult it would have been
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.120]   for him to actually make that ascent,
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.160]   but also the call that God had on him
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.280]   to come up here and meet him face to face.
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.920]   But something also happens on the top of the summit
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.760]   that actually reshapes not just Moses's life,
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.240]   but the life and the character of Israel itself.
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.480]   And to help you to understand that a little bit more,
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.520]   I wanna introduce you to a chapel,
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.720]   a chapel that sits on the top of Mount Sinai here,
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.040]   and tell you a little bit
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.740]   about the thing that reshapes God's people.
[00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.320]   In the fourth century, Julian of the Euphrates
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.840]   built a chapel at the peak of Mount Sinai,
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.080]   so worshipers would have a place to shelter
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.680]   and perform religious ceremonies at the very place
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.760]   where God's presence was thought to have been revealed.
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.360]   Later in that same century,
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.740]   the Emperor Justinian ordered the construction
[00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:01.440]   of a three-aisled basilia here at the same site.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.720]   The present chapel of the Holy Trinity,
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.540]   a private Greek Orthodox church,
[00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.000]   was completed in 1935,
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.920]   and now rests at the eastern end of the original complex.
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.100]   It amazes me that right here at the top of Mount Sinai,
[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:18.060]   worshipers can actually gather in a church building
[00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:21.980]   around a priest who is able to perform religious services.
[00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.780]   The chapel itself is truly breathtaking,
[00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:26.940]   and is a powerful reminder of something
[00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:31.280]   that we see right in the text of Exodus 19 and 20.
[00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:38.960]   When God gives Moses the law here on the top of Mount Sinai,
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.440]   it's because he desires to be
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.640]   an intimate relationship with his people.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.960]   He wants his people to come into his presence,
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.040]   and he wants to bring his presence to them.
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.040]   And that's what I love about this Greek Orthodox chapel
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.600]   right here on the summit,
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.240]   because people are still gathering
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.920]   to worship God right in this place.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.600]   This is still the intimate presence of God,
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.680]   and it truly is special just being in here.
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.760]   You know, often we think of the Ten Commandments
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:08.120]   as rules, as boundaries, as a strict law
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.680]   that we're afraid to break, but it's not like that at all.
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.680]   The Ten Commandments was God's way of saying,
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.760]   "I want you to know who I am, and I wanna be your God.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.880]   "I wanna be connected intimately with you."
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.200]   And the chapel here today is still a living legacy
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.440]   to that very moment.
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:33.840]   And here is what is fascinating about all of that.
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.600]   You see, while God had placed some stringent laws
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.880]   about who was allowed to ascend up into his presence,
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.820]   the giving of the law to Moses was God's way of saying,
[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:44.940]   "I want to now descend down the mountain
[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.600]   "and be with my people."
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.920]   It was God saying, "Here is my character,
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:52.120]   "here is my nature, and I don't want all of your life
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.480]   "to be about some mountaintop experience."
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.360]   You see, the Christian life isn't always about ascending
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.760]   up to the top of the mountain with God.
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.000]   Actually, the beauty of the Christian life,
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.320]   seen through the story of the Exodus,
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.680]   is that God has descended the mountain.
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.620]   God has come down with us, and he now meets us
[00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.400]   in the power of his presence in the everyday,
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.660]   even in the mundane things that we struggle with in life,
[00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.040]   God is there.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.880]   And that is why this moment on the top of Mount Sinai
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.280]   for Moses, receiving of the law, is so critical,
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:27.840]   not just for them in history, but right here now.
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.420]   (gentle music)
[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:39.600]   It was a real privilege to be able to get into that chapel.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.200]   It's not actually generally open for tourists.
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.360]   It literally is at the top of Mount Sinai.
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.400]   And it's strictly reserved for those
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:47.480]   of the Greek Orthodox tradition,
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.920]   and they gave us permission to film in there,
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.560]   which I was very grateful for,
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:54.360]   'cause I wanted to show you something of that presence,
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.400]   that holiness, that awe of God in that place.
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:01.720]   And it's in that moment where God draws Moses
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.760]   into his presence, that out of that place of awe
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.560]   and holiness, he speaks these words.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.660]   Let me read you Exodus 20.
[00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:12.080]   And God spoke these words.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.120]   I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt,
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.920]   out of the land of slavery.
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.240]   You shall have no other gods before me.
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.040]   You shall not make yourself an idol
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.560]   in the form of anything in heaven above
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:26.160]   or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.600]   You should not bow down to them or worship them,
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.280]   for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God,
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.080]   punishing the children for the sin of their fathers
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.960]   to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me,
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:39.040]   but showing love to a thousand generations
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:42.080]   of those who love me and keep my commands.
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.640]   You should not misuse the name of your Lord, your God.
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.040]   The Lord will not hold anyone guiltless
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.120]   who misuses his name.
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.000]   Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Six days you shall labor and do all your work,
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.920]   for on the seventh day it's a Sabbath to the Lord your God.
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.560]   On it you shall do no work at all,
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.280]   neither you nor your son or your daughter,
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.540]   nor your manservant, your maidservant, nor your animals,
[00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:05.000]   nor the alien within your gates.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.680]   For in six days the Lord made the heaven and the earth
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.560]   and the sea and all that is in them,
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.320]   but he rested on the seventh day.
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:15.000]   Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.280]   Honor your father and your mother
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.720]   so that you may live long in the land
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.940]   that the Lord your God is giving you.
[00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:26.000]   You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery,
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.680]   and you should not steal.
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.400]   You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor,
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.600]   and you shall not covet your neighbor's house.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.360]   You shall not covet your neighbor's wife
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.640]   or his manservant or maidservant, his ox or donkey,
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.920]   or really anything that belongs to your neighbor.
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.840]   These words are perhaps some of the most famous
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.160]   that we have in scripture.
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.640]   And whether you've been a Christian all your life
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:48.840]   or you're relatively new to faith,
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.000]   you've probably heard something of these words.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.880]   We call them the 10 commandments,
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.320]   but actually that word is not in the Bible at all.
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:59.040]   The biblical context to these words in the Hebrew
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:04.040]   means literally the 10 words, the decalogue, the 10 words.
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.120]   And what's fascinating about these words
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.880]   is that they are central to both the Jewish
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:09.540]   and the Christian faith.
[00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.800]   But because they're so familiar to us,
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.300]   it's really easy for us when it comes to God's law,
[00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:16.420]   the 10 commandments, for us to assume
[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:17.960]   that we understand what they're about
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:21.600]   and therefore take a certain posture towards them.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.920]   And what I wanna do with you today
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.080]   is actually open up a fresh perspective for you
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.120]   about what these laws are all about.
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.520]   I want you to understand and to hear God's heart behind them
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.440]   'cause what's critical is not necessarily
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.840]   just what they're saying, but it's the character
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:40.040]   and the identity both of God and ourselves
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.480]   that God is trying to communicate through them.
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.880]   Let me start by telling you
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.480]   what the 10 commandments are not.
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.980]   They are not a bunch of legalistic rules
[00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:53.160]   that are designed to basically constrain you,
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.600]   hold you back, and make your life miserable.
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:00.200]   These are not rules that are created
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.840]   so that you're suddenly in a whole bunch
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.100]   of red tape with God, okay?
[00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:09.100]   Remember that God has just set his people free from slavery.
[00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:10.980]   The last thing God wants to do
[00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:13.720]   is put his people back in slavery.
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.840]   But so often we look at these laws
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.680]   and we think they're designed to basically shackle us
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:22.200]   and hold us back and strip all the joy out of life.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.260]   These are not prison bars.
[00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.800]   They're really just traffic laws.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.040]   And traffic laws are important.
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.240]   See, when you drive a car,
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.200]   you have the freedom to drive wherever you want.
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.000]   You can drive down the wrong side of the road
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.080]   if you want to.
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.340]   No one's actually gonna stop you in the moment, right?
[00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:39.640]   You have freedom.
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.040]   But we have traffic laws,
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.560]   and those traffic laws are created with lines on the road
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.420]   and lights and signs to help you
[00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:50.440]   to safely arrive at the destination that you want to go to.
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.920]   And if everybody stays within their lane
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.340]   and within those traffic laws,
[00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:56.680]   we're able to operate as a successful society
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:59.060]   and get efficiently to where we want to go.
[00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:02.280]   The law, these 10 commandments, they're kind of like that.
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:03.680]   No one's gonna shackle you.
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.360]   They're not designed to hold you back.
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.260]   No one's gonna force you to do them either.
[00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.620]   They're God's path of life.
[00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:12.940]   It's like God saying, "I have a destination for you.
[00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:14.720]   "I have somewhere where I want you to go."
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.980]   And within this structure, there is life.
[00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:19.580]   Within this structure, there is flourishing,
[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:21.460]   there's safety, there's health.
[00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:24.600]   If we live this way, there is a certain flourishing
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:28.100]   that comes not just for us, but also for those around us.
[00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:29.740]   Did you get that?
[00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:33.280]   The second thing is that the 10 commandments
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.460]   are not a bunch of rules that you follow
[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.380]   in order to gain your salvation
[00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:41.100]   or to gain more love of God.
[00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:43.500]   And I think so often we think of these in that way.
[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.080]   We think, "Oh man, if I can just be a better Christian,
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.900]   "if I could just try to live with the law
[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.000]   "a little bit better, if I could try to adhere
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.180]   "to the 10 commandments more,
[00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:53.480]   "I'm going to either earn my salvation
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.360]   "or I'm gonna get more of God's blessings.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.720]   "I'm gonna get more of His favor.
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.400]   "I'm gonna get more of His love."
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:04.400]   Salvation and God's love is not the reward of God's law.
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.640]   It's the reason why we wanna live out God's law.
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:09.240]   Are you following this, church?
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.640]   It's not the reward.
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:13.080]   We don't follow the law and then check a box
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.260]   and God goes, "Well done."
[00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:15.660]   And He puts a medal over us and says,
[00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:18.340]   "Congratulations, I love you now."
[00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:21.920]   We do the law because it comes out of a place of grace,
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:23.320]   out of a place of love,
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.440]   out of an intimate relationship we have with God.
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:28.140]   Remember, Moses comes into God's presence
[00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:31.460]   and God speaks to him about how he should live.
[00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:34.560]   In fact, Jesus Himself said this.
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:38.160]   He says, "If you love me, you'll obey my commandments."
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.740]   He doesn't say, "If you obey my commandments,
[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:42.360]   "I will love you."
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.040]   He doesn't say, "If you obey my commandments,
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:44.920]   "I can tell that you love me."
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.720]   He's saying, "If you love me."
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.280]   If we're in a relationship together,
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.960]   if there's this relationship of love that we have together,
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:54.880]   out of that will flow a new way that you'll want to live.
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.560]   You'll wanna do things that honor me.
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.160]   You'll wanna do things that connect
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:59.560]   the world and me together.
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.080]   You're gonna wanna live that character
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.480]   of the kingdom of priests and as a holy nation.
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:07.820]   Those things will naturally desire to come from you
[00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:10.280]   because they come from a place of love.
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.240]   This is why it was great in worship
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.880]   that we spent that time in that place
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:16.360]   of understanding our love of God and His love of us
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:19.280]   'cause from that flows everything we're about to do.
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.640]   And there's many of us who think
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:25.840]   if we can just do this list better, God will love us more.
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:28.280]   And I wanna break that slavery from you.
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:31.680]   Anybody here?
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:34.560]   I wanna break that slavery from you.
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:37.300]   You've been set free by Christ Jesus
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:38.840]   'cause He loves you so much.
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:42.440]   And out of that love comes the glory of life.
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:45.240]   Here's the third thing that the 10 commandments are not.
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:47.400]   They're not irrelevant for today.
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.040]   They're not to be cast aside.
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:50.800]   Oh, that was God in the Old Testament.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.280]   And now that we have Christ
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.920]   and now that we are a kind of a regeneration,
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.240]   I have new covenant and this old stuff,
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.480]   it doesn't really matter anymore.
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:01.520]   I can live how I want because I have the grace of Jesus
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:02.680]   and He forgives me.
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.620]   That's not what's happening here.
[00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:07.640]   In fact, Jesus in His own ministry, He said this,
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:09.560]   "I didn't come to abolish the law.
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:10.760]   "I didn't come to wipe it away.
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:11.740]   "I didn't come to just say,
[00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:12.760]   "Hey, this doesn't matter anymore.
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.960]   "No, I've actually come to fulfill it.
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.800]   "I've actually come to show you in my life
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.980]   "how it is actually a blessing.
[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.000]   "I wanna show you what the law does
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.320]   "and the heart behind the law.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.440]   "And I wanna show you how I am the only one
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.040]   "who could ever fulfill the law."
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.000]   This is the fascinating thing.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.120]   You see, the law itself was always designed
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:33.040]   to move people to Jesus.
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:35.960]   And so when Jesus says, "I am the fulfillment of the law,"
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:39.160]   what He's saying is the law is designed to draw you to me
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:43.960]   so that when you find me, you can then live out the law.
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:46.260]   Are you seeing the flow?
[00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.240]   So let me tell you a little bit
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.680]   about what the commandments actually are
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.920]   and how you might be able to live them out.
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:56.640]   And I wanna do that by breaking them down for you
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.520]   in a way that perhaps you've not heard before.
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.240]   But I hope in doing this,
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.840]   it'll really help you to understand
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.280]   how God has created you to be.
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:05.600]   Most people, when they look at the law,
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:06.840]   most scholars, when they talk about it,
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.760]   they break it into two sections.
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:11.960]   The first four being about our relationship with God
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.080]   and the next six being about our relationship
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:14.920]   with one another.
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.120]   And that's absolutely a fair way of looking at these.
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:20.240]   In fact, Jesus Himself pretty much saw it that way
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.400]   when the lawyer asked Him in the Gospels,
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.080]   "Hey, how do you summarize the law?"
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.160]   He says, "Love the Lord your God
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:26.760]   "with all your mind, heart, soul, and strength
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.060]   "and love your neighbor as yourself."
[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:30.840]   There it is, the Shema, as it's known in the Torah
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:32.600]   in the Jewish faith.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:36.000]   The Shema points us to the culmination of the law.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.600]   We are to love God and out of that,
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:38.920]   we are to love one another.
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.560]   So it breaks quite neatly down
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.260]   into this kind of two sections.
[00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:45.360]   But I think what's really important to understand
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:48.640]   for the Jewish people as they've arrived at Mount Sinai,
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:51.760]   their context is not necessarily this kind of idea
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.840]   of the Shema, of pulling it all together in two easy ways.
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.840]   Their concept is still slavery and brokenness.
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.920]   And their concept is identity vacuum.
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:01.640]   And I need to know who I am.
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:05.600]   And it is the context of Egypt and slavery
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.160]   that God brings the law into that.
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.480]   So I think actually the 10 commandments
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.760]   break down into three sections
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:15.360]   that are all about how we love.
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:18.000]   'Cause God is calling His people now to live in a new way,
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.240]   to live in a place of love,
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.360]   not a place of slavery and fear.
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.560]   The first three are about how we love God.
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.800]   The fourth is about how we are to love ourselves.
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.360]   And the final six then are about
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.800]   how we are to love one another.
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:34.440]   And they flow in that order really well.
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.360]   Now, as I unpack these for us,
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:40.480]   I also wanna do it in three specific categories
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.400]   to help you to understand the heart behind
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.320]   what the 10 commandments are all about.
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:47.080]   I wanna talk to you about three identities
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.380]   because that's what God is trying to communicate.
[00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:52.880]   The first identity is what I'm calling Pharaoh's identity.
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.880]   I'm not speaking specifically about Pharaoh,
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.720]   the actual person and his identity.
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:59.180]   I'm talking about a summary identity,
[00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:01.740]   this idea of what humanity is like
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:03.600]   in its brokenness and sin.
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.640]   What we see in the whole of the Exodus journey
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.920]   is Pharaoh becoming this kind of picture,
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.400]   this metaphor, if you will,
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.720]   of what humanity is like apart from God,
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.200]   what humanity acts like
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.440]   when it isn't in relationship with God.
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.960]   So that's Pharaoh's identity.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.080]   Does that make sense to you?
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.240]   Then I'm gonna tell you about God's identity,
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.800]   how God reveals Himself in the 10 commandments.
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.160]   And then finally, I'm gonna tell you about your identity,
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.800]   our identity, how that relates.
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.460]   So there's gonna be the identity
[00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:30.220]   of broken, sinful humanity,
[00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:32.680]   the identity of God, and then our identity.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:33.860]   Making sense?
[00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:35.940]   Okay, let me give you some examples.
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:37.900]   Let's start with the very first one.
[00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:40.260]   The very first one is, of course, when God says,
[00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:42.460]   "You will have no other God than Me."
[00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:44.700]   No other God but Me.
[00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:46.660]   It's very important that that's the first one
[00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:49.640]   because, of course, Israel's come out of a pantheon
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:52.720]   of religious understanding when they were slaves.
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:56.420]   The Egyptian cultural religion had over 60 different gods.
[00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:58.740]   So God says, "No, we're leaving that behind.
[00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:00.060]   "That's not the way things are.
[00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:02.480]   "There is just one God, and you are to worship God.
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:03.440]   "You worship Me.
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.540]   "You're not to have any other gods."
[00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:07.280]   But actually, God is saying something else
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:08.780]   about identity here that's really important.
[00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:10.340]   It's easy to miss this.
[00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:12.020]   Remember, the context is slavery
[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:14.540]   and coming out of that Pharaoh identity.
[00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:17.640]   The reality is, so much for many of us,
[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:21.100]   is that we actually put ourselves in the place of God.
[00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:26.100]   It is so easy to make life all about yourself.
[00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:29.260]   It's so easy for us to begin to think
[00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:32.500]   that actually we are the center of the world.
[00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.180]   I remember raising my daughter.
[00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:37.060]   There were many years where everything revolved around Mia.
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:38.480]   Now I'm still wrapped around her finger
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.980]   a little bit too much, but she still knows now
[00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:42.560]   that the world does not revolve around her.
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:43.840]   Are you with me?
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:46.540]   But there is something in our identity,
[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:49.420]   in Pharaoh's identity, where we would basically express it
[00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:52.980]   like this, "I am God, and I rule."
[00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:54.820]   And I want you to be honest with yourself
[00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:55.760]   'cause you'll hear that, and you'll be like,
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.320]   "No, no, I don't believe that."
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:59.280]   But then our actions, Monday to Friday,
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.400]   suggest that we are God and we rule.
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.420]   Are you with me?
[00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:03.780]   Am I preaching to anyone?
[00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:05.180]   Getting a little uncomfortable?
[00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:06.860]   Good, I'm just warming up.
[00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:10.900]   But the Pharaoh identity of this idea,
[00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:12.700]   "I am God, and I am rule,"
[00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:14.500]   and there's so much of that in us,
[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:15.920]   and God knows He needs to break that.
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:18.000]   So God, with His first commandment, is saying,
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.880]   "I am God alone.
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.500]   "It is just me.
[00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:22.660]   "I am the only one.
[00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:25.100]   "I have all authority in my hands,
[00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:27.440]   "all control and authority sits me."
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.720]   Because when we declare that we are God and we rule,
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.340]   we're basically saying we're in control.
[00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:34.500]   God's saying, "All authority is in me."
[00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:36.100]   Our response to that then,
[00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:38.020]   our identity now as free people,
[00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:40.620]   is to say, "We are worshipers.
[00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:42.020]   "We are worshipers of God."
[00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:42.860]   And that's really important
[00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:44.980]   because when you're in that Pharaoh's space
[00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:48.500]   of saying, "I am God and I rule," you worship yourself.
[00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.700]   And God is saying, "I'm the one who holds all authority."
[00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:53.300]   Our response is to say, "I will worship God."
[00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:54.700]   Are you with me?
[00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.260]   Here's the second one.
[00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:58.100]   The second one is you will make no image.
[00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:00.540]   You will make no other idol.
[00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:01.660]   Now, this is really important again
[00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:03.340]   because they've come out of their slavery
[00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:05.420]   and out of that pantheon of 60 gods,
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:06.940]   there's lots of idols that are created
[00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:07.980]   that they can worship.
[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:09.820]   And here's the fascinating thing.
[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:12.940]   Pharaoh would use those idols as a way of controlling
[00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:14.580]   and manipulating his people.
[00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:18.700]   He would oppress them under a system of image worship,
[00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:20.620]   idol worship.
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.420]   And this is really important to understand
[00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:25.180]   because I think all of us struggle to some degree
[00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:27.420]   with a deep-seated Pharaoh identity
[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:29.740]   of basically worship my image.
[00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:33.380]   Now I'm really preaching.
[00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:35.060]   Worship my image.
[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:37.180]   Follow my social media.
[00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:39.180]   Follow my ideas.
[00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:41.060]   Do what I say.
[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:42.380]   I wanna control.
[00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:43.660]   I wanna influence.
[00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:44.820]   I wanna be the focus.
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:47.420]   Worship my image.
[00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:48.340]   One of the things that we're seeing
[00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:49.620]   in the social media space right now
[00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:51.700]   is all these apps and all these AI tools
[00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:54.060]   that can take a really not attractive person
[00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:55.900]   and turn them into a stunning person.
[00:24:55.900 --> 00:25:00.100]   You no longer had to be like incredibly hot.
[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:02.220]   You could be ugly and still hot today.
[00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:04.980]   And all of this is creating for us
[00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:07.020]   this idea of like worship my image.
[00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:07.860]   And God is saying, "Hang on,
[00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:10.460]   we need to break the back of that slavery."
[00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:12.660]   And he's saying, "You have me."
[00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:15.340]   He's basically saying, "I am all you need.
[00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:16.180]   And if you have me,
[00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:17.580]   you don't need to worship anything else,
[00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:18.980]   whether that's anything in the world
[00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:20.980]   or whether that's yourself, you have me."
[00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:22.580]   Our response to that is to say,
[00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:26.260]   "My identity therefore is I am undivided."
[00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:28.660]   Because one thing that image worship always does,
[00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:30.740]   it divides your heart.
[00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:32.660]   And you end up worshiping a whole bunch
[00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:34.780]   of different things all over the place.
[00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:38.420]   Pharaoh's identity is come and worship me, I'm the best.
[00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:41.060]   God is saying, "You don't need anything else other than me."
[00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:45.780]   We're going, "I am undivided in my heart."
[00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:47.980]   Are you seeing this still so far?
[00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:49.020]   Anyone?
[00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:50.420]   Are you alive?
[00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:53.500]   Okay, here's the third one.
[00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:55.740]   By the way, we're not doing this for all 10, don't worry.
[00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:57.700]   This would be about a four hour sermon.
[00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:01.300]   But I'm gonna do it for a few.
[00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:04.660]   The third one is this idea of not misusing my name.
[00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:06.540]   He says, "Don't misuse my name."
[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:10.020]   When I grew up, I thought this was all about swearing.
[00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:11.900]   Don't swear.
[00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:14.540]   If somebody beats you to the lift and the door's closed,
[00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:17.740]   don't use Jesus's name out loud, right?
[00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:20.060]   Now, that is very important.
[00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:22.980]   And please don't misuse God's name in that context.
[00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:25.500]   But I don't think that's actually what God is saying here
[00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:26.420]   in this moment.
[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:28.940]   He's drawing his people to him out of a place of slavery.
[00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:30.700]   And he's saying, "I've saved you.
[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:31.980]   "I have redeemed you.
[00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:33.060]   "I have set you free.
[00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:34.860]   "Now don't misuse my name."
[00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:37.380]   Name in biblical context means character,
[00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:39.340]   your good name, my character.
[00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:41.620]   He's saying, "Don't misuse my character."
[00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:44.420]   In other words, if you're gonna say that you're a Christian,
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:47.420]   but your life is leading a very different picture
[00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:50.100]   to my character and who I am, stop doing that.
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:52.140]   Don't misuse my name.
[00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:54.340]   Don't claim to be a Christ follower
[00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:57.660]   and do all this other stuff that everybody else is doing,
[00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:00.300]   because that's just not gonna do any priestly function
[00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:01.140]   in the world at all.
[00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:02.860]   You're not helping people connect God together.
[00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:04.300]   People just think you're just like them.
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:05.980]   Don't misuse my name.
[00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:07.220]   Are you with me?
[00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:08.860]   And then there's this other thought as well
[00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:10.780]   that I think is in God's heart here.
[00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:15.300]   And that is for us as Christians amongst each other.
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:17.500]   Because I tell you one of the things that's at work
[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:19.020]   in the global church right now
[00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:21.300]   that we have to be really, really careful of,
[00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:24.220]   and we need to stand up against is spiritual abuse.
[00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:29.020]   And spiritual abuse happens when somebody takes
[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:31.500]   God's authority to manipulate people
[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.300]   within a church context.
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:35.100]   The number one, I'm just gonna be honest with you.
[00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:39.940]   The number one thing that Chris and I constantly pray about
[00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:44.580]   is that I would do my utmost to avoid the temptation
[00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:46.980]   to use God's name to get you
[00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:49.500]   to do something I want you to do.
[00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:53.220]   That's every pastor's greatest challenge.
[00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:55.220]   But it's not just the pastor's challenge.
[00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:57.580]   It's also your challenge too.
[00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:59.500]   That we wouldn't misuse the name of God
[00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:00.740]   for our own personal gain.
[00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:04.940]   Pharaoh's identity is basically this, God serves me.
[00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:09.700]   Like I'm gonna use God to get what I need to get.
[00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:10.660]   God serves me.
[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:12.740]   God is basically saying, I serve no one.
[00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:17.860]   Our response is to say, we are servants.
[00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:19.500]   We are servants of God.
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:20.860]   You follow the flow?
[00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:22.700]   So I want you to see what God's doing
[00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:24.700]   just in this first section of loving God.
[00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:27.660]   He's trying to uproot some of this broken Pharaoh identity
[00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:29.300]   that so many of us still hold onto,
[00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:31.260]   that I know I still hold onto,
[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:34.900]   where I say, I am God and I rule.
[00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:37.180]   Where I say, worship my image.
[00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:38.980]   Where I say, God serves me.
[00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:42.300]   God says, I alone have all that authority.
[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:44.900]   You don't need anything else other than me.
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:47.460]   And I serve no one.
[00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:50.020]   And our response then in the reality of that
[00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:52.900]   as free people is to say, I am a worshiper.
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:54.100]   I am undivided.
[00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:56.540]   I serve God.
[00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:57.620]   Follow it?
[00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:58.940]   Isn't it great?
[00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:00.900]   This is the path to life.
[00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:02.860]   This is not shackles to bind you.
[00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:04.700]   It is something to set you free.
[00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:09.580]   This is why the fourth one is the most, I think, important.
[00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:12.660]   Keep the Sabbath.
[00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:14.740]   Keep the Sabbath.
[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:18.740]   Have a day off, God says, and we all ignore it.
[00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:23.340]   And he binds this in creative history.
[00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:25.700]   He says, in the same way that God himself
[00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:28.460]   rested on the seventh day, you should also rest.
[00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:30.340]   And God is not doing this
[00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:32.820]   because he thinks everybody needs a yoga retreat.
[00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:38.300]   He's doing this because he's speaking about their identity.
[00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:41.260]   Notice this, when you're a slave,
[00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:44.980]   you are never resting or free to rest.
[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:48.380]   Slavery by its very definition is you go, go, go, go, go
[00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:49.220]   all the time.
[00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:52.500]   They work seven days, 365 days a year.
[00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:53.980]   That's what it meant to be a slave.
[00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:55.660]   So when God comes and he says,
[00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:57.500]   this is not about how you love me.
[00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:59.340]   This is also about how you love yourself.
[00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:02.580]   And if you don't rest, you are not proclaiming the freedom
[00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:04.980]   I have paid the price for for you.
[00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:07.060]   'Cause when you fail to rest,
[00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:10.140]   you're basically adapting the identity of a slave.
[00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:14.100]   This is why this is so key for Hong Kong.
[00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:17.500]   Because every single one of us, we all work too much.
[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:21.220]   We all drive ourselves so much.
[00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:23.420]   That song we sang earlier, there's so many times
[00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:24.580]   where Chris says to me,
[00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:27.580]   "Even when I don't see it, you're still working.
[00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:29.700]   "Even when I don't feel it, you're still working.
[00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:32.740]   "You never stop, you never stop working."
[00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:36.260]   (congregation laughing)
[00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:37.100]   She's right.
[00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:40.740]   I need this more than anything.
[00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:43.220]   And here's what the identity is.
[00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:46.500]   The Pharaoh identity is, I will provide for myself.
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:48.220]   I will consume and provide.
[00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:49.820]   I'm in control.
[00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:51.900]   And we drive ourselves because we're fearful
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:53.140]   of not being able to provide.
[00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:57.100]   And God is saying, I'm your provider, rest.
[00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:59.500]   Take a breath.
[00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:01.820]   You can't do it all in your own strength.
[00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:05.180]   You can't drive yourself to success like that.
[00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:07.860]   You can try, but you're just gonna reach burnout.
[00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:08.700]   You need to rest.
[00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:13.700]   And in that place of rest, we say, I have faith in God.
[00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:16.980]   I have faith and I have trust in Him that He will provide.
[00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:18.820]   And that means that I will stop my work.
[00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.180]   I will turn my email off.
[00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:22.260]   I won't respond to WhatsApps or whatever it is.
[00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:23.340]   I'm gonna break away.
[00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:24.900]   I'm gonna spend time with my loved ones.
[00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:27.220]   I'm gonna get away from all of that stuff
[00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:28.700]   that's draining all my energy.
[00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:31.340]   I'm gonna refill it by being in relationship with God.
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:33.300]   And that's the way I'm gonna find life.
[00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:35.820]   That's the path to life for me.
[00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:38.180]   It's really interesting because we think Sabbath
[00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:41.100]   is about coming to a church service.
[00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:43.860]   Sabbath itself is worship.
[00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:46.020]   Come on church.
[00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:47.780]   I like it when you come to church services.
[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:50.380]   Please keep coming to church services.
[00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:53.780]   But I need you to know that Sabbath itself is worship.
[00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:55.100]   Because when you Sabbath,
[00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:58.260]   you're saying I'm no longer a slave.
[00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:02.380]   I have freedom to rest.
[00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:03.620]   And when you rest,
[00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:07.100]   you proclaim a different narrative to the world.
[00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:11.140]   Rest my friends, rest.
[00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:13.740]   Now, here's the other important thing about Sabbath
[00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:16.340]   and why I think it's here, right here, number four,
[00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:17.820]   and why it's about ourselves.
[00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:19.060]   Because here's the reality.
[00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:23.700]   When we fail to rest, we're really bad at loving others.
[00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:28.700]   When you're exhausted and tired and worn out and burnout,
[00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:30.820]   your patience with people goes like this.
[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:32.820]   At least mine does.
[00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:34.580]   I know when I need a Sabbath
[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:36.460]   is when I don't like you guys anymore.
[00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:37.980]   (congregation laughing)
[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:39.620]   That's when I need a break.
[00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:41.500]   That's when I need to get away.
[00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:42.540]   Because I love you guys.
[00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:43.780]   I really love you guys.
[00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:44.940]   But there are times when I don't,
[00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:46.500]   and that's because I've gone and I've gone
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:47.500]   and I've worked and I've worked
[00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:48.980]   and I'm exhausted and in pain.
[00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:51.820]   This is why God says you have to keep the Sabbath.
[00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:54.140]   And it's about loving yourself because out of that,
[00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:56.420]   then you can keep the next six.
[00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:59.300]   'Cause the next six are really hard if you're exhausted.
[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:02.300]   The next six are really difficult if you have not rested.
[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:04.900]   But if you're resting in me, abiding in me,
[00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:06.140]   finding your presence in me,
[00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:09.500]   then you will flow to your love of others.
[00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:11.260]   Now I'm not gonna break these down one by one for you
[00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:13.140]   'cause it will take ages, but let me put them up on a slide.
[00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:15.260]   This is the next six of them.
[00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:16.340]   You don't need to take a photo of this
[00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:17.700]   'cause I'm gonna give you one slide in a moment
[00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:19.580]   that I have all 10.
[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:22.020]   So, but you can look at this.
[00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:24.780]   I want you to see this because here you see,
[00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:26.300]   God has a heart for family.
[00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:28.980]   God has a heart for people.
[00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:32.580]   God believes in life over death,
[00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:34.940]   that God is non-violent,
[00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:36.900]   that God wants us to treat each other with respect
[00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:38.940]   and honor and peace and love.
[00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:42.860]   This is a manifesto of how we should be walking together
[00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:43.860]   with one another.
[00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:47.420]   And yet that Pharaoh identity so easily strips us
[00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:49.880]   of the freedom that God has created us for.
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:52.220]   Are you with me?
[00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:55.100]   And all of this is his invitation.
[00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:58.220]   It's like, come to me and out of me,
[00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:01.300]   come and live this stuff.
[00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:04.820]   Now, if you're anything like me, let me put up all 10
[00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:06.660]   and you can take a quick photo of that.
[00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:09.260]   And we're actually gonna make a social media post
[00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:10.620]   about it later this week.
[00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:12.860]   So you can keep an eye out on our Instagram
[00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:14.140]   and Facebook for that.
[00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:15.300]   But you can take a photo of that.
[00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:18.340]   You can put it up somewhere where you can see it regularly
[00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:20.980]   because this is the path of life.
[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:23.420]   Now, you're all taking a photo.
[00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:26.760]   (congregation laughing)
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:30.780]   Serious, I'm gonna finish with this.
[00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:35.260]   I don't know about you, but when I look at that list,
[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:38.700]   my time is spent looking at Pharaoh's identity
[00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:40.020]   because I relate to it.
[00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:44.780]   I look in here and I can see so much of Pharaoh in me.
[00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:48.660]   I can see so much of the broken is still there in me.
[00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:51.360]   I can feel the temptation to make myself a God.
[00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:56.840]   I can feel the temptation to make people worship my image.
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:59.540]   I can feel the temptation to wanna steal
[00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:01.040]   other people's creative ideas.
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:05.140]   I can feel that brokenness in me to look with my eyes
[00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:07.660]   upon others in ways that I shouldn't.
[00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:10.700]   So much of Pharaoh I know still sits in me.
[00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:14.140]   And part of that is absolutely right
[00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:18.900]   because the law is to drive us to Jesus.
[00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:22.500]   And when we see this broken Pharaoh-ness in us,
[00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:25.920]   it should compel us, drive us towards Jesus.
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:27.820]   But here's what usually happens.
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:30.060]   When we find the Pharaoh stuff in us,
[00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:32.780]   it doesn't drive us to Jesus, it drives us to ourselves.
[00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:35.460]   And we try to work harder to achieve everything
[00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:38.420]   on the right hand side here in our own strength.
[00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:41.860]   The worst thing you can do off of a message like this
[00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:42.700]   is to go home and go,
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:45.500]   "Andrew told me to pull my socks up
[00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:48.260]   and try to be a better human being."
[00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:50.060]   It's not what I'm telling you today.
[00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:52.880]   If you try this in your own human strength,
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.100]   you will be exhausted.
[00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:57.180]   The most exhausting thing on earth
[00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:59.420]   is being religious and not saved.
[00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:05.660]   Oh, the most exhausting thing is being religious
[00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:09.280]   but not having a saving relationship with Jesus.
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:12.340]   You cannot achieve this on your own, in your own strength.
[00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:14.180]   And that's what the law is all about.
[00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:17.260]   The whole point of the law
[00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:18.980]   is to bring us to somebody who can do it.
[00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:20.620]   This is why Jesus said, "I didn't abolish it,
[00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:22.780]   but I fulfilled it."
[00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:25.300]   Paul writing in Romans 10, he put it this way.
[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:27.980]   He said, "Christ is the culmination of the law
[00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:29.420]   so that there may be righteousness
[00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:31.380]   for everyone who believes."
[00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:32.820]   But notice this, who believes?
[00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:33.980]   Who has relationship?
[00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:35.200]   Who is in a relationship?
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.100]   Not righteousness for everybody who works hard,
[00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:40.020]   tries hard, strives hard, does stuff on their own strength.
[00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:41.860]   Righteousness for those who believe
[00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:43.980]   'cause Christ is the culmination of the law.
[00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:45.500]   And as the culmination of the law,
[00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:47.340]   our belief and relationship with him
[00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:49.700]   releases the law in and through us.
[00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:51.540]   This is why Paul would write
[00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:54.060]   that we no longer have the law on stones or tablet,
[00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:56.540]   but they're written on the flesh of our heart.
[00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:58.860]   'Cause the spirit of God now is in us
[00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:01.460]   to help us to live in the way that would bring God glory.
[00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:05.220]   We don't do it in our striving, we do it in our abiding.
[00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:08.740]   We do it in our relationship with Jesus.
[00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:10.420]   As we're drawn into him
[00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:12.340]   and intimately in relationship with him,
[00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:14.400]   we are then drawn out to the world.
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:17.280]   The last thing I want you to do
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:20.560]   is just try to work harder.
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.440]   What I wanna invite you into
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:25.720]   is to be so inspired by the path of life
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:28.220]   that you just wanna be more with Jesus.
[00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:32.840]   The very central passage of the vine is John 15, five.
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:35.720]   I am the vine, you are the branches.
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:37.560]   If a person remains in me and I in them,
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:39.060]   they will bear much fruit.
[00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:42.280]   Apart from me, you can do nothing.
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:44.040]   Apart from me, it is useless.
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:47.160]   It is just religion without salvation and that's painful.
[00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:52.080]   But in me and with me, it is the path of life.
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:55.440]   Abide in me, he says.
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.600]   Don't try to go through that list
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:58.000]   and make it all work for you.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.940]   Use that list to propel you to Jesus
[00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:04.040]   so that in relationship with him,
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:06.140]   you are propelled to the world.
[00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:08.240]   That's the path of life.
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:10.900]   And that is Exodus chapter 20.
[00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:11.900]   Let me pray for you.
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:15.720]   Father, I am so grateful for everybody here.
[00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:19.640]   I'm so grateful for your presence with us
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:21.400]   and your call to us.
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:27.720]   Father, we sit in the beauty of these 10 commandments,
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:29.240]   these 10 words.
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:33.540]   And Father, they invite us into reflecting
[00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:35.060]   on our Pharaoh identities,
[00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:40.480]   on the brokenness that we carry so easily amongst us.
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:45.280]   And the law reveals the Pharaohs in us,
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:48.700]   not so that we would feel bad about ourselves,
[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:51.660]   so that we'd feel alone in that field,
[00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:55.360]   so that we would beat ourselves up.
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:58.760]   The law reveals our brokenness
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:00.620]   so that we are drawn to Christ,
[00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:04.640]   that we are drawn out of ourselves to him,
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:06.140]   the one who can save,
[00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:08.080]   the only one who's the fulfillment,
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:10.180]   the culmination of the law.
[00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:12.980]   So Father, for every person here
[00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:17.240]   who is recognizing some of the Pharaohs in their identity,
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:21.020]   I pray that in this moment, they would come to you.
[00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:25.200]   I wanna give you space to be able to do that,
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:27.000]   just in the quietness of your heart.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:35.540]   We've seen today God's identity,
[00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:38.940]   who he is, what he stands for,
[00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:40.300]   and the way that he is the opposite
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.640]   of all that slavery that we experience.
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:46.060]   And out of his identity and who he is
[00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:48.960]   and how he's made himself known, we then respond.
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:51.680]   And so I wanna pray for each one of you
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:53.220]   as you abide in Christ,
[00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:58.440]   as you come to Jesus in a beautiful place of grace,
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:04.860]   I pray that you would feel him transforming and changing you
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:07.500]   as a priest and as someone who is holy.
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:11.640]   And I feel that out of that, I pray that you would know
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:15.600]   the joy that it is to live in this world
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.920]   in a way where we love our neighbor,
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:21.640]   where we don't commit adultery, where we don't fight,
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:24.020]   where we don't seek brokenness and slavery,
[00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:28.440]   but a world where we long to love and honor and respect
[00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:31.680]   and see peace come on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:36.920]   Father, would you inspire us by you
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:40.760]   and by how you are all of the law
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:42.880]   in a person and in your spirit.
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:44.840]   So I wanna pray for the release of the Holy Spirit
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:45.940]   of every person here.
[00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:48.880]   I wanna pray, Lord, that you would,
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:53.880]   by your spirit, write on our hearts your path of life.
[00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:57.640]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:00.960]   I'm just gonna respond together in worship.
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:02.200]   Would you stand with me?
