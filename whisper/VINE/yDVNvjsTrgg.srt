1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
 When you hear the word idolatry, what are some of the thoughts that come to your mind?

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,680
 Perhaps you think about many gods or random statues

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:16,360
 Things that you might have seen in a family gathering or family homes

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:24,840
 For me whenever I think of the word idolatry, I get the picture of the children of Israel in the desert

5
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,400
 so Exodus

6
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,840
 32 verses 1 to 4 reads

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,000
 When the people saw that Moses was so long in coming down from the mountain

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,160
 They gathered around Aaron and said come

9
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:45,760
 Make us gods who will go before us as for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt

10
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,920
 We don't know what happened to him

11
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:55,520
 Aaron answered them take off the gold earrings that your wives your sons and your daughters are wearing and bring them to me

12
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,520
 So all the people took off their earrings and brought them to Aaron

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,600
 He took what they handed him and made it into an idol cast in the shape of a calf

14
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:12,240
 Fashioning it with a tool then they said these are your gods

15
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,000
 Israel who brought you up out of Egypt

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,680
 So we see in this text that Moses their leader had gone on to the mountain to be with the Lord and in this time

17
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,040
 They go up to Aaron and ask for gods to go before them

18
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:36,320
 The gold here interestingly enough was part of the provision of God when they were in Egypt

19
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,920
 God had prompted the Egyptians to give them gold as they were leaving

20
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:47,160
 So they're actually using the provision that God gave them for their future to make an idol

21
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,320
 Something that is not God to worship

22
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:57,560
 now I think for me this is like the first picture of idolatry that comes into my mind because

23
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,400
 It's a very obvious picture. They're literally worshiping a golden calf

24
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,200
 but

25
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,840
 Personally for me as someone who grew up in England

26
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,240
 It's really really easy for me to remove myself from the sin of idolatry

27
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,840
 I can say well, I don't have a golden statue in my house

28
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,560
 I don't necessarily see statues or worship in my home. So I'm good

29
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,800
 But I know that for a lot of you here that may not necessarily be the case

30
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,320
 You may actually have statues or have seen them at family gatherings

31
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:40,240
 Somebody's home. You may have a close relative who actually worships an idol, which is sinful

32
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:47,880
 Now for us for me and you perhaps we don't partake in this type of idolatry

33
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:54,120
 but unfortunately, it doesn't remove us from the sin of idolatry and

34
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,720
 Here is why

35
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,600
 The first thing about idolatry is that it actually starts in here in our heart

36
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:09,280
 Despite that we read in the Bible that they made a golden calf. We can imagine them

37
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,280
 dancing around worshiping singing whatever they were doing as

38
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,800
 disobedient as the actual act was

39
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,760
 What led them to that point?

40
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,600
 Started in here

41
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:29,960
 It was the posture of their heart that led them to make in such an image in the first place and you might ask

42
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,240
 What does that even mean posture of your heart?

43
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:39,320
 How can your heart lead you to doing such a detestable thing against the Lord?

44
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:46,880
 Don't we always hear in our culture follow your heart, you know do what's right in here. It's all good

45
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:52,480
 Isn't it that warm mushy place where people fall in love and all things are great?

46
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,520
 According to the Bible. No

47
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,560
 one of the Old Testament prophets

48
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,440
 Jeremiah actually says the heart is deceitful

49
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:07,960
 Above all things and beyond cure who can understand it

50
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,480
 the book of Proverbs

51
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:18,480
 One of the wisdom books that really tells us about how to live in step with the Word of God says above all else

52
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,920
 Guard your heart for everything you do flows from it

53
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:27,160
 so it's a way of protecting ourselves from sin and

54
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,880
 Then we skip to the New Testament Jesus himself

55
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,960
 Says in Matthew 15 for out of the heart come evil thoughts

56
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,160
 murder

57
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,160
 adultery sexual immorality

58
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,160
 theft false testimony and

59
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,160
 slander

60
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:53,680
 Now Jesus says this after speaking to the Pharisees and at that time the things that the Pharisees would say

61
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,440
 Would have you believe that they are in step with God?

62
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,760
 Everything they said seemed to be in line with what God was saying

63
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,360
 but as Jesus is God he was able to see to their hearts and he knew that their hearts were dark and

64
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,680
 Very very far from him

65
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:20,600
 The sin he identifies in here the roots of all of those sins are actually

66
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,400
 started in the heart they start from a heart posture that

67
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:33,360
 Disregards God and that is far from him and then it's the sin that we see that is birthed from those desires. I

68
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:40,640
 Believe that the golden calf stemmed from two key places that we're going to talk about

69
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,800
 The first is the culture

70
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,080
 normalized idol worship the culture

71
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,760
 normalized idol worship

72
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,360
 So if we remember back to our series on the life of Joseph in Genesis and

73
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,640
 We see how the children of Israel came to be

74
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,000
 Joseph was in Egypt

75
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,880
 there was a famine in the land and he eventually invited his dad and his brothers and their children to live in Egypt with

76
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,960
 him and

77
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:19,360
 They were fruitful and they multiplied into the children of Israel and they never went back

78
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,840
 So they stayed there for centuries and centuries

79
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:28,720
 And so we see that in Egypt they didn't follow the God that we follow today

80
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,800
 They didn't follow Yahweh. So for them worship in many gods

81
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:39,080
 totally fine totally normal and many theologians have actually argued that

82
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:44,500
 the calf the golden calf that the Israelites made was

83
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,160
 inspired by one of the gods of the Egyptians

84
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,240
 Number two they did not regard or trust God

85
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,880
 They did not regard or trust God

86
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:03,480
 I say regard because by this point they had already received the Ten Commandments

87
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:09,840
 So they knew that they should have no other gods before the Lord. They should not make idols

88
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,240
 They should not worship any idols. They knew all of these things

89
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:19,240
 They also doubted God when Moses went up onto the mountain. It seemed

90
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:25,720
 Silent for some time and they didn't know if he was coming back. They didn't wait on the Lord

91
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,520
 They didn't trust in the Lord

92
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,640
 and so this is when they quickly lost the desire to wait on him and

93
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:38,440
 Decided to make gods of their own making a god that they could physically see

94
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,200
 whenever they pleased a

95
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:48,840
 God that had no real requirements a God that they didn't need to be held accountable to

96
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,640
 They could worship it when ever they pleased

97
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,720
 A

98
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,120
 God that they could worship whenever they pleased

99
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:18,840
 They didn't need to be held accountable for anything as it was a God of their own making their own hands

100
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:24,760
 In their comments about Moses. We hear that God doesn't even feature

101
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:31,160
 They literally say as for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt

102
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,400
 We don't know what happened to him

103
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:39,880
 We see throughout scripture and God makes it very clear that I am the Lord your God

104
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,720
 Who brought you up out of Egypt, but at this point?

105
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,160
 They were not bothered

106
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,640
 so many many gods worshipped in Egypt

107
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:56,280
 Influenced the Israelites and the fact that they did not trust and they did not regard God

108
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:02,600
 All of that led them to fashioning a God of their own hands a God of their own making

109
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,240
 Apostle Paul in the New Testament in the book of Romans

110
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,760
 summarizes this sin

111
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,880
 beautifully

112
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,880
 Romans 1 reads

113
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,640
 For although they knew God

114
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:20,400
 They neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him

115
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:26,240
 But their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened

116
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,720
 although they claimed to be wise they became fools and

117
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:38,280
 exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like a mortal human being and

118
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,720
 birds and animals and reptiles

119
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,400
 So they thought that what they were doing was actually wise

120
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,760
 but we see that it led them to be foolish and

121
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:56,800
 They fell into deeper sin moving further and further away from God

122
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:04,160
 Their disregard for God caused them to worship a God that they created with their own hands with their own

123
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,680
 Jewelry for that matter the work of their own hands

124
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,640
 They failed to place God above all things

125
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:16,120
 they failed to value God as we should a

126
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:22,840
 Scripture tells us to and when we look through the history and the trajectory of the Israelites

127
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,000
 we see that their existence was very tumultuous and

128
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,760
 lacked a lot of peace

129
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,640
 The images they built for themselves

130
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,520
 eventually amounted to nothing

131
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,200
 Didn't fulfill them

132
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,040
 Didn't protect them couldn't provide security

133
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,800
 Couldn't answer any of their problems or questions

134
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:51,440
 These are the things that only God can do

135
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,640
 But unfortunately in our society today

136
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:01,560
 This is still a problem. It's not just something we read about in the Bible

137
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:09,560
 According to Timothy Keller who was who was a modern-day theologian. He actually passed in

138
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,080
 2023 he defined idolatry as

139
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:19,040
 Idolatry is treating anything as more important than Jesus Christ

140
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:27,400
 For your meaning in life your happiness your security your hope and your self-regard. I

141
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,160
 Think I'll read that again

142
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:38,160
 Idolatry is treating anything as more important than Jesus for your meaning in life your happiness

143
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,320
 your security your hope and your

144
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,960
 self-regard

145
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,160
 so

146
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,840
 when we think about work a

147
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,520
 education a

148
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,400
 business

149
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:59,000
 I'm pretty sure that idolatry or an idol is like the furthest thought from your mind

150
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:07,600
 In our modern-day society. We've been taught to earn a living to earn our key to support our family to make

151
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,080
 ends meet

152
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,080
 Genesis 2 in the Bible even speaks about

153
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,960
 cultivating and working so

154
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,240
 How on earth can this be an idol?

155
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,440
 So there's actually a story in Genesis 11

156
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:28,160
 That sort of gives us a bit of an insight into how work can become an idol

157
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,560
 So Genesis 11 verse 1 to 4

158
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,640
 Genesis 11 1 to 4

159
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:42,800
 Now the whole world had one language and one common speech as people moved eastward

160
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,880
 They found a plane in China and settled there

161
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:53,240
 They said to each other come let us make bricks and bake them thoroughly

162
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,760
 They used brick instead of stone and tar for water

163
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:05,360
 Then they said come let us build a city for ourselves with a tower that reaches to the heavens

164
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,880
 So that we may make a name for ourselves

165
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:15,040
 Otherwise, we will be scattered over the face of the earth

166
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,920
 now we read that the people wanted to build a city and

167
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,680
 Personally, I never saw the problem with this story

168
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:32,160
 Over the years I was like, there's nothing wrong with building. They wanted to build a city. They wanted to build a tower

169
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,200
 I never truly understood it until

170
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,920
 recently and

171
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,920
 Why God would go to the effort of scattering their language?

172
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:47,120
 Stopping them from understanding each other and essentially stopping the job

173
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,440
 But I realized that it's the city itself

174
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:58,240
 Wasn't the problem we live in Hong Kong. We see it's very built up. I don't think God is upset with us for that

175
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,640
 The issue itself again

176
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,240
 Was in here. It was a heart posture thing

177
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:10,480
 Their goal in making it was to make a name for themselves

178
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,720
 God didn't feature in it something they could identify themselves with

179
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:25,960
 Something that others would recognize them for perhaps something so great that it would reach up to heavens to God

180
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,400
 himself

181
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,520
 Knowing that they were mere mortals. There was this

182
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:37,840
 Desire for them to be like God just like the original sin in the garden

183
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,880
 they were putting their faith in their own abilities and

184
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,200
 Skill and linking their identity to what they could make

185
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:54,520
 I'll say that again. They were putting their faith in their own abilities and skills and

186
00:14:54,520 --> 00:15:01,440
 Linking their identity to what they could make which in their minds would make them known

187
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:09,080
 They wanted to prove that they too can create just like God and in making a name for themselves

188
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:14,040
 God again didn't feature let us so we

189
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,760
 ourselves it was all about them and

190
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,360
 Sadly, this is kind of what our society is like today

191
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:29,680
 We worship the God of self. It's all about me myself and I

192
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:37,120
 We just like the Israelites wanted to make a city for themselves a God for themselves

193
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,520
 To fashion and suit their own needs we often do the same

194
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,920
 Similar to the lie the snake told Eve in the garden

195
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:53,080
 You will become like God are the same whispers the enemy whispered

196
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:58,840
 To the children of Israel you can make your own gods. You can make gods for yourself

197
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:04,400
 The same lie he whispered to the people in Babel. You can build a city

198
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:11,240
 You can make a name for yourself and sometimes there's some of the lies that we hear in our lives today

199
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:18,600
 Now we may not unless you're in construction be building cities of our own

200
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:24,520
 But we can often make our jobs what we do an idol

201
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:28,160
 our title our job our role

202
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,720
 Even like the personas that we put out there of ourselves

203
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,200
 They're the work of our hands

204
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,840
 We we build ourselves up to become something so that we are

205
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:46,040
 Recognized or seen by other people and most of the time this is outside of God

206
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:51,320
 We are proud we've built ourselves up from the ground up

207
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:56,720
 It's our pride and joy and sometimes it makes us who we are

208
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,040
 Without it. We become less accomplished or

209
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,280
 unfulfilled

210
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:09,640
 It could be a job or a career that you've worked your whole life for

211
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:15,560
 Years as an undergraduate you might have done a master's a PhD

212
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,640
 You might have trained done work experience

213
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:24,920
 You've given your all to it and now you've become a doctor, which is great

214
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:32,840
 But you've now made that the source of your identity and so every single conversation

215
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:37,640
 You must insert the fact that you are a doctor

216
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:45,720
 Everybody must know that you are a doctor and those conversations where you fail to mention it you feel like

217
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,400
 Something's missing

218
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,840
 Because people don't know that you are the doctor

219
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:58,560
 You've attached your identity to a title outside of Christ

220
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:06,320
 Or maybe maybe it's not even a job. Maybe it's a talent or a gift that you have

221
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,880
 Maybe it's something that

222
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:16,120
 People think of that thing and they think of you straight away the best cook in the family. Yes, it's her

223
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,440
 every family event

224
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,360
 wedding gatherings

225
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:28,240
 You're on it. Every meal you make there are compliments flying through the room and it makes you feel pretty amazing

226
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:34,920
 You feel great about yourself. You are the designated chef and that is your thing and

227
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:41,840
 Now you've attached your identity and who you are as that instead of in Christ

228
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,640
 Maybe you're the footballer

229
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,520
 You've always been skilled the videos of you as a one-year-old dribbling and doing all sorts of skills

230
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:58,920
 Your whole life your drive everything about you has been to be the greatest footballer

231
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:03,560
 There is and you weren't really concerned about any other area of life

232
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:08,640
 You wanted to be the absolute best and that was you

233
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:14,400
 But what happens when all of these things start to fall apart?

234
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:23,080
 What happens when God allows your mini Tower of Babel to be scattered or to fall apart?

235
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,720
 What happens if the doctor?

236
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,520
 loses his license

237
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,560
 Does he still see value in himself?

238
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:39,320
 What happens if the best cook in the family makes that awful dish that everyone's talking about?

239
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,400
 reputation ruined

240
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,320
 Does she or he feel like an absolute failure?

241
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:51,000
 What happens to that super mom who everyone goes to for advice?

242
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,080
 Wow, help me with my child and now all of her kids are grown and they've flown out of the nest

243
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,960
 Does she lose her?

244
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:07,000
 Source or her purpose in life and what happens if that athlete or footballer gets injured?

245
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,840
 And they can't go back to work does their whole life fall apart?

246
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,840
 as a result

247
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:20,560
 These are all problems that people today face. Maybe some of you have faced things like that as well

248
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:26,800
 We need to understand that all of these things fall flat

249
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:31,320
 When we do not build them primarily on the Lord

250
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:37,800
 All of these things fall flat when we do not build them primarily on the Lord

251
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,240
 when our identity our

252
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:47,120
 Fulfillment our strengths our source is from anything outside of the Lord God

253
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,120
 We leave the door open for disappointment

254
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,080
 for feelings of meaninglessness and

255
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,520
 Failure if we place anything before God

256
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:04,960
 We find ourselves having to keep adding and doing more and doing more to satisfy

257
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,320
 Because it's never going to be enough

258
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,840
 outside of God

259
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,240
 There's no satisfaction

260
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:18,960
 Outside of the will of the Lord and putting him first. You're always gonna need to do more and

261
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,120
 Like the city of Babel they focused on building a name for themselves

262
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,960
 on being known by others and they worship themselves as

263
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:36,840
 Believers today we should be concerned rather with building our careers and our lives and all

264
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,360
 forms of our lives on Christ

265
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:48,160
 Which actually lines up with an interesting story that Jesus tells in Matthew 7 about the wise and the foolish man

266
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:53,480
 So Jesus implores us as believers to build everything

267
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:58,640
 Including our work on the rock which is a metaphor for Jesus himself

268
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,920
 He is the solid rock and you see that when the storms of life come

269
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,680
 When you have trials when you lose your job all the things happen

270
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:15,760
 Your peace is intact and you stand firm because you have built everything on Jesus the solid rock

271
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:22,160
 He also tells us to not be like the foolish man who built on the sand

272
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,680
 Because we know I think we know exactly what happens when you build on the sand

273
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:33,080
 Imagine t10 with a house built on a sand. It's just not gonna work as it and

274
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:40,160
 so we as believers need to ensure that Jesus the solid rock is what we are building on and

275
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:44,960
 When we don't we actually find ourselves in despair

276
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,160
 living lives of frustration and

277
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:53,320
 Ecclesiastes 5 gives us a great example of this

278
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,440
 Ecclesiastes 5 15 to 17

279
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,880
 everyone comes naked from their mother's womb and

280
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,360
 As everyone comes so they depart

281
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,600
 They take nothing from their toil that they can carry in their hands

282
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,320
 this too is a grievous evil as

283
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:20,800
 Everyone comes so they depart and what do they gain since they toil for the wind?

284
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:26,000
 All their days they eat in darkness with great frustration

285
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,760
 affliction and anger

286
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:35,000
 Now how many of us feel like sometimes we just go through the motions

287
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,880
 Like we go to work we clock in we work

288
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:46,600
 We clock out we go back home and we repeat over and over and over again. And sometimes you feel like

289
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:53,360
 There's nothing really there the value of what you're doing is lost. You feel

290
00:23:53,880 --> 00:24:00,560
 Heavy you feel burdened like there's a weight and you're not really sure what to do with it

291
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,840
 sometimes

292
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,360
 It's because you're in the wrong job

293
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:11,680
 I will say but a huge part of that is when you've not actually built your

294
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:16,200
 work life your job your career on God a

295
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:24,960
 Career and a job that leads to frustration and darkness as God is not the center or the motivating factor

296
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,640
 The Bible says toiling in the wind. So you're just working and it's

297
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,880
 Blown away

298
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:38,200
 We need to build our work life on the only reliable source, which is God

299
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:45,600
 Now this is a story of how God revealed in in my heart and in my life

300
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,040
 that I was making my job and my career an idol and

301
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:56,600
 it's also a story of how God restored me back to himself and

302
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:02,560
 Refocused me to know that he should be the center. So

303
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,840
 Many years ago. I won't say how many

304
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,680
 When I was working in the Middle East as a teacher

305
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,080
 my

306
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,880
 Focus and my goal was to make money

307
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:22,560
 I wanted to make as much money as possible. I wanted to be debt-free. I wanted to be independent

308
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:26,640
 I didn't want to have to rely on any man. Love you, babe and

309
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:32,480
 This was before I met him

310
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,920
 Way before I met him. I didn't have to rely on anyone

311
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:41,960
 I wanted to help out my family and I want it to be my own source

312
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:46,360
 I didn't want to have to go to anyone or ask anyone for help

313
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:53,260
 Which that in and of itself isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I will

314
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,560
 unpack that later

315
00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:02,680
 So I worked all the hours I would stay late and then I would take up extra tutoring on the weekends

316
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:07,440
 I didn't really need to but I felt like I had to I didn't want to ever

317
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,620
 Go back and see the days of when I was growing up

318
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:18,540
 Because we didn't really have much and so for me. I wanted to build my own city. I

319
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:23,540
 Wanted independence. I wanted to be the source and

320
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,740
 For a while. It was fantastic

321
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:30,460
 It was great. I could go on holiday

322
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:36,540
 I can get up and do whatever I wanted my family would come to me and ask for help and it felt good

323
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,740
 to be able to give I

324
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,660
 also

325
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:43,220
 Really enjoyed the compliments that came with it

326
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:49,740
 I enjoyed the praise of men when my friends or people that I knew would be like wow

327
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:56,060
 You do you go live your best life? I'd be like, yes. I am living my best life

328
00:26:56,060 --> 00:27:01,540
 I felt good and I sort of reveled in that praise

329
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:08,340
 I I really enjoyed it. And so I continued to build my city and I very

330
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:12,380
 very rarely gave thanks to God or even

331
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:15,820
 Considered him in my job at all

332
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:23,100
 I was building for my own purpose my own goal for myself that idol of self again and

333
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,260
 God really didn't feature

334
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:29,300
 But after a while it started to feel

335
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:37,560
 Empty I started to feel like it wasn't enough. There was something more there was something missing

336
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:45,300
 And at church there was a mission trip to Thailand and when I went there it hit me like a ton of bricks

337
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:49,100
 Oh my gosh, there's more to life than making money

338
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,540
 shocker and so when I returned

339
00:27:52,540 --> 00:28:01,500
 there was this shift, but I still didn't really know what to do with it and in that season I felt the Lord call me to

340
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,340
 quit my job and

341
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:09,180
 move to a different country to go into ministry and

342
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:13,300
 When I did I will tell you it was the hardest

343
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:21,140
 Season of my life. I saw what I had built for myself my savings start to

344
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,660
 Deplete my sense of security

345
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:29,900
 Started to wane my source what I felt I was relying on

346
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,820
 wasn't really there anymore and

347
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:40,180
 Thankfully God used the life of my pastor and his family to really show me

348
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:43,620
 How to build on the solid rock

349
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:47,280
 They didn't need to amass wealth

350
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:54,060
 They were content with anything they had they knew that their source was from God

351
00:28:54,060 --> 00:29:01,540
 They knew that their identity was in Christ and not in how much they had or what car they drove

352
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:09,140
 They had true peace and they really didn't have much and I remember looking back

353
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:12,620
 At when I did have much and I still had anxiety

354
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:20,780
 Any minute I kept thinking like what if I lose my job or what if my savings just go or what if something happens?

355
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:27,380
 but they didn't have and they were fine because God was their source and their peace and

356
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:31,580
 So when I started to actually follow their lead

357
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:32,860
 I

358
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:35,500
 Started to feel that exact same piece

359
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:42,340
 I realized that my search had been so futile and pointless and that actually

360
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,880
 Building my life on Christ was what I needed to do

361
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:54,300
 Now I am NOT saying it's bad to have money. It is not it's not bad to be wealthy

362
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,780
 Either it's all about our heart posture

363
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:05,100
 So there's a story in the New Testament again about Jesus and he tells a rich young ruler

364
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:12,360
 to sell everything that he has and follow him and we see that the rich young ruler was

365
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,660
 Extremely sad and couldn't do it

366
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:23,580
 Now this doesn't mean that rich people can't be saved because they can and it doesn't mean that success is bad

367
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:29,140
 But perhaps the money the power that it enabled him to have at the time

368
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:34,220
 were also an idol or a source for him outside of God and

369
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:39,700
 For me, it was my safety net. I felt like it was my security

370
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:44,220
 it was like my blanket and when I put all those things to the side and

371
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:51,300
 truly trusted God with my finances the peace of God that I gained was

372
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:55,100
 Crazy, like I can't put it into words

373
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:59,420
 And so now looking back at the golden calf story

374
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:06,620
 I can identify many parallels in my own life and maybe you guys can in your own as well

375
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:11,380
 So not trusting God led to idolatry

376
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:17,820
 Since they didn't hear from God for a while. They didn't know where Moses was. They weren't really sure what was gonna happen

377
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:24,420
 They fashioned a God from their own jewelry one on their own terms

378
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:30,820
 so they didn't have to wonder if God was around because they had made their own I

379
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:39,340
 Wonder if we do the same in our own desert seasons when we feel like everything's silent

380
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:47,340
 And we don't necessarily hear from God. Do we also fashion and make our own gods out of our own hands?

381
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:52,700
 Maybe you're in a season where you're having problems with your boss

382
00:31:52,700 --> 00:32:00,700
 you've prayed and fasted you've said all the prayers you've tried to be kind and show love and

383
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,740
 Nothing is working

384
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:09,260
 Maybe you feel like you're at the point of getting laid off from your job

385
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:17,500
 Perhaps people are getting laid off around you and you think maybe I'm next or maybe

386
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:25,020
 God has placed you in a certain industry or an office and you know that God has put you there

387
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:30,300
 But you're starting to doubt because God's been silent for a season

388
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:36,860
 You're not sure if this is what you should be doing or what is gonna happen to you next

389
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:43,860
 Maybe you're not even sure if God cares about this area of your life

390
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:52,260
 After all, you're not a pastor or in full-time ministry. So maybe work. Yeah, that's an area that God doesn't care about

391
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:57,780
 So we start to build and fashion gods of our own hands

392
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:02,580
 Maybe without praying to God you go and confront angrily your boss

393
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:10,060
 or you decide to quit the job that you know that God placed you in or you go and seek advice from

394
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:15,500
 ungodly sources and you start to feel a sense of security and

395
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:19,940
 That you're in control of your life outside of God

396
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:24,800
 You start to make like the Israelites God's to go before you

397
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:31,340
 All outside of God, but the Bible shows us that we become frustrated

398
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:34,260
 in despair and

399
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:38,940
 Ultimately fail when we do all these things outside of God

400
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:43,700
 Or perhaps it's the actual culture that we live in

401
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,780
 maybe

402
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:51,180
 Idolatry is normal in your workplace, and I don't mean just worshiping a statue

403
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:58,260
 Maybe your work culture is super fast-paced and you have people around you saying oh, don't worry

404
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:01,420
 This is just what you have to do to get to the top

405
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:07,660
 You know that it's against the Word of God against your morals, but don't worry

406
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:14,460
 Everyone does it no one will know we just change a few things here. We do a little bit here

407
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:20,260
 Don't worry about it, and you know in your heart that it's not in line with the Word of God

408
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:28,300
 You start to compromise your morals your integrity to get to the top and to reach your personal goal

409
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:35,220
 it can be extremely easy for us as humans to get sidetracked and

410
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:41,180
 Influenced by what happens around us even when we've promised ourselves that we won't

411
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:46,500
 it's really really easy if many people around you are doing it and

412
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:50,660
 So it's really important as Christians to regularly

413
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:56,180
 Check our hearts the posture of our hearts with the Word of God

414
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:59,860
 So there's a great verse for me in

415
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:09,540
 Colossians 3 23 that I usually use as like a heart checker and it says whatever you do

416
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:14,140
 Work heartily as for the Lord and not for men

417
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:19,820
 Whatever you do work heartily as for the Lord and not for men

418
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:24,740
 So it always forces me always to ask myself

419
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:27,740
 Who am I doing this for?

420
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:32,780
 Is it for God or is it for men when I find myself at school?

421
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:39,100
 frustrated with all of the teacher admin or sometimes the kids I

422
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:43,980
 Go to a place where I ask myself. Why am I here?

423
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:49,780
 And I'm reminded by the Holy Spirit that he's put me here one

424
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:56,620
 To show his love to these students and to to be a light in my place of work

425
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:00,060
 Not for a raise though. That would be great

426
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:05,260
 Not to gain the good graces of my boss for a promotion

427
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:09,740
 But to be a light to be the believer amongst others

428
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,740
 to work

429
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:17,940
 Diligently and so when we put that at the forefront of our minds, am I doing this for men?

430
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,820
 Am I doing this for God?

431
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:27,500
 It really shifts your focus and it helps you to get back into your purpose and what God has for you

432
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:31,780
 Whenever this happens, there is a shift in my perspective as well

433
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:35,380
 and I'm able to just do what God has called me to do and

434
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:43,220
 This isn't just for teachers and it's not just for pastors as well. It's for every single believer

435
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:49,020
 We are all called to work for the Lord in every area of our lives

436
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,580
 regardless of what our job is

437
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:58,540
 We are all called to work for the Lord in every area of our lives

438
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:01,500
 regardless of what our job is

439
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:07,260
 It applies to builders, flight attendants, freelancers, stay-at-home mums

440
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:11,660
 Students, applies to students too, police officers, government workers

441
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:18,980
 Whatever job you can think of you are part of this. Whatever season God has you in

442
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:22,940
 He wants to be first. He deserves honor

443
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:29,260
 He deserves praise. It's also a reminder that we are placed in our jobs

444
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:35,260
 Not to get sucked in to the culture of idolatry like the Israelites

445
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:39,980
 but to make sure that we are shifting the culture and

446
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:45,540
 Doing things God's way in partnership with him

447
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:50,620
 We are making him Lord in all parts of our lives

448
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:53,740
 including our work

449
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:58,460
 So I want to ask you guys today

450
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:02,180
 What is your heart posture?

451
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:07,260
 What does your day-to-day work look like?

452
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:10,420
 Do you sometimes feel

453
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,100
 pressure

454
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:16,140
 To get involved with the culture that is

455
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,220
 obviously

456
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,220
 away from the Word of God

457
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,780
 Do you sometimes feel like

458
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:27,140
 You don't trust God in the area of work

459
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:33,100
 Do you sometimes feel like you can't even pray to God about your job?

460
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:40,260
 Do you sometimes feel like work has taken over your life and

461
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:48,380
 You can't seem to find your way back to God or to having him at the center

462
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:54,940
 God is calling us back to a place of repentance and

463
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:58,300
 realignment with him

464
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:05,300
 He wants to shift our focus away from the work of our hands and into his work

465
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:09,900
 He wants to shift our focus to him

466
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,780
 And so let's use this time and

467
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:16,660
 Speak to the Holy Spirit

468
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:19,060
 for each and every one of us

469
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:22,620
 We speak to him and he will start to highlight

470
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:29,180
 Areas in your life areas in your work where you need to realign and turn back to him

471
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:36,700
 We're never too far gone. There's always a way to put God back at the center

472
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:44,060
 And so let's just spend some time with the Holy Spirit

473
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:54,060
