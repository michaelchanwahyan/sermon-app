1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Thank you, Alison. Happy Chinese New Year, everyone.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,200
 So I hope you all had some good time over the past few days,

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,760
 perhaps enjoying some good food,

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,680
 enjoying some time with your family and friends.

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,440
 Or if you say, "Oh, I don't really celebrate Chinese New Year,"

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,760
 I hope you enjoy some time off during the public holiday as well.

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,920
 So, my name is Jennifer.

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,960
 I grew up in Hong Kong and my family is quite a traditional Chinese one.

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,560
 So Chinese New Year has always been a big thing that we celebrate,

10
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,880
 especially when I was a kid.

11
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,280
 So there are a lot of things that we do as a family.

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,480
 We need to clean our house.

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,840
 We go visit our families.

14
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,800
 We buy new clothes and we will host dinners at our place as well.

15
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,200
 So it's been a lot that we do in the New Year,

16
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,160
 but the intention behind the whole thing is really

17
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,920
 we hope to start our year well.

18
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,160
 So among all the things,

19
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,080
 there's one thing that I would like to highlight to you today

20
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,960
 is during Chinese New Year, we will say some blessings to each other.

21
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,160
 So, for example, my family has been teaching me that

22
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,600
 each family can be different,

23
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,280
 but my family has been teaching me that

24
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,400
 the very first thing I say to a person

25
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,160
 if this is my first time seeing them in a New Year is a blessing.

26
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,280
 So in case, like, for example, Gordon,

27
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,840
 this is our first time meeting in a New Year.

28
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,240
 So I'm supposed to say a blessing over him,

29
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,440
 something like "Happy Chinese New Year" or "Congratulations on Chinese New Year,"

30
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,280
 things like that.

31
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,240
 The very first thing I say to him should be a blessing.

32
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,760
 So let me introduce a few blessings

33
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:53,400
 that are commonly used among the Chinese community in Hong Kong.

34
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,640
 So the first one, I think many of you will be heard of this,

35
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,800
 is "Gong Hei Fat Choy."

36
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,800
 It means "Wish you get rich."

37
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,160
 And then the second one is "Sun Tai Gin Hong,"

38
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,200
 is "Wish you good health."

39
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,040
 Sounds good, right?

40
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,240
 And then the third one is an interesting one

41
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,560
 that I would like to teach you,

42
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,560
 is "Sam Sang Si Sing."

43
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,640
 (audience murmurs)

44
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,480
 Doing good.

45
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,400
 And the literal translation is,

46
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,640
 "I wish your heart desires come true."

47
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,280
 It sounds really good, right?

48
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,920
 Sometimes I really hope things happen that way,

49
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,400
 that, like, my heart desires will come true.

50
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,840
 And, yeah, as I said, like, the whole idea behind this

51
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,720
 is to start our year well,

52
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,320
 and there's also a belief behind that.

53
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,480
 If we do these things, it will bring us good luck

54
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,040
 throughout the whole year.

55
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,320
 So my family is not a Christian one,

56
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:55,480
 so they really take this tradition very seriously.

57
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,360
 So growing up, the very first thing I need to do

58
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,560
 on a New Year day, before even brushing my teeth,

59
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,320
 is to go to my parents' bedroom

60
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,280
 and say at least three blessings to each of them.

61
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,080
 If I pass the exam, I will get my life's seat.

62
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,920
 (audience laughs)

63
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,760
 From them.

64
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,000
 So that's how it works.

65
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,840
 And also, my parents would always make sure

66
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,400
 I say the right thing to the right people,

67
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,640
 like, especially when they're around me.

68
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,360
 So, for example, if I'm seeing an older person,

69
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,200
 I must say, "I wish you good health."

70
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,800
 If I'm seeing a business person,

71
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,160
 I must say, "I wish you get rich."

72
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,200
 So this is how serious it is for my family.

73
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,320
 It sounds like an oral exam, I know,

74
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,480
 but sometimes I feel like it as well.

75
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,520
 So, slowly, this whole tradition,

76
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,280
 because I have to do this every year,

77
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,320
 my parents will make me say something

78
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,240
 to them and to other people.

79
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:02,120
 And it has become a formula to me in my head.

80
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,240
 So whenever I see a person,

81
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:09,040
 my brain will automatically go search the right word

82
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,840
 I should say to them in a new year.

83
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,440
 But do these words run through my heart?

84
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,440
 Do I really bless them wholeheartedly?

85
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,120
 Maybe not.

86
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,120
 I almost feel like I'm just doing it for doing's sake.

87
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,160
 I do it because this is what a Chinese does during CNY.

88
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,320
 And how about you?

89
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,440
 If you're a Chinese in this room,

90
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,760
 perhaps you can resonate this with me as well.

91
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,400
 Perhaps you also find yourself just blessing one another,

92
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,960
 like out of the ritual or tradition.

93
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,960
 It feels like we are doing things out of habit.

94
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,920
 And I hope I'm not lonely in this room feeling that way.

95
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,520
 And perhaps for those who are not Chinese in this room,

96
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,520
 you might not 100% understand what I was saying,

97
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,080
 but actually there are things

98
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,840
 we Christians say to each other as well.

99
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,560
 Let me give you some example.

100
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,920
 Like, God bless you.

101
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,560
 Or I'll pray for you.

102
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,840
 Or, I hear some laugh already.

103
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,480
 Let's catch up some time.

104
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,680
 How about this?

105
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,560
 Or I would like to involve more and serve more.

106
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,080
 Do they sound familiar?

107
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,680
 Yeah, these are the things that we say to each other as well.

108
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,880
 But are we saying from the bottom of our hearts,

109
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,960
 do we always mean it?

110
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,680
 Or do we always back our words with our actions?

111
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,120
 Last week, Pastor Promise shared with us

112
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,120
 that Jonathan said he loved David as himself.

113
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,800
 And Jonathan backed these words up

114
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,400
 with his whole life, actually.

115
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,600
 So for us as well,

116
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,400
 it is important to back our words with actions.

117
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,520
 And right now, we are still at the beginning of the year.

118
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,280
 Do any of us have the New Year resolution

119
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,960
 of spending more time with God,

120
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,920
 or spending more time to pray,

121
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,600
 or spending more time to read the Bible?

122
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,840
 I'm one of them.

123
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,400
 So how is it going?

124
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,560
 I need to confess that I say these things every year

125
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,120
 at the beginning of the year.

126
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,840
 But when my schedule gets full,

127
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,000
 the first thing I sacrifice is spending time with God too.

128
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,200
 And of course, personally,

129
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,480
 I want to spend more time with God.

130
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,680
 And I'm sure all of us in this room

131
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,040
 would want to be closer to God as well.

132
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,720
 We want to be more like Jesus.

133
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,200
 We want to make Him pleased with all the things we do.

134
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,560
 But why do we stop at wanting to do something,

135
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,960
 but not making it happen?

136
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,200
 Why do we say we are going to do something,

137
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,160
 but not following through with it?

138
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,400
 So to be honest, our faith does not work

139
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,480
 like the Chinese New Year blessing,

140
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

141
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,200
 may your heart's desire come true.

142
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:20,200
 Our heart's desire do not just come true automatically.

143
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:25,800
 And we always need to do something and make them happen.

144
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,480
 In the year of 2025, as a church,

145
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,400
 we have a theme of action.

146
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,400
 I think many of us are very excited

147
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,440
 to do something together.

148
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,560
 It is really essential to allow our action

149
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,160
 to align with our heart's desire,

150
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,520
 and more importantly, to align with our faith.

151
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:51,320
 We don't want to do something together just for doing's sake

152
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,000
 or the other way around,

153
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,640
 that we want to do something,

154
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,760
 but we stop at just wanting or saying

155
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,480
 and end up not doing it.

156
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,200
 So it is amazing that there's a whole book in the Bible

157
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:09,040
 that tells us about moving our faith into action.

158
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,640
 As we read it, we might find his theology

159
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,800
 a little bit different from Paul's

160
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,200
 saved by faith along theology,

161
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:21,000
 as he argues the importance of action coming with our faith.

162
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,560
 But if we look into it deeper,

163
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,800
 we will find it makes sense

164
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,800
 because he asks practical application to Paul's theology.

165
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,080
 And this book is written by the apostle James,

166
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,760
 and therefore the book is called the book of James.

167
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,000
 We will look into a few verses in chapter two today.

168
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,400
 And let me read it for you.

169
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,120
 What good is it, my brothers and sisters,

170
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,840
 if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds?

171
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,040
 Can such faith save them?

172
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,840
 Suppose a brother or a sister

173
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,600
 is without clothes and daily food.

174
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,720
 If one of you says to them,

175
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,840
 "Go in peace, keep warm and well fed,"

176
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,320
 but does nothing about their physical needs,

177
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,120
 what good is it?

178
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,740
 In the same way, faith by itself,

179
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:12,200
 if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.

180
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,200
 But someone will say, "You have faith, I have deeds.

181
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,160
 "Show me your faith without deeds,

182
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,080
 "and I will show you my faith by my deeds."

183
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,120
 You believe that there is one God, good.

184
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,760
 Even the demons believe that and shudder.

185
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,480
 You foolish person, do you want evidence

186
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,480
 that faith without deeds is useless?

187
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,600
 Was not our father Abraham considered righteous

188
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,080
 for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?

189
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,960
 You see that his faith and his actions were working together

190
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,260
 and his faith was made complete by what he did.

191
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,800
 And the scripture was fulfilled that says,

192
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,400
 "Abraham believed God and it was credited to him

193
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,580
 "as righteousness, and he was called God's friend."

194
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:04,160
 You see that a person is considered righteous

195
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,480
 by what they do and not by faith alone.

196
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,180
 In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute

197
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,660
 considered righteous for what she did

198
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,640
 when she gave lodging to the spies

199
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,180
 and sent them off in a different direction?

200
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:22,140
 As the body without the spirit is dead,

201
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,060
 so faith without deeds is dead.

202
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:30,440
 So here, James is clarifying what a true faith is,

203
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,340
 what it means to be a Christian.

204
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,020
 James asked us a question.

205
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:39,200
 What good is faith without deeds?

206
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,000
 In other words, what good is faith without action?

207
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,080
 Is faith only about believing

208
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,560
 there's one God who is Jesus Christ?

209
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,620
 Let's ask ourselves this question for a moment.

210
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,720
 Is our faith authentic faith

211
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,440
 if we never reach to a point of action?

212
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,780
 We can imagine if the apostles who had faith,

213
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,760
 but they never reached to a point of action,

214
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,800
 I think the church today would not have existed.

215
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,280
 And as Jesus called the disciples,

216
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,360
 he did not just call them to believe

217
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,520
 that he is the son of God.

218
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:25,180
 In fact, Jesus called the disciples to follow,

219
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,840
 and following is an action.

220
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,520
 Some of you might start thinking,

221
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,140
 didn't Jesus and the apostle Paul emphasize

222
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,040
 that we are saved by faith and grace

223
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,020
 instead of following the law?

224
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:45,100
 That is very true that we are saved by grace of God alone.

225
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,860
 And in fact, we can never save ourselves by doing anything.

226
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,400
 The deeds James is referring here

227
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,080
 isn't the deeds of the law,

228
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,400
 but the deeds as a demonstration of our faith outwardly.

229
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,000
 It might sound similar or it might look the same

230
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,520
 because we can be doing the same thing,

231
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,020
 but internally it could be very different.

232
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,520
 Let me give you a simple example.

233
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,720
 So let's talk about praying before a meal.

234
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,520
 So I grew up with a teaching that if I am a real Christian,

235
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,800
 I must pray before every meal.

236
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,440
 And it doesn't matter whom I'm eating with,

237
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,640
 it doesn't matter whether or not they are Christians,

238
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,320
 but my prayer needs to be visible

239
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,880
 to the people I'm eating with.

240
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,640
 I can be praying silently,

241
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,680
 but I need to show that I'm praying

242
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,520
 and show that I'm a Christian.

243
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,440
 So if we think about this,

244
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,920
 like it sounds like the works of the law, right?

245
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,720
 Because it operates like this,

246
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,440
 because we are a Christian,

247
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,440
 therefore we need to pray before every meal

248
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,880
 to show that I'm a Christian.

249
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,080
 But while there are other people

250
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,760
 who praise before every meal,

251
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,200
 because they believe that,

252
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,720
 we believe that everything is provided by God,

253
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,760
 every meal is provided by God.

254
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,160
 So we want to give him thanks before every meal.

255
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,960
 And it is totally different from the motive.

256
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,480
 Like it is an outworking action from what we believe.

257
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,480
 So these two things, these two examples,

258
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,360
 they can look exactly the same.

259
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,600
 We are both like, they're all praying before a meal,

260
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,240
 but they actually come from very different motives.

261
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,800
 And therefore they can have very different results.

262
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,960
 And I want us to pay attention

263
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,960
 to how James understands the relationship

264
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,000
 of faith and deeds.

265
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,200
 In verse 14, he says,

266
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,600
 "What good is it if someone claims to have faith,

267
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,560
 "but has no deeds?"

268
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,160
 Let's pay attention here.

269
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,400
 James didn't say,

270
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:57,400
 "What good is it if someone has faith, but has no deeds?"

271
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,760
 He said, "Someone who claims to have faith."

272
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:05,320
 In other words, James is referring to someone

273
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,320
 who says they have faith,

274
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,240
 but never reached to a point of action.

275
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,760
 And these people, they are deceiving themselves.

276
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:19,060
 And the faith is just a self-declaration.

277
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,760
 But again, James is not introducing

278
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,000
 some new salvation formula

279
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,760
 that is different from Jesus' teaching.

280
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,160
 He's not telling us that faith plus action

281
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,400
 equals to salvation.

282
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,660
 It's not like now we have faith in Jesus

283
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,800
 and we add a little bit of action in there,

284
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,920
 then that's salvation.

285
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,480
 He is telling us that faith by its own nature

286
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,780
 includes action.

287
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:51,720
 In other words, action is the result of our faith.

288
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,740
 We desire to do something for God

289
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:58,040
 because we have been given a new hope,

290
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,800
 a new life, a new identity.

291
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,080
 And out of the faith and salvation,

292
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,240
 we have received from God,

293
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,280
 we put that salvation into practice.

294
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,460
 It doesn't add to our salvation,

295
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:15,000
 it is an outworking of our salvation.

296
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,420
 So action is the natural result of our faith.

297
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:23,960
 So we can't have faith but do nothing about it.

298
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,480
 And James used Abraham as an example,

299
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,720
 that Abraham has faith,

300
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,240
 but he also had deeds that originated in his faith.

301
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,680
 And because of his actions that followed from his faith,

302
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,200
 God declared him as righteous.

303
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:48,380
 Faith is like a seed planted inside each one of us

304
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:53,000
 and our words and our actions are the fruits of our faith.

305
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,600
 In fact, we are all different

306
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,440
 and our action can look very differently.

307
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,160
 And most of us here in this room,

308
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,360
 I'm sure you're not called to sacrifice your son, right?

309
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,200
 Right, Alison?

310
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,240
 [audience laughing]

311
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,080
 But there is one thing that is applicable

312
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,200
 to all of us today is like,

313
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,120
 there is a cost in following Jesus.

314
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,480
 It means putting our faith into action,

315
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,520
 it means following God's call and do something.

316
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,040
 And it could look differently to each of us.

317
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,020
 So I would like to ask, how is God calling you to act?

318
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:39,160
 Is there anything God is conflicting you to do for him

319
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,300
 in the coming year?

320
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:45,400
 One more thing I would like to highlight in this passage

321
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:50,400
 is that James concerns our faith in relation to others.

322
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,280
 He gave us a scenario in verses 15 to 16

323
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:58,000
 that if a person who has no clothes, no daily food

324
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,680
 and he came to us, but if we say to them,

325
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,060
 go in peace, keep warm and well fed,

326
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,280
 but do nothing about their physical needs,

327
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,980
 how do we feel about this?

328
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,920
 It sounds terrible, right?

329
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,400
 But if we are honest,

330
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,140
 sometimes we Christians do this as well.

331
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,540
 When we see people in need, we might say,

332
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,200
 God bless you or I'll pray for you.

333
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,700
 Praying is great and blessing people is wonderful as well,

334
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,260
 it's powerful.

335
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,580
 We need to continue to do this to people.

336
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:40,580
 But let's be reminded that our faith cannot stop

337
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,780
 at saying something nice to each other,

338
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,980
 but not doing anything about it.

339
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:51,000
 James says, such faith is dead.

340
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,900
 Let's do better than this.

341
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:57,160
 So what does living faith mean?

342
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:02,060
 If we read the rest of the book of James,

343
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:05,220
 which is heavily on the topic of faith and deeds,

344
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:09,140
 he says a lot about our relationship with other.

345
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,620
 He speaks again favoritism,

346
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,820
 he says about caring for the poor.

347
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,460
 Again, this is not some laws for us to follow,

348
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:22,040
 but our faith conflicts us to showcase the love of God

349
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,000
 to people around us.

350
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,940
 This is who God is.

351
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:29,940
 This is a God who loves and cares for people,

352
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,200
 not just saying it, but through our action.

353
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,040
 And sometimes it will mean meeting people's physical needs.

354
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,080
 I'm not saying that we need to meet everyone's need

355
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,080
 when they come all the time,

356
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,720
 but sometimes it does mean that we need to meet

357
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,600
 physical needs of people.

358
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:54,960
 And more importantly, God called us to be part of his action.

359
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,160
 He called us to be more like him.

360
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,160
 And through our actions, we are demonstrating who God is

361
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,460
 to the people around us.

362
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,940
 It is always about people.

363
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:12,080
 God does not just intend us to be isolated

364
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,360
 and to be close to him only.

365
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,680
 God always intend us to follow our faith

366
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:22,520
 to shape us in how we are interacting with people.

367
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:28,880
 This is also what Jesus commanded us, to love one another.

368
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,400
 As we are actioning, it is important to keep in mind

369
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,480
 that we are not just doing something good

370
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,080
 in the public's eyes,

371
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,260
 but we are actually doing the work of God

372
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,340
 as the followers of Jesus.

373
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,300
 As the love of God is in us,

374
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,880
 and we are to reflect who God is

375
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,380
 and bring the love of God to the world.

376
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:54,320
 This might sound very big and scary,

377
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,380
 but loving people can be really reflected

378
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,420
 in the smallest ways on a personal level.

379
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,720
 It is really a way of living.

380
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,160
 So how do we do this?

381
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,480
 How do we practically put James' call into action

382
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,760
 in the city of Hong Kong?

383
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,400
 In a relationship that we had around us?

384
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,040
 How do we ensure we're not just saying words,

385
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,760
 but putting our faith into action?

386
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,560
 Let me give you a few examples

387
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,280
 to help you to think about this,

388
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,160
 and then you can think about how you can apply it

389
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,000
 into your own life.

390
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,280
 So in today's culture, people tend to put ourselves first,

391
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,240
 especially in Hong Kong.

392
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,560
 We value efficiency and convenience.

393
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,640
 We can't waste one minute on anything, really.

394
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,300
 If we get to the train station,

395
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,860
 if we see the next train is in three minutes,

396
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,520
 it's too long, right?

397
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:53,160
 And you can tell how efficient we are

398
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,400
 by how we walk on the street,

399
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,960
 by how we drive on the road, right?

400
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,200
 So Hong Kong people do not really value being considerate,

401
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,200
 to be honest.

402
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,000
 You know what I mean?

403
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,080
 So, (laughs)

404
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,040
 so what does following Jesus in this space look like?

405
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,000
 How can we be considerate to people

406
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,240
 as we are living in this environment?

407
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,160
 And also, with our friends as well,

408
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,480
 we always say to each other,

409
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,920
 "Let's catch up more, let's hang out."

410
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,400
 But do we always put that in our schedule

411
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,720
 and make time for that?

412
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,040
 Or we put it in our schedule,

413
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,440
 it makes it to my schedule,

414
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,360
 but I don't feel like it on the day,

415
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,240
 so what do I do?

416
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,840
 These things sound familiar, right?

417
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,580
 So what does loving people mean in this space as well?

418
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,760
 And I think being consistent and honoring people's time

419
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,100
 is one way to do it.

420
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:57,380
 And our faith does not only exist for the big moments,

421
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,880
 the turning points in our life.

422
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,800
 Our faith is also reflected in these smallest things

423
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,280
 in our everyday life, how we treat people,

424
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,300
 how we make choices,

425
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:14,360
 how we choose to put other people's needs above ourselves.

426
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:20,480
 Where do we choose to sit or stand in a public transport

427
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,560
 or on a Sunday, or in what condition

428
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,300
 we are leaving the bathroom to the next person

429
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,280
 is one way to reflect it.

430
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,920
 You know what I mean?

431
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,280
 These smallest things in our life,

432
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,040
 have we thought about what kind of faith

433
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:40,640
 are we demonstrating, or what do we want to demonstrate?

434
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,640
 How is your faith conflicting you

435
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,900
 on how to interact with people?

436
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:50,780
 Is your faith conflicting you to do something

437
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,240
 for the people in need?

438
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:58,740
 Let me share my story of how God conflicted me personally

439
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:02,940
 to put my faith into action when I was in seminary.

440
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,740
 So I started studying in seminary

441
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,460
 before I actually started working in ministry.

442
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:14,300
 I was working in corporate, I was thinking about ministry,

443
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:19,300
 so I started a part-time program in a seminary.

444
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:23,240
 And then later I joined the staff team at the Fine,

445
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,740
 so I've started working here also as a full-time staff.

446
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,660
 So in my seminary life,

447
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,540
 I have always been a part-time student

448
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,980
 with a full-time job.

449
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,120
 As you can imagine,

450
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:40,980
 I need to be quite diligent with how I use my time.

451
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,780
 I need to set good boundaries at work

452
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,700
 so I can get off on time and show in school, in person,

453
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:50,620
 and yes, my school requires me to go in person all the time.

454
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:54,900
 And then also to make time to do my coursework as well,

455
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,580
 to write assignments, write the papers,

456
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,100
 so my time being in school campus

457
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,020
 has always been very functional.

458
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:06,060
 When I show up in school, I was either in class

459
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:10,060
 or either I'm hiding in library doing my research

460
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,320
 and doing my homework.

461
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,200
 By the way, I love working in library.

462
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,180
 It's quiet, it has a lot of books and resources,

463
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:21,140
 and I can be quiet processing the thoughts in my mind,

464
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,980
 so I really love that.

465
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:27,460
 However, one big belief of my school

466
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:31,460
 is that we are a learning community,

467
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:34,980
 and community plays a big part in our learning

468
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:38,900
 and equipping process, which I really appreciate now,

469
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,700
 not so much back then.

470
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:44,660
 So whenever my school has some optional events,

471
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,260
 like show-show events,

472
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,680
 I had a very easy excuse that I say all the time.

473
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,060
 I'm just a part-time student,

474
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,740
 I can't commit to anything else.

475
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,860
 So my school was very gracious

476
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:59,420
 to part-time students like me,

477
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:02,860
 and I held on to my excuse for a few years.

478
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:06,340
 In my first few years, I was really happy with my pattern,

479
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:09,300
 but until I started working here in ministry,

480
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:13,220
 I started to feel that my study pattern doesn't seem right.

481
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,520
 It feels like I'm just there

482
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,220
 to fulfill the course requirement

483
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,880
 and to just get a degree.

484
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:22,900
 Although if I was still able to learn something new,

485
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,300
 that was not enough.

486
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:28,740
 So I realized my pattern does not allow me

487
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:33,740
 to fulfill what I was sensing God is calling me to do.

488
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,940
 Something needs to change.

489
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:40,580
 If I also believe that community plays a part

490
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,860
 in my learning and equipping process,

491
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,260
 I can't be just showing up to the class

492
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:49,160
 and then hiding in the library all the time.

493
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,980
 If I also believe that community

494
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,060
 is an expression of my faith,

495
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:58,780
 if I believe that Jesus is calling me

496
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:01,180
 to learn with those people,

497
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,660
 I need to actually spend time with them.

498
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:09,180
 And my next steps is to actually doing it.

499
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,120
 I can't be saying to my schoolmates

500
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,080
 that I want to get more involved

501
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,380
 and spend more time with you,

502
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,200
 but not doing anything about it.

503
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,940
 I needed to sort out my priorities.

504
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:25,300
 It doesn't mean that I don't care

505
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,820
 about my work here or my study anymore.

506
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:31,940
 Those two things still have higher priority in my life,

507
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:35,420
 but I needed to prioritize my schoolmates,

508
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:38,620
 perhaps over my excuses at the moments

509
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,300
 that I don't feel like it.

510
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:45,560
 And I need to prioritize people over my comfort zone,

511
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,640
 which is the library.

512
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,580
 I needed to change my pattern,

513
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,340
 which means showing up to the common area

514
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,480
 instead of the library,

515
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,580
 make time to talk to people,

516
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,720
 enjoying their social events.

517
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,540
 And I needed to drop my excuses

518
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,840
 and walk out of my comfort zone.

519
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,620
 Was I stretched?

520
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,500
 Absolutely.

521
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,900
 Does it worth it?

522
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,800
 Even so.

523
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:18,320
 So I wonder if you're holding on to any excuses

524
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,480
 and allowing those to stop you

525
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,360
 from doing what God is calling you to do.

526
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:28,620
 As I shared at the beginning,

527
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:32,380
 during CNY, we often say things to people out of habit

528
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,900
 or rituals, but not really meaning it.

529
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:38,640
 We can't go forward as Christians here,

530
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,760
 especially in the year of action in 2025

531
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,300
 with the same attitude.

532
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:47,900
 We must check our hearts and ask ourselves,

533
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,900
 where our motives are coming from.

534
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,380
 This is step number one.

535
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,460
 But we can't stop here.

536
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:59,420
 We can't just follow with our mouths only.

537
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:02,420
 We must put our faith into action.

538
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,980
 In order to do that,

539
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,860
 we will look into some practical ways

540
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:09,940
 we can put our faith into actions.

541
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:13,660
 So the first one is to seek God.

542
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,500
 As I said just now,

543
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:19,760
 checking our hearts and motive is step one.

544
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,800
 Before we take any actions,

545
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,820
 we need to be intentional about

546
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:29,820
 to allow God speak to us on what and how to act,

547
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:33,460
 just like what the apostles did.

548
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:37,220
 Like I said, it doesn't have to be big things all the time.

549
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:41,540
 We can ask God each day how we can demonstrate our faith

550
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:44,380
 and his love before we go about our day,

551
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,740
 before we go to work, before we go to school,

552
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:50,940
 when we wake up in the morning or on our way.

553
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,780
 We can ask God about that.

554
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:57,860
 And also, if you have important things during the day,

555
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:00,300
 do that before your important meetings.

556
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,900
 Ask God how would he want you to act.

557
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:10,100
 And then number two is we need to watch our choices.

558
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,380
 As we go about our day,

559
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:14,460
 there are a lot of things we do out of habits,

560
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,140
 like getting on trains, going to work,

561
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,880
 going out for lunch, doing our groceries.

562
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,620
 We might not pay attention to these moments,

563
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:26,780
 but there are actually a lot of human interactions

564
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,380
 in those spaces,

565
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,660
 and we make a lot of choices out of habit.

566
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:35,980
 So perhaps we can be intentional about our choices

567
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,580
 and ask ourselves,

568
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:41,260
 are we choosing to be considerate to people?

569
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:44,460
 Are we choosing to demonstrate love

570
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,420
 to people with our choices?

571
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:51,340
 And number three, it is our priorities.

572
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:55,460
 Let's be honest, we all have limited time and resources.

573
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,420
 As we look at our schedule, ask ourselves,

574
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:01,820
 what are our top priorities

575
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:04,900
 that we must give our attention to?

576
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,540
 And what are the things that are occupying us

577
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:10,480
 from doing the important things?

578
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,740
 And are there any excuses we are holding onto,

579
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,640
 like what I did in seminary?

580
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:20,620
 If there is something that God is convicting us to do,

581
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,620
 we need to make time for that

582
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,440
 and make them one of our priorities.

583
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,960
 And the final one is to honor our promises.

584
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:34,420
 If we say to God or we say to each other

585
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:38,460
 that we will do something, let's honor that.

586
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:42,120
 If you are bad at this, perhaps put it in your diaries

587
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,240
 or setting an alarm or reminder,

588
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,880
 or perhaps ask someone who is close to you

589
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,640
 to keep you on track and hold you accountable.

590
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,420
 Just find a way that is workable for you.

591
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:01,020
 And let's approach 2025 together

592
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:05,680
 with putting our words into action and live out our faith.

593
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,220
 If we want to spend more time to read the Bible,

594
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,540
 open the Bible and read it.

595
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,380
 I can't think of anything else

596
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,420
 that other way that we can do it.

597
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:19,540
 If you want to spend more time to pray,

598
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:22,980
 take away your phone or other distractions and pray.

599
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,380
 This is the only way to do it.

600
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:28,220
 If you want to serve the people around you,

601
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,380
 make sure you commit yourself to prioritize this

602
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,900
 so you don't make people down.

603
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:37,920
 And I hope in 2025, we will be a community

604
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:42,340
 that allow our faith to shape us inwardly and outwardly.

605
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:46,060
 And also as a community,

606
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:49,640
 as we are entering into a year of action,

607
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:54,620
 if you also believe that action is part of our faith,

608
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:58,620
 get ourself ready to be part of the action.

609
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:01,580
 Not because everyone else is doing it,

610
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:04,300
 not just doing it for doing's sake,

611
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:08,420
 but let's demonstrate our faith as a church.

612
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:12,040
 So I hope this is encouraging,

613
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,980
 this excites you to do something for God.

614
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:19,020
 As I said, it could look very differently to each one of us

615
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,500
 because we are all unique

616
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,980
 and we all have different sphere of influence.

617
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:29,260
 So I'm not sure how you feel about this

618
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:32,620
 or how clear you feel that God is calling you

619
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:36,140
 to do something, but I'm sure if you are a believer,

620
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:39,140
 you have a relationship with Jesus.

621
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:42,300
 He has a purpose in you.

622
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:46,580
 And there is a way that you can be part of his action,

623
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,960
 no matter in a big way or in a small way.

624
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:55,060
 So may I invite you to stand as we pray to close.

625
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,220
 (silence)

626
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:06,960
 Dear Jesus, we thank you.

627
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:14,460
 We thank you that you are such an almighty God

628
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:21,140
 and with all the powers in your hand,

629
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:25,000
 you can basically do anything by yourself,

630
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,180
 but you have chosen us to be your people

631
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:34,000
 and you have chosen us to be part of your action.

632
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,980
 Lord, we thank you so much for this opportunity

633
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,300
 and we thank you so much

634
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,380
 that we are called to be your people.

635
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:50,500
 Lord, we pray for each one of us in this room.

636
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:58,620
 We believe that you have a purpose in each one of us.

637
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:05,240
 You intend us to shine for you

638
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,080
 and to be your hands and feet

639
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,680
 in our different spaces we have in our lives.

640
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:19,520
 That you intend us to love the people around us

641
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:24,520
 and to show what your love is to the people around us.

642
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:34,800
 So Lord, we pray that your Holy Spirit will show us

643
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:41,560
 how we can love the people around us,

644
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:46,080
 how we can be in action for you,

645
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,720
 not only in the big moments,

646
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:53,720
 remind us to not overlook the small everyday moments.

647
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,540
 Show us what you see.

648
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:01,560
 Show us how we can serve you

649
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,360
 and serve other people in those areas.

650
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:09,960
 And also to allow us to grow in loving people and compassion.

651
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:17,240
 And we pray for those who of us

652
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:22,000
 who might not 100% sure what the purpose is,

653
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,280
 how we can follow this.

654
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,640
 Lord, we pray that you will show us,

655
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,780
 not only show us, but you will take us on this journey

656
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:36,200
 and you will show us on each step we are taking.

657
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:44,240
 And for those of who of us are really excited about this,

658
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,880
 we already know that you have put a calling in us.

659
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,600
 We are excited to put that calling into action

660
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,120
 in the coming year.

661
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:56,480
 Lord, we pray that you will remind us

662
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,280
 to be even more attentive to your heart,

663
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,720
 to seek you first before we do anything,

664
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,960
 to seek you all the time.

665
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,420
 Lord, may you give us an attentive heart.

666
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,160
 And we invite the Holy Spirit to continue

667
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,580
 to config us as one community,

668
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:22,920
 to config us on how we can serve you together

669
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,300
 as one church, as one community.

670
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:32,100
 And if we are holding onto any fears, any excuses,

671
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:36,120
 we pray that you will give us the courage

672
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,000
 and you will give us the strength to overcome them.

673
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,440
 Lord, thank you that you have sent us

674
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,880
 to be part of your action,

675
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,740
 and yet you didn't leave us alone.

676
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:53,840
 And your Holy Spirit is always there

677
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,720
 to guide us and lead us.

678
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:01,680
 And we have one another to do them together.

679
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,520
 So Lord, in the coming year,

680
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,600
 we pray that we can be your hands and feet

681
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:10,120
 and we can bring your love to the world around us.

682
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,140
 And we thank you in Jesus' name.
