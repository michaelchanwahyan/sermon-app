1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,080
 Amen. - Amen. Thank you, Alison.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,560
 Good morning, everyone. - Good morning.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:10,360
 Morning, morning. So, like Alison said, if you have been involving in CGs,

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,440
 you might have known me, but let me introduce myself a little bit.

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,400
 So I joined the pastoral team almost for four years now.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,360
 So four years ago, I was the former CG pastor

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,640
 who's pastor team leading Yuen Long Church right now.

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,120
 Oh, by the way, hi, Tim. I know you've been watching.

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:35,320
 And so he invited me to join the CG team to work on the pastoral team.

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,760
 So it was a long journey for me as well, but long story short, I'm here.

11
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,200
 So it's a privilege for me to share the word with you all this morning.

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,480
 So I was chatting with my brother last week,

13
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,360
 and I told him that, "Oh, I'm going to preach on forgiveness today."

14
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,680
 And then he laughed immediately.

15
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,760
 He was like, "You? Teaching on forgiveness? Seriously?"

16
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,480
 And yeah, why did he laugh?

17
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,360
 Something that he has been teasing me a lot is,

18
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,080
 like, I think my colleagues will be able to testify as well,

19
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,320
 that I have slightly better memory than average.

20
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,280
 So I remember things.

21
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,160
 So it's helpful for me at work because I remember things,

22
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:30,000
 gets me more efficient, and also for me to be in a bigger church community,

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,520
 it helps me to remember people as well.

24
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:38,360
 But it's really unhelpful when we talk about forgiveness.

25
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:44,080
 So my brother has been describing that I have a register to remember,

26
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,720
 like, to write down who has offended me, how they have offended me,

27
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,720
 and it's probably thicker than my Bible.

28
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,960
 Well, FYI, this thing does not exist, I don't have a register,

29
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,240
 but these things do stay in my head sometimes.

30
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:05,200
 But we have been hearing that forgiveness is not about just forgetting, right?

31
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,920
 And no matter how forgetful you are, there are things that you remember.

32
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,040
 There are things that it is hard for you to let go as well.

33
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,160
 There are times for you to struggle with forgiveness.

34
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,480
 So what I'm trying to say is, if you find it difficult to let things go,

35
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,400
 you are not alone. I'm like that as well.

36
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,800
 These past three weeks, we have been hearing and reflecting

37
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:39,360
 on the importance of forgiveness, how we have been forgiven by God,

38
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,720
 and what forgiveness is.

39
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,240
 And today, we will look into forgiving others.

40
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,920
 Before we open the Bible today, I have a question for us.

41
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:57,720
 I wonder, what does it look like when we struggle with forgiveness?

42
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,320
 Those people you need to see regularly, perhaps not someone stepping on your feet

43
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:10,120
 on MTR, but maybe our colleagues, our family members, our friends,

44
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,320
 or even our brothers and sisters in the church.

45
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:20,920
 If they have offended you, how would that impact you?

46
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,960
 When you struggle with forgiving them, how would you react?

47
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:30,520
 And what comes to your mind when you see them?

48
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,280
 Do you just hide your thoughts, hide your emotions,

49
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,640
 and try to act normal in front of people?

50
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,040
 Do you try to avoid these people?

51
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:47,640
 Or would you want to exclude them from your circle?

52
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:54,240
 For me, if someone offends me, I would definitely go to the avoidance side.

53
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,040
 If you offend me, I don't want to see you.

54
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,680
 If I see you in a pantry, I will not get water until you walk out the pantry.

55
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,440
 If I see you in the lower house, I would probably go to the upper house.

56
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,160
 But actually, I don't get to decide.

57
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:15,120
 And if I see you in my family dinner, I would try to get the furthest seat I can

58
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,160
 just to avoid talking to you.

59
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,720
 I wonder if you can resonate with any of these.

60
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,320
 But this is not what God intend us to be, right?

61
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,840
 Especially when it happens in our church community.

62
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:40,080
 We are brothers and sisters, and we are all part of the same body of Christ.

63
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:47,520
 So today, we will look into the forgiveness within the church body in our early church.

64
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,880
 Last week, Derek shared one of the biblical examples of forgiveness with us,

65
00:04:52,880 --> 00:05:00,480
 with Stephen getting stoned, and he released his forgiveness to the people who killed him.

66
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:06,640
 Such a beautiful testimony from one of the followers of Christ.

67
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:13,680
 And I would like to continue to read that passage, the immediate verses after that.

68
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,680
 So Acts 7.59, "While they were stoning him, Stephen prayed,

69
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,920
 'Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.'

70
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:31,440
 Then he fell on his knees and cried out, 'Lord, do not hold this sin against him.'

71
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,680
 When he had said this, he fell asleep."

72
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,520
 And immediately after this, "And Saul approved of their killing him.

73
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,880
 On that day, a great persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem,

74
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:53,760
 and all except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria.

75
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:59,280
 Godly men buried Stephen and mourned deeply for him.

76
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:05,360
 But Saul began to destroy the church, going from house to house.

77
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,560
 He dragged off both men and women and put them in prison."

78
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,200
 So the scripture tells us that it was Saul who approved the killing,

79
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,640
 and we know that this Saul is the apostle Paul,

80
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:24,720
 who later became an apostle and has done a lot for our church.

81
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,400
 "And he killed Stephen."

82
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,960
 Stephen is now with Jesus, he does not need to struggle with forgiveness anymore,

83
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,600
 and in fact, he doesn't need to struggle with anything anymore.

84
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:45,280
 But how about his brothers and sisters, those who witnessed the killing?

85
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:51,280
 If we read chapter 6, we can see that Stephen was one of the seven people

86
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,920
 whom the twelve apostles appointed to help with the ministry.

87
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:02,320
 And the scripture describes Stephen as a man full of God's grace and power,

88
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:08,000
 performed great wonders and signs among the people.

89
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,680
 Such a faithful brother that they have lost.

90
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,400
 Those who witnessed would struggle with their emotions,

91
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,520
 they mourned deeply for him.

92
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,920
 And there were even more and more people getting imprisoned and killed

93
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,240
 by the Jews and Saul.

94
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:36,160
 How would the church community feel towards the Jews and Saul in this case?

95
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,920
 Sometimes when we read this passage, we go too fast into,

96
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,720
 "Oh, he's the apostle Paul, has done so much for Jesus later,

97
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,680
 wrote so many letters that we are still reading today."

98
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:57,280
 And it's true that he's a great apostle that built up the foundation of our faith.

99
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,880
 But perhaps sometimes we miss the perspective from other disciples at that time.

100
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,400
 In their eyes, in the church's eyes at that time,

101
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,800
 he is a murderer who killed a lot of Christians.

102
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,480
 And he is an oppressor as well.

103
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:24,000
 If I were one of them, if I personally witnessed that my friends are getting killed by a person,

104
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,600
 this is something that I will always remember.

105
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:35,280
 And I would definitely struggle with forgiving them.

106
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,720
 So,

107
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:46,480
 but we remember that in the past weeks that we can't rely on our own strength to forgive people.

108
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:52,240
 This is the good news for us. We don't need to do that by ourselves.

109
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,240
 And God's work in people are amazing.

110
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:05,200
 As we continue to read, we can see how God moves the people in the early church to forgive in this case.

111
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:13,120
 "Now there was a disciple in Damascus named Ananias, and the Lord said to him in a vision,

112
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,760
 'Ananias,' and he said, 'He I am, Lord.'

113
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:23,280
 And the Lord said to him, 'Get up and go to the street called Strait,

114
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:32,080
 and inquire at the house of Judas for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying.

115
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:39,920
 And he has seen a vision, a man named Ananias came in and lay his hands on him,

116
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,280
 so that he might regain his sight.'

117
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:49,920
 But Ananias replied, 'Lord, I have heard from many people about this man,

118
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,000
 how much harm he did to your saints in Jerusalem.

119
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,840
 And here he has authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name.'

120
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:08,000
 But the Lord said to him, 'Go, for he is a chosen instrument of mine,

121
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,520
 to bear my name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel,

122
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:19,600
 for I will show him how much he must suffer in behalf of my name.'

123
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:28,000
 So Ananias departed and entered the house, and after laying his hands on him, he said,

124
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,280
 'Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road by which you were coming,

125
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:43,040
 has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.'

126
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:50,560
 And immediately something like fish scales fell from his eyes, and he regained his sight,

127
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:57,920
 and he got up and was baptized, and he took food and was strengthened.

128
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:06,560
 So we can see that when Ananias hears about the idea of going to find Saul and laying hands on him,

129
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,200
 he was unsure about that.

130
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:16,160
 Saul was literally still on his way to persecute the church before his conversion.

131
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:22,560
 The danger is real before we even talk about forgiveness in this case.

132
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,680
 And we can see that Ananias was subtly against this idea.

133
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:35,360
 See how he called Saul 'this man', not even addressing his name.

134
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:46,080
 But God explains his plan to Ananias, that Ananias has a role in God's work as well.

135
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,800
 His role is to redeem Saul's life, so in the future,

136
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,400
 Saul can proclaim Jesus' name to Gentiles and other people.

137
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:01,200
 So we are under the Gentiles category, right? Most of us.

138
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:10,720
 Can we imagine what happens to us if Ananias disobeyed God at the moment?

139
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,600
 Would we even exist?

140
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,600
 I'm sure God has his own way to work that out if Ananias refused to do that.

141
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:29,120
 But thankfully, Ananias chose to obey, and he is willing to be part of God's work.

142
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:35,200
 I want us to pay attention to how Ananias addresses Paul when he gets there.

143
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:42,480
 The first word he said is, "Brother Saul, this is powerful.

144
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,920
 From this man to brother."

145
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,080
 Ananias knows his assignment.

146
00:12:52,080 --> 00:13:01,040
 The way that he calls him 'brother' demonstrated forgiveness and also full acceptance to Saul,

147
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:08,240
 that he has included Saul into the church community, which is essential.

148
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,440
 Because Jesus could have healed his eyes, healed Saul's eyes in his own way.

149
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,760
 He doesn't need to send people there.

150
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:22,800
 But Jesus chose to send someone to do that, to be part of his work.

151
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,280
 Have we thought about why?

152
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:32,800
 God intended his people to be accepted in his community.

153
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,960
 No matter what terrible things we have done in our life,

154
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:44,800
 and no matter how unworthy we feel we are, we are all accepted.

155
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:54,320
 Jesus sends Ananias to Saul to accept him before he even proves that he is a worthy Christian.

156
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,640
 This is powerful.

157
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:02,000
 Because how can Saul convince the acceptance of the forgiveness of God

158
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,080
 if he didn't experience that from other Christians?

159
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:15,120
 However, being accepted by Ananias does not mean that the whole community has accepted him.

160
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,640
 Yet.

161
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:21,440
 I want to continue to read the story as I want us to know that

162
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,080
 it was uneasy for the early church community as well.

163
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:31,040
 It takes time for the community to go through the forgiveness journey.

164
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:37,760
 And different people would have their own pace, would have their own journey on that.

165
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,040
 Just like you and me.

166
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:49,200
 When he, he is Saul, came to Jerusalem, he tried repeatedly to associate with the disciples.

167
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:57,200
 And yet, they were all afraid of him, as they did not believe that he was a disciple.

168
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:03,760
 But Barnabas took hold of him and brought him to the apostles and described to them

169
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:09,200
 how he had seen the Lord on the row, and that he had talked to him,

170
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:15,760
 and how he had spoken out boldly in the name of Jesus at Damascus.

171
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:25,600
 And he was with them, moving about freely in Jerusalem, speaking out boldly in the name of the Lord.

172
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,560
 And he was talking and arguing with the Hellenistic Jews,

173
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,800
 but they were attempting to put him to death.

174
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:43,760
 Now when the brothers learned of it, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus.

175
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:51,520
 So the scripture tells us, emphasizing that he repeatedly tried to associate with the disciples,

176
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,240
 but they were afraid of him.

177
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:03,040
 We can see that Saul's repentance and conversion did not immediately lead to forgiveness

178
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,320
 and acceptance from the whole community.

179
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,800
 People still remember what he has done,

180
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,400
 and probably still wrestling with the loss that they have experienced.

181
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:20,240
 How would they trust this murderer immediately?

182
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:27,360
 It indeed takes time and people's effort to encourage forgiveness in the community.

183
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:35,360
 But here we've got a Barnabas who didn't only offer his own forgiveness to Saul,

184
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:42,400
 but also to help Saul to be forgiven by other people.

185
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:49,440
 Barnabas put in effort in helping the community to see what has happened in Saul

186
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:57,520
 and more importantly to see Saul's new identity as a Christian, as a follower of Christ,

187
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:02,800
 and to help Saul to be accepted by the community.

188
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,680
 And forgiveness does not mean that what Saul has done is forgotten.

189
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:15,680
 In fact, what he has done is remembered forever, as it is recorded in the Bible.

190
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:21,200
 But forgiveness is letting go of our sense of being wronged and offended,

191
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:29,840
 and to see the person in God's sight, to see them from God's perspective.

192
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:38,160
 And this act, this act of forgiveness, is to fulfill God's work in our community.

193
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:44,720
 And at the same time, I want us to see that Saul also takes his ownership of his actions.

194
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,480
 Firstly, he didn't force others to forgive him.

195
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:56,160
 He didn't say to other Christians, "Oh, you are a Christian. You're supposed to be gracious.

196
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,840
 You're supposed to be merciful. You're supposed to be forgiving."

197
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:07,040
 These words sound familiar, right? But Saul didn't do it.

198
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,880
 Also, if we read the letters he was writing to the church,

199
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,800
 he has not been hiding the things that he has done.

200
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:21,520
 He takes responsibility of his own sins and actions.

201
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:30,000
 And it is important that we know that it is by the grace of God that he has been forgiven.

202
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,040
 Forgiven by God, and forgiven by others.

203
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:39,120
 Church, this is a reminder to us as well.

204
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:45,520
 If we have wronged others, take responsibility of our own actions.

205
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,720
 Ask for forgiveness with the posture of asking grace.

206
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:57,360
 For us who need to forgive others, we are not only doing that for the sake of our mental health.

207
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:03,600
 There's something more. We are doing the work of God.

208
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:10,160
 Ananias, with his obedience, becomes part of God's plan to redeem Saul's life

209
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:17,520
 so that he can become the apostle Paul that God intends him to be.

210
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:23,840
 And Barnabas and the whole community works together on their forgiveness with Saul.

211
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:31,120
 Together, they have demonstrated the forgiveness of Jesus to Saul.

212
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:37,760
 This is the church. This is who we are.

213
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,800
 Starting with a strong foundation of forgiveness.

214
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:49,120
 Perhaps today in this room, we don't have an apostle Saul for us to redeem,

215
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:58,320
 but will we lay down our preferences and rights to fulfill God's work within our community?

216
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,840
 I want to share a little bit of my personal story as well,

217
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:08,720
 which I took a long time to forgive the people in my church community as well.

218
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,040
 It happened in my uni time. I was not in this church yet.

219
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:20,320
 I was part of a young adults community, just like 180 here, similar.

220
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,440
 So one time we were planning for an event together,

221
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,640
 and then the communication was bad. It was terrible.

222
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,600
 And the event did not turn out as we wished.

223
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:37,200
 So it ended up like the organizers were having a conflict among us.

224
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,920
 So for sure, I was part of that conflict.

225
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:46,800
 And then people in our community heard of this conflict among the organizers,

226
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,760
 and people started to take sides,

227
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,040
 which we know is unhelpful when we are involved in a conflict.

228
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,960
 But we were young, right?

229
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,160
 It wasn't that of a big deal at the beginning,

230
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:07,280
 but things got worse, and then we get to a point that we can't really resolve it.

231
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:14,960
 So just as I said in the beginning, if I get offended, I will avoid the people.

232
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,560
 So that's what I did. I stopped showing up to my community gatherings.

233
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:26,880
 And then later, I felt, "Oh, I still want a community."

234
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:33,360
 I made an even worse decision that I joined another community in the same church.

235
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,920
 My church wasn't that big, just a few hundred people, so we all know each other.

236
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,440
 It was very weird that we show up in the same church,

237
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,800
 but I just went to another community.

238
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,400
 But I am quite stubborn, if I'm honest.

239
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,000
 So I did that for almost half a year,

240
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,560
 until someone from my original community came to me and told me that,

241
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:05,440
 "Jennifer, you know what? We missed you, and we want you to come back."

242
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,400
 At the bottom of my heart, I wanted to do that as well,

243
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:14,960
 but at that time, I was not brave enough to do the conversation that I need to do,

244
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,640
 to forgive what has happened, to forgive the people,

245
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,600
 and at the same time, ask for their forgiveness.

246
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,480
 So I was being immature for a few more months,

247
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,840
 and then finally, I got myself together and felt, "I really want to go back."

248
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:38,480
 So in that period, more people came and asked me to go back,

249
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,760
 to encourage me, "You can do it."

250
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,000
 They are like Barnabas and Ananias in my situation,

251
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,520
 to help me to go back and have conversation with the people.

252
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,240
 So at the end, I did that, I went back,

253
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,440
 and then I have the conversation with my community,

254
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,400
 and we all lay down what has happened,

255
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,480
 and continue to have fellowship together.

256
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,760
 From this experience, I personally experience the power

257
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:16,560
 of both forgiveness and also unforgiveness in a church community,

258
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:23,200
 and how a few people's actions can impact the whole community.

259
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,400
 Well, the honest truth is, as long as we are in community,

260
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,640
 as long as we are with people, conflicts will happen,

261
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,280
 and we will need to forgive.

262
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:41,840
 For Saul as well, after him being accepted, became an apostle,

263
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,040
 he still has conflict.

264
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:48,080
 He had a conflict with Mark later, and then it leads to splitting,

265
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,880
 and even more conflicts within the early church community.

266
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,560
 But later, they sort that out, the relationship,

267
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:05,200
 and then both Mark and Paul are having important roles in the early church.

268
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:11,680
 So what I'm saying is, as long as we are in the community,

269
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,520
 we can't really avoid conflict,

270
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,920
 we can't really avoid the conversation of forgiveness.

271
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:22,400
 Earlier this year, we have gone through the Ephesians series,

272
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,920
 which is written by Paul.

273
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:28,560
 There's a passage that Paul writes his reflection about forgiveness.

274
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,320
 Let me read it to you.

275
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,640
 "Get rid of all bitterness, rage, and anger.

276
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,920
 Brawling and slander, along with every form of malice.

277
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,200
 Be kind and compassionate to one another,

278
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:49,760
 forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you."

279
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:55,520
 We see, this is Paul's reflection after all the things that had happened in his life.

280
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,640
 It is essential for the church community to forgive one another,

281
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,120
 as the sense of unforgiveness will birth into something else

282
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,960
 that will harm the whole community.

283
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,560
 And forgiveness is hard.

284
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:15,600
 It's not as simple as just saying, "I forgive you," to each other.

285
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,600
 But it is a hard work.

286
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,600
 We need to do that from the bottom of our heart.

287
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,760
 And there are things that it's really difficult to handle.

288
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,360
 Things like people that broke your trust,

289
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,600
 people who betrayed you,

290
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,560
 or even people who abused you.

291
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:38,960
 And again, if you are in an abusive situation,

292
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,400
 do seek help from the people you trust.

293
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,120
 But what I'm saying is,

294
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,600
 "I forgive you" does not have the magical power

295
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,720
 to heal all the wounds that are in your heart.

296
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,760
 It takes time, and it takes effort,

297
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:04,000
 and it takes God's grace for us to do the forgiveness.

298
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,480
 I'm not sure what you are going through right now,

299
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,560
 but you are not alone.

300
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:18,400
 You don't need to do this alone if you are struggling with forgiveness.

301
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,080
 If you are struggling with forgiving people,

302
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,200
 again, this is hard.

303
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,760
 It takes time and effort to do that.

304
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,240
 But do ask for God's grace and strength to do that.

305
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:36,400
 He is with you, and only by His power we can do that.

306
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,280
 And if you have offended someone,

307
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:43,520
 if you need to ask for forgiveness,

308
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,160
 take responsibility of your own action.

309
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,360
 Go find the people that you have offended

310
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,000
 and ask for their forgiveness.

311
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,880
 Make known of your heart to the people

312
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,280
 and ask genuinely.

313
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:04,080
 And ask again for God's grace and strength to do that.

314
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,360
 And for some of us,

315
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:11,680
 we might be the people that are seeing the struggle of forgiveness around us.

316
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:16,240
 If you are walking with people on that,

317
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,200
 let's come around the people who struggle

318
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,960
 because they need the community to help them.

319
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,400
 Be like Barnabas or Ananias,

320
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:31,680
 that help people, to encourage people to forgive.

321
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,240
 To come around them, to support them,

322
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,400
 because it is a long journey.

323
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,840
 Do not take sides.

324
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,640
 I'm saying this from my very painful experience.

325
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,880
 Try to see the things in God's perspective.

326
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:54,080
 And try to see that we are doing the work of God.

327
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:59,920
 And we are doing this together as one body.

328
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,120
 And this is like we are called the body of Christ

329
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,840
 to demonstrate who Jesus is to the people around us.

330
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,320
 So let's demonstrate the love of Christ

331
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:15,200
 and the power of forgiveness as this is to fulfill God's work.

332
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,160
 So right now, we will hear some testimonies from our own community.

333
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,040
 May I invite Pasajan to facilitate that

334
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:28,480
 and invite our guests for today, Charles and Alison.

335
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,000
 Thank you, Pasajan.

336
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 And let's welcome, this is Alison.

337
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,200
 Alison and Charles, let's give them a warm welcome.

338
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,720
 Yes, so Alison and Charles, you've both led community groups here.

339
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,400
 Alison, you're currently serving on Alpha

340
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,120
 and Charles, you've been involved, you've been leading a CG

341
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,440
 and you've been involved in Cleansing Stream as well.

342
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:55,440
 And today, we've heard a story from Jen's life within church community

343
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,400
 and we'll hear different communities from you both.

344
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,880
 And Alison, why don't we start with you?

345
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,040
 Could you share about just a recent testimony of conflict?

346
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,480
 Sure. My story comes from the workplace.

347
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,800
 So ever since I was a teenager,

348
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,920
 I've dreamed of becoming a really kick-butt CEO.

349
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,800
 I don't know if I'm allowed to say the word "butt" but I will just say it.

350
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:21,280
 And I've had a passion for the corporate world and the business world.

351
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:25,600
 And for much of the last decade and a half I've been working since university,

352
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,960
 I felt I was very successful and confident in my career.

353
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,000
 You know, in these companies that I worked for,

354
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,800
 every year they would give annual performance reviews

355
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,200
 and I tended to place pretty high.

356
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,200
 So it just affirmed the confidence I had in myself that, you know,

357
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,880
 I'm a good leader, I'm a good worker,

358
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,160
 I'm recognized for my, you know, characteristics at work

359
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:50,320
 and identified as a high achiever.

360
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,520
 So when this incident came two years ago in the workplace,

361
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,200
 it was extremely hard for me.

362
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,640
 I had the toughest challenge yet in my career

363
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,040
 and I had a horrible relationship with my boss.

364
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:05,360
 And my relationship with him wasn't always strange,

365
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,320
 but suddenly a year into working with him,

366
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,240
 things took a really bad turn.

367
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,000
 We would often have very big team meetings.

368
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,560
 Who has big team meetings, you know, when you have work?

369
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,360
 He, every time when I spoke up,

370
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,640
 I felt that he would vocally just humiliate me

371
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,160
 and turn the things down I said

372
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,840
 and make it known that, you know,

373
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,880
 what I was saying or suggesting was not the right way.

374
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,760
 And he would get very vocally nasty in front of the whole team

375
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,640
 and say that to me.

376
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,640
 And in other smaller team discussions, it was the same.

377
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,160
 And, you know, he was very condescending in his speech.

378
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:46,880
 So I felt humiliated, I felt hurt, and I was surprised.

379
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,680
 And I tried to address this in our one-on-one discussions

380
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,800
 and ask him, you know,

381
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,280
 "How do you see me doing better, Mr. Boss?"

382
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,760
 Because obviously there's some issues.

383
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,520
 And it was a very hard discussion.

384
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,320
 He eventually never really gave any clear answers,

385
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,280
 but made it known that he would be hiring someone else

386
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,040
 to take over from my role.

387
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,640
 So that was very difficult for me.

388
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,840
 - Not easy, thank you.

389
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,560
 And Charles, could you share with us your family background?

390
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,240
 - Sure, good morning, everyone.

391
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,680
 I'm sharing a story from my family background.

392
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:23,440
 So I grew up in a family with a lot of relationship challenges.

393
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,000
 So there's a lot of emotional abuse

394
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,520
 happening within the family.

395
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,400
 And eventually my parents are divorced.

396
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,720
 And my brother and I, after we got into university,

397
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,800
 we moved out of the family just to be on our own

398
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,240
 so that we can have some peace.

399
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,400
 So at first I thought I just, I'm in a clear,

400
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:50,880
 but because the family didn't really have a common practice

401
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,720
 of forgiveness and apology.

402
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,760
 So I actually needed to learn it much later on

403
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,840
 in my adult life.

404
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:03,120
 So I will share one example with you, one story with you.

405
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,120
 So this was when I was in my late 30s already.

406
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:12,400
 And at that time, my father was in his 80s

407
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,680
 and we were all living separately on our own.

408
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,600
 And one year he had a stroke.

409
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,120
 And then of course the family rallied together

410
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,120
 to try to care for my dad.

411
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,400
 And during this time, we found out that he actually

412
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,120
 has been involved in a mess for a while

413
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,160
 and nobody in our family knew about it.

414
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,200
 So in order to help him out, I decided that

415
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,400
 at that time I was still single.

416
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,720
 So I moved back to be with him.

417
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,440
 I packed up half of my belongings.

418
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,000
 I moved back.

419
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,600
 I still kept my place, trying to support my dad

420
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,800
 and try to hopefully, hoping that he will not,

421
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,920
 he will have a new life and not be involved

422
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,920
 in messy situations again.

423
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,720
 So long story short, after about six months,

424
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,360
 I realized that, my brother and I realized that

425
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,960
 my dad is still involved in the mess.

426
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,080
 And I was very upset because I put in a lot of effort.

427
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,560
 My life was really difficult, going to work,

428
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,120
 having two places, having pets to look after,

429
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,120
 like just really chaos.

430
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,080
 So I was really obsessed.

431
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,840
 I packed my stuff and I went back home

432
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,040
 and I just disassociated.

433
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,520
 So it felt like, okay, I'm back in my own place.

434
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,760
 I should be feeling better now.

435
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,920
 And I learned a very valuable lesson during this season

436
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,120
 because when I moved back home for the next six months,

437
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,360
 I was tortured by memories.

438
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,600
 And these are memories of my past wrongdoings,

439
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,280
 things that I've done that I hurt people in the past.

440
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,680
 And these are old stuff as well

441
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,360
 that I thought I have resolved with God.

442
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,760
 I've confessed and I thought I received forgiveness.

443
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,800
 But these memories, for some reason,

444
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,480
 in that season came back and they would replay in my mind

445
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,760
 like movie trailers.

446
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:05,040
 Imagine you have a movie trailer of your bad deeds playing.

447
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,800
 That's really a torture actually.

448
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,160
 So after about six months, I really couldn't stand it.

449
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,000
 So I was thinking to myself,

450
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,720
 what had actually really changed that this is happening?

451
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,760
 And it still took me about two weeks to realize

452
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,720
 that it might be because I have held a grudge against my dad.

453
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,840
 And at that point, I realized that I really need to forgive my dad.

454
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,840
 And also at that point,

455
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,720
 because it was just a decision to forgive my dad,

456
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,200
 I also realized I was holding a grudge

457
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,720
 based on my own choice as well.

458
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,240
 And the forgiveness was also a choice that I could make.

459
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,480
 So I made the choice to forgive my dad.

460
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,120
 When I made up with him, I totally behaved like normal again.

461
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:49,440
 And actually, very, very, almost instantaneously,

462
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:55,520
 all the tormenting videos would stop playing in my mind again.

463
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,720
 So it was a very dramatic lesson for me.

464
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:04,320
 And Charles, how did that impact you when you were growing up?

465
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,040
 How did you cope with people?

466
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:12,400
 Because when I was growing up, there was a lot of emotional abuse.

467
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,040
 So I would withdraw.

468
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:21,360
 I would try to stay away from the pain, the source of the pain.

469
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,480
 And I will grow up to become a very self-reliant person

470
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,200
 because I want to minimize my reliance on people

471
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,320
 so that I will have less pain, right?

472
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,440
 Basically, that's how I coped with it when I was growing up.

473
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,560
 When I grew up, when I was in my late 20s,

474
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,400
 so I learned a very valuable lesson in church life,

475
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,200
 which is to share it with others.

476
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,880
 Like I started to have safe mentors that I can meet with regularly,

477
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,160
 and I share my pain with them, and it really helped me out.

478
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,160
 I even saw a therapist for about, I think, two years.

479
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,440
 So it really helped me out.

480
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,480
 And one other thing, though, is when I was repeating these stories

481
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,520
 over a period of time, I realized I was repeating it over and over,

482
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,800
 and I was still lacking a little bit of stuff to move forward.

483
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,160
 And afterwards, I eventually realized that,

484
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,280
 apart from sharing with people, I need to...

485
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:20,000
 Forgiveness is the key that was missing in my life.

486
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,160
 So I needed to work forgiveness out into my life as well.

487
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,920
 Yeah, and Allison, I know you worked with a therapist as well,

488
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,240
 but before we go there, how did you cope with that pain in this workplace?

489
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,440
 What did you do?

490
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:38,080
 Yeah, I think before I got on my knees with the decision to forgive,

491
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,120
 because that was very hard,

492
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,320
 I felt like actually my voice was stolen in the workplace.

493
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,520
 That was very difficult for me.

494
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,840
 I'm usually a very vocal and direct person,

495
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,080
 but whenever there was a team meeting, I would just...

496
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,000
 I dreaded every day going to work,

497
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,240
 and I just felt like I wanted to be invisible.

498
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,520
 I didn't want to be seen.

499
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:58,480
 And the worst was just seeing team members I hired and trained personally.

500
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,840
 They saw that the political tide was obviously not in my favor,

501
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,160
 so they would turn against me to ensure that

502
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,920
 they would still have a job at the end of the day.

503
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,760
 So it was very hurtful.

504
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,560
 And eventually, I felt like I had no option,

505
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,320
 because I knew I would be replaced,

506
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,760
 was to leave, to leave the company and to leave his leadership.

507
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:21,360
 But even that was hard, because I would keep seeing him around Hong Kong.

508
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,840
 Turns out we went to the same grad school, me and this boss,

509
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,520
 and he would come up to me and be like,

510
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,000
 "Why do I keep still seeing you, even after you left?"

511
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,480
 And I was like, "Well, I live in Hong Kong too,

512
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,680
 and we went to the same school."

513
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,600
 So anyways, but it was hard, but with time,

514
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,840
 and we can share about the forgiveness journey too,

515
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,440
 as I worked with a therapist,

516
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,600
 with the awesome community around me here,

517
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,200
 and of course, with God's help, all of that changed eventually.

518
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,800
 Yeah, so how did the therapist and the community around you,

519
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,200
 what did that look like for you?

520
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,440
 I sought the help of a career counselor who's also a Christian,

521
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,880
 and he knew me very well.

522
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,000
 And he said, "You know, Alison, this is not who you are in the workplace."

523
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,960
 And he spoke some very affirming, life-giving words,

524
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,560
 and he encouraged me to write down a list of,

525
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,800
 you know, because I said my voice was like stolen,

526
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,560
 you know, of what I'm thankful for,

527
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,000
 and what my identity is in Christ in the workplace.

528
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,680
 And I wrote all this down, and he said,

529
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,920
 "You know, read this aloud to your husband,

530
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,160
 and make sure he affirms you as well.

531
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:22,960
 He's here."

532
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,960
 And so that helped a lot,

533
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,080
 and it just helped remind me of my identity in Christ.

534
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:31,360
 My community here at The Vine have been really supportive.

535
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,480
 They kept listening to me when I was really down,

536
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,080
 and, you know, they really encouraged me,

537
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,560
 and told me, you know, "There is a future.

538
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,160
 This is not the only thing,

539
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,760
 that your work situation is not one that is going to stay.

540
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,320
 And as you move on, it will get better.

541
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,440
 This is not the end."

542
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,680
 And they prayed with me, and believed with me,

543
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,480
 and eventually helped me to get to that place of,

544
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,880
 "I want to get rid of this chain holding me back.

545
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,240
 This is not worth it."

546
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,720
 Because I know I could do well in the workplace.

547
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,320
 It was this experience that I didn't want to be stuck in it anymore.

548
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,320
 So I think those things all helped.

549
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,120
 - Yeah.

550
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,760
 And so we hear from both of you how people around you,

551
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,360
 how the community around you,

552
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,440
 be it a therapist, a mentor,

553
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,840
 or the Christian community have really helped you

554
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,640
 to really go through that forgiveness,

555
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,640
 which we've heard it takes time.

556
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:23,920
 And we know we've heard that you've both chosen to forgive,

557
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,440
 and we just want to hear from you.

558
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,560
 What does walking out this forgiveness in your life look like?

559
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,720
 Alison, why don't you start?

560
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,600
 - Okay.

561
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:37,440
 I would say it's definitely not an overnight forgiveness journey.

562
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,160
 Even now today, when I think of this person,

563
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,880
 I wouldn't say I've 100% forgiven him.

564
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,920
 But it gets a little bit better every day.

565
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,840
 And just like Pastor Derek shared last week in his sermon,

566
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,040
 it was a decision.

567
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,160
 It started with a decision.

568
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,240
 "Hey, God, I'm really stuck in this.

569
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,840
 I really need your help to forgive."

570
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:59,200
 Recognizing, vocalizing the pain it caused,

571
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,800
 and a conscious decision not to continuously dwell

572
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,040
 in that hate and resentment circle.

573
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:09,600
 And I would say that first step already helped immensely

574
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,760
 to let go of the pain and to forgive.

575
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,760
 And if I were to see this leader that I had

576
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,680
 that caused me so much pain right now,

577
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,400
 to come up to me right now,

578
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,040
 I at least wouldn't punch him in the guts.

579
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,880
 Like I would be okay,

580
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,880
 and I would wish God's blessing upon him.

581
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,040
 And eventually moving on to a new workplace

582
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,680
 where I felt like I was healed and restored

583
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,600
 in my identity also helped.

584
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,160
 So sometimes leaving that was also helpful,

585
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,800
 but it was really the Holy Spirit and God

586
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,240
 working in their heart to let go.

587
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,680
 - Yeah, thank you.

588
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,240
 And Charles?

589
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,200
 - I agree with Alison.

590
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,840
 I needed to make the choice.

591
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:56,480
 For me, because of what the Holy Spirit shared with me

592
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,480
 regarding my past sin against others,

593
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,680
 I find it non-negotiable these days

594
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,800
 with regard to forgiving others

595
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,160
 because I realized I actually needed it more.

596
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,520
 I needed God's forgiveness over my own sins

597
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,560
 more than the other person needing the forgiveness for me.

598
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,880
 So it's a very personal thing.

599
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,800
 I can feel the weight of sin coming back upon me

600
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,280
 when I was unforgiving towards my dad.

601
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,840
 And during even moments these days

602
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:33,040
 when I was edging back towards unforgiveness

603
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,640
 towards anyone,

604
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,080
 I started to feel the weight again upon my heart.

605
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,800
 So because of that, I also remember,

606
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,160
 there's a parable of the unforgiving servants

607
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,840
 that Jesus talked about,

608
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,600
 that this king had servants

609
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,160
 and there's this servant owed him like a million dollars,

610
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,560
 impossible debt, like 10 billion.

611
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,080
 I think it was a huge amount.

612
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,840
 And the king had mercy

613
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,600
 and just know that he couldn't pay,

614
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,280
 so he forgave him.

615
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,440
 And then the servant turned around

616
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,000
 and tried to chase down $1,000 or $10,000

617
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,880
 from a fellow colleague.

618
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,680
 And it was outrageous.

619
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:14,480
 So the person was put back into prison to be tormented.

620
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,920
 So when I had that experience,

621
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,080
 I felt like, oh, I was the unmerciful servant.

622
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:23,200
 So through all these revelation of the spirit,

623
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,640
 I now walk very cautiously.

624
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,880
 Also, I know that after even 20 years

625
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,840
 of being a Christian,

626
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,240
 these days as I'm still working out

627
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,120
 how to overcome,

628
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,160
 working on the process of overcoming sin

629
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,520
 through the Holy Spirit,

630
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:43,040
 I still inadvertently would hurt people here and there.

631
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,480
 So even for myself, if I'm hurting people,

632
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,040
 how can I not forgive others as well?

633
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,800
 So that's why I am really cautiously

634
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:57,920
 living out forgiveness in my life on a regular basis.

635
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,680
 Thank you both.

636
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,320
 We've really heard real life stories

637
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,680
 of how they've struggled,

638
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,240
 how they've navigated the conflict

639
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,440
 and the forgiveness journey,

640
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,160
 and really honor you and appreciate you both

641
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,280
 for sharing today.

642
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,560
 We hope that's blessed you.

643
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,200
 And let's give them a round of applause again.

644
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,800
 Thank you.

645
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,360
 Thank you.

646
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:21,760
 And now we're going to take some time

647
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,160
 to respond to God.

648
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,720
 So can I invite you all to stand

649
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,320
 and let me pray.

650
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:38,800
 God, we thank you for that reminder of that parable,

651
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,520
 how we have been so completely forgiven.

652
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:48,320
 And we know, God, it's not easy.

653
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:52,960
 But right now we just take some time

654
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,960
 and we pray that through your spirit,

655
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:01,520
 you will do that next bit of your work,

656
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:05,360
 that next bit of healing, of restoration,

657
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:09,120
 of helping us either to choose to release forgiveness

658
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,400
 or to continually choose again and again

659
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,280
 and again and again,

660
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,720
 to lay down our resentment.

661
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:23,760
 Pray for anyone here who needs that chain of resentment

662
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:24,720
 to be loosened.

663
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:30,640
 I pray for anyone perhaps who knows

664
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,200
 that they are the one who needs to ask for forgiveness.

665
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,200
 Holy Spirit, we just come before you now.

666
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,160
 It's your work.

667
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,120
 It's your grace.

668
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:46,080
 So let us just take a moment to encounter that grace right now.
