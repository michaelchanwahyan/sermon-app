1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Well, Church, I'm really excited. We are in week two of our Post-Traumatic Growth series.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,600
 It's a series where we wanted to start 2021 focusing on this amazing idea that's been discovered in psychology recently,

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:23,400
 that in the worst moments of our lives, we can actually experience the greatest moments of our humanity,

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:34,400
 that we can actually change and transform and grow and be renewed in ways that would not have been possible unless the trauma had happened itself.

5
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:41,800
 That actually that trauma, that hardship, that pain, that suffering is actually the catalyst to our greatest moments of who we are,

6
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:48,600
 that we don't actually get defined by that trauma, that it doesn't become the place where we settle and put our roots down,

7
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:56,000
 but the trauma actually meets us in a place where we can find the hope of Christ rising us out of it in such a way

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,600
 that we couldn't have experienced the hope of Christ in that way unless we had been in the place of that trauma to begin with.

9
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:13,400
 You know, the research suggests, and I spoke about this last week, that that growth and that transformation happens in us in predominantly five main ways.

10
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:25,200
 It takes place in the idea of our appreciation for life, in our relationships with others, in new possibilities for life, in our own personal strength,

11
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,400
 and finally, in our own spiritual transformation, our own spiritual change.

12
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:38,000
 And in this series, we're going to take a look at each one of those this week and over the next four weeks ahead, and we're going to unpack each one for you.

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,800
 But as I was thinking about and praying about, what's the one that actually is the foundation of this series?

14
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:50,600
 What's the one that I think is most pertinent that we can speak to right up front to help prepare you for that change in your life?

15
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,600
 For me, it was new possibilities.

16
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,000
 And right here at the start of the message, I want to speak this over some of you.

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,600
 Some of you are primed today by the Spirit of God to be woken into new possibilities in your life.

18
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,600
 When I was praying for this series, and particularly praying for this Sunday,

19
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,600
 I saw a picture for us as a church and for us individually that I want to share.

20
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,000
 I saw a picture of a red traffic light.

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,800
 It was just a very clear, very bright red traffic light.

22
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,400
 And right in front of this traffic light, there was this bus.

23
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:29,000
 And the bus was filled with people, and the bus was stopped, of course, at the traffic light.

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,600
 But what was interesting in the picture was that the bus had been there for a very long time.

25
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,600
 You could see dust on the top of the bus.

26
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,800
 You could see that it was worn out and getting a bit rusty.

27
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,000
 The tires of the bus were beginning to deflate.

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,200
 You could see in the picture that the red light had been there for a long period of time,

29
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,400
 and the bus had been stuck in that place.

30
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,000
 And what was amazing to me in this picture is I could see the people on the bus,

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,800
 and the people themselves looked almost like they had resigned themselves to this place.

32
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,600
 That because perhaps they'd been stuck at the red light for so long,

33
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,400
 that the bus and the journey and the destination didn't matter anymore.

34
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,200
 They were stuck right there.

35
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,600
 And because they'd been stuck for so long, they had begun to be comfortable in that place.

36
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,200
 Almost as if that was the place that they were supposed to be,

37
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:23,200
 and they had long forgotten the destination that they were actually journeying towards.

38
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,200
 I want to just speak on this right now,

39
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,200
 because I think that will resonate with some of you watching this.

40
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,000
 Because of all the stuff that had taken place in 2020,

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,200
 maybe some of the personal trauma that you're actually carrying yourself,

42
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,400
 maybe some of the hardship that you've been facing.

43
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,200
 I know many of us have lost jobs during this pandemic.

44
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,000
 We've actually lost family members and loved ones.

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Many of us have struggled with some of the hardest moments in life.

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 And when we're like that, when we're in a place of trauma,

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,400
 it can almost feel like a red light is in front of us.

48
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,200
 A stop sign is right there, and it sticks to us.

49
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,800
 And we become almost weighted in that place.

50
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,800
 Almost like we put roots down in the place that we're stuck in.

51
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,000
 And we think that we can't go forward. We can't move on.

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,800
 And the idea of post-traumatic growth almost seems funny to us.

53
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:12,400
 It's like, how can I grow in the mix of the place that I'm stuck in?

54
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,000
 I want to speak to you right now and tell you this right up front.

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,600
 You were not created for the red light.

56
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,600
 Listen to this. You're going to experience red lights in your life.

57
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,800
 We're all going to experience them,

58
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,000
 and we've experienced some of those in the past 12 months.

59
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,800
 But you were not created to put roots down in the place where you're stuck.

60
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,100
 And in fact, actually the Spirit of God is at work,

61
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,700
 I believe, in this series and everything that we want to do through it

62
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:42,500
 to begin to take you from that place of being stuck and move you forward.

63
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:47,500
 I believe the word that sits over the vine this year is to move forward.

64
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,300
 And if you're feeling stuck today,

65
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:54,300
 I pray that what we're about to unpack in this message about new possibilities for you

66
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,300
 will be an encouragement and a powerful prophetic change for you

67
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:04,900
 to actually begin to move towards the destination that God had always planned for you.

68
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:10,300
 I want to inspire you about new possibilities today by sharing with you a story.

69
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,300
 It's a story that's famous to us.

70
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,700
 It's a story from Scripture, the story of Simon Peter.

71
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,800
 And to help us to understand that story, I want to actually show you something.

72
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,500
 So just come with me for a sec.

73
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:29,700
 I want to show you the four primary elements that are found in the story of Peter's life.

74
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:36,400
 And these four things are a net, they're a sword here, they're a fire and a sheep.

75
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,200
 Let me show you those again.

76
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,900
 Net, sword, fire and a sheep.

77
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:45,900
 And those four things are what actually comes to define the person of Peter.

78
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,600
 And those four things become actually the thing that we begin to see

79
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:56,200
 to shape the transformation of Peter into the new possibilities that Christ had for them.

80
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,200
 So let me tell you the story of Peter's life.

81
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,100
 We first meet Peter actually on the shores of the Sea of Galilee.

82
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:07,000
 This is right towards the beginning of Jesus's teaching ministry.

83
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,900
 And Jesus at this point in his life hadn't called any of the disciples to him.

84
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:16,300
 And he's teaching one day right there on the shores of the Sea of Galilee.

85
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:21,000
 And in fact the crowd around him is so large that he begins to get swamped by that crowd.

86
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 And he's so hemmed in by it that he looks around to see how he can kind of move away from them.

87
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,900
 And he sees that there are two fishing boats right there.

88
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:34,400
 And he calls one of the fishing boats over and that boat belongs to a fisherman by the name of Simon.

89
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,100
 And Jesus stands in the boat and he pushes a little bit out from shore.

90
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,400
 And he in that space can begin to teach the crowds.

91
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:47,400
 Now the Simon who's the fisherman who owns that boat is kind of a bit overwhelmed by what's taking place.

92
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:52,900
 He's just been out all night fishing and him and his friends have not caught anything.

93
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,300
 And they've just come back right here at the early part of the day.

94
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,900
 They're tired. They're worn out. They've just come back.

95
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,500
 And suddenly this rabbi has gone in his boat told him to push out from shore.

96
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,400
 You can almost sense that there's Simon kind of sitting in the boat going like,

97
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,700
 "Okay, come on buddy, you know, like let's get this going. Let's get this done. Let's move on."

98
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:15,000
 Well, Jesus finishes teaching the crowds and then he turns to Simon

99
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,800
 and perhaps understanding the frustration that Simon's feeling.

100
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:24,200
 He says, "Hey, why don't you head out back into the heart of the lake and put your nets down one more time."

101
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:29,200
 Now Simon's an expert fisherman and he's not been able to catch anything all night.

102
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,500
 He knows that this is just one of those days where the fish are not biting.

103
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,200
 But perhaps out of respect to the rabbi, perhaps out of the fact of the crowds that were around,

104
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:42,000
 Simon obeys him, goes out into the middle of the lake and I can almost sense that he throws the nets out.

105
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,300
 He's probably thinking, "Look, I'll prove to you that there's no fish here."

106
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:51,300
 And of course, we know the story. Peter catches the largest amount of fish that he has ever done.

107
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,700
 I mean, it's so hard that they can't even seem to pull the nets in.

108
00:07:54,700 --> 00:08:00,000
 And Simon suddenly realizes that this person sitting in his boat is not just some traveling speaker.

109
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,900
 He's not just some rabbi. This person is a holy man.

110
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,100
 What's taken place is a miracle of God.

111
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:17,900
 And so Simon falls on his knees before the rabbi and he says, "Lord," he says, "go away from me, for I am a sinner."

112
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:24,700
 Simon realizes in the light of this miracle and in the power that was obviously of God in this person,

113
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:30,400
 he was ashamed of the things that were sticking in him, the things in his life, the way that he was living his life.

114
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,200
 And he said, "I'm a sinner. You must leave me."

115
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:40,200
 And Jesus, in a moment of compassion that we'll see take place throughout the gospel stories,

116
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,800
 leans over and places his hand on Simon's shoulder.

117
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:52,600
 And he says this, he says, "You do not need to be afraid, for from now on, you'll catch people."

118
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:58,200
 You're not going to be a fisher of fish. You're going to be a fisher of people.

119
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,400
 That's now your destiny.

120
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,300
 And here's Peter, thinking that his life revolves around this lake.

121
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,600
 And suddenly this rabbi, this holy man of God, calls him into a new possibility,

122
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:14,000
 calls him into a new time to leave his nets behind and begin to minister and walk out

123
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,700
 and try to reach the Jewish people, beginning to be understood that a rabbi,

124
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:22,100
 if a rabbi calls you and asks you to follow after him,

125
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,500
 it was one of the most precious, important things that you could hope for as a young Jewish person.

126
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,200
 And so Peter and his colleagues, they move up to the shore.

127
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,300
 They leave the boats behind. They store up the nets.

128
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:38,300
 They walk away from them and they start to follow Jesus.

129
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:44,400
 And over the next three years, they encounter some of the most unbelievable events.

130
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,100
 They see miracle after miracle.

131
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,000
 They see this one do things that they thought would never be possible before.

132
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,100
 Turning water into wine, feeding five thousands, walking on water.

133
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:01,500
 And Simon begins to wrestle with the idea that this is more than just a prophet,

134
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,800
 more than just a rabbi.

135
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,800
 Perhaps this one might be the long-awaited for Messiah that we were hoping would come.

136
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,600
 And Jesus, eventually sensing this in Simon, turns to him one day and says,

137
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,000
 "Who do you actually think I am?"

138
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,900
 I mean, not what the crowds think I am, not what disciples think I am.

139
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,000
 Who do you personally think I am?

140
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,900
 And Simon turns to him and he says, "You are the Christ of God."

141
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,300
 I mean, you are the Messiah. He names it. He sees it.

142
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,600
 And in faith, he proclaims it.

143
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,100
 And Jesus turns to him and says, "Okay, up until now, you've been called Simon,

144
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,200
 which in Hebrew means listener.

145
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,000
 I'm now going to call you Peter, which in the Hebrew means rock.

146
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,800
 And this new name now classifies who you are, another new possibility for you.

147
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,900
 You are now going to be the foundation of my church.

148
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:57,000
 Upon this rock, I will build my church.

149
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,600
 The revelation of me as a Messiah and you now, Peter,

150
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,400
 as the one that I call to found and to build my church."

151
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,800
 The Bible tells us that as soon as that proclamation of the Messiah of Christ happens,

152
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,200
 and soon as Jesus changes his name,

153
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,700
 Jesus and the disciples begin to walk specifically towards Jerusalem.

154
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,300
 And you can imagine for Peter how excited he would be.

155
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,100
 He's heard the stories.

156
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,500
 He knows what's going to take place when the Messiah gets to Jerusalem.

157
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,600
 He knows it's going to be a moment of great celebration.

158
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,200
 He knows it'll be the time when the Messiah will take his throne

159
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,700
 at the evil Greco-Roman Empire that had been so oppressing the people would be pushed back.

160
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:45,300
 He understood that this would be the moment where actually sin would be once and for all dealt with,

161
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,600
 that there would be literally heaven on earth.

162
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,300
 It was a time of victory, of celebration.

163
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:57,700
 You can imagine how excited as they crest up that hill and they glimpse on Jerusalem for the first time.

164
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:04,000
 And then they walk into the city and nothing is as Peter had predicted.

165
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:12,300
 I mean, Jesus, the conquering victorious Messiah, doesn't do anything that Peter thought he was going to do.

166
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:17,200
 He goes into the temple and he annoys everybody and pushes out the people that were trading there.

167
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,000
 He begins to teach the crowd about his death.

168
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,500
 He begins to speak in ways that people are claiming he's blasphemous.

169
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,600
 I mean, here's Peter thinking that they've come into the place where finally the Romans are going to be pushed aside.

170
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,200
 And it actually seems like Jesus is getting pushed aside.

171
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:40,800
 Rumors are beginning to be said that actually Jesus might get arrested and killed.

172
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,200
 And Peter is thinking, "You cannot kill the Messiah.

173
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:49,500
 I mean, that doesn't make sense. Like none of this is adding up."

174
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:54,700
 And then one evening, they're in this upper room and they're sharing in the meal of the Passover.

175
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,700
 And it's just Jesus and his 12 closest disciples.

176
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,300
 And there's Peter right next to him.

177
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:05,100
 And in the meal, Jesus begins to speak of the reality that in just a few days,

178
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:10,500
 most of them in that room is going to deny and betray him.

179
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,100
 And they're all sitting there and they're thinking, "That is not going to happen."

180
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,100
 And Peter being the kind of boisterous one he was, he kind of jumps up and he says,

181
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:24,200
 "Lord, I'm prepared to go to prison. I'm prepared to die for you.

182
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:29,000
 Even if everybody here fails you, I will not fail you.

183
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,900
 I mean, I am willing to even die with you.

184
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:37,500
 I will do that before I will ever disown you."

185
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,300
 Jesus, perhaps a little bit like that time on the boat,

186
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:46,300
 leans over and puts his hand there on Peter's shoulders and he looks him in the eye.

187
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:53,200
 And he says, "Peter, before even this day breaks, before a rooster crows,

188
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,100
 you're going to deny me three times."

189
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:00,900
 And Peter's like, "There is no way that it's ever going to happen.

190
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:05,100
 I will die for you."

191
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,000
 That evening, they're out on the Mount of Olives

192
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,200
 and they're sleeping out there in the shadow of the temple.

193
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,200
 And as they're sleeping, a large army arrives,

194
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,300
 soldiers from the servants of the high priest.

195
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,600
 And they're carrying weapons and they all wake up and there's Peter.

196
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,200
 And you can see that suddenly there's a confrontation

197
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,200
 that Rome and the Jewish authorities have come to arrest Jesus.

198
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,400
 And Peter does what he had said he was going to do in that upper room.

199
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,800
 He finds a sword that was lying nearby and he jumps forward.

200
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,300
 And one of the servants of the high priest is right there, also armed.

201
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:44,100
 And Peter swipes and he cuts off the ear of the servant.

202
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,500
 And Jesus sees this and he's so overwhelmed.

203
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,700
 He jumps forward and he rebukes Peter.

204
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,600
 Not the first time he's done that, by the way.

205
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,500
 He rebukes Peter and he says,

206
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,300
 "No, we will not do it this way."

207
00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:00,700
 And he picks up the ear and he prays and he restores it on the servant's head.

208
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,200
 And then he does something Peter never would have expected.

209
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,900
 He allows himself to be arrested.

210
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,700
 No fighting, no violence.

211
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:14,100
 He actually gives himself up to the authorities

212
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,100
 and the authorities take him and bundle him up

213
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,500
 and walk him out away from the Mount of Olives.

214
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,400
 And there's Peter trying to comprehend everything.

215
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,000
 This is the Messiah.

216
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,300
 This is the Christ.

217
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,100
 This is the one that we thought would change everything.

218
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:35,000
 And the ruling oppressive power has now arrested him and taken him away.

219
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 And almost like Peter's in this daze, in this place of shock.

220
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,400
 He follows after Jesus.

221
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,200
 He follows after the crowd that's leading Jesus away.

222
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,400
 And they take him to the high priest's house in Jerusalem.

223
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,400
 And they enter into this outer large courtyard.

224
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,900
 And then beyond the courtyard, a small crowd takes Jesus into the house.

225
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:58,100
 And Peter finds himself standing there on the outer courtyard

226
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,600
 trying to comprehend everything that's just happened.

227
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
 Now it's really early in the morning.

228
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,800
 It's super cold that night.

229
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:12,500
 And he sees a charcoal fire at work just in the corner of the courtyard.

230
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,700
 And Peter finds himself walking over to the fire

231
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:20,400
 that is surrounded by a bunch of the servants of the high priest.

232
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,800
 And just standing there trying to warm himself on this fire.

233
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,600
 Peter's trying to comprehend and work it all through in his head.

234
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,600
 And he suddenly finds himself in a place of his greatest trauma.

235
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,700
 That everything he'd hoped for, everything he thought Jesus was going to be

236
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,500
 doesn't seem to be working out how he expected.

237
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:44,500
 He realized that he's just been arrested and no doubt is going to go to trial.

238
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:49,400
 And no doubt just a few days later is going to be executed.

239
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,400
 And Peter's standing around that fire thinking to himself,

240
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:57,300
 this Messiah is about to be killed in the worst way that's possible.

241
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:02,100
 That the Romans had actually engineered this execution, crucifixion on the cross

242
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,200
 to be the most painful thing that it could be.

243
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,000
 He's going to be crucified for a heretic.

244
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,700
 And Peter's there thinking, hang on, if they're going to do that to the Messiah,

245
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:17,900
 imagine what they would do to one of his little followers.

246
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:22,800
 Right about that moment, a servant girl who's standing around the fire

247
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,400
 looks at Peter and recognizes him.

248
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,400
 And she says to everybody else there, she says, this was one who was with him.

249
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,200
 And Peter immediately says, woman, I do not know him.

250
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,400
 Denying him the first time.

251
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,600
 The woman, the servant girl persists.

252
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,700
 No, she said, no, I can tell in your accent that you're not from here.

253
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,800
 You're a Galilean. You're part of his tribe.

254
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:48,000
 And again, Peter denies having ever known him.

255
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,800
 By this time, the crowd had gathered around.

256
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,100
 The other servants were there.

257
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,000
 They could see in the firelight his face.

258
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,500
 And one of the relatives of the servant of the high priest who had had his ear cut off

259
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,900
 comes forward and recognizes that it was Peter who had done that.

260
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,600
 And again, he says, no, you are the one.

261
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,800
 You are the one who cut off the servant's ear.

262
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,300
 And Peter stands back from that moment and he says with a loud voice,

263
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:16,500
 I tell you, I never knew the man.

264
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,400
 The third time that he denies him.

265
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:25,900
 And immediately in the distance, a rooster crows for the break of a new day.

266
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:31,200
 Peter immediately remembers the words that Jesus had spoken on that day in the upper room.

267
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,800
 The Bible tells us that he ran out of the courtyard and he wept bitterly.

268
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,800
 That he realized for all that fighting words he'd had in the upper room,

269
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,900
 for all that bravado, I'm willing to go to prison.

270
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,300
 I'm willing to die for you.

271
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,800
 There it came to the very moment where he could have actually lived up to that

272
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:51,000
 and he denies even knowing his best friend.

273
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,100
 He turns his back on Jesus in a moment where perhaps Jesus needed him the most

274
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:00,900
 and Jesus had never done that to him.

275
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,700
 And here's Peter weeping bitterly.

276
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,500
 The Bible tells us the word there means he was in anguish,

277
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,500
 crying out, could not understand what he had just done.

278
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:14,100
 He felt such shame and embarrassment.

279
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:19,300
 That he would be so feeble in the moment when he should have stood up to be counted.

280
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:24,000
 He folded like a deck of cards.

281
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,600
 The inevitable takes place, the trial and then the crucifixion on the cross.

282
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:33,700
 And then three days after that, people start to say that this Jesus is not dead.

283
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:38,100
 That he's been resurrected, that he's come back from life, that he's alive.

284
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,600
 And Peter hears this and you can imagine how that might have felt for him.

285
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,000
 Well, you might have thought that that would be filled with joy.

286
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,300
 Could you imagine Peter going, I don't know if I can face him.

287
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:54,100
 I mean, how can I stand before my best friend who I turn my back on on his darkest hour?

288
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:58,000
 How could I ever bring my, I mean, I'm as bad as Judas.

289
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,600
 I betrayed him. I can't ever face him.

290
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,100
 I'm not worthy to be his disciple. I'm not worthy to be his friend.

291
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:11,000
 I am disqualified from everything that I ever thought would ever take place.

292
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,400
 In the trauma that he's feeling, in the anguish and the shame.

293
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,400
 Peter doesn't want to ever, ever put himself in the place

294
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:27,200
 where he might have to encounter the one that he had betrayed and denied.

295
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,100
 And it's there that I want to pick up the story.

296
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,900
 No one ever said the Bible was boring. That's not a boring story, is it?

297
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,300
 Don't ever let anyone tell you the Bible is a boring document, right?

298
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:41,400
 Let me pick up now the point of the story right here

299
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,000
 when Peter is overwhelmed and wondering what is next

300
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,800
 and wondering how he could ever face Jesus.

301
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:52,200
 This is from John chapter 21 starting in verse 1.

302
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:58,300
 "Afterwards, Jesus appeared again to his disciples, this time by the Sea of Galilee."

303
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:02,000
 "It happened this way, Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus,

304
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,700
 Nathaniel from Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee,

305
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:10,400
 and two other disciples were there together.

306
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,000
 'I'm going out to fish,' Simon Peter told them.

307
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,700
 And they said, 'Well, we'll go with you.'

308
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:23,300
 So they went out, got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing."

309
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,900
 Notice the words here. Peter in front of his friends says,

310
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,400
 "I'm going to go out and fish."

311
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,800
 In other words, everything I thought was the thing that I was called into,

312
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:39,800
 everything thought that I was going to be, none of that I deserve anymore.

313
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,400
 Peter has gone right back to where he began.

314
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,800
 He's retreated right back to his old days,

315
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,800
 right back to the place where he was before Jesus called him.

316
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:52,100
 He's defaulted himself, got himself stuck right back at the very beginning,

317
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,400
 feeling that he is not worthy to do anything else

318
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,300
 other than go back out and be a fisherman.

319
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,700
 I might have left those nets behind before,

320
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,700
 but now those nets will become my life again.

321
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,200
 I don't even know how I could ever lift my head up in pride

322
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,100
 and even look Jesus in the eyes.

323
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,000
 I'm going to go out and fish.

324
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,200
 It's the only thing that I deserve to do.

325
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,100
 And guess what? Once again, he goes out on that lake.

326
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,800
 He slaves all night and he catches nothing.

327
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,000
 This is what trauma does to us.

328
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,500
 Trauma and the stress of it will always cause us

329
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,100
 to want to fall back to what we've always known

330
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,800
 rather than press on into the thing that we may have been caught into.

331
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:37,100
 Trauma and grief will always cause us to root ourselves backwards,

332
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,400
 will always cause us to think that we don't deserve.

333
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:44,200
 The stress creates what's talked about in psychology as fight or flight.

334
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,100
 And we've seen Peter do both in the story.

335
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,900
 The time where he picked up that sword to fight

336
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,000
 and then the time when he's gathered around that charcoal fire

337
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,400
 in the outer courtyard and he flees from knowing Jesus.

338
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,500
 And now here again, just days into the resurrection,

339
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:03,500
 he's fled again onto the shores of the Sea of Galilee

340
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,400
 to the place where he thinks he's the most comfortable

341
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,600
 doing what he thinks he should do

342
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,700
 because he feels he's disqualified from the thing that Jesus called him to do.

343
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,100
 I want to speak to some of you watching this right now

344
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,600
 because I get a sense that I was praying for this message

345
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,100
 that there's a bunch of us who are acting exactly like Peter right now

346
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,400
 where maybe something's taking place in your life.

347
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,200
 Maybe like Peter, you've done something that you're not happy about.

348
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,200
 Maybe you've done something that you're ashamed of.

349
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,500
 Maybe there's a sin in your life.

350
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,700
 Maybe you've hurt somebody that you're close to.

351
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,000
 Maybe you've acted in a certain way or done something

352
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,400
 and you are ashamed of it.

353
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,400
 You're embarrassed about it and you've actually had to pay a price for it.

354
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,100
 Maybe it's hurt the loved ones around you and you're really struggling

355
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:48,600
 and maybe there's been some consequences for that for you

356
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,900
 and because of those actions in the past,

357
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,200
 you feel like you are no longer qualified to do the things

358
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,500
 that you had on your heart that God had called you in to do.

359
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:02,100
 Maybe you've actually self-condemned yourself back to the old habits,

360
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:06,400
 the old ways because you don't think you're worthy of the new

361
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,100
 or perhaps something's happened to you.

362
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,700
 Maybe not by your own fault,

363
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,700
 but something outside external to you has taken place

364
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,500
 that's caused you to feel like you're stuck,

365
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,700
 to feel like you're at that red light,

366
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,800
 to feel like this is the only place now that you deserve to be,

367
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,600
 that all the hopes and the dreams and the promises that you had are now gone for you.

368
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,700
 Perhaps that's the place where you feel like you're standing.

369
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,800
 If that's you, I want to say this.

370
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,200
 God stands over you in this moment and he says,

371
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,100
 "You need to remember I am in control.

372
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,300
 You need to understand that I have not distanced myself from you.

373
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,900
 I have not left you,

374
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,700
 that the place where you are right now is not your permanent home.

375
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:47,800
 You are not disqualified," says the Spirit of God to you.

376
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,900
 You are not disqualified ever from the kingdom of God.

377
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:56,900
 Peter felt like he deserved nothing other than to go back and be a fisherman

378
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,500
 and Jesus is about to show up and tell him,

379
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:03,400
 "You are never disqualified from my kingdom."

380
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,700
 Never disqualified.

381
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,500
 I want you to notice this.

382
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,600
 What happens next is that this figure shows up on the beach

383
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,900
 and there's Peter having done his fishing and caught nothing

384
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,000
 and they see this figure and the figure cries out and says,

385
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,400
 "Hey, did you catch anything?"

386
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,600
 Probably a common thing that was said in those days.

387
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,700
 Peter honestly replies back, "No, we caught nothing."

388
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,900
 And this one says something quite simple.

389
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:29,300
 He says, "Hey, why don't you throw the net on the other side of the boat?"

390
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:33,200
 And Peter, perhaps going, "Well, we tried everything else,"

391
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,100
 throws his net on the other side of the boat

392
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,400
 and once again, there is a catch that they can't even pull in.

393
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,100
 The Bible says 153 large fish almost breaking the nets

394
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,100
 and in that moment, everything comes back for Peter.

395
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,400
 He's taken right back to that very first moment where Jesus met him,

396
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,500
 took him out on the boat, caught that miraculous set of fish.

397
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,100
 Now here he is all that time and he sees this person and he goes,

398
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,100
 "This is Jesus."

399
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:02,300
 I mean, the only person who can ever fill my nets like this is the Son of God

400
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,700
 and there he is and I love this.

401
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,700
 This is so Peter.

402
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:09,100
 Peter literally jumps out of the boat and begins to swim as fast as he can

403
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:13,700
 to get to the shore to meet with his Messiah and his friend.

404
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:18,000
 And I want to pick up now the moment in the passage where they actually get to the shore.

405
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,200
 It's found in verse 9.

406
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,100
 It says this, "When they landed, they saw a fire of burning coals

407
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:30,000
 where they had fish, where Jesus had put fish on it and some bread.

408
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 Jesus said to them, 'Bring some of the fish that you have caught.'

409
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 Simon Peter climbed aboard and dragged the net ashore.

410
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,500
 It was full of large fish, about 153, but even with so many the net was not torn.

411
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:45,600
 Jesus said to them, 'Come now and have breakfast.'

412
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,400
 None of the disciples dared ask him, 'Who are you?'

413
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,800
 For they knew that it was the Lord."

414
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,300
 I want you to see what Jesus does here.

415
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:58,800
 Here he is on the beach and he's created what the scriptures say to us here

416
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,800
 as a charcoal fire.

417
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:07,600
 That phrase, a fire of charcoal, is only ever repeated one other time in the New Testament.

418
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,000
 Do you know when?

419
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,300
 When Peter was in the courtyard of the high priest, cold on that night

420
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:18,800
 and sees a charcoal fire and goes over and warms himself.

421
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:23,200
 Jesus creates the same environment for Peter

422
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,500
 and welcomes him back into the worst moment of his life.

423
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,800
 Now that might seem on the surface like a pretty harsh thing to do,

424
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,400
 but I want you to catch what Jesus is doing here.

425
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,600
 He's actually reframing the narrative of Peter's trauma.

426
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:44,200
 In creating a charcoal fire before him and actually inviting Jesus into that space,

427
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,000
 he's taking Peter right into the place where he denied him three times.

428
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,100
 But in that moment, Jesus is now saying,

429
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:55,200
 "Let me take you back and actually reframe the narrative of your trauma.

430
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,300
 What you thought was the place of your worst moment

431
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:04,100
 is about to become the place of your greatest moment of humanity.

432
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:10,800
 I'm about to actually reframe everything you thought around the very charcoal fire

433
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:16,000
 where you denied me is about to become the place of your greatest redemption."

434
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,200
 I want you to know that this is very important in the idea of post-traumatic growth.

435
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:24,000
 We said last week that our growth from trauma does not take place

436
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,500
 by ignoring our trauma, by trying to walk away from it,

437
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:31,100
 by trying to bury it or by trying to kind of bury the feelings that it creates in us.

438
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,700
 Jesus doesn't try to ignore what's taking place.

439
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:37,800
 At the same time though, Jesus doesn't beat it over his head.

440
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:44,600
 Jesus gently, graciously brings him into the place of owning the reality of the moment,

441
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:49,600
 but not so he can feel shame, but instead so he can be redeemed,

442
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,600
 so that there can be a changing point for him.

443
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,100
 And that's what takes place in this conversation.

444
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,800
 Let me read it to you from verses 15 onwards.

445
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,200
 "When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter,

446
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:04,000
 'Simon, son of John, do you truly love me more than these?'

447
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,300
 'Yes, Lord,' he said, 'you know that I love you.'

448
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,500
 Jesus said, 'well then feed my lambs.'

449
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:12,000
 Again, Jesus said, 'Simon, son of John, do you truly love me?'

450
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,100
 He answered, 'Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.'

451
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,700
 Jesus said, 'well, take care of my sheep.'

452
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,100
 The third time he said to him, 'Simon, son of John, do you love me?'

453
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:25,100
 Peter was hurt because Jesus had asked him a third time, 'do you love me?'

454
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:29,500
 He said, 'Lord, you know all things, you know that I love you.'

455
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:33,400
 Jesus said to him, 'feed my sheep.'

456
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:37,300
 Notice what takes place in that place of trauma.

457
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:40,300
 Three questions about whether he loves him

458
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,600
 for the three denials that took place in that courtyard.

459
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,600
 Three times where Peter is able to say out loud in that moment,

460
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,000
 'I do love you.'

461
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,300
 See, this is the powerful thing about Jesus.

462
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:56,300
 And this is the powerful pivot point for post-traumatic growth.

463
00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:00,900
 See, Jesus is not interested in shaming Peter for his past mistakes.

464
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:04,800
 Instead, he wants to know what's on his heart right in that moment.

465
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,600
 'Do you love me right now?'

466
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,700
 Like Jesus is not saying that was the worst thing.

467
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,500
 He's saying, 'what is in your heart right in this moment?'

468
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,100
 And Peter is there going, 'you know I love you.'

469
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,900
 I love actually what he says right at the end.

470
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:23,300
 He says, 'Jesus, you know all things.'

471
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,000
 This is Peter's way of saying to Jesus,

472
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,900
 'you knew everything that took place in that courtyard.

473
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,200
 You know the trauma that I've been through.

474
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,600
 You know the fact that I denied you three times.

475
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,200
 You know the fact that that has torn me up inside.

476
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,100
 You know the fact that I have retreated back here to the shores of the Sea of Galilee,

477
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,100
 doing the thing that I thought I was only responsible for.

478
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:46,900
 You know how terrible I feel about myself.

479
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,100
 You want to know what I think of you?

480
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,700
 I love you.

481
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:56,300
 I love you because I know that even in how terrible I feel,

482
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:00,500
 you're here right now, reaching out to me.'

483
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:04,300
 Peter understood that Jesus had not given up on him.

484
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,600
 And in saying those three times, 'I love you.

485
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,500
 I love you. I love you.'

486
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:14,300
 Peter was prophetically standing against the enemy's rule

487
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:17,400
 to try to keep him locked down in the red light of his life,

488
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,800
 to keep him stuck there in the place that was his past,

489
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,900
 rather than move forward into the thing that was his future.

490
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:27,900
 And Jesus knows that he needs to reframe the narrative of his trauma

491
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:31,100
 by speaking to him about his personhood, his identity.

492
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,900
 I want you to see here in this passage, it's quite a beautiful thing.

493
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:37,200
 Jesus refers to him as Simon, son of John.

494
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,000
 He doesn't mention Peter here.

495
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 He actually goes back to his original name.

496
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,400
 He says Simon, which means listener.

497
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,900
 And then he says son of John.

498
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:49,900
 See, Jesus is actually centering Peter in his true identity.

499
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,600
 He wants him to know who he truly is.

500
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,300
 He wants him to get right to the place of his identity

501
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,300
 and say the trauma has not defined who you are.

502
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,400
 You want to know who you are?

503
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,900
 You're Simon, son of John,

504
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,800
 who I changed the name to be Peter, which means rock.

505
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,900
 You are not what your trauma says you are.

506
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,800
 You are this one right here, the one I love,

507
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,800
 the one who's sitting with me around this fire,

508
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,500
 restoring and redeeming the narrative of your trauma.

509
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:19,500
 You and your identity is not linked to the worst moment of your life.

510
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,300
 I need to preach this to someone right now.

511
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:26,600
 The sum total of who you are is not the worst moment of your life.

512
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:30,200
 And Jesus is getting into the very heart of the identity for Peter.

513
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,500
 And he's saying, Peter, do you want to know who you truly are?

514
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,100
 Simon, listener.

515
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,300
 That's who you are. You listen.

516
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,300
 You've heard my word. You know who I am.

517
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,700
 You just declared that you love me.

518
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,800
 And guess what?

519
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:49,500
 I am now releasing you out of a place of a restored identity into new possibilities.

520
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,600
 Note this. Every single time that Jesus speaks to him,

521
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:57,700
 he says, feed my sheep, feed my lambs, feed my sheep.

522
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,700
 Remember what took place in the very first time they met?

523
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,200
 Jesus says, oh, you don't need to be afraid.

524
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,300
 From now on you will catch people.

525
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,500
 Now Jesus takes it a step further.

526
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:13,000
 He says, hey, your identity is not just to catch people.

527
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,300
 You're going to be the shepherd of my people.

528
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:19,800
 I want you to go from here and I want you to love my people

529
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,100
 with the same way that you love me in this moment.

530
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,300
 I want you to go from here out of the place of your trauma.

531
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:28,300
 And guess what? The fact that you felt shame,

532
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:32,300
 the fact that you were embarrassed, the fact that you thought you were nothing.

533
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,900
 That's the people you're about to encounter out there.

534
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:38,400
 And as you go and start my church, as you found my church,

535
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,400
 I don't want you to go there just simply as a fisher of people.

536
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:45,000
 You need to go there as a pastor and you're going to be able to pastor my people

537
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,200
 because you felt brokenness yourself.

538
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:54,300
 Your trauma is the very thing that's going to be the root and the power of your ministry, Peter.

539
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:59,400
 This is Jesus redeeming him out of the place and saying nothing is going to be wasted.

540
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:03,500
 You're going to be able to go and pastor a group of people in such a powerful way

541
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:09,700
 that you would not have been able to do if you had not experienced the trauma in the first place.

542
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:16,100
 This is Jesus releasing Peter to the new possibilities of his life.

543
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:21,100
 And Peter from this moment will go and we see in church history what he does.

544
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:24,200
 He goes and preaches to the crowds of boldness and fire.

545
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,800
 Over 3,000 coming to Jesus in one day.

546
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,400
 He's a wounded healer.

547
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:34,200
 He goes and heals people in Jerusalem, just like Jesus healed people in the shores of Galilee.

548
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,600
 He goes and starts and founds the early church, the first church in Jerusalem,

549
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,500
 and passes it for many years.

550
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,600
 He writes letters, pastoral letters to his people

551
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,100
 that explains the beauty of forgiveness and the transformation of life.

552
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:51,800
 Why can he do all that? Because he's been forgiven himself.

553
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:58,100
 And Jesus is releasing him to new possibilities because of the trauma that he had been through.

554
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:04,900
 Now is the time, Peter, for you to become the one that I had always created you to be.

555
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:12,600
 So, a net, a sword, a fire, and then sheep.

556
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:16,300
 Peter's story is also our story.

557
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:23,700
 The same God who met Peter is the same God that's alive in my story and your story.

558
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:27,300
 And I want you to know you are never distant from God.

559
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,700
 I want you to know that that red light that you feel like you're sitting in front of

560
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,000
 does not define who you are.

561
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,600
 I want you to know that as real as trauma is, as hard as it can be,

562
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,000
 it does not shape the fullness of your identity.

563
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,900
 I believe that Jesus wants to show up at each one of our beaches.

564
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,600
 He wants to show up at your beach right now.

565
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:52,900
 After you have struggled over your long, dark night of trauma

566
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,700
 and felt like you have received nothing,

567
00:35:54,700 --> 00:36:00,400
 Jesus will come and stand on the shore of that beach and He will tell you He is in control.

568
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,200
 He will actually assert His authority over your life again.

569
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:09,100
 He will actually invite you to that place of your moment of identity and who you are.

570
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:12,800
 He will begin to speak new possibilities over you,

571
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,300
 begin to take you from a place where you were to a place where you're going to be.

572
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:20,700
 And He knows that the scars that you carry from the trauma that you're in right now

573
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:25,700
 is going to be the very thing that's going to bring healing to the many that He wants to bring into your life.

574
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:29,700
 What happens to Peter also now becomes a part of our journey.

575
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:33,300
 That's true post-traumatic growth.

576
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,600
 New possibilities for you.

577
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,600
 Some of you watching this right now,

578
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:42,800
 there are new possibilities for you in the workplace that you have never allowed yourself to think about.

579
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,200
 Maybe you've never been willing to take the risk in a new adventure

580
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,400
 or a new investment or a new opportunity at work.

581
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:54,100
 And maybe some of you have wanted to change jobs for a long time and just haven't had the courage

582
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,700
 and God stands over you in this time of trauma of pandemic

583
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:01,200
 and He says, "You want to know what's ahead for you? Open your heart to me again.

584
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:06,200
 I want to speak to you and give you courage and boldness for new possibilities."

585
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,200
 Some of you, those new possibilities are in relationships.

586
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,900
 Some of you, you've got fractured relationships in your life,

587
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:15,300
 maybe because of some things you've done or because of what others have done to you.

588
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,400
 And I feel like Jesus stands over you right now

589
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,500
 and welcomes, invites you into new possibilities,

590
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,200
 maybe to repair relationships that are broken

591
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,600
 or it might be to launch you into some new relationships

592
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:30,500
 that you thought you would never want it once again, ever receive.

593
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:36,700
 Actually, as I'm saying this right now, I feel like some of you feel like you cannot be loved.

594
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:40,900
 I feel like right now, some of you feel that you can't be loved.

595
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,000
 Maybe you've done something wrong.

596
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,300
 Maybe someone's done something to you

597
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:48,700
 and it's left you in a place where you think, "I can't be loved anymore."

598
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:52,300
 And I want you to know that there are relationships ahead of you

599
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,600
 that are filled with new love for you,

600
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:59,300
 new possibilities of relationships that you've not allowed yourself to even consider

601
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:03,200
 because you feel like you're not worthy to be loved by someone else again.

602
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,700
 I feel like that's really important for some people who are divorced watching this right now.

603
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,400
 You feel like you're on plan B.

604
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,200
 And I feel like the Holy Spirit's saying right now, there's new possibilities for you.

605
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:19,400
 New possibilities for you to be loved in a way that you perhaps never anticipated or expected.

606
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,900
 And perhaps for some of you, that new possibility is in your faith.

607
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:26,800
 Maybe this year is the year for you to take that step forward in faith.

608
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,900
 Maybe you know that God's been calling you into something

609
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:32,300
 and you've been holding back, thinking maybe you're not worthy or deserving of it

610
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,800
 or maybe just afraid of it.

611
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,200
 I pray that the Spirit of God would fall on you right now

612
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,000
 and fill you with something that would enable you to have the courage to step out.

613
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,100
 Be strong and courageous, I hear the Lord say.

614
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:47,900
 I hear the Lord say, "I'm not worthy of you, but I'm calling you to step out."

615
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,800
 And I pray that the Spirit of God would fall on you right now

616
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,800
 and fill you with something that would enable you to have the courage to step out.

617
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,600
 Be strong and courageous, I hear the Lord say.

618
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,300
 Be strong and courageous, I hear the Lord say.

619
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,600
 And I pray that the Spirit of God would fall on you right now

620
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:07,800
 and fill you with something that would enable you to have the courage to step out.

621
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,800
 Be strong and courageous, I hear the Lord say.

622
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,100
 And I pray that the Spirit of God would fall on you right now

623
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:18,100
 and fill you with something that would enable you to have the courage to step out.

624
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:21,100
 And I pray that the Spirit of God would fall on you right now

625
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:25,100
 and fill you with something that would enable you to have the courage to step out.

626
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:28,100
 And I pray that the Spirit of God would fall on you right now

627
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:32,100
 and fill you with something that would enable you to have the courage to step out.

628
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:35,100
 And I pray that the Spirit of God would fall on you right now

629
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:39,100
 and fill you with something that would enable you to have the courage to step out.

630
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:42,100
 And I pray that the Spirit of God is here for you to move you forward.

631
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:45,100
 Can we pray together? Let's pray.

632
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:49,100
 Father, we just thank you for this moment.

633
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:52,100
 Lord, I want to pray for everybody in this room.

634
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:55,100
 I want to pray for everybody who's watching online.

635
00:39:55,100 --> 00:40:01,100
 I want to ask that your Holy Spirit would come and minister to us new possibilities, Lord.

636
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:05,100
 Some of us, like Peter, we've run backwards.

637
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:10,100
 That picture of being stopped at a red light resonates with us deeply.

638
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:14,100
 Would you hear the Holy Spirit today saying, "This is not the place I've designed you to be.

639
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:19,100
 I've not designed you to put roots down at the red light."

640
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:24,100
 Some of you have gone back to fishing.

641
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:28,100
 And I feel like the Lord is saying over you, "Drop the nets.

642
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:31,100
 It's time for you to move forward again.

643
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:35,100
 Don't let the enemy define who you are through your trauma,

644
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:42,100
 but allow the trauma to actually be the deposit of the things that the Holy Spirit is going to use most for his glory ahead.

645
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,100
 For those of you that feel like you're no longer lovable,

646
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:50,100
 the love of Christ speaks over you against the lie of the enemy to hold you back.

647
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:54,100
 For some of you who feel like you can't move forward in a calling that God has for you,

648
00:40:54,100 --> 00:41:01,100
 I come against the enemy's strategy to put you on the boat on the lake rather than on the shore moving forward.

649
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:05,100
 For some of you who feel like you're at an end point,

650
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:09,100
 I pray new possibilities in the name of Jesus over you.

651
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,100
 Father, we don't do this in our own strength.

652
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,100
 We don't do this because we try to be better people.

653
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,100
 We do this because of a work of your Spirit.

654
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:19,100
 So Spirit, break out. Spirit, break out.

655
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,100
 Heaven, come down.

656
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:27,100
 Lord, would your presence and your Spirit fill me and change me, renew me and send me forward

657
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,100
 into the person that you've always created me to be.

658
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:34,100
 Not in my own effort, but in the grace of the power of the Spirit of God.

659
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:38,100
 And we pray that over every person at the Vine, over every person watching this,

660
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,100
 and we thank you that you release us into this.

661
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:44,100
 In Jesus' name. In Jesus' name.

662
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:46,100
 Everyone says, "Amen."
