1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,420
 (soft music)

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:14,480
 The Father would remind you this morning

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,480
 that His mighty right arm,

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,580
 His mighty right arm is stretched out towards you.

5
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:28,360
 Always is a symbol of strength, of victory.

6
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:33,360
 It's the arm that a warrior would have the sword in.

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,720
 And the Lord is saying,

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,580
 "I see the need that you have at this time."

9
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,880
 And I feel like for many of us in this room,

10
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,400
 it's an emotional need.

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,240
 And the Father would say,

12
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,920
 "My mighty right arm is extended towards you now."

13
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:56,680
 And there's this beautiful moment in Nehemiah

14
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,900
 as he's rebuilding the wall

15
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,640
 and he's come under such attack from those

16
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,200
 that were trying to resist the rebuilding

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,500
 of the walls of Jerusalem.

18
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:10,560
 In chapter six, Nehemiah turns to the Father

19
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,280
 and he says, "Lord, strengthen my hands."

20
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,920
 And I feel just in the power of the Holy Spirit

21
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,140
 for you here this morning, that that's a prayer for you.

22
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,920
 And so if your hands are open

23
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,500
 and if you're in need of the mighty right arm of God

24
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,540
 to do battle for you,

25
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,180
 I wonder whether you would just pray that prayer

26
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,680
 in your heart now.

27
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,540
 Lord, strengthen my hands, strengthen my heart,

28
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,900
 strengthen my mind, strengthen my emotions,

29
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:48,660
 strengthen my relationships, strengthen my business,

30
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,220
 strengthen the things that I don't have the ability

31
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,680
 to strengthen, Father, would you strengthen me?

32
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,640
 Father, you've put a task,

33
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,520
 you've put something before each one of us,

34
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,280
 just like you put before Nehemiah a noble task.

35
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,600
 And Lord, I wanna pray for anybody in this room

36
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,960
 that's wanting to shrink back,

37
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,800
 that perhaps opposition or perhaps word spoken

38
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,040
 or perhaps resistance is causing people in this room

39
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,560
 to wanna put the tools down

40
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,920
 and to give up on the building that God has called you to do.

41
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,480
 We just say in the name of Jesus over you,

42
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,780
 that the Father's mighty right arm is here to save,

43
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,720
 it's here to move on your behalf,

44
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,880
 and he will strengthen you for the resilience

45
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,880
 and the hope and the life that he wants to fill you in.

46
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,960
 The Lord would say, I see you.

47
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:49,200
 I see you, the wholeness of you.

48
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,260
 I see your coming and your going.

49
00:02:53,260 --> 00:03:00,220
 You have nothing to fear, for you are in my gaze.

50
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,920
 My light shines upon you.

51
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,300
 You have nothing to fear.

52
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,640
 So as I called to Joshua, so I called you,

53
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,200
 be strong and courageous.

54
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,880
 Be strong and courageous.

55
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:20,060
 Allow my spirit to fill you, to strengthen your hands.

56
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,800
 Do not give up, for it is your time to rise.

57
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,660
 It is your time to wake.

58
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,100
 It is your time to move.

59
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,560
 Don't hold back.

60
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,620
 For the same spirit, the Bible says,

61
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,420
 that raised Christ from the dead is now in you.

62
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:41,460
 And so I wanna pray that you would feel

63
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,260
 as we open God's word together here this morning,

64
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:48,320
 you would feel the calling of Christ upon you again.

65
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,200
 For those of you that have been feeling weak,

66
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,340
 you will feel strong.

67
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,380
 For those that have been overwhelmed, you'll be comforted.

68
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,660
 For those that have felt to shrink back in this season,

69
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,400
 you will feel the Holy Spirit's wind behind your back.

70
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,820
 Lord, I pray for a releasing of your people

71
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:11,020
 as we open your word together here this morning.

72
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,800
 Holy Spirit, come.

73
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,720
 Holy Spirit, come.

74
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:21,080
 We thank you for this, Lord.

75
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:26,320
 And to you be the glory, we pray, in Jesus' name.

76
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,520
 Everyone says, amen, amen.

77
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,200
 Hey, can we thank our worship team?

78
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,700
 (congregation applauding)

79
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,880
 Well, welcome to the Vine.

80
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,600
 If this is your relative first time with us,

81
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,480
 we're so glad you're here.

82
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,320
 And we know that we got a full overflow as well.

83
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,520
 Outside and people joining us online from around the world.

84
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,480
 We're so glad you're here.

85
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,720
 And isn't it wonderful to be in a crazy city like Hong Kong

86
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,720
 and just have a moment where we can go,

87
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,520
 just me, just me?

88
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,360
 Thank you.

89
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,080
 Or we can just take the foot off the gas for a moment

90
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,800
 and just kind of go, thank you, Lord.

91
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,080
 Thanks for being with us.

92
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,880
 I wonder if you've ever experienced

93
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,080
 the absolute blackness of the darkness of night.

94
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,920
 I wonder if you've ever been in a situation

95
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,760
 where you've been in the complete darkness of an evening

96
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,640
 or a complete darkness of a night.

97
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,960
 If you're anything like me and you grew up here in Hong Kong

98
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,360
 then chances are you haven't.

99
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,760
 Because we live in a city, don't we, that's 24/7?

100
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,600
 A city that is filled with the ambient neon light pollution

101
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,760
 that it is.

102
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,640
 Whenever we go to bed at night,

103
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,720
 we may draw the curtains and turn off the lights

104
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,880
 in our house, but it feels like there's this other big light

105
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,800
 glowing out there.

106
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,000
 And I grew up in this city

107
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,320
 and I've always had ambient light around me always.

108
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,680
 And I've never really known the trueness

109
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,840
 of what darkness is like.

110
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,880
 I've just gotten used to sleeping with the glow of a city

111
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,880
 that is 24/7, that never sleeps.

112
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,080
 But this all changed when my wife invited me

113
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,440
 to come and visit her and her family

114
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,760
 in their small little town in New Zealand.

115
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,200
 New Zealand that doesn't have any neon lights.

116
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,760
 And I remember that first night I had gone to bed,

117
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,360
 I was exhausted, I mean, traveled down and was tired.

118
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,160
 And I got into bed and I had a little side lamp on

119
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,280
 and I was reading my book,

120
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,800
 but I couldn't read for very long, I was super tired,

121
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,000
 put the book down.

122
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,040
 I turned the light out and I freaked out.

123
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,320
 Because for the first time,

124
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,840
 literally probably the first time in my life,

125
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,640
 I was finally in a place

126
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,000
 where there was no light pollution at all.

127
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,760
 And suddenly I was in darkness, like complete darkness.

128
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,560
 It was like, (screams)

129
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,840
 like I really didn't like it, it filled me with fear.

130
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,200
 There was actually no difference in that room

131
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,640
 as I'm lying in that bed

132
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,320
 between having my eyes open or my eyes closed.

133
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,120
 It was completely black either way.

134
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,920
 I remember lying there,

135
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,080
 putting my hand in front of my face like this

136
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,760
 just to make sure I still had limbs on me.

137
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,280
 'Cause I could not literally see my hand

138
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,480
 right in front of my face.

139
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,240
 And I remember lying there thinking,

140
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,200
 I'm glad I'm here visiting my beautiful wife and her family,

141
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,320
 but I can't sleep in darkness.

142
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,720
 It's like I needed like some ambient light somewhere

143
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,200
 to kind of lull me into a place of being able to sleep.

144
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,760
 The darkness was total and the darkness was uncomfortable.

145
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,640
 I needed some light.

146
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,640
 As Paul continues this incredible letter

147
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,520
 to the church in Ephesus that we've been going through

148
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,360
 as a church over the last number of weeks,

149
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,640
 he comes to a section of it, chapters five and six,

150
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,760
 where he has some of the strongest things

151
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,120
 that he wants to say to his church community.

152
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,080
 Stuff that's actually gonna be kind of difficult

153
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,520
 for them to hear.

154
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,920
 Stuff that's gonna shake up a few things amongst them

155
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,120
 and stuff that's gonna sober them

156
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,400
 in terms of how they think about church

157
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,760
 and life and community.

158
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,160
 And Paul's doing this off the back

159
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,560
 of what Pastor Tim shared with us last week

160
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,760
 about this idea of taking off the old self,

161
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,680
 which is being corrupted by a deceit

162
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,320
 and our deceitful desires and putting on the new self

163
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,640
 that is filled with freedom and love

164
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,080
 and the glory of God and holiness.

165
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,120
 And Paul's just taught them,

166
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,360
 look, I want you to take off the old stuff,

167
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,440
 put on the new stuff.

168
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,160
 And then from chapters five and six,

169
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,840
 he basically unpacks what it is

170
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,640
 that he wants them to take off

171
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,920
 and what it is that they can now put on.

172
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,720
 And the passage that we're looking at here this morning,

173
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,120
 I think is perhaps the hardest things

174
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,360
 that he has to say to his church.

175
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,200
 He's got some pretty tough stuff to say to them

176
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,680
 in these verses that we're looking at.

177
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,800
 But everything we've seen of Paul so far in this letter

178
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,320
 is important for us to remember.

179
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,160
 Paul has an incredible pastoral heart.

180
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,800
 I mean, he loves the people of his church so much.

181
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,360
 We've seen this throughout the letter, haven't we?

182
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,120
 He's just spent three chapters, chapters one to three,

183
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,920
 unpacking Christ and what Christ has done

184
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,800
 and the grace that Christ has done

185
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,200
 to pay the price for our sins

186
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,000
 and to bring us into new life.

187
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,400
 He's then at the end of chapter three,

188
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,520
 prayed that beautiful prayer of love.

189
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,160
 Oh, church, I wish that you would be strengthened

190
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,560
 from within you with the power of the Spirit,

191
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,640
 that you would know the height, depth, and width

192
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,080
 and the length of love,

193
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,960
 that love that surpasses understanding

194
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,320
 would be inside of you.

195
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,760
 He said, I want you to know love.

196
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,560
 And then he started chapter four with,

197
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,080
 hey, I want you to now live a life that's worthy

198
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,680
 of all the things that we've just talked about

199
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,200
 in the first three chapters.

200
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,600
 And I want you as a church body,

201
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,040
 as a Christian community to find unity together

202
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,880
 in the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God.

203
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,760
 He's just poured all that out.

204
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,520
 And now he's getting to the point

205
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,280
 where really the rubber hits the road.

206
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,400
 And he's saying to the church,

207
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,600
 but there's still this going on inside of you.

208
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,120
 Despite all the stuff that we've seen,

209
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,800
 there's still this, but his pastoral heart is like,

210
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,560
 how do I explain this in a way

211
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,960
 that number one, sobers you

212
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,000
 and helps you to understand the sin

213
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,200
 that is still at work in you

214
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,480
 and leads you to deal with that,

215
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,960
 but equally inspire you,

216
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,480
 lift you up so that you're living better.

217
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,240
 You're desiring to live in a way

218
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,320
 that you're not currently living.

219
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,400
 He's like, how do I do this?

220
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,680
 Sober you, inspire you.

221
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,280
 And so here's what he decides to do.

222
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,280
 He decides to dig into the rich history,

223
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:23,360
 biblical history of the metaphor of darkness and light

224
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,680
 in order to help his church to understand

225
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,040
 how they need to take off.

226
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,200
 But actually Christ has already done

227
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,080
 and placed upon them so much.

228
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,880
 And as I unpack this metaphor that Paul brings us

229
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,800
 of darkness and light with you today, here's my prayer.

230
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,800
 I feel in my spirit that many of us here, myself included,

231
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,880
 where it doesn't make a difference

232
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,720
 whether our eyes are open or our eyes are closed,

233
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,880
 we're still seeing darkness.

234
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,320
 We're really struggling to see the future for ourselves.

235
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,720
 We're struggling perhaps to see the future for our city.

236
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,160
 We're struggling perhaps to see anything good at all.

237
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,320
 And when we look around the world, we see so much darkness

238
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,960
 and it's almost like there's a hand in front of us,

239
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,840
 but we cannot see it.

240
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,680
 Some of you right now are currently

241
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,400
 in a posture of blindness.

242
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:22,200
 And my prayer as we open up these passages today

243
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,360
 is that something would click for you.

244
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,680
 Something would shift in your spirit

245
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,200
 and you would go from darkness to light.

246
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,000
 Let me read this to you from Ephesians 5,

247
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,280
 starting in verse three.

248
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,280
 Listen to these strong words of the Apostle Paul,

249
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,000
 but from a pastoral heart for his church.

250
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,160
 He says, "But among you, there must not even be a hint

251
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,080
 of sexual immorality or of any kind of impurity or of greed

252
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,880
 because these are improper for God's people.

253
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,360
 Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk

254
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,920
 or coarse joking, which are out of place,

255
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,040
 but rather thanksgiving.

256
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,160
 For of this you can be sure, no immoral, impure

257
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,320
 or greedy person, such a person as an idolater,

258
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,800
 has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.

259
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,480
 So let no one deceive you with empty words.

260
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,360
 And because of such things, God's wrath comes

261
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,320
 on those who are disobedient.

262
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,840
 For you were once darkness,

263
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,200
 but now you are light in the Lord.

264
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,200
 So live as children of light,

265
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,400
 for the fruit of light consists in all goodness

266
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,760
 and justice and truth.

267
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,840
 And so find out what pleases the Lord.

268
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,360
 Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness,

269
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,640
 but rather expose them.

270
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,600
 For it is shameful to even mention

271
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,400
 what the disobedient do in secret,

272
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,440
 but everything exposed by the light becomes visible

273
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,040
 and everything illuminated becomes a light."

274
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,640
 This is why it says, "Wake up, O sleeper,

275
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,480
 rise from the dead and Christ will shine on you."

276
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,560
 So be very careful then how you live,

277
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,240
 not as unwise, but as wise,

278
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,480
 making the most of every opportunity

279
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,360
 because the days are dark, they are evil.

280
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,840
 It's really majestic what Paul does here.

281
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,560
 He's not trying to win friends.

282
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,440
 He's trying to be really honest

283
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,760
 and direct with his community.

284
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,720
 And there's this beautiful flow in what he's teaching here.

285
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,600
 He starts out by addressing some of that deep stuff

286
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,240
 that he can see still at work with his people,

287
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,000
 but then he moves them to think about this metaphor

288
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,080
 of darkness and light.

289
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,040
 And in that, he calls them to now live in a new way,

290
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,280
 to live, and I love this phrase, as children of light.

291
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,400
 So he's got some strong things to say

292
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,040
 about the sin and their brokenness,

293
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,000
 but he's speaking to them as children

294
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,880
 and he's giving them a new perspective

295
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,480
 on how they can now live their lives.

296
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,400
 I wanna take you through this flow

297
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,680
 and hopefully as we do so,

298
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,600
 something will speak into your soul here.

299
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,960
 Notice the sin list that he provides.

300
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,640
 It's not an exhaustive list,

301
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,000
 but I think he's chosen specific sins

302
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,760
 that were relevant for this particular community.

303
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,600
 Things like the sexual immorality, the greed,

304
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,080
 there's a whole bunch of them that I've highlighted

305
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,680
 on the screen there for you to see.

306
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,160
 What I want you to see most importantly

307
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,000
 is that Paul is talking about not just general things.

308
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,320
 Hey, don't do these things.

309
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,040
 He's saying, these things are at work within you

310
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,200
 and I'm pointing them out for one very important reason.

311
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,640
 These particular sins that he's highlighting,

312
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,440
 that he sees at work in his body,

313
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,880
 these sins, he's saying basically,

314
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,280
 are sins that don't just break your relationship

315
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,720
 with your father, with God,

316
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,680
 but it also breaks your relationship with one another.

317
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,880
 Every single one of these is about breaking that community

318
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,120
 that he's just prayed for them

319
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,920
 at the end of chapter three that they would have

320
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,600
 and he should have said at the beginning of chapter four

321
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,120
 that unity that they can find

322
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,680
 in the knowledge and the faith of God.

323
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,320
 These things he's saying breaks everything

324
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,560
 that we've been talking about in the letter so far.

325
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,240
 Every single one of these are basically selfish acts

326
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,720
 that you do at the expense of the other.

327
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,320
 The sexually immoral,

328
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,480
 those that are sexually in immorality, he says,

329
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,000
 what you're doing is you're seeking pleasure for yourself

330
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 even at the expense of the people around you.

331
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,520
 He talks about greed.

332
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,800
 Greed by its very definition is the hoarding of resources

333
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,280
 so that you gain, again, at the expense of the other.

334
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,080
 He talks about harsh language, coarse joking.

335
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,520
 Again, it's all around this idea

336
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,360
 of we shouldn't be slandering each other.

337
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,200
 We shouldn't be gossiping about each other.

338
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,040
 We shouldn't be making fun of one another.

339
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,320
 That just breaks disunity, but God's called us to unity.

340
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,080
 Do you see this?

341
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,480
 And the reason why this is important

342
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,880
 is because he actually does something

343
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,760
 incredibly theological.

344
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,240
 Let me show you this from verse five.

345
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,400
 He says, "For this you can be sure,

346
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,720
 no immoral, impure, or greedy person,

347
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,160
 such a person is an idolater,

348
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,840
 has an inheritance in the kingdom of God

349
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,080
 or the kingdom of Christ."

350
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,920
 It's really important you see something here.

351
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,040
 Paul says, look, when you're doing sins,

352
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,360
 that breaks the unity and community

353
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,440
 that you can have as the body,

354
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,120
 here's ultimately what you're doing.

355
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,120
 You're doing idolatry,

356
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,800
 and it's idolatry not worshiping other gods.

357
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,160
 It's idolatry making yourself God.

358
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,920
 Come on, church, this is super important

359
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,200
 that you track with this.

360
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,280
 'Cause what he's saying, something that's very deep here,

361
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,640
 this is the original sin that happened in the garden.

362
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,280
 If you go back to Genesis chapter three,

363
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,480
 and you see Adam and Eve there,

364
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,080
 and you see Satan coming in that form of the snake

365
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,760
 and speaking to Adam and Eve,

366
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,320
 he basically says this, Satan, he said,

367
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,920
 God told you not to eat of this fruit.

368
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,440
 Well, that's because God doesn't want you

369
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,320
 to become like him.

370
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,760
 But if you eat of that fruit, you'll become like him,

371
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,760
 knowing good and evil.

372
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,360
 And Adam and Eve take the fruit

373
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,640
 because they've decided, here's the temptation,

374
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,360
 they've decided they're not comfortable anymore

375
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,360
 being made in the image of God, Genesis one and two.

376
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,800
 They now want to be like God.

377
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,960
 They wanna be equal to God.

378
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,760
 So at the heart of the very first sin

379
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,120
 is this desire to be a peer with God.

380
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,840
 And what Paul is saying is that the ultimate purpose

381
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:05,360
 of all sin is to exchange your identity

382
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,480
 from being a child of God to trying to be a peer with God.

383
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,800
 That's ultimately what all sin does.

384
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,000
 It's trying to shift you away from your right relationship

385
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,440
 with your father in heaven and cause you to think

386
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,480
 that you can be on the same level.

387
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,960
 So when we place ourselves at the center of our world

388
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,680
 through whatever acts we might do in order to do that,

389
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,320
 we become greedy.

390
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,360
 When we say my pleasure is more important

391
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,560
 than anyone else's.

392
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,680
 What Paul's saying is you're idle worshiping yourself

393
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,920
 and that is the roots of all sin.

394
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,200
 And when you do that,

395
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,000
 you're breaking the unity amongst yourselves.

396
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,560
 Are you tracking with this?

397
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,320
 This is why he uses the word in verse five,

398
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,120
 the word inheritance.

399
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,960
 He says, if you live that way, if you act that way,

400
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,960
 you will lose the inheritance that you have in Christ Jesus.

401
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,240
 You have no inheritance.

402
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,520
 Now that's a very interesting word he uses here.

403
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,840
 He uses this word on purpose because notice it,

404
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,520
 if your original perspective and relationship

405
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,640
 and identity is a child, so you're here,

406
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,080
 you're a child of God.

407
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,720
 And if sin causes you to try to become a peer of God,

408
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,880
 what he's saying is you no longer see yourself

409
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,840
 as his family.

410
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,240
 You never see yourself anymore as a son and daughter.

411
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,200
 You think you're equal with him.

412
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,600
 Well, you're gonna lose your inheritance

413
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,200
 because inheritance is a family thing, isn't it?

414
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,520
 Inheritance happens when you're within a family.

415
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,760
 And he's saying, look, you've decided through your sin,

416
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,200
 through the way you're acting to try to be a peer of God.

417
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,920
 So you're gonna lose out on your inheritance.

418
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,000
 And Paul is crying out to his church,

419
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,880
 don't lose the inheritance that Christ has paid

420
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,960
 an incredible price for on the cross.

421
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,480
 Your salvation, your hope, your forgiveness,

422
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,480
 your mercy, your grace, your flourishing, your shalom,

423
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,600
 be made now into his image

424
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,120
 so that you can become the fullness of him,

425
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,120
 as he's just said in chapter four,

426
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,720
 the wholeness of the fullness of Christ.

427
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,560
 He's like, you'll lose all of that

428
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,520
 if you think you're no longer part of God's family,

429
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,000
 but you wanna try to be God himself.

430
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,920
 And he's like, that is not the way to go.

431
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:16,760
 And as Paul's unpacking this,

432
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,680
 he's inviting his church to shift something within them,

433
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:25,760
 just to say, I don't want to lose my identity

434
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,560
 as a child of God.

435
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,160
 That is the primary thing,

436
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,360
 because in that perspective of being a child,

437
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:37,080
 it is not me-centered, it is other-centered.

438
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:42,080
 Christ, first and foremost, I submit myself to him.

439
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,360
 And Paul said, that's how we flourish.

440
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,720
 That's our inheritance in the kingdom of Christ.

441
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,320
 And as your pastor here,

442
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,080
 I wanna pick up a little bit of Paul's pastoral heart

443
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,560
 for his community in Ephesus.

444
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,920
 And I wanna say over you,

445
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,600
 I do not want you to lose the inheritance

446
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,600
 that you have in Christ.

447
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,560
 And so here's what I implore of you.

448
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:10,120
 Enjoy the role of repentance.

449
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,800
 When we think about repentance in the church,

450
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,400
 so often we make it such a heavy topic.

451
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,120
 We make it such a weighty thing.

452
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,680
 We make it such a like, oh my gosh,

453
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,120
 I've gotta confess and repent.

454
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,680
 And Paul's saying, you should find joy,

455
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,400
 joy in coming before Christ and offering your life

456
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,520
 and saying there's some things inside of me

457
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,560
 that I'm not proud of, and I repent, I confess.

458
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,880
 I ask for your forgiveness,

459
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,480
 because I'm tired of trying to be like you.

460
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,240
 I don't wanna disqualify myself

461
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,280
 from the inheritance that comes in Christ.

462
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,200
 My repentance is my ticket to my inheritance.

463
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,680
 And as I repent and confess and bring it to you,

464
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,520
 I don't do so in a heaviness, I do so in a soberness.

465
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,280
 There's a sober reality to the brokenness in me.

466
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,920
 I bring that to you, but I do in the joy

467
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,240
 of knowing that you've already forgiven me on the cross

468
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,040
 and the joy to know that you're now gonna fill me afresh

469
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,360
 with your spirit and your love,

470
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,200
 and that I'm gonna become your child again,

471
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,440
 and the inheritance of your goodness is mine.

472
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,400
 So I wanna encourage you.

473
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,480
 This message speaks to you at all today

474
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,400
 about some of the stuff that's involved in you.

475
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:22,400
 May I invite you to the joy of repentance

476
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:28,800
 that brings you back into right relationship with him.

477
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,320
 It is this movement of repentance

478
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,640
 and the shift of our identities

479
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,120
 that brings Paul to the part where he starts to talk

480
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,680
 about the metaphor of darkness and light.

481
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,160
 Paul's of course not the first person

482
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,160
 to speak about this metaphor.

483
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,000
 In fact, it's a biblical metaphor

484
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,840
 throughout the whole of redemptive history.

485
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,360
 The Bible in fact starts Genesis 1, verses 1 and 2

486
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,280
 in a perspective of darkness and light.

487
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,160
 But we learn there that God created the world,

488
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,000
 the heavens and the earth,

489
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,120
 and it says that the world was formless and void

490
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,960
 and darkness covered its depths.

491
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,880
 So there is the starting point of darkness in scripture.

492
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,760
 And then in verse 3, we have the first moment

493
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,600
 where God speaks.

494
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,320
 And the very first word God says is,

495
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,160
 "Let there be light."

496
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:16,120
 Four words, one command, and everything changes.

497
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,920
 And so in the first three verses of the Bible,

498
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,720
 you get the gospel.

499
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,400
 You get a world that is dark, separated, formless and void,

500
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,080
 and you got a God who decides to make a difference in it.

501
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,080
 A God who says, "I don't want you to remain in darkness.

502
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,000
 "I don't want what I've created to be in darkness."

503
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,480
 And he says, "Let there be light."

504
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,240
 And then in the light of that creative moment,

505
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,560
 the rest of creation happens,

506
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,360
 all the way up to the culmination of us as human beings,

507
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,880
 created in his image,

508
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,720
 made in the light of Christ and God himself.

509
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,080
 Which is really interesting because then in Genesis 3,

510
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,880
 Adam and Eve decide to go back into darkness.

511
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,240
 Note that, we decided to go back into darkness.

512
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,200
 In taking of that fruit that we've just been talking about,

513
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,760
 in becoming a peer with God,

514
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,000
 or thinking that they can become a peer with God,

515
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,400
 shame comes on them.

516
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,160
 And what does darkness do?

517
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,680
 Sorry, what does sin do?

518
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,040
 Sin drives Adam and Eve back into darkness.

519
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,760
 They cover themselves.

520
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,200
 They retreat from the presence of God,

521
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,360
 the light of God's presence,

522
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,720
 as God walks in the corners of the evening in the garden.

523
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,160
 They're so afraid of the light of his presence now,

524
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,200
 that they now retreat,

525
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,880
 and they go back into a place of darkness,

526
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,840
 covering their shame.

527
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,160
 And for the rest of the biblical narrative,

528
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,920
 the story is basically this,

529
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,360
 can humanity ever know what it is

530
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,920
 to be in the presence of light again?

531
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,840
 Can we ever know what the light of God is for us?

532
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,280
 Can we ever have that relationship like Adam and Eve had

533
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,240
 before they fell in chapter three?

534
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,160
 Can we know what Genesis 1 and 2?

535
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,360
 Can we find that place of Shalom,

536
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,440
 the beautiful Jewish concept,

537
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,400
 of what it is to know that everything is right

538
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,600
 as it should be, completeness, wholeness, perfection?

539
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,680
 Our soul writes before God again.

540
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:03,840
 Towards the end of the Old Testament narrative,

541
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,680
 the prophets begin to speak,

542
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:09,040
 and to use this metaphor of darkness and light,

543
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,880
 to basically begin to speak into Israel,

544
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,840
 and say a time is coming in the future,

545
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,080
 where God will step in,

546
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,720
 and this messianic hope begins to build

547
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,720
 towards the end of the Old Testament.

548
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,000
 The prophets begin to speak into this metaphor,

549
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,960
 perhaps most famously, Isaiah,

550
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,480
 and I want you to have a look at some of the passages here

551
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,920
 that Isaiah begins to speak.

552
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,840
 The people walking in darkness have seen a great light.

553
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,520
 The Lord will turn the darkness into light before his people.

554
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,560
 In the future, the Lord will be your everlasting light,

555
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,360
 and your days of sorrow will end,

556
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,360
 and Isaiah starts to point forward

557
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,880
 to this messianic hope that one would step in,

558
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,960
 one of God, not of us,

559
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,480
 one who would step in into the fullness of that,

560
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,360
 and take what is dark right now,

561
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,120
 like in Genesis verses one and two,

562
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,680
 take that darkness and say, let there be light.

563
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,600
 And of course, for us Christians,

564
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,040
 as we consider who Christ is in the light of this,

565
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,960
 we understand Christ as the messianic fulfillment

566
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,360
 of that moment,

567
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,640
 and indeed, the whole of the New Testament

568
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,760
 picks up that idea,

569
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,400
 and actually drives the metaphor forward even more.

570
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,920
 So the gospel writers speak of it.

571
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,200
 Look at how John speaks about it here.

572
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,760
 He shines in the darkness,

573
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,600
 and the darkness has not overcome it.

574
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,480
 He is the true light that gives light to everyone.

575
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,480
 And then Jesus himself takes on this metaphor from Isaiah.

576
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,880
 Have a look at John 8, 12.

577
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,920
 I am the light of the world,

578
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,400
 and whoever follows me will never walk in darkness,

579
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,840
 but will have the light of life.

580
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,360
 I love this one over here from later on in John.

581
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,680
 You are going to have the light.

582
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,760
 This is Jesus speaking.

583
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,800
 You're going to have the light just a little while longer

584
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,720
 while you have the light.

585
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,160
 Walk while you have the light

586
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,960
 before darkness overtakes you.

587
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,960
 Believe in the light

588
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,160
 so that you may become children of light.

589
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,200
 Jesus has taught this to his disciples.

590
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,160
 Paul picks up on this idea of being children of light,

591
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,480
 and he brings it into his church as well.

592
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,560
 And so all of this redemptive history

593
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,120
 of biblical understanding of darkness and light

594
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,760
 comes to its fulfillment in Christ,

595
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,200
 and then Paul takes that,

596
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,000
 and he brings it into the very lives of his people.

597
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,520
 Notice how he does this in verse eight.

598
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,360
 I love this.

599
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,240
 He says, "For you were once darkness,

600
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,560
 "but now you are light in the Lord."

601
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,720
 I want you to see something really important in this verse.

602
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,760
 Paul does not say, "For you were once in darkness,

603
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,840
 "and you are now in the light of the Lord,"

604
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,360
 which I think is so often how we think of it

605
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,000
 when we hear this passage,

606
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,040
 and I think how we think about our Christian faith,

607
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:39,120
 as in like, I'm just sort of like neutral,

608
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,000
 and sometimes I find myself in darkness,

609
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,280
 and sometimes I find myself in light.

610
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,480
 As Christians, we think we're neutral,

611
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,600
 but if life happens, or if I drink a little bit too much,

612
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,600
 or if I stumble onto that website,

613
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,040
 I'm in darkness for a while.

614
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,760
 But if I have a good week, and I pray well,

615
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,800
 and I try hard, and I come to church regularly,

616
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,800
 I find myself in the light.

617
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,120
 And we think that we are neutral,

618
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,840
 and it's just about the place that we're in

619
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,800
 in terms of our faith.

620
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,920
 Paul looks at that thinking,

621
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,840
 and he says, "That's faulty thinking."

622
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,960
 "You're not neutral," he's saying.

623
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,880
 And it's not about the place you're in.

624
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,080
 You need to understand you were darkness.

625
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,360
 The totality of darkness was who you were.

626
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,680
 It wasn't like you were neutral,

627
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,800
 and you just happened to be surrounded by darkness.

628
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,520
 "You were darkness itself," he says.

629
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,360
 Strong words.

630
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,640
 Because he's wanting you to understand what sin does.

631
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,520
 The wages of sin is what?

632
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,760
 Death.

633
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,640
 And he's spoken to his church, hasn't he,

634
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,240
 already in chapter two, and he says,

635
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,840
 "When you were in your sins, you were what?

636
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,680
 "Asleep?"

637
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,240
 No, he didn't say that.

638
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,320
 He said, "When you were in your sins, you were dead."

639
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,400
 Like, literally dead.

640
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,280
 So he sees sin in that way.

641
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:01,280
 So you are not in sin, you were sin, he's saying.

642
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,200
 You were not in darkness, you were darkness.

643
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,720
 You were the separation, you were the death.

644
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,400
 And that's a sobering thing for him to teach his church.

645
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,680
 It's a hard thing for us to think

646
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,080
 because we like to remain neutral.

647
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,720
 We like to think that we're neutral people,

648
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,680
 and it's just whether we're in one thing or in the other.

649
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,600
 And Paul says, "No, no, no.

650
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,720
 "If you think sin is that way,

651
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,520
 "you will never have a sober understanding

652
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,640
 "of the power of sin."

653
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,760
 Come on, church.

654
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,920
 If you think that way, you will always think,

655
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,800
 "Well, if I just try a little bit harder,

656
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,360
 "or if I get a little bit more faithful,

657
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,880
 "or read a little bit more of my Bible,

658
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,920
 "I'm gonna be okay."

659
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,360
 And Paul's like, "Sin is death.

660
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,400
 "Sin is darkness.

661
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,040
 "And when we're in sin, we are actually darkness."

662
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,360
 We're not in it, we are the darkness.

663
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,280
 Now, as sobering as that is, he then says,

664
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,760
 "But guess what?

665
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,040
 "Now that you're in Christ, you are the light."

666
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,400
 In other words, it's not a temporary location for you,

667
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,880
 and you're moving in and out.

668
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,520
 He's saying, "Now you are light.

669
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,080
 "You are the light of the world."

670
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,720
 It's funny 'cause Jesus calls himself the light of the world,

671
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,440
 but then later on, he says to the disciples,

672
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,560
 "You're the light of the world."

673
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,000
 And this is what Paul's picking up on here.

674
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,120
 He's saying, "You were darkness, now you are light,"

675
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,480
 which is why he says this.

676
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,160
 He says, "Live as children of light."

677
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,520
 He says, "Live a life like this.

678
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,320
 "Live with boldness and courage.

679
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,840
 "Live with hope and faith.

680
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,680
 "Live as if the light really is in you,

681
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,480
 "that you are this light in the world."

682
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,920
 He's like, "I want you to live like that."

683
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:34,000
 And the question that the church in Ephesus

684
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,680
 should have asked, and I think we need to ask, is this.

685
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,080
 How do I live as children of light

686
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,720
 in a world that continues to be so filled with darkness?

687
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:48,960
 That's an important question for us at the Vine.

688
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,880
 How do we want to, how are we able to live

689
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,880
 as children of light in a world

690
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,240
 that is still so filled with darkness?

691
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,640
 Paul offers two answers to that question.

692
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,920
 It's found in verses 13 and 14.

693
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,040
 Let me read these verses.

694
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,600
 These are beautiful to me.

695
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,480
 He says this, "But everything exposed

696
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,800
 "by the light becomes visible,

697
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,000
 "and everything illuminated becomes a light."

698
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,960
 I'm gonna read that again.

699
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,720
 "But everything exposed by the light becomes visible,

700
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,920
 "and everything illuminated becomes a light."

701
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,840
 He's like, "Do you want to know how it is

702
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,320
 "that you're able to walk as a child of light?

703
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,600
 "First of all, you have to understand

704
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,080
 "that you could not do anything because you were darkness.

705
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,680
 "God had to step in and do it, first of all, for you.

706
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:42,360
 "Everything that is exposed by the light becomes visible."

707
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,440
 Light's this fascinating thing.

708
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,760
 If you look at it scientifically,

709
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,960
 essentially a definition of what light is

710
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,800
 is it's electromagnetic radiation of a wavelength

711
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,480
 that is visible to the human eye.

712
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,560
 Write that down in your notes.

713
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,560
 That's very important.

714
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,560
 (audience laughing)

715
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,080
 And here's the crazy thing.

716
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:01,240
 It is about 400 to 700 nanometers in size.

717
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,880
 Very, very, very, very small.

718
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,840
 And it travels at one of the fastest things it can travel.

719
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:10,840
 It travels at 182, 868 miles per second.

720
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,640
 Not miles per hour, miles per second.

721
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,200
 So what light does is it goes out

722
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,800
 and it bounces off of the surface of the thing.

723
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,160
 Look around you right now.

724
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,120
 Okay, you can see the people in this room

725
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,760
 because there is some light in this room,

726
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,280
 and that electromagnetic radiation is bouncing

727
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,240
 off of the people around you, enabling you to see them.

728
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,520
 But here's the reality.

729
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,360
 We're blind or we're in darkness

730
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,040
 when actually that electromagnetic radiation

731
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,600
 of a wavelength is removed.

732
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,640
 When light is removed, we have no ability

733
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,560
 to bounce off of one another

734
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,400
 to actually look at each other and see.

735
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,600
 So Paul, when he's talking about those sins

736
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,560
 of sexual morality and greed and brokenness,

737
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,640
 what he's basically saying is you've got all this stuff

738
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,920
 that's at work in you, and what that's causing you to do

739
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,080
 is become blind to one another.

740
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,320
 You can't see each other, nor can you see God

741
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,720
 because you're now in an environment

742
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,920
 where you are completely in the dark, he's saying,

743
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,200
 because it has cut out all of the light,

744
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,600
 and you cannot see anymore.

745
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,520
 And this is a sobering thing.

746
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,960
 I want you to feel this.

747
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,080
 I know that there's still a little bit

748
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:16,920
 of ambient light in here.

749
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,520
 We can't make this place completely dark

750
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:23,240
 because of the exit signs and a whole bunch of other things,

751
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,440
 but I want you to kind of look around as well.

752
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,640
 We can't see each other as clearly anymore.

753
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,080
 And basically what Paul's teaching is,

754
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,360
 this is what sin does.

755
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,600
 It causes you to become blind.

756
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,200
 It's like you can't see your hand in front of your face,

757
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,200
 and there's nothing you can do to change that.

758
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:42,600
 But then, because God so loved the world,

759
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,120
 here's what he does.

760
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,240
 In Christ, he basically says this,

761
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,880
 "Let there be light, and there was light."

762
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:55,040
 So the light, yeah.

763
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,520
 (congregation applauding)

764
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,560
 I love this.

765
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,400
 I love this.

766
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,480
 Half of you were sitting there

767
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,440
 throughout the whole service going,

768
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,160
 "Why have they not fixed that horrible thing

769
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,920
 that's hanging in the middle of the room?"

770
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,560
 That's Jesus right there.

771
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:13,120
 But the light comes.

772
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,320
 God brings this light.

773
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,720
 Now, I want you to notice the room again.

774
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,360
 Like, we can begin to see each other again.

775
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,120
 Not only that, but we can begin to see ourselves.

776
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:26,920
 See, Paul says everything is exposed by the light

777
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,000
 that makes everything visible.

778
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,880
 So Jesus makes everything visible.

779
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,200
 Everything inside of me that is broken and dark,

780
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,520
 the darkness, my darkness, the fact that I am darkness,

781
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:41,560
 I can only tell that when the light shines.

782
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,000
 Otherwise, I'm ignorant.

783
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,920
 Otherwise, I'm blind to it.

784
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,400
 I've got the hand in front of my face, and I can't see it.

785
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,040
 But Christ, as he comes with the light,

786
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,760
 it changes everything within me,

787
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,400
 and I can begin to go, "Hang on a sec.

788
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,520
 There is the brokenness.

789
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,640
 There is the darkness.

790
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,000
 There is the sin, and I need to somehow deal with that."

791
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,320
 The light, Paul says, makes everything visible.

792
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,880
 It exposes it, he says.

793
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:07,960
 But then he says something that is really key.

794
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:12,320
 He then says, "Not only does the light of Christ

795
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,680
 enable you to begin to see yourself

796
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,360
 as you should see yourself,

797
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:20,120
 and see one another as we should see one another,"

798
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,680
 he then says, and this is really important,

799
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:26,760
 "Everything that is illuminated becomes a light."

800
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,120
 He uses this wonderful word,

801
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,280
 this idea of something being illuminated.

802
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,960
 It's a beautiful phrase for salvation.

803
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,400
 It's one of the only times Paul uses it

804
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,440
 to speak of our salvation.

805
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,000
 He says, "Everything that becomes illuminated,"

806
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 in other words, everything that becomes illuminated

807
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,720
 by the light, he says, "It's not just," note this,

808
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,720
 "It's not just so that you can see the darkness, finally,

809
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,080
 and do something about it.

810
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,320
 It's not just so that you can kind of connect

811
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,320
 with one another."

812
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,320
 What he's also saying is, you've got to understand

813
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,440
 that there's something else also at play here, right?

814
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,360
 And what else is at play is that every one of us

815
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,680
 has the potential to become this kind of light

816
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,240
 that Christ has, and that light that Christ wants to give us.

817
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,600
 We have this potential sitting within us.

818
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,920
 But when we're in darkness, when we are the darkness,

819
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,480
 that potential is not there at all.

820
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,160
 And we're walking around like this, are you with me?

821
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,040
 But Paul says, first of all, Jesus' light illuminates

822
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,360
 everything for us so that we can realize

823
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,000
 that there's nothing going on here.

824
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,040
 But then he says, "Everything, though, that is illuminated

825
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,640
 becomes a light."

826
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,880
 In other words, in our relationship with Christ,

827
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,200
 we then become the light.

828
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,480
 It's like Paul is saying, you've got to understand

829
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,920
 that Christ illuminates everything,

830
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:47,040
 but everything that becomes illuminated becomes a light.

831
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,840
 (congregation exclaims)

832
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,680
 Right?

833
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,360
 (congregation applauds)

834
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:58,360
 And because it's a light, it's not our light, remember?

835
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,480
 Our light, it would be like this, right?

836
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,640
 Our light, we have no light, but when we come

837
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,120
 into relationship with the light, we bring his light now.

838
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:11,560
 And Paul says, "You were once darkness, now you're light."

839
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:15,240
 So then he says, "Live as children of light."

840
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,160
 Like take the light into the darker places around you

841
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,360
 and begin to shine that light so that the darkness

842
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:24,280
 in people and the darkness around can be seen,

843
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,440
 not in a way of judging them.

844
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,520
 He uses this word exposed.

845
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,600
 I love this word exposed.

846
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,080
 It literally means to prove with evidence.

847
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:37,080
 Paul's saying, "Your job is not to go to the dark places."

848
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:40,160
 I'm gonna go to the really dark places out here somewhere.

849
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,960
 This is real, these guys are very, I'm coming here.

850
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,160
 "Your job is not to go to the really dark places

851
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,960
 and start bashing people with the light."

852
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,960
 You know, start like kind of slandering them

853
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,600
 and, "Oh, you guys are terrible.

854
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,760
 Can't you see how you're living your life?

855
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,760
 Oh, you guys suck."

856
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,040
 (groans)

857
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:01,800
 He's saying, "Prove with evidence that your light shines."

858
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,120
 What does that mean?

859
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,240
 Well, he actually defines it.

860
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,520
 He says, "For the fruit of those who are light

861
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,280
 is goodness, justice, and truth."

862
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:15,080
 The things that we do and the ways that we live

863
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,520
 reflects the light of Christ that is within us.

864
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,440
 We don't have to go wagging our fingers.

865
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,400
 We just go, "Check this out.

866
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,000
 Like, wouldn't you wanna be a part of this?

867
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,360
 Wouldn't you want that dead thing

868
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,600
 that's in you to be alive again?

869
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,760
 Like, if it got dead, wouldn't you wanna make it?"

870
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,600
 Oh, darn it.

871
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,680
 (congregation laughing)

872
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,680
 Okay, okay.

873
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,560
 So, but wouldn't you wanna make it alive again, right?

874
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,240
 And he's like, "That's the invitation in this passage."

875
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,000
 Paul is not saying, "Hey, wag your finger in judgment."

876
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,640
 He's saying, "Invite people to redemption.

877
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,840
 Live your light like that."

878
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,560
 I love this.

879
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,480
 Jesus says it this way in Matthew.

880
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,760
 I love this passage from Christ.

881
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,600
 He says it this way.

882
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,760
 He says, "Let your light shine before all people

883
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,840
 that they may see your good deeds

884
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,360
 and praise your Father in heaven."

885
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,360
 Not praise you.

886
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,320
 Praise your Father in heaven.

887
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,880
 They will see your good deeds.

888
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,480
 I think church history has shown us this beautifully.

889
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,480
 I think of people like John and Charles Wesley

890
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,440
 who took the light of Christ that was within them

891
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,680
 to the darkness of London in the mid 1700s

892
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,400
 and brought revival to that land.

893
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,040
 I think of William Wilberforce and the Clapham sect

894
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,920
 in the late 1700s,

895
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,120
 who took the light of Christ that was within them

896
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,000
 and brought it to the darkness of slavery

897
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,080
 and over a 25 year long journey and battle

898
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:39,200
 was able to see that abolished in the British empire.

899
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,040
 I think of Amy Carmichael,

900
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,880
 who took the light that God had given her

901
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,040
 in the early 1900s and traveled to India,

902
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,440
 to the North of India

903
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,360
 and actually stood against the darkness

904
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,360
 of child exploitation and child abuse

905
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,240
 in the Hindu temples of that time.

906
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,360
 I think of Martin Luther King Jr. in the 60s,

907
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,640
 more closer perhaps to us,

908
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,800
 who saw the darkness of injustice and decided,

909
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,760
 and racism and decided to make a difference about it

910
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,160
 and brought the light that was in him

911
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,920
 to bear on a whole nation.

912
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,720
 And Paul is writing this and he's saying,

913
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,560
 "I want you to live as children of light

914
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,800
 because you're not darkness, you are light,

915
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,160
 but there is still darkness.

916
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,840
 And I want you to go in the goodness

917
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,520
 and in that justice and in that truth

918
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,560
 that is placed inside of you because of the light

919
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,720
 and shine that light brightly."

920
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,800
 This is why he says this beautiful thing right here.

921
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,320
 He says this beautiful thing here.

922
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,920
 He says, this is why it says,

923
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,360
 "Wake up, O sleeper, rise from the dead

924
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,720
 and Christ will shine on you."

925
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,680
 This is like Paul, by the way,

926
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,480
 this is not a quote from scripture.

927
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,800
 This is not Paul kind of basically saying something like,

928
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,480
 oh, by the way, it says in Jeremiah this.

929
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,960
 Actually, scholars think what he's doing here

930
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,640
 is quoting from an early Christian hymn

931
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,360
 that was active in the church at the time.

932
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,880
 So this is like him quoting a worship song.

933
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,000
 And he stands before the church and goes,

934
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,280
 "Don't you know that we sing this?

935
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,680
 Don't you know that we say this to each other?

936
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,760
 Wake up, O sleeper."

937
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,840
 That's exactly what he's saying.

938
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,200
 He's saying, "You've got the light of Christ in you.

939
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,000
 Live as a child of the light.

940
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,160
 Wake up."

941
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,160
 He's saying, "Wake up, church.

942
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,280
 How can you live like you are living right now

943
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,520
 in all that brokenness that dims your light

944
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,960
 and causes separation?

945
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,960
 No, deal with your sin, come into repentance,

946
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,360
 receive the light that you truly are in Him,

947
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,400
 and then live in that light."

948
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,160
 It's like Paul is kind of saying,

949
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,560
 "Where are those who are willing to stand up

950
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,520
 for goodness, justice, and truth?

951
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,480
 May your good deed shine before all people

952
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,360
 and may they come to know Him."

953
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,680
 And I stand before us today.

954
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,640
 And I think about this so often.

955
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,720
 I'm like, "Where are the Amy Carmichael's of our time?

956
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,680
 Where's the Martin Luther King Jr.?

957
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,560
 Where's the John and Charles Wesley?"

958
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,880
 Like, where is it within the church in Hong Kong?

959
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,600
 Where is it within us?

960
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,960
 Well, in our little bit,

961
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,600
 maybe we're not gonna change the world or change society,

962
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,800
 but maybe there's a relationship

963
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,280
 that's broken in our workplace.

964
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,600
 Maybe there's someone that we know who needs forgiveness.

965
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,360
 Maybe there's someone who's desperately lonely

966
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,200
 and we could befriend them.

967
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,760
 I don't know how it might look for you,

968
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,840
 but you've got the light.

969
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,680
 So live as a child of light.

970
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,840
 Wake up.

971
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:18,520
 Take a hold of what it is that Christ has placed

972
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,280
 inside of you, goodness and justice and truth,

973
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:26,280
 and be that in whatever darkness He has placed you in.

974
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,040
 And when we do this,

975
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,400
 we come to see light like we've never seen it before.

976
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,480
 May you let your light shine.

977
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,920
 May you do it proudly with courage and boldness.

978
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,320
 And may we see the darkness around us become light.

979
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,160
 Amen.

980
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,580
 (congregation applauding)

981
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:57,560
 I wonder if you could stand with me

982
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,200
 and I would love to pray for you.

983
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:08,560
 And I wonder whether you just,

984
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,040
 as you quieten your eyes,

985
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,160
 quieten your eyes, that's a bit weird.

986
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,960
 As you close your eyes, quieten your heart.

987
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,360
 I know we're running a bit long, but I just wanna,

988
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:24,400
 there's so many of us who have been called

989
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,400
 to shine our light and it's not always an easy thing to do.

990
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:33,880
 I wanna just invite you just to quieten your heart now.

991
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,460
 (gentle music)

992
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:40,360
 For some of you in this room,

993
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:44,080
 what is really important for you today is repentance.

994
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,320
 And like I've said in the message,

995
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,440
 this is not something you have to fear.

996
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,840
 It doesn't have to be heavy.

997
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:55,840
 But that recognition, I'm trying to become a peer of yours,

998
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,480
 even though maybe I've never said it that way,

999
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,740
 but I'm actually really self-centered.

1000
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:03,520
 Actually, everything is kind of about me.

1001
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:07,320
 And I think the Lord wants to break self-centeredness

1002
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,880
 out of us as a community.

1003
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,320
 And that will require repentance.

1004
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,400
 But it's the joy of that,

1005
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,880
 knowing that our relationship has been shifted

1006
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,280
 from that peer of God to a child of God again.

1007
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,760
 And I think for some of you here,

1008
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,880
 that's a really important response for you.

1009
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,280
 To respond in that openness

1010
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,680
 of what it is to bring your confession

1011
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,840
 and repentance to Him.

1012
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,160
 Some of you just need to say,

1013
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,480
 "I don't wanna be your peer.

1014
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,520
 "I don't want the universe to revolve around me.

1015
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,520
 "I don't want my self-centeredness

1016
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,360
 "to be the main thing in my life.

1017
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,160
 "I want you to be the main thing in my life.

1018
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,200
 "I need to repent."

1019
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,120
 And I can see that that's manifesting

1020
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:56,240
 in the way I treat others.

1021
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,600
 It's manifesting in my sexual immorality.

1022
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,880
 It's manifesting in my greed.

1023
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,280
 It's manifesting in my coarse language and my jokes.

1024
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,320
 It's manifesting in my joking and my gossiping

1025
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,720
 and slandering or whatever it is.

1026
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,320
 But Lord, I recognize it's manifesting itself

1027
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,880
 in these ways that are actually bringing division

1028
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,800
 and not unity.

1029
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,240
 Lord, that's not what I want.

1030
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,320
 I'm a child of light.

1031
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:19,440
 So I wanna just encourage some of you now.

1032
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,600
 That's the work Christ is inviting you into.

1033
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,120
 But for maybe many of us,

1034
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:27,160
 it's this work of recognizing that our light

1035
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,680
 has been hidden for a while.

1036
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,200
 Turn your light before all people

1037
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,160
 so that they would see your good deeds.

1038
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:38,080
 Not see how cool you are,

1039
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:41,880
 not see how gifted or talented you are.

1040
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,480
 They would see your heart,

1041
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,240
 the goodness and the justice and the truth

1042
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,800
 that sits within you, the fruits of light.

1043
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,680
 They would see those things and they would change

1044
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:51,680
 because they would see.

1045
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,560
 Remember, everything that is light exposes

1046
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,320
 and makes things visible.

1047
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,960
 And so I wanna just pray an anointing over you here

1048
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:03,800
 this morning

1049
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:07,360
 to be able to shine the light of Jesus

1050
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,920
 without any sense of doubt,

1051
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,200
 without any sense of apology,

1052
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,640
 without any sense of being ashamed.

1053
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,080
 For Paul says, "I am unashamed of the gospel,

1054
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:22,400
 "but to do so in love, to do so in grace,

1055
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,440
 "to do so seeking the good of others,

1056
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,080
 "to do so by laying your life down

1057
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,400
 "and picking up your cross,

1058
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,600
 "doing so by putting others before yourself,

1059
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,800
 "doing so by revealing goodness and justice and truth."

1060
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:38,720
 And so Lord, I pray you would release your people in this.

1061
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:42,920
 And Father, we thank you so much for this.

1062
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:46,080
 We're gonna just take a moment to respond in worship

1063
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,000
 'cause I think it's really important

1064
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
 that you take this time.

1065
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,240
 If you need to repent, you take the time to repent.

1066
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,040
 If you need to ask God to strengthen your hands

1067
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,880
 like we talked about earlier, pray that.

1068
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,400
 If you want your light to shine more,

1069
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,880
 ask him to show you how you can do that

1070
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:00,960
 in your sphere of influence.

1071
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,560
 But every single part of it,

1072
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,760
 let's bring it to him now in worship.

1073
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,360
 (gentle music)

1074
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,940
 (gentle music)
