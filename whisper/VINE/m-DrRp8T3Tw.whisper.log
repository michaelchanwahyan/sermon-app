[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   What a joy it is to sing together of the reality of Christ's presence on earth.
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.040]   We're going to move into a time now of listening, of thanksgiving for Christ's birth.
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.840]   May God our Father, who sent Jesus to be the light of the world,
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:23.800]   make us shine with His love so that we are quick to serve, help, comfort anyone in need,
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.080]   and ready to follow wherever Jesus leads.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.400]   In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:40.200]   And the Word was God, for in Him was life, and the life was the light of all people.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.600]   The true light, which gives light to everyone, came into the world.
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.400]   Glory to the newborn King!
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:56.000]   God is light. In Him there is no darkness at all.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.200]   Although darkness covered the earth and the people lived in thick darkness,
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.200]   God's glory appeared to us.
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.800]   The Lord is our everlasting light, so glory to the newborn King!
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:15.400]   Jesus came to the people who walked in darkness.
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.400]   He is the light of the world.
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.800]   He came to His own home, and the people did not accept Him.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.000]   But to all who receive Him, He gives power to become the children of God.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Glory to the newborn King!
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:38.800]   The Word became flesh and lived amongst us, and we have seen His glory.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.200]   The glory as of a Father's only Son, full of grace and truth.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.600]   To Jesus, light of the world.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.600]   To God, the Creator, who said, "Let there be light."
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.400]   To the Holy Spirit, bringing light to our lives, be praise and glory now and forever.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.400]   And glory to the newborn King!
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:09.600]   We're now going to hear the Christmas story in a number of sections.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.600]   Let's open the ears of our hearts to Scripture together.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:28.600]   [Silence]
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.600]   Once, many, many years ago, in the country of Israel, far across the sea,
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.600]   on the other side of the world from us, a very special event took place.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.600]   It happened when the Emperor, Caesar Augustus, ordered that a census, a count of all people,
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.600]   should be taken throughout the whole world.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.600]   Everyone had to register, all the members of their family,
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.600]   and they had to do this by going to the town where their great-great-great-great-great,
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.600]   ever so many great-grandfather lived.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.600]   There was a couple named Mary and Joseph, who lived in the village of Nazareth.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.600]   They had to go down south to the town of Bethlehem, where King David once had lived,
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.600]   because he was their great-great-great-great-great, ever so many great-grandfather.
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.600]   It probably took Mary and Joseph three or four days to travel to Bethlehem.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.600]   They took their donkey, which Mary rode with Joseph, alongside.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.600]   Mary was pregnant with their baby, and their baby was almost due.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.600]   Joseph was sorry that Mary had to go on this long journey at this time of her pregnancy,
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.600]   but he couldn't leave her behind.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.600]   And besides, Mary wanted Joseph to be there whenever the baby was to be born.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.600]   When they got to Bethlehem, the town was absolutely bustling with all the visitors.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.600]   There were people everywhere and activities going all over the place
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.600]   because everyone had to come for the census.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:01.600]   Joseph tried to find somewhere for them to stay, but every hotel and inn in the town was full.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:08.600]   Finally, they found one whose kind owner, although he didn't have room for them inside the inn,
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.600]   made a place for them in the stables.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.600]   There, they had a shelter for them for the night from the cold weather.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.600]   And after the long days of the journey, the time came for Mary to have the baby.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.600]   There in the stable with the animals in the stalls, her first son was born.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.600]   She wrapped him in a blanket and laid him in the manger.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:37.600]   Mary and Joseph named him Jesus, as an angel had told them to do.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.600]   Church, as we sing this next song, we give you a space to reflect on the elements
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.600]   and on what it might have been on that first Christmas.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:53.600]   So as this song plays, you can sing with us, but stay seated and just reflect and think through that.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.600]   The Announcement to the Shepherds
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:04.600]   On the hills just outside of Bethlehem, there were some shepherds spending the night with their flocks of sheep.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.600]   It was dark and quiet on the hillside.
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:13.600]   Suddenly, there was a great light glistening in the sky, and they saw an angel.
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.600]   The glory of the Lord shone on them.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.600]   They were so amazed that they were very frightened.
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.600]   Nothing like this had ever happened to them before.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:31.600]   But the angel said to them, "Don't be afraid. I bring you good news which will be a great joy to all people."
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:39.600]   Today in the town of Bethlehem, a Savior has been born, Christ the Lord.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.600]   This will be the sign for you.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.600]   You will find the baby wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.600]   And suddenly, there is a huge crowd of heaven's angels with the first angel,
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:06:00.600]   and they fill the whole sky with their song, "Glory to God in the highest and peace to his people on earth."
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.600]   The Visit of the Shepherds
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.600]   When the angels had left and gone back to the heavens, the shepherds said to each other,
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.600]   "Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that the angels have told us about."
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.600]   So they left their sheep on the hillside and hurried off to Bethlehem.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.600]   When they got there, they looked around until they found Mary and Joseph in the stable,
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.600]   with baby Jesus lying in the manger.
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:32.600]   When they saw them, they told Mary and Joseph all the things that the angels had said about the child.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:38.600]   Then the shepherds returned to their flocks, singing and praising God all the way back.
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.600]   It had been just as the angels said it would be.
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.600]   The Visit of the Wise Men
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.600]   When Jesus was born in Bethlehem, Herod was king of Israel.
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.600]   He lived in a palace in Jerusalem.
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:07:01.600]   Soon after Jesus' birth, some men who studied the stars came from the east to Jerusalem.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:10.600]   They had seen a new and special star in the sky, which showed them that the king had been born.
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.600]   They had travelled a long way to find the new king.
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:20.600]   They asked people in Jerusalem, "Where is the baby who is born to be king of the Jews?"
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.600]   King Herod heard about this.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:31.600]   It made him very upset because he was the king of Israel, and he didn't know anything about the baby,
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:36.600]   any baby who is going to grow up and be king instead of him.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:41.600]   So he called the Jewish chief priests and teachers of the law to the palace,
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.600]   and he asked them where the Messiah was to be born.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:53.600]   They said, "In Bethlehem," because that's where the prophet Micah said many years ago.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:59.600]   So Herod called the wise men who had come from the east to a secret meeting.
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:04.600]   He asked them exactly what time the star had appeared.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.600]   They told him.
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:13.600]   Then he sent them on to Bethlehem, and he said, "When you get there, search and find the child.
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:20.600]   Then come and tell me so I can go to Bethlehem and worship him too."
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.600]   Away they went to Bethlehem.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.600]   The star led them all the way.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:29.600]   Eventually, it stopped just over the place where Jesus was staying.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.600]   The wise men were very happy about that.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:37.600]   They went inside the house and saw the baby with his mother, Mary.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.600]   They knelt down, and they worshipped him.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:48.600]   Then they opened their bags and took out their gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:59.600]   It's wonderful that we get to celebrate with gifts at Christmastime as we give one another gifts,
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:07.600]   as we celebrate our friends and our family, as we gather together in whatever ways that you will do so this evening and tomorrow.
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:12.600]   As you do gather, as you reflect on some of the things that we've been sharing tonight,
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:17.600]   as you think about what Christ's light means to you,
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:24.600]   our prayer as a church for you is that you would know comfort, you would know hope,
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:28.600]   and you would know that no matter what might take place in your life,
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:32.600]   and everybody has good times and challenging times,
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:37.600]   that whatever might happen for you, you would know that you're never alone.
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:45.600]   The great joy of Christmas for us is that we have a Savior who is willing to be stepped into our darkness.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.600]   Emmanuel, as Scripture calls Him, God with us,
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:54.600]   so that no matter what might take place, we are literally never alone.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.600]   Our prayer for you as a church is that you would know the power of the Spirit of God,
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:06.600]   that Spirit that sits with us and makes us know that we are forgiven, renewed, and redeemed in Him,
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:13.600]   and a Spirit that guides us far better than that star guided those wise men.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:23.600]   A Spirit alive in each one of us so that we might know God's heart, His word, His encouragement, His comfort,
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:29.600]   and His power so that we can live as a light in the world around us.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:35.600]   So as you go tonight, you will take your candle and you will light it at some point,
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:45.600]   and as you do so, you remind yourself of the fire that burns inside of you through the empowerment of God's Spirit.
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:50.600]   And for the lucky few amongst us, because we only have about 40 bottles left,
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.600]   we have some mulled wine available.
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.600]   It's not for free, you have to purchase it.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.600]   You're also not allowed to drink it on our premises, but it is wine.
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.600]   It has alcohol in it.
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:08.600]   You can find joy by joining together with your family with wine.
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:12.600]   And we have some of these bottles available, and we want to encourage you, if you would like to,
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.600]   you can purchase some of those.
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:18.600]   We sold these about three weeks ago. Don't worry, this is a fresh batch.
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.600]   It's only three weeks old.
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:25.600]   But there are some of those available for you tonight if you would like to purchase one on the way out.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:34.600]   But as we close, may we do so with a few more lines of liturgy as I pray and you respond.
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:40.600]   God, our Father, you give light to this world so that it shines with your glory.
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:47.600]   Lead us to see the beauty of your heavenly glory through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:56.600]   Lord Jesus Christ, light of the world, make our lives pure so that we may shine with your light in this world for you.
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:02.600]   Holy Spirit, moving across the face of the earth, breathing new life and shedding new light,
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:08.600]   renew us as we shine with the light of Christ in the world.
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:15.600]   As you go tonight, you go in one of the main themes that Christmas is all about, the theme of joy.
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:21.600]   And what better way for us to finish our time together than singing that well-known carol, Joy to the World.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:27.600]   Would you stand with me and may we join in praise together as a congregation.
