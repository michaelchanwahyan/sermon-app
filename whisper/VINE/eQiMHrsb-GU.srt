1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 I will share more about how I grew in Christ first.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,900
 Well, firstly, I learned in my community.

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,960
 My fellowship started to disciple me.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,200
 We had Bible study every week to make our life rooted in God's Word.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:22,440
 We learned how to love each other in fellowship, and we also reached out to others.

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,200
 And also, I got my calling after a short-term mission trip.

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:34,160
 God spoke to me from Luke chapter 4, verse 18 to 19.

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:41,480
 The Spirit of the Lord is on me because He has anointed me to proclaim good news to the

9
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,720
 poor.

10
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:50,600
 He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and the recovery of sight for the

11
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:58,320
 blind, to set the oppressed free, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor.

12
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:05,160
 Then I made a bold decision to submit the rest of my life to serve God.

13
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,200
 You know what?

14
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:14,560
 My name, Song Song, in pinyin is S-O-N-G, just like "song" in English.

15
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:21,040
 Ever since I was young, I loved music, but I had never pursued my dream.

16
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,920
 Rather, I followed people's expectation to study a more promising subject.

17
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:36,080
 God called me back to His original plan, exactly like the GPS system guiding us.

18
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:42,760
 After my decision to follow Jesus Christ, I learned piano, drums, and even I began to

19
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,160
 write songs.

20
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,360
 I want to use songs to worship God in my whole life.

21
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:56,120
 Before I came to know the Lord, I wanted to be seen as a model of success in the eyes

22
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,880
 of others.

23
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:04,760
 Now I only want to be the treasured Song Song in the eyes of the Lord.

24
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,240
 In this, there's a very beautiful name, Song Song.

25
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,800
 So now I cannot wait to hear your dreams now.

26
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,040
 I can share my dreams to you.

27
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:21,160
 My dream is to be used by God and share more beautiful songs of the Lord.

28
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:29,120
 My dream in this new year is to use worship to draw more and more people near to God.

29
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,240
 God called me to proclaim the freedom for the prisoners and set the oppressed free.

30
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,000
 We are all learners on the way.

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,040
 To be honest, I'm still in the way of releasing myself.

32
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:51,160
 I need to release from the needs of people's approval and the success so that I have the

33
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,600
 same passion to the people in the one.

34
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:01,400
 I want the people in the one to experience the release from our burdens and find our

35
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,640
 own freedom in Jesus Christ.

36
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,520
 So you are really discipled and equipped well so that you can be ready to disciple others

37
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,520
 and make disciples.

38
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,880
 Wow, Ivan, thank you for listening to my story.

39
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,000
 Now I would like to hear your story as well.

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Sure.

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,640
 Let me share a little bit of my own story to be discipled.

42
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,200
 It is even in a secular sense.

43
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,160
 I used to be in discipline force, which is fire service department.

44
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,880
 That is in 2005, I started my training.

45
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:47,040
 In the training, we are trained with the essential basic foundation about the fire service training.

46
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:53,960
 Which is we train them with using the breathing apparatus, the searching, high search and

47
00:03:53,960 --> 00:04:00,800
 high res search and rescue, and also firefighting strategy and so on.

48
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,640
 After that, some of us may feel that, wow, we are so cool.

49
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,600
 We are finally a fireman to save the world, something like that.

50
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,440
 Very well equipped.

51
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,560
 But of course, that's far from true.

52
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,600
 We are not entirely ready.

53
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,560
 What we went through were very basic, laying the very foundation.

54
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:27,680
 There is so much more that we have to learn to build up our comprehensive skill set in

55
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,200
 the real life, rather than just in the training.

56
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:39,080
 Actually, how we really learned to be really well equipped as a fireman is in the midst

57
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,880
 of real fire and sin.

58
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:49,000
 We need to accumulate our own experience by observing, practicing how our seniors led

59
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,800
 and guide us.

60
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,080
 But interestingly enough, after a period of time, we suddenly realized that, wow, we are

61
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:06,240
 leading and guiding others who are new, passionate, first joined the fire service, but they have

62
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:13,560
 the same desire, the burning heart to save others from the fire.

63
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:19,040
 I first joined the Vine community 10 years ago.

64
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:25,840
 Being a part of this community of disciples allowed me to grow quite similar to competing

65
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,200
 the essential of fire service training.

66
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:39,000
 But then we, not just me, but we, the whole community, must go into the field, not from

67
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,760
 the fire zone, not to the fire zone, but the field of harvest, yes, likewise, save lives

68
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,680
 and souls.

69
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:55,200
 We have learned a lot and heard a lot in church about the teaching, but now we are turning

70
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,320
 them into lively teaching.

71
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:05,320
 That is, we are challenged to live it out by faith in every situation in our lives.

72
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:13,620
 What I've learned from my other so-called senior disciples in church is when I saw how

73
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:19,960
 they really turned their hopeless situation to really live in their life by faith.

74
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:28,480
 They can be sick, poor in material wealth, brokenness in motion, grieving from losing

75
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,680
 their beloved one, etc.

76
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,440
 Through this, I can see that, wow, how they really live their life through their faith

77
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:42,280
 and then put their difficult situation in the living life.

78
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:49,720
 Then when I face my own challenges, their testimony, their life example become my encouragement.

79
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,960
 Wow, what a wonderful story.

80
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,000
 Ivan, I can hear your heart of making disciples.

81
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 Actually, I have a heart to reach out to the Mandarin speakers in Hong Kong as well.

82
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,400
 Wow, wonderful.

83
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,200
 You must share more with us.

84
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,200
 Sure.

85
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:15,520
 There are many, many new mainland immigrants studying, working, and living in Hong Kong.

86
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,400
 And it is also because of this, many people get to know Jesus.

87
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,040
 I am one of them.

88
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:29,120
 Some churches have started their Mandarin ministry while the one has his unicune vision

89
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,860
 to reach out.

90
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:37,600
 As a young congregation, we are mingled English and Chinese speakers and an all-embracing

91
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:43,080
 culture all loving Hong Kong, we have much to offer.

92
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:48,200
 Best of all, we do have this mandate to make disciples.

93
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:54,400
 I just want to be part of God's plan for the many fellow Chinese.

94
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:02,800
 [speaking in Mandarin]

95
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,480
 Thank you very much for sharing with us, Songsong.

96
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,880
 Now Vivian and I will share more about discipleship.

97
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,840
 Hey, Vivian.

98
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,840
 Hi, Ivan.

99
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:20,240
 The Great Commission, as described in Matthew 28, 18-20, carries four or where the Greek

100
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,680
 word "past" was used.

101
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:31,120
 All authority, all nations, or all people, all my commandments with you always, all days.

102
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,000
 But the only word is "disciple."

103
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,920
 It is in imperative tense that is indeed "command."

104
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:47,300
 We are all familiar with the Great Commission, and we hope that this is not a great omission.

105
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:53,840
 The Great Commission in Matthew 28, 19, "Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations."

106
00:08:53,840 --> 00:09:02,160
 God has entrusted us the message and the authority to bring goodness, peace, and joy to nations.

107
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:10,000
 We are to live it out with the very life that Jesus has modeled for his disciples in his

108
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,500
 early life, even before his death and resurrection, and likewise to make disciples.

109
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:25,140
 The commission is expressed not so much in terms of the means to proclaim the good news,

110
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:29,080
 but in the end to make disciples.

111
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:33,200
 There are a few aspects to understanding making disciples.

112
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:43,640
 First, to disciple a person to Christ is to bring him into relation of student to teacher.

113
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:50,480
 Taking his yoke of authoritative instruction, we are to accept what he says as true because

114
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:57,720
 he said it, and submit his requirements as right because he makes them.

115
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:04,840
 Second, disciples are those who hear, understand, and obey Jesus' teaching.

116
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:12,240
 To disciples command a kind of evangelism that does not stop after someone makes a profession

117
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,720
 of faith.

118
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:22,520
 Third, that is biding on Jesus, all Jesus' disciples, to make others what they themselves

119
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,480
 are, disciples of Jesus Christ.

120
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:33,360
 To make disciples of all nations does require many people to leave their homelands, but

121
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,400
 Jesus' main focus remains on the task of all believers to duplicate themselves wherever

122
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,400
 they may be.

123
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:47,480
 I echo what you and Song Song just shared earlier on.

124
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:53,800
 Years back, when my family moved to live in Singapore, I was hoping to live in a foreign

125
00:10:53,800 --> 00:11:00,880
 land, yet someone reached out to me, shared the shalom and fellowship with me over meals.

126
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,920
 She also met our needs of needing support, love, and acceptance.

127
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,160
 And when the opportune time came, she shared the gospel with me and family.

128
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:17,960
 Interestingly, since then, I was nurtured by yet another foreigner, a young lady all

129
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:23,800
 the way from Colombia, who brought me through a basic understanding of Christian faith,

130
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:29,240
 taught me how to read the Bible, praying by praying together, and we were connected to

131
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,480
 family cell groups.

132
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:38,440
 In fact, we began to host a home group, but were tremendously blessed by a young, energetic

133
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,920
 Singapore leader.

134
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:46,360
 Her name was Sunshine, and I love her, as she was indeed sunshine for my family.

135
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:51,280
 All these amazing people embraced us while we lived in a foreign land.

136
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:55,680
 That embrace had made a huge impact on my family.

137
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:02,680
 And I dare to say, we learned to be a blessing for others while we reside as foreigners.

138
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:09,800
 More significantly, the church adopted India as a nation that we wanted to disciple, and

139
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:15,920
 various members went on mission trips one after another to various parts of the country

140
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:21,960
 to partner with local churches to evangelize, to encourage, and to disciple disciples.

141
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:29,960
 Therefore, I challenge all of us here, whatever we are from, now that we are in this land,

142
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:37,320
 we can be a blessing for others, regardless of our and their ethnic origin.

143
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:43,280
 Then, my husband Sidney and I felt called to serve back here in Hong Kong some 14 years

144
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,000
 ago.

145
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:52,320
 Here at Indovine, Ivan and I were amazed to witness the birth of a new ministry, outreaching

146
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:58,440
 to local Cantonese and subsequently Mandarin speakers.

147
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:07,080
 I record a God's given vision in late 2014, where I saw Chinese faces all over Hong Kong

148
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:13,160
 and sensed their pain and desperation and tears.

149
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:19,240
 The vision ended with the word "satellites," as well as seeing sparks throughout Hong Kong

150
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,560
 and China.

151
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:30,320
 I wept upon seeing this vision, and the Lord began to break my heart for both Cantonese

152
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,600
 and Mandarin speakers.

153
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:38,440
 Could it be that God is calling Indovine to think more seriously about reaching out with

154
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,760
 the gospel to Chinese in our city?

155
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:47,000
 This may mean running Cantonese and Mandarin Alpha courses on a regular basis.

156
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,360
 It may mean launching a Cantonese and Mandarin Vine service.

157
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,520
 It may mean planting satellites in Hong Kong and in China.

158
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:02,680
 I trembled to communicate to Andrew and church leaders a sense of God's new vision to us

159
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,000
 as a church.

160
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:12,880
 In 2015, we took a step of faith to establish the Vine Chinese community to intentionally

161
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:18,200
 connect and disciple the Cantonese and Mandarin speaking congregations at the Vine.

162
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:25,360
 And it's unquestionably a step in the right direction for reaching out to Chinese believers

163
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,960
 in the city.

164
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:33,440
 Now you may ask, how we shall reach out or evangelize?

165
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:39,560
 Let's turn to Luke 10, where Jesus taught his disciples about the valuable evangelistic

166
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,560
 process.

167
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,880
 Luke 10, verse 5 to 9.

168
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,160
 When you enter a house, first say, "Peace to this house."

169
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:54,080
 If someone who promotes peace is there, your peace will rest on them.

170
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,880
 If not, it will return to you.

171
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:03,760
 Stay there, eating and drinking whatever they give you, for the worker deserves his wages.

172
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,660
 Do not move around from house to house.

173
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:12,840
 When you enter a town and are welcomed, eat what is offered to you.

174
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:19,200
 Heal the sick who are there and tell them the kingdom of God has come near to you.

175
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:26,440
 I love this passage in which I find four fruitful steps in this evangelistic process that build

176
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:31,840
 very much in line with the Chinese New Year celebration setting.

177
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,480
 Step one, bless.

178
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,440
 Speak peace to them in verse 5.

179
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,000
 Step two, fellowship.

180
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,920
 Eat with them in verse 7.

181
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,520
 Step three, minister.

182
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,300
 Take care of their needs in verse 9.

183
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,440
 Step four, proclaim.

184
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,520
 The kingdom of God has come in verse 9.

185
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:59,640
 Whenever we do a Chinese New Year visit, we desire to bless one another.

186
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,480
 So step one, bless.

187
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:10,540
 Whatever house you enter, first say, "Peace be to this house."

188
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:16,320
 The speaking peace involves not just words, but an intentional impartation.

189
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,000
 The words that we speak should impact spirit and life.

190
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,400
 They cannot be casual or flippant.

191
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,760
 We are intended to touch the recipient.

192
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:33,920
 When we bless the people in our circle of influence, sooner or later, those who used

193
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:40,800
 to keep away from us will begin to look for us, opening the door to fellowship.

194
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:46,240
 They will make it because they will feel the blessings we are speaking over them.

195
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:52,960
 They may put it like this, "When I see you walking by, I get a positive vibration."

196
00:16:52,960 --> 00:17:00,200
 What they mean is that in our presence, they feel a tangible peace.

197
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,820
 Step two, engage in two-way fellowship.

198
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:10,280
 Stay in that house, eating and drinking what they give you.

199
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:16,120
 Fellowship provides an opportunity to show unconditional acceptance by welcoming people

200
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:20,480
 the way they are instead of the way we want them to be.

201
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:26,120
 In fact, Jesus' instruction here is that we let the others bless us.

202
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,240
 Why?

203
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:34,720
 In Jesus' day, the custom was to offer food and lodging to visitors, even to strangers.

204
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:42,400
 Today, when we allow others to do something for us, we affirm that value and dignity as

205
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,360
 God's creation.

206
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,760
 We should appreciate the fellowship.

207
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,560
 We may then speak blessings in return.

208
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:55,880
 Of course, we need to be sensitive as much as creative in the COVID season and the space

209
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,600
 limitations of Hong Kong.

210
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,320
 Many of my sisters became master chefs.

211
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:08,240
 We bake all kinds of goodies to bless others, and we gladly embrace the love and food.

212
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:14,240
 Whenever the COVID situation permits, we host very small-scale gatherings with loved ones

213
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:22,000
 or friends in quiet restaurants or homes just to celebrate togetherness, or else we just

214
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,920
 bless each other over Zoom.

215
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:33,800
 Step three, minister to the families, heal those in it who are sick.

216
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:38,620
 Fellowship eventually leads to opportunities to meet people's families.

217
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:43,720
 This will only happen after they trust us enough to disclose them.

218
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:49,000
 Once we build such trust, they may share their fear and concerns of being troubled by the

219
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,520
 COVID.

220
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:55,920
 They may even tell us about the fear of losing their job, their struggles and frustration

221
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:01,560
 in relationships with family members, friends, or colleagues.

222
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:08,420
 They will begin to share heart to heart because they sense our genuine care for them.

223
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:15,200
 It is at this precise moment when we can say to them, "I have been praying for you, and

224
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,480
 I would be glad to pray about this concern too."

225
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,960
 Amazingly, most people will say, "Yes."

226
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:30,760
 When we start praying for them, soon we will be praying with them.

227
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:36,720
 Praying is the most tangible trace of eternity in the human heart.

228
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,480
 Even atheists have prayed in moments of desperation.

229
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:47,480
 When we let the others know that we are praying prayers of faith for their feltonies, we touch

230
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,520
 them at the heart level.

231
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:59,640
 Many years back, when my family gathered for a reunion dinner, prior to my father going

232
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:06,160
 for a cardiac operation, he radicaled me and Sidney in front of the entire household when

233
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,240
 we told him that we were praying for him.

234
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:14,640
 Anyway, we did not give up praying for him passionately.

235
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:21,200
 The day that he went for surgery, he was pushed out from the operating theater much earlier

236
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,200
 than expected.

237
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:29,720
 But he was smiling like a child as he was told by the doctors that suspected abnormality

238
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,000
 was no longer there.

239
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,560
 Praise the Lord!

240
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:39,920
 He realized Jesus answered prayer, and God indeed healed him.

241
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:47,520
 Since then, he is much more open to our praying with him, and he will say, "Amen."

242
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:53,640
 Step four, let the pre-believers know that the kingdom has come near them and invite

243
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,840
 them to come into it.

244
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:01,280
 Say to them, "The kingdom of God has come near to you."

245
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,880
 Once we have taken steps to blessing the others, fellowship with them, and take care of the

246
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,320
 fellow needs, something is bound to happen.

247
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:16,600
 We have imparted to them peace that upstream to God, which is what pre-believers may not

248
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,800
 experience the most.

249
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:26,080
 We have provided them with the most caring and healthy fellowship they have ever enjoyed.

250
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:32,360
 And we have offered prayer for needs that they have not been able to meet on their need.

251
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,360
 So don't be surprised if they say something like, "I feel like I'm going to die."

252
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,200
 "I feel something.

253
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,960
 I don't know what's happening to me right now."

254
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:47,400
 Or, "Tell me, who is this God who loves me even though I don't know him?"

255
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,680
 At that point, we can share the gospel with them.

256
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:56,680
 It is the kingdom of God that has just come near to you.

257
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:00,120
 Would you like to come into it?

258
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:04,520
 Then we may gently lead them to Christ.

259
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:11,280
 Some years back, someone close to me began to hear strange voices in the household and

260
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,880
 manifestations of insomnia.

261
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:19,280
 This dark mood followed, leading to uncontrollable outbursts.

262
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,200
 We were approached to visit the house.

263
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:29,240
 We went to bless, to fellowship, and to pray for much-needed peace in the household.

264
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,600
 And we led the family to Christ.

265
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,360
 What an amazing testimony, Vivian.

266
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:43,760
 Regardless of the tremendous COVID infection and related social distancing measures, yet

267
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:51,680
 the Bible also reminds us to Matthew 6, verse 33, in the message version, "Stiff your life

268
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:56,480
 in God's reliance, God's initiative, God's provisions.

269
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,800
 Don't worry about missing out.

270
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:03,000
 You will find all your everyday human concern will be met."

271
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,760
 In the NIV version, "Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things

272
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,520
 will be given to you as well."

273
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:19,920
 The fall of Satan in Luke 10 was precipitated by Jesus standing to 70 to every city and

274
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:24,360
 place where he himself was going to come.

275
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:31,440
 Now Jesus is coming, but he is sending us ahead to every household, to bless, to fellowship,

276
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,960
 to minister to people in need, and to invite others into God's kingdom.

277
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,320
 Vivian, would you say you have new vision or new dreams for the new year?

278
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,960
 What I do know is this.

279
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:50,560
 If it is a word, a vision, a dream from God, then God keeps watching to see that His Word

280
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,960
 is fulfilled.

281
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:58,680
 I believe we were, are, and will be witnessing the move of God on us about His call to invite

282
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:03,720
 us to reach out to the local Cantonese and Mandarin speakers in this city.

283
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:09,520
 God is going to bring restoration and hope to the brokenhearted in the political situations

284
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,940
 and in the COVID challenges.

285
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:19,800
 Some of us here may feel called to step up and embrace God's vision for bearing spiritual

286
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:26,880
 sons and daughters through evangelism and growing in Christ through discipleship.

287
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:35,400
 Therefore, firstly, I invite you to get connected and discipled in one of the Vine communities

288
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:42,480
 like the Energetic Youth Community Fight, the Vibrant Young Adults Community 180, the

289
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:48,040
 Authentic Cantonese and Mandarin Community, the amazing community groups.

290
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:54,080
 Come join the Vine various discipleship courses, including the Alpha Preparatory course, Tree

291
00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:00,880
 of Life courses, and others to get equipped to evangelize to our loved ones and friends.

292
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,800
 Talk to one of the Vine staff about the best ways to use your influence at home or workplace

293
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:11,240
 as a witness of Jesus to your family and colleagues.

294
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:17,840
 Secondly, I encourage you to invite your loved ones and friends to join the churchwide Alpha

295
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,040
 Preparatory in April and October this year.

296
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:29,240
 Thirdly, I invite anyone here who might already have a heart for China or Mandarin speakers

297
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,920
 in the city.

298
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:37,320
 Come and join us in praying and discerning together as a church to bi-weekly Mandarin

299
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:42,400
 worship and prayer gatherings starting April.

300
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:48,920
 Lastly, God the Father loves you very, very much.

301
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:57,920
 天父上帝愛你,祂的愛比天高比海深。

302
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:17,920
 祂的愛比天高比海深。

303
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:30,920
 當祂祈禱的時候,祂感覺到一對很溫暖的手,捉緊祂的心。

304
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:37,920
 我相信今日上帝都係好想去捉摸你的心。

305
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:42,920
 God the Father loves you very much, just like what Songsong has shared earlier on.

306
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:50,320
 Even though she has not come to know Jesus, as she prayed, she felt the strong sense of

307
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,920
 God's love coming to her.

308
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:58,920
 She sensed her heart was carried by the Lord's hand.

309
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:05,920
 主啊,我多謝祢,因為是祢去捉摸我們的心。

310
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:12,920
 我們知道在我們的城市當中裏面,我們有很多人都覺得很疲乏,

311
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:19,920
 很無奈,很無助。

312
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:27,920
 我們很多的夢想好像破碎了,我們不知道在哪裏可以

313
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,920
 重拾我們的夢想。

314
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:38,920
 但我們知道主祢的愛,祢的平安,祢的祝福,是與我們同在的時候。

315
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:44,920
 祢好想扶我們一把,祢好想讓祢的愛去捉摸我們。

316
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:52,920
 所以主啊,今日奉主耶穌的名去祝福今日,聽到我們今日的講道,

317
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:59,920
 或者主祢這份的愛,求祢親自去祝福,去捉摸每個人的心。

318
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,920
 Father, we thank you for today.

319
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:08,920
 We understand that we are living in an era of chaos, many challenges, many concerns,

320
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,920
 in the midst of the COVID, in the midst of the political situations.

321
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:18,920
 But God the Father, your peace, your blessing, your love, be with us.

322
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:24,920
 Today you hear the gospel that the kingdom of God has come near to you.

323
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,920
 Would you like to come into it?

324
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:35,920
 If you haven't yet received Jesus into your life, or you would want to rededicate your life to Jesus,

325
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:40,920
 you can do so by praying with me the following.

326
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:51,920
 Dear Jesus, I want the gifts of blessing, hope, love, and internal life you offer.

327
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:58,920
 I open my life and heart to you now, and accept you as my savior.

328
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,920
 Forgive me for all the wrongs I have done.

329
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:07,920
 I believe you died for my sins, and rose from the dead.

330
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:12,920
 Give me a fresh start, and help me get to know you.

331
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,920
 In your love, I am your beloved child.

332
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,920
 In Jesus' name, amen.

333
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,500
 (gentle music)

334
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,080
 (gentle music)
