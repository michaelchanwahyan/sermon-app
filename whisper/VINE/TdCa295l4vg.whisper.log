[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   >> Yeah, thank you Justin.
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.740]   And good morning, if you're joining online,
[00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.440]   good morning to you too.
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.940]   Honored as always to be here.
[00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:07.780]   And like Justin said,
[00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.940]   we are wrapping up our Ephesians series today.
[00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.720]   It's been a great journey through this book
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.720]   and I'm glad to be finishing off today.
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.560]   So, something, I mean my colleagues at the Vine here
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.400]   know this very well.
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.120]   People who know me know this quite well.
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.520]   In general, I'm not a very serious person, okay?
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.480]   I mean like I'm serious about God's word,
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.660]   but my general demeanor is,
[00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.500]   why are you brief a lot?
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.800]   It's like, Justin, you're not surprised, okay?
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.960]   Like I like to play jokes, I like to play pranks.
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.640]   Around the office, there's a little bit of a reputation
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.240]   about the guy who like plays the practical jokes
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.800]   on people and all that kind of stuff.
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.960]   The most often victim of these sort of sneak attacks
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.400]   or these practical jokes are of course my wife, okay?
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.800]   So, sometimes these jokes work well,
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.800]   sometimes not so well, okay?
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.840]   This was one that works well.
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.720]   Okay, take notes, okay?
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.740]   So, you turn on the shower, okay?
[00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.940]   You draw the curtain and so, you know,
[00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.860]   she thinks I'm in the shower, okay?
[00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.760]   The shower's going shh and then I call out,
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.420]   but actually I'm not in the shower,
[00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.640]   I'm hiding under the sink, okay?
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.680]   So, hey honey, could you pass me my toothbrush?
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.160]   Okay, so she goes into the shower, you know,
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.460]   she says, hey, okay, here's your toothbrush,
[00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.860]   here you go, here you go, but no one's responding
[00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.060]   'cause there's no one behind there, right?
[00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.780]   So, she opens the curtain, no one's there,
[00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.940]   it's like, what's happening?
[00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.940]   And then right at that moment, under the sink,
[00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.180]   I grab her by the ankle, ah, okay,
[00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.060]   and she screams, okay, that's a good one, okay?
[00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.780]   Often it works, okay.
[00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.540]   Sometimes, however, these jokes don't work so well.
[00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.240]   Okay, Akin was taking notes, okay.
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.620]   One time I saw my wife, we were out separately
[00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.060]   and we just happened, my wife and I,
[00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.620]   Brittany and I, were coming home at the same time
[00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.420]   and so I thought, okay, perfect opportunity,
[00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.140]   I'm gonna play a prank on her.
[00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.020]   And so, you know, with stealth-like movements,
[00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.260]   I went ahead of her and I hid behind,
[00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.500]   you know, sometimes you get one of those electrical boxes
[00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.500]   that sit on the side of the street.
[00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.060]   So I hid behind one of those electrical boxes,
[00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.780]   hoping that when she would walk past,
[00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.140]   I would jump out and scare her
[00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.780]   and it'd be, you know, really funny, okay.
[00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.040]   Problem was, I was just focusing on like,
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.500]   watching where she was going
[00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.460]   and not anything else around me, right?
[00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.780]   What I didn't notice was, this light box
[00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.180]   was next to the bike path, okay.
[00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.160]   And so, I was hiding behind, she was walking past,
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.020]   but as she was walking past and I jumped out,
[00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.140]   like, boo, and tried to scare her,
[00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.700]   a biker on his bike was coming full speed down
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.020]   and he hit me, okay.
[00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.300]   And so I go flying back onto the path,
[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.020]   my shoes fly off, you know, everything's crazy.
[00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.780]   This guy is so, understandably, so angry at me.
[00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:39.780]   He's like, what are you doing?
[00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.220]   You know, starts asking about my mother,
[00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.820]   all this kind of stuff, okay.
[00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.280]   I'm just like, oh, sorry, I don't even know, okay.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.300]   Meanwhile, okay, Brittany is there,
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.740]   she's seen the whole thing, apparently.
[00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.300]   She saw me hide behind the light box, like,
[00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.020]   what's this person doing, okay?
[00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.620]   And then she saw me jump out, get scared, okay.
[00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.700]   In the end, I ended up with a fracture wrist
[00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.780]   and a trip to the ER, right, so, yeah.
[00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.440]   Moral of the story, right?
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.340]   Do better when you're trying to scare your wife,
[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.180]   all right, now.
[00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.620]   I know that this is just a silly story,
[00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:10.740]   but I wanna illustrate something.
[00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.380]   Maybe you can think about it this way.
[00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.820]   As you go about life, does it ever feel like
[00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.160]   you're under attack?
[00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.500]   As you go about life, does it ever feel like
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.260]   there's something or someone out there
[00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.480]   who's trying to get you?
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.040]   I mean, what if I told you right now,
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.980]   in this very moment, we're actually in the middle
[00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.460]   of a battle that's being fought, right?
[00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.380]   It's just that you can't see what's happening all the time.
[00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.340]   It's not something you can always see
[00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.300]   with your eyes or feel with your senses.
[00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.740]   Okay, I'm not talking about tinfoil,
[00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.780]   conspiracy theories, or anything like that, okay.
[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.180]   What we're talking about today is spiritual warfare.
[00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.220]   Let me lay a little bit of a definition
[00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.140]   before we go any further.
[00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.700]   Right, throughout the Bible and throughout history,
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.020]   right, there is this belief,
[00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.460]   and it's a biblical teaching as well,
[00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.120]   that there is a spiritual realm, right?
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.260]   Scholars sometimes call this an unseen realm, right?
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.580]   It exists side by side by this physical world,
[00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.980]   this realm that we're living in right now.
[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.260]   And so the Bible teaches us there are spiritual beings,
[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.160]   right, these beings were created by God
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.460]   just like human beings were.
[00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:24.740]   They've been there since the beginning of this world.
[00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.060]   And God created these spiritual beings
[00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.300]   in order to help him rule the world.
[00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.820]   It's a sort of an illustration of this,
[00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.820]   could be you can picture God as like a CEO,
[00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.280]   it's not the best example, but you know,
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.340]   he is a CEO, he's the big boss, okay,
[00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.420]   and he has his staff team, okay,
[00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.220]   the council of these divine beings
[00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.260]   that were created to help him in his rule of the world.
[00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.660]   However, just like human beings rebelled,
[00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.460]   his children wanted to be God instead of be God's children.
[00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.100]   In the same way, these spiritual beings
[00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.820]   also rebelled against God.
[00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.540]   Some of these beings also rebelled against God.
[00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.460]   And instead of them enticing and turning
[00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.140]   and encouraging people to worship God,
[00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.540]   they started to get people to worship them instead, right,
[00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.180]   and they crossed many boundaries.
[00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.140]   Genesis 6, two tells us that the sons of God,
[00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.740]   referring to these spiritual beings,
[00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.700]   saw that the daughters of humankind were beautiful.
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.660]   Thus, they took wise for themselves from any they chose.
[00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.700]   This is the Bible teaching us
[00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.180]   how rebellious these beings have become.
[00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.240]   They came down to earth and had relations with humans,
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.540]   all right, it's kind of weird,
[00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.980]   but it's in the Bible, it's there, right.
[00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.980]   Another example, in the book of Job.
[00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.300]   Job gives a really clear story, a really clear picture
[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.700]   about these rebellious spiritual beings
[00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.660]   having some sort of influence
[00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.500]   and power and authority on this earth, right.
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.820]   Now, the day came, Job 1, when the sons of God again,
[00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.380]   okay, came to present themselves before the Lord,
[00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.580]   and Satan also arrived among them.
[00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.380]   The Lord said to Satan, "Where have you come from?"
[00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.740]   And Satan answered the Lord,
[00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.180]   "From roving about on the earth
[00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.980]   "and walking back and forth across it."
[00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.580]   And as you know, in the book of Job, in the story of Job,
[00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.260]   there's a season in Job's life, right,
[00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.180]   chaos and ruin permitted by God,
[00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.020]   but all orchestrated by the enemy.
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.800]   We could talk about this stuff forever.
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.140]   If you wanna talk more, I love talking about this stuff,
[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.820]   okay, take me out for a coffee,
[00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.380]   and then we can talk more about it, okay.
[00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.980]   But the point I'm trying to make is this,
[00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.500]   is that yes, there really are dark and evil forces
[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.620]   in this world, and they are trying to do everything they can
[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.260]   to sabotage, to distract,
[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.460]   and to destroy your relationship with Jesus.
[00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.200]   The enemy out there is out there, and he is not a friend.
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.060]   And I think this is especially relevant
[00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.580]   for the people in the Ephesians, of course,
[00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.740]   but like the Ephesian city, Hong Kong, right,
[00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.540]   is a city full of opportunity
[00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:13.060]   to turn to other spiritual sources for guidance,
[00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.740]   right, from things like feng shui, to fortune tellers,
[00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.420]   to the da si yang, the hitting small people down the road,
[00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:22.100]   okay, visiting temples to spin the wheel,
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.940]   playing with Ouija boards.
[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.240]   All these are examples of how the enemy
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.620]   tries to capture our attention.
[00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.260]   And so as followers of Jesus in this culture,
[00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.460]   in this city, we have to be very, very careful,
[00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.660]   'cause when we see these things,
[00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.620]   it's not just a little bit of harmless fun.
[00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.380]   Like it's not harmless just to go to a fortune teller
[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.220]   and say, "Oh, I'm interested in my love life.
[00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.780]   "Can you tell me a little bit about that?"
[00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.500]   Okay, it's not okay.
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.700]   It's not okay just to invite a feng shui master
[00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.260]   to come to your office and give you some tips
[00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.580]   on where you should put the fish tank and the tank,
[00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:57.860]   and you should do this with the windows,
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.780]   all that kind of stuff, okay?
[00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:02.820]   It's not okay, because these practices
[00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:05.060]   are clearly not from God,
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.420]   which means that the source of power
[00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:11.280]   is from a dark and evil place.
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:17.560]   Therefore, as Christians, as followers of Jesus,
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.960]   we should have nothing to do with these practices.
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.320]   Because like I said just now, there's a fight happening
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.520]   between the forces of good and evil in these unseen realms,
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:31.080]   unseen to us, but definitely can have effect
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.840]   on our lives and even our souls.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.920]   And so this is why what we're talking about today
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.460]   is important.
[00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:40.320]   In fact, the whole letter of Ephesians,
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:44.160]   Paul has been preparing his readers for this moment.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:47.280]   Throughout the letter, Paul has called them,
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.640]   has encouraged them to challenge them
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:50.980]   in the way they live their lives, right?
[00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:54.020]   To be counter-cultural, to live in a way
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:57.800]   that reflects the fact that we are followers of Jesus.
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:01.320]   To live in a way that puts the power of God
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.200]   at work in display, right?
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.600]   A power so strong, Paul says, it's able to do
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.560]   more than we can ever ask or imagine, right?
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:13.680]   This is the power that we carry as followers of Jesus.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.560]   And as followers of Jesus, everybody is invited
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.400]   into this community.
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.780]   So another thing Paul reminds us of,
[00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.120]   we've been called to live in radical unity.
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.960]   Doesn't matter who you are, slave, free, Greek, Jew,
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.840]   doesn't matter, man, male, female,
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.880]   everyone has been called into this community
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.120]   to live in radical unity, serving each other,
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.340]   submitting to each other, working with each other
[00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:39.520]   for the glory of God.
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.360]   Paul also reminds us that we have been brought
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.060]   out of the darkness into the light.
[00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:49.080]   That we were once dead, but now we are alive
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.760]   in the love of Christ.
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.720]   And because of this, everything we do should be done
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.480]   in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:01.360]   And so what here is what Paul's saying.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.000]   Here's what scripture is saying.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.920]   If we're really gonna live like this,
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.680]   if we take these words seriously,
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.420]   if we're gonna take this series I've been walking through
[00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:12.920]   and apply it to our lives, then you best believe
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.320]   we're gonna expect some opposition from the enemy.
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.040]   Because the enemy will attack.
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.380]   And when he does, if we're not ready,
[00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:25.380]   if we're not equipped to take a stand
[00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:28.520]   and to fight back in some way, we'll be in trouble.
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.420]   But here's the other thing, and this is the encouraging part.
[00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:37.200]   We don't need to freak out and be super scared about this.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.700]   Because as we're about to find out,
[00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:42.400]   God has given us everything we need.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.460]   Not only to withstand against the enemy,
[00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.800]   but to fight back against his schemes.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.500]   Listen to these ending words of this letter.
[00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:56.000]   Ephesians 6.10, "Finally, be strong in the Lord
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.240]   "and in his mighty power.
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.140]   "Put on the full armor of God so that you can take
[00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:04.100]   "your stand against the devil's schemes.
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.780]   "For our struggle is not against flesh and blood,
[00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:09.000]   "but against the rulers, against the authorities,
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.120]   "against the powers of this dark world,
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.240]   "and against the spiritual forces of evil
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.220]   "in the heavenly realms.
[00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:18.100]   "Therefore, put on the full armor of God
[00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.100]   "so that when the day of evil comes,
[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:22.540]   "you may be able to stand your ground,
[00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:25.720]   "and after you have done everything, to stand.
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.760]   "Stand firm then with the belt of truth,
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.180]   "buckled around your waist,
[00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:32.500]   "with a breastplate of righteousness in place,
[00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.380]   "and with your feet fitted with the readiness
[00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.020]   "that comes from the gospel of peace.
[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:40.220]   "In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith
[00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:44.240]   "with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.900]   "of the evil one.
[00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.460]   "Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit,
[00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.540]   "which is the word of God.
[00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:53.120]   "And pray in the Spirit on all occasions,
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.260]   "with all kinds of prayers and requests.
[00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:59.040]   "With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.280]   "for all the Lord's people.
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.520]   "Pray also for me that whenever I speak,
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.400]   "words may be given to me so that I will fiercely,
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.880]   "fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel,
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.580]   "for which I am an ambassador in chains.
[00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:15.660]   "Pray that I might declare it fiercely as I should."
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.560]   It's a beautiful passage.
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.840]   It's well-known, it's descriptive,
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:23.580]   but it's also super practical.
[00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.120]   So we're gonna walk through this together,
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.760]   hand in hand, okay, and see how it equips us
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.620]   for this battle we have ahead.
[00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:33.600]   Well, Paul starts with this.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.100]   It starts with telling us to be strengthened.
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.720]   It starts with strength.
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:42.120]   Whatever battle you're fighting in,
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.940]   it's always gonna require strength.
[00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:49.260]   But notice here, the strength, the source of this strength.
[00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.600]   Where is this strength coming from?
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.160]   This is not a strength we must up in ourselves, right?
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.720]   Paul is calling us to be strong in the Lord
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.800]   and in his mighty power.
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:05.600]   Our own efforts will only ever get us so far in this battle.
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.640]   If we wanna prevail, if we wanna stand firm,
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.160]   we have to know what it means to be strong
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:15.020]   and live in his power, in God's power.
[00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:17.800]   The psalmist refers to this all the time
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.760]   as you read through the psalm time and time again, right?
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.540]   "My refuge is in the Lord.
[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:25.280]   "God is the strength of my heart."
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:28.280]   Jesus reminds his followers of this before he dies.
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:32.180]   He told his disciples, "Without me, you can do nothing."
[00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:36.280]   So church, let us ask ourselves this morning,
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:40.040]   what is the source of your strength?
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:44.240]   It's easy to rely on all sorts of other kind of things.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.120]   Right, some of us are pretty physically fit and strong.
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.800]   That's great.
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.680]   Right, some of us are super smart.
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.280]   We have the brains and that's really good.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.180]   Some of us have resources and money
[00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:56.000]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.760]   That's a source of strength.
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.720]   But all of these earthly sources
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.760]   will never be enough in this battle
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.560]   because as it says,
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:06.800]   our battle is not against flesh and blood.
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.480]   So the first step of today,
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.840]   the first thing we need to do is,
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.820]   as we fight this battle together,
[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:18.820]   is to find your strength in the Lord and his mighty power.
[00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:21.800]   And how do we do that?
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:25.600]   What does strength in the Lord look like?
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:29.000]   Well, actually, I think the answer is quite simple.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.960]   Strength in the Lord is total surrender to him.
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:39.800]   To do what he says, to be obedient to God.
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:43.080]   Strength in the Lord is what Paul reminds us of
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.640]   early in chapter three,
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:49.640]   to live as Christ is dwelling in our hearts through faith.
[00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:54.580]   Surrendering to the Lord, walking in obedience with him.
[00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:57.320]   That's where we find our strength.
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:01.020]   So after we've been strengthened,
[00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:03.460]   we are empowered by the Lord's strength.
[00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:08.060]   Then we're instructed to put on the full armor of God
[00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:09.500]   so that you can take your stand
[00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.240]   against the devil's evil schemes.
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.220]   For our struggle is not against flesh and blood,
[00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.080]   but against the rulers and authorities,
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.700]   the dark powers of this world
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.160]   and against the spiritual forces of evil
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.740]   in the heavenly realms.
[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:24.100]   Put on.
[00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:27.960]   So this is actually action we have to take now, to put on.
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.840]   It's not just a display piece in the museum
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.420]   for you to admire and to look at.
[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:33.220]   You actually have to put this on.
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.780]   Again, time and time throughout the book of Ephesians,
[00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:38.120]   Paul is encouraging us to put things on,
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.920]   to take off the old self, to put on the new self.
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:44.480]   Now we're being encouraged to put on the armor of God.
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:48.000]   And in a battle, you're gonna need armor.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.800]   But notice again, the source of this armor,
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.480]   it's the armor of God, not your own armor,
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:54.440]   not your own ideas.
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:57.640]   We put on these things because the source of them
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:59.480]   is from God.
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:03.560]   And we put it on so we can take a stand
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:06.180]   against the devil schemes.
[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:12.280]   Just as Jesus has good plans for your life,
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:15.040]   for you to have life and life in the full,
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.960]   to live a life free from the chains of sin,
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:21.480]   the enemy also has schemes for your life too.
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:24.720]   And when it comes to talking about the enemy schemes,
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.840]   I think it can go a few ways.
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:31.920]   Right, one idea, one perspective of this is that
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:35.480]   we refuse to believe that these things
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.160]   are actually happening.
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.160]   Right, we find it too weird.
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:39.600]   Maybe you're even sitting here right now
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.120]   and say, this is weird, Allison.
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.040]   I brought a friend today.
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.780]   You're talking about all this woo-woo stuff, okay,
[00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:46.200]   like focus on something else, okay?
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.600]   So we just ignore it.
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.960]   We don't wanna talk about it, it's weird, and we ignore it.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:55.840]   Sometimes, though, we might trivialize it.
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.400]   Right, this is sort of picturing the devil
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:01.360]   as a man in a red spandex suit with a dodgy mustache
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:02.320]   holding a pitchfork.
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.600]   You know, it's like, kinda looks kinda comical.
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:07.120]   Yeah, you know, the mentality is that,
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:09.640]   yeah, it might be some weird stuff like that out there,
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:12.160]   but you know, no one takes it that seriously.
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.480]   It's just a bit of fun, you know.
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.420]   In fact, you know, it might even be interesting
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:19.920]   to see what happens there sometimes, right?
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.320]   So there's that perspective.
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:25.780]   Maybe some of us, though, live in constant fear
[00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:28.020]   of the enemy's attack, right?
[00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:31.900]   And so everything we do, we interpret it through the lens
[00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.780]   of it's a spiritual attack on me.
[00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:35.900]   Everything that happens, anything bad that happens,
[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.180]   it's a spiritual attack on me.
[00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:39.920]   Like I said, we'll talk about this a bit more
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:41.540]   in a minute, right?
[00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:46.540]   And so, you know, we, it ends up being trapped in fear
[00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:47.820]   about the enemy's attack, right?
[00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:50.760]   Around every corner is a devil waiting to attack me.
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:53.540]   And then maybe there's some of us
[00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:55.240]   who have really crossed that line,
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:58.080]   who have shown too much of an interest
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.420]   and actually been drawn into the powers
[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:03.040]   of this dark and evil world.
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.860]   And we found ourselves in some really, really dark
[00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:07.780]   and scary and evil places.
[00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:12.060]   All these, though, have one thing in common.
[00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:15.340]   What the scheme of the enemy is trying to do
[00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:19.180]   is to keep your eyes off of Jesus,
[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:22.380]   to keep you in the dark, to feed you lies,
[00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.980]   to stir up your worry and your anxiety in your life.
[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:29.180]   And I think one of the most popular thing he does
[00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:34.760]   is that the enemy loves to make evil look attractive.
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:38.420]   The enemy loves to think that sin
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:40.500]   and living outside of God's will,
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.400]   disobedience is something that we can just control
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.300]   for ourselves, right?
[00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:46.020]   Sin is like this little pet,
[00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:47.700]   like a little thing we can play with.
[00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.620]   When we get bored of it, we can put it away.
[00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:50.780]   But you know, it's harmless.
[00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:51.940]   I'm just gonna, you know,
[00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:54.020]   hang out with this thing for a little bit.
[00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:58.020]   But this is always how it starts.
[00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:01.620]   And this quote I got in my research for this message,
[00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:03.260]   you know, illustrates it so well.
[00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:06.580]   It says this, "Evil rarely looks evil
[00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:08.740]   until it accomplishes its goal.
[00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:12.060]   It gains entrance by appearing attractive,
[00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:14.500]   desirable, and perfectly legitimate.
[00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:18.580]   But it is a baited and camouflaged trap."
[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:21.580]   Let's be wise, church.
[00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:23.220]   Let's not be fools.
[00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:26.100]   1 Peter 5:8 tells us, "The enemy, the devil,
[00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:29.100]   prowls around like a roaring lion
[00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:31.620]   looking for someone to devour."
[00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:35.740]   And sin and disobedience will absolutely destroy
[00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:39.540]   your lives now and even for all eternity.
[00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:43.500]   But this is why we call it a battle, right?
[00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:47.020]   Life as a Christian is a struggle.
[00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.100]   Because even though when we're aware of these things,
[00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:52.020]   that there's evil out there, there is a draw to it.
[00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:56.020]   Right, this is the word Paul uses for struggle here.
[00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:57.460]   It's actually the word, the same word
[00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:59.780]   for like a physical wrestling match, right?
[00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:01.620]   Wrestling was one of the popular sports
[00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:02.700]   in the back in the day, right?
[00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:04.900]   Like a jujitsu thing they're doing, you know.
[00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:06.260]   It feels like that sometimes, right?
[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:07.940]   When you're wrestling against sin,
[00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:09.540]   someone's trying to get your back,
[00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:12.020]   trying to twist your arm, trying to choke you out.
[00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:15.780]   Maybe it's a bit like this in more practical ways.
[00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:17.580]   When temptation comes up.
[00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:18.980]   Lots of different examples of this,
[00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:21.820]   but for example, one thing that I find myself
[00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:22.980]   wrestling sometimes, right?
[00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:25.740]   Late at night, you're tired, everyone's asleep,
[00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:28.460]   and it's finally time for yourself.
[00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:29.900]   You're trying to settle down.
[00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:34.220]   What are some things that pop up to mind in that moment?
[00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:38.220]   Oh, you feel tired, you know, you've had a long day.
[00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:40.220]   Turn to this.
[00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:42.780]   Go onto that website.
[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:45.860]   Have that extra drink that you don't need.
[00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:49.820]   Maybe it's drugs, maybe it's gambling,
[00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:52.540]   maybe it's an out of control shopping habit,
[00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:53.740]   something like that.
[00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:59.140]   And in those moments, if you do not have on the armor of God,
[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:01.940]   if you are not strong in the Lord,
[00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:04.740]   the enemy will get the better of you.
[00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:11.220]   Which is why Paul says, "And put on the full armor of God,
[00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:14.180]   "so that when that day of evil comes,
[00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:15.740]   "when those moments come,
[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:18.420]   "you may be able to stand your ground,
[00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:22.260]   "and after you've done everything, to stand."
[00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:26.020]   It's like me trying to play a prank on Brittany, right?
[00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:27.260]   Always trying to figure her out,
[00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:28.940]   always trying to trick her, scare her,
[00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:31.340]   in the same way the enemy is trying
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.460]   to do the same thing to us.
[00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:37.860]   Which is why we've been encouraged to stand our ground.
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:40.900]   Stand firm, wearing the full armor of God.
[00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:45.060]   This is how we fight back against the enemy and his schemes.
[00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:50.100]   The enemy is strong, he has influence, he has power,
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.220]   but it's limited.
[00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:54.780]   It's limited, and with this armor of God,
[00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:58.060]   we can stand firm against his schemes.
[00:21:58.980 --> 00:21:59.980]   So which is why again he says,
[00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:02.620]   "Stand firm, with a belt of truth
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:04.220]   "buckled around your waist.
[00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:06.660]   "The breastplate of righteousness is in place,
[00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:09.460]   "feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel,
[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:11.260]   "the shield of faith to extinguish
[00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:13.300]   "the flaming arrows of the evil one,
[00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:15.980]   "the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit,
[00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:18.820]   "which is the word of God."
[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:20.460]   So there's a number of components, right?
[00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:23.460]   It's different things that we have been called to put on
[00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:26.700]   that help us in this battle against the enemy.
[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:30.340]   So let's see how these parts fit together.
[00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:31.740]   First it says this,
[00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:35.820]   "The belt of truth buckled around your waist."
[00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:37.580]   Now as we're talking about this,
[00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:40.220]   imagine like a Roman soldier standing there.
[00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:42.180]   In the context of a soldier,
[00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:44.420]   the belt would have been the thing that keeps
[00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:46.860]   all the rest of the pieces together.
[00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:50.420]   Holds everything down so the soldier can be ready for action.
[00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:53.620]   The belt of truth around the waist.
[00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:55.940]   Now maybe some of us don't want us to see the truth
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:57.500]   around our waist, okay?
[00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:58.980]   Hips don't lie, you know what I mean?
[00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:03.260]   All right, but as believers of Jesus,
[00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:06.780]   as believers of Jesus, we know the truth.
[00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:09.180]   Now the enemy, his schemes, right?
[00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:10.540]   He hates the truth.
[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:13.860]   John 8, 44 tells us that the enemy
[00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:18.220]   is a liar and the father of lies.
[00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:20.300]   The enemy hates the truth.
[00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:23.580]   But this is why we have to say it even more clearly.
[00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:26.100]   So let me remind us, church, of the truth.
[00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:28.420]   The truth is that Jesus loves you
[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:30.740]   and he died for your sins.
[00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:34.580]   The truth is he is alive and resurrected.
[00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:36.580]   The truth that he has called you to live a life
[00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:41.300]   that reflects and shows his love to those around us.
[00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:43.500]   The truth is even though there are these other
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:46.620]   spiritual beings, there is only one true,
[00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:49.580]   all-powerful, almighty God.
[00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:54.500]   And the truth is the war has already been won.
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:57.940]   Jesus, over on this earth, is progressing
[00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:00.860]   and advancing against these unseen powers of darkness
[00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:03.700]   and the kingdom of God has a very clear goal
[00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:05.460]   and it will reach this goal.
[00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:08.180]   The reclamation of all peoples and all nations,
[00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:10.260]   the full restoration of God's creation
[00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:13.260]   to how he originally created it to be.
[00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:15.620]   This day is coming.
[00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:18.940]   That is the truth, church, and the truth doesn't change.
[00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:22.420]   So church, do you have this belt of truth
[00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:24.340]   buckled around you?
[00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:27.180]   Does the truth of who Jesus is and what he has done
[00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:31.660]   for you and all humanity hold your life together?
[00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:35.060]   Wrap this truth around yourself tightly.
[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:39.580]   Buckle up because without it, everything will fall apart.
[00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:45.540]   Then it talks about the breastplate of righteousness.
[00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:47.940]   Now the breastplate is the largest piece
[00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:52.820]   of the Roman soldier's armor, protects the vital organs,
[00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:55.100]   the heart, the lungs, all that kind of stuff.
[00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:57.020]   But because the breastplate is the biggest,
[00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:59.140]   it's the most obvious part.
[00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:01.140]   It's the part that everyone can see.
[00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:03.020]   It's the most prominent thing.
[00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:06.940]   And so in our context, in what we're talking about here,
[00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:11.660]   for us, this means God has called us to proudly display
[00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:15.700]   the fact that we are followers of Jesus,
[00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:19.020]   that we are children of the light,
[00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:22.420]   that we walk in righteousness.
[00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:25.460]   Now the opposite of righteousness is wickedness.
[00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:30.380]   And the enemy, that's what he delights in, in wickedness.
[00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:34.020]   Scripture tells us that the enemy is an oppressor.
[00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:37.700]   The enemy is the orchestrator of injustice.
[00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:41.340]   The enemy would like to see us do unrighteous things,
[00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:43.620]   unholy things to each other.
[00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:45.540]   Then the enemy wants us to abuse
[00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:47.820]   and to take advantage of each other.
[00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:49.780]   That's wickedness.
[00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:52.380]   That's how the enemy's schemes work.
[00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:55.660]   But when we put on the breastplate of righteousness,
[00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:59.180]   it means that we are in right standing with God,
[00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:02.820]   which also means we are living out God's justice
[00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:04.700]   in his battle against evil.
[00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:09.780]   So church, put on this breastplate of righteousness.
[00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:13.700]   We are called to live a life that reflects God's heart
[00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:16.540]   for the weak and the oppressed.
[00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:19.060]   We are called to speak out and do something
[00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:23.380]   when a situation doesn't fit in to what God's heart is.
[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:25.340]   We are called to act justly,
[00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:29.620]   just as God is just and righteous.
[00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:34.860]   So we put on this breastplate so we can be the people of God
[00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:36.380]   that he has called us to be.
[00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:40.500]   People who walk alongside the weak and the oppressed,
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:43.260]   who look after the widows and the orphans,
[00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:46.460]   a voice of justice in a world that's unjust,
[00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:50.820]   a people who are unashamedly living for the gospel,
[00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:53.740]   proudly declaring who they are.
[00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:55.820]   Put on this breastplate of righteousness
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:57.940]   and wear it proudly, church.
[00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:03.300]   Then it tells us, the feet fitted with the readiness
[00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:05.700]   that comes from the gospel of peace.
[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:08.660]   So much of a soldier's life, right,
[00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:11.900]   you can imagine is either spent standing firm,
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:13.740]   standing in one place, keeping guard,
[00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:16.780]   or requiring them to march forward
[00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:18.300]   and move to a different place.
[00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:21.940]   Both require strong, steady shoes.
[00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:24.260]   And time and time again, you have heard it repeated,
[00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:26.460]   the call has been to stand firm,
[00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:29.340]   stand firm, to be unmoved.
[00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:33.700]   You see, the enemy doesn't want us to stand firm.
[00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:37.740]   The enemy wants to make us change our minds.
[00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:38.820]   That's another one of his schemes,
[00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:41.660]   especially in our relationship with Jesus.
[00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:45.340]   The enemy knows that a double-minded person
[00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:48.300]   is unstable in all that they do.
[00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:49.660]   James 1:8 tells us that.
[00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:52.700]   And so what he wants to do,
[00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:56.060]   he likes nothing more than to make us second guess
[00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:59.260]   Jesus' love for us, his plans for us,
[00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:03.380]   to get us to doubt what God has already told us.
[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:07.260]   In other words, to disrupt the peace that you feel
[00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:09.300]   when you have the word of God,
[00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:12.300]   when you have Jesus living with you and in you
[00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:14.380]   that comes from following the Lord.
[00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:19.220]   Do you feel like you can relate to this?
[00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:23.220]   Have you ever felt yourself doubting the goodness of God?
[00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:24.780]   Right at the beginning, that was his scheme, right?
[00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:27.220]   He said to Eve, did God really say this?
[00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:30.020]   Trying to get her to change her mind?
[00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:33.060]   Do you ever find yourself living one way
[00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:36.140]   in certain situations or living another life
[00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:37.540]   in another situation?
[00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:40.540]   Big part of my testimony growing up,
[00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:41.940]   I struggled with that so much.
[00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:44.060]   I felt like with my school friends,
[00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:46.300]   and in one context I was this person,
[00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:48.620]   but in another context I was the good church boy
[00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:51.500]   and it was so hard trying to navigate my life
[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:53.180]   between the two identities
[00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:54.980]   that I seemed to carry at that time.
[00:28:54.980 --> 00:29:00.340]   Do you ever hear the enemy make you doubt
[00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:03.860]   if God really has given you the peace he has promised you?
[00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:10.020]   We need to fit our feet in the gospel
[00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:12.100]   because the gospel is the only thing
[00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:15.420]   that gives us a firm foundation to stand on,
[00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:16.920]   to build our lives upon.
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:19.420]   Jesus said this before he left earth,
[00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:22.900]   peace I leave with you, my peace I give to you,
[00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:25.780]   not as the world gives do I give to you.
[00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:28.020]   Let not your hearts be troubled,
[00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:30.260]   neither let them be afraid.
[00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:33.740]   So we fit our feet with the gospel
[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:35.900]   so that we can have a firm place to stand
[00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:37.180]   and to build our life.
[00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:39.060]   But here's the other thing,
[00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:41.900]   at the same time, knowing the gospel
[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:44.260]   also allows us to bring this peace
[00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:48.380]   to areas of conflict, to areas that need it.
[00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:50.620]   We have been called to stand firm, yes,
[00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:55.420]   but sometimes offense is the best version of defense.
[00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:58.140]   And when we see there's a place that needs the gospel,
[00:29:58.140 --> 00:29:59.820]   when we see our family and our friends,
[00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:04.260]   when we see areas of this society that needs peace,
[00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:06.220]   then we are called to carry it there.
[00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:09.900]   And when that moment comes for you to carry the gospel,
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:12.580]   to live out the gospel, to speak the gospel,
[00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:15.060]   we also need to be ready for those moments
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:17.700]   whenever opportunity presents itself.
[00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:20.820]   Whenever God calls you,
[00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:23.660]   will you be able to respond like Isaiah and say,
[00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:27.020]   Lord, here I am, send me.
[00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:29.940]   So we put on the gospel,
[00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:32.660]   we fit our feet with the gospel of peace
[00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:35.060]   so that we cannot just stand firm,
[00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:38.780]   but also bring the gospel to those places that need it.
[00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:43.740]   Then it says we need to take up the shield of faith
[00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:45.700]   with which you can extinguish
[00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:49.100]   all the flaming arrows of the evil one.
[00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:50.420]   So the shields for Roman soldier
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:52.460]   were probably about like four feet high,
[00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:53.980]   about as wide as a body,
[00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:55.380]   a cover up most of the upper body.
[00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:57.180]   They were important because
[00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:59.380]   one of the most common methods of attack back then
[00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:02.460]   was to dip arrows in tar and light it.
[00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:03.780]   You've probably seen it in the movies, right?
[00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:06.780]   These flaming arrows, literally flaming arrows that come
[00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:08.980]   and so like with the sword, you can,
[00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:12.660]   with a shield, you can block the enemy's attacks.
[00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:16.780]   The shields will have a special covering on the top,
[00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:18.540]   like a leather, so the shield itself
[00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:21.260]   wouldn't sort of burn up as well.
[00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:22.460]   Google it, I don't know.
[00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:25.300]   For us, this is what's important, okay?
[00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:30.340]   The shield of faith talks about our faith
[00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:34.060]   and our loyalty to Jesus, no matter what.
[00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:38.020]   The enemy is a master archer,
[00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:41.860]   and like we said, he fires, all things kind of schemes.
[00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:45.540]   His arrows he fires at us are things like doubt,
[00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:50.540]   things like fear, selfishness, impurity, lust, greed,
[00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:54.340]   adverse circumstances, pride, self-confidence,
[00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:57.140]   persecution, false teaching, all these things,
[00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:58.300]   the list could go on.
[00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:02.220]   These arrows are there to make us doubt what we believe in.
[00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:07.140]   His arrows are designed to try and burn down our faith.
[00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:13.940]   But the shield reminds us that we walk by faith
[00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:16.220]   and not by sight.
[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:18.660]   So even as the enemy fires these arrows,
[00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:21.980]   we put up our faith, we put up our loyalty to Jesus,
[00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:24.260]   and they will be extinguished.
[00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:27.260]   Even when we do not fully see or understand
[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:29.940]   what is happening, faith is acknowledging
[00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:33.060]   that God's ways are higher than our ways.
[00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:37.180]   And in this battle, we cannot defer, we cannot jump ship.
[00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:39.980]   We have to stay loyal to Jesus.
[00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:43.700]   One of the most amazing displays of faith and loyalty,
[00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:45.940]   I think, in scripture is through the story
[00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:49.260]   of Daniel's friends, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego
[00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:51.660]   in the book of Daniel.
[00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:54.700]   Here they are facing the fiery furnace,
[00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:56.460]   and these are their words.
[00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:59.660]   "If we are thrown into the blazing furnace,
[00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:02.300]   "the God we serve is able to deliver us from it,
[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:04.180]   "and he will deliver us."
[00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:05.140]   That's the faith.
[00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:10.060]   "But even if he does not, we want you to know,
[00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:12.500]   "your majesty, that we will not serve your gods
[00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:15.060]   "or worship the image of gold you have set up."
[00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:17.060]   That's the loyalty.
[00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:21.900]   So church, we have been called to hold on tight
[00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:26.620]   to the shield of faith, and to loyally follow Jesus
[00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:31.220]   into battle, extinguishing all the flaming arrows
[00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:32.060]   of the enemy.
[00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:38.820]   Then it tells us about the helmet of salvation.
[00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:40.380]   Right, for the soldier, the helmet covers
[00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:42.860]   another important part of the body, the head.
[00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:45.460]   And the helmet was also sometimes a way of determining
[00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:47.300]   the position and the rank of the soldier,
[00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:50.100]   these plumes on the top of the helmet.
[00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:56.220]   And so for us, this helmet speaks to our identity.
[00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:59.460]   It's knowing who you belong to.
[00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:03.580]   As you battle, as you take your stand,
[00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:06.900]   know that you are fighting for King Jesus.
[00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:10.500]   That as brothers and sisters, as people of Christ,
[00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:13.780]   we are part of the Lord's army.
[00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:15.300]   And with the helmet of salvation,
[00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:17.220]   and what that does, it's that reminds us
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:20.460]   that we have already been saved.
[00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:23.860]   This is one of the most important things to hold on to.
[00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:26.380]   All these things that the enemy's trying to do,
[00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:29.220]   ultimately, they're not gonna change the outcome.
[00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:32.700]   Right, we said this just now, Jesus is already victorious.
[00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:37.580]   He's doing everything he can to try and distract us
[00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:38.420]   from this fact.
[00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:40.940]   But through his death and resurrection,
[00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:42.940]   Jesus has already won.
[00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:46.060]   He has already overcome sin and death.
[00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:50.260]   And the enemy's not attacking from a place of strength,
[00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:53.980]   but from a place of already having been defeated.
[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:56.660]   Well, we have to realize this,
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:59.220]   the enemy is a desperate loser.
[00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:03.580]   In this time, he might have some influence on earth,
[00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:06.820]   but his fate has already been sealed.
[00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:08.900]   And when Jesus returns, when the new heaven
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:10.460]   and the new earth comes,
[00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:12.260]   the enemy and all his deeds
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:15.420]   and all these other spiritual forces,
[00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:16.780]   these evil spiritual forces,
[00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:19.540]   will be destroyed once and for all.
[00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:23.580]   And the helmet reminds us that salvation
[00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:26.660]   and victory belongs to our God.
[00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:28.780]   We are on the winning side.
[00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:31.660]   And so yes, we might get wounded.
[00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:34.700]   We might get hurt.
[00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:36.980]   But following Jesus and doing spiritual battle
[00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:40.260]   against the enemy is not going to be a breeze.
[00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:43.700]   It's not going to be smooth sailing.
[00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:45.580]   Let's not forget there are people out there,
[00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:47.660]   other Christians in parts of the world
[00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:49.740]   who are literally being persecuted,
[00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:53.820]   literally risking their lives for the sake of the gospel.
[00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:57.300]   But even in that situation,
[00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:00.140]   the helmet of salvation reminds us,
[00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:03.180]   even if we were to lose everything on this earth,
[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:07.700]   everything, we are still victorious
[00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:11.900]   because God has already won the ultimate battle.
[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:15.580]   So church, we put on our helmet.
[00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:18.780]   Be brave.
[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:22.140]   Be strong and courageous, as scripture has called us to.
[00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:23.540]   Take risks for Jesus.
[00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:25.780]   Go all out and live for him
[00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:28.660]   because he has already saved you.
[00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:34.940]   And finally, we get the sword of the spirit,
[00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:36.540]   which is the word of God.
[00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:41.420]   The sword is the one weapon of offense the soldier carries,
[00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:43.460]   a short little dagger-like thing
[00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:45.740]   used for close-handed combat.
[00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:49.460]   For us, though, when it speaks of the sword,
[00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:52.460]   this speaks to the power of God's word.
[00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:55.660]   And we remind ourselves, scripture is reminding us
[00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:59.780]   that the word of God is alive and active.
[00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:02.500]   Throughout scripture, again, you see,
[00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:04.540]   whenever the word of God is heard,
[00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:08.260]   whenever God speaks, there is power in it.
[00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:11.700]   Things happen when God speaks.
[00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:14.260]   Situations change.
[00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:17.420]   Therefore, knowing God's word is one of the key ways
[00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:19.700]   we not only stand firm against the enemy,
[00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:22.660]   but the only weapon you have in this battle
[00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:25.740]   against the enemy is the sword of his word,
[00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:27.300]   the sword of the spirit.
[00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:31.380]   Jesus himself is a great example of this.
[00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:34.180]   When Jesus is tested in the wilderness,
[00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:35.780]   when the enemy tempts him with lies,
[00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:37.700]   when the enemy fires his darts at him,
[00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:40.300]   he stays loyal, he does all that stuff,
[00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:43.380]   but then he also fights back with scripture,
[00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:44.860]   with God's word.
[00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:48.060]   In the same way, then, church,
[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:50.420]   we today need to have a relationship
[00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:53.540]   and a good understanding of the word of God
[00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:57.180]   to withstand the enemy and to fight back against his schemes.
[00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:01.100]   So let's cherish God's word, church.
[00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:02.620]   Read it.
[00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:03.740]   Meditate on it.
[00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:04.580]   Cherish it.
[00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:05.620]   Memorize it.
[00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:07.820]   Study it together.
[00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:11.700]   Listen to it, because this is our only weapon
[00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:14.060]   in this fight against the enemy.
[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:19.020]   But be encouraged also that God still speaks today,
[00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:20.700]   yes, through his word,
[00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:23.060]   but one of the key ways God speaks today
[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:24.620]   is through the Holy Spirit.
[00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:27.260]   The Holy Spirit, therefore,
[00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:30.540]   also fights back against the enemy when we're attacked.
[00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:33.380]   Since this battle is not against flesh and blood,
[00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:35.860]   our weapon is also not against flesh,
[00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:38.820]   our weapons are also not physical weapons.
[00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:44.780]   We too now, then, we study God's word
[00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:46.620]   and we follow the Holy Spirit
[00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:51.300]   and allow him to move in power whenever he speaks.
[00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:55.900]   Now, finally, it's this.
[00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:59.860]   You see, we're not just individual soldiers
[00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:00.980]   fighting these battles,
[00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:03.780]   these little squirmishes on our own.
[00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:07.580]   Paul brings everything together
[00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:10.340]   in the central idea of prayer.
[00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:15.460]   Prayer's the final thing that completes the armor of God.
[00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:18.540]   This is why Paul signs off this letter by saying,
[00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:22.060]   and pray in the spirit in all occasions
[00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:25.380]   with all kinds of prayers and requests,
[00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:28.380]   with this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying
[00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:30.740]   for all the Lord's people.
[00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:34.140]   Pray also for me that whenever I speak,
[00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:36.900]   words may be given me so that I will fiercely make known
[00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:39.300]   the mystery of the gospel for which I am ambassador
[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:43.260]   in chains, pray that I might declare it fearlessly
[00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:44.580]   as I should.
[00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:51.060]   Paul's writing to a community, to a group of people,
[00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:52.940]   and he's asking them to pray together.
[00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:54.660]   Always pray, don't stop praying.
[00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:56.460]   He says this in other parts of his letter.
[00:39:56.460 --> 00:40:00.340]   Pray in all occasions, keep on praying for God's people.
[00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:02.900]   Keep on praying for each other.
[00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.540]   And pray also for me.
[00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:07.980]   See, it's a sobering end to this letter
[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:11.100]   because we're reminded as Paul is writing this letter,
[00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:15.020]   he's not actually writing from a place of confidence.
[00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:16.260]   He is in prison.
[00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:20.500]   He is actually being held captive and in chains.
[00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:22.700]   In some commentaries you read, as he's writing this,
[00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:25.020]   there was probably a literal Roman soldier
[00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:26.900]   standing there keeping a guard of him.
[00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:29.380]   But notice what he says.
[00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:31.940]   He doesn't pray, oh, pray for my release,
[00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:35.740]   pray for justice to be done, pray that I would walk free.
[00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:36.860]   That's the probably kind of stuff
[00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:38.700]   I would be asking people to pray for.
[00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:41.220]   But he gets it.
[00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:43.460]   In this battle, he doesn't say,
[00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:45.100]   pray that I would be released.
[00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:47.440]   He says, pray for my wisdom.
[00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:49.260]   Pray for my courage.
[00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:51.360]   Pray that I would know what to say
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:55.380]   in every single situation for the sake of Jesus.
[00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:57.800]   You see, this is what it looks like then,
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:59.860]   to stand firm and to fight back
[00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:02.400]   against the schemes on the enemy.
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:03.360]   This is what it looks like
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:06.800]   when no weapons formed against you prosper.
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:09.660]   Because no matter what situation you're in,
[00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:11.640]   you are strong in the Lord.
[00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:17.240]   And so we pray together as a community.
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:20.560]   When things come up, we join together in prayer
[00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:22.680]   and walk alongside each other as a community.
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:27.520]   Fight as a community of believers, not just on your own.
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:34.560]   And so since Paul encourages us to do this,
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:37.320]   this is how I wanna end our time together this morning.
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:43.400]   So we're gonna still our hearts for a moment.
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:50.360]   And maybe if you came with someone today,
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:52.980]   you know, Paul's asking us to pray together.
[00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:56.560]   Maybe turn to the person you came with right now.
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:59.440]   And we can ask each other for you,
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:00.720]   have a quick conversation, you know,
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:02.060]   how can I pray for you?
[00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:07.320]   Where have you been feeling attacked lately?
[00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:10.440]   Where do you need courage?
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:15.280]   Where do you need the Spirit of God to empower you,
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:17.400]   to strengthen you, to walk alongside you?
[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:23.120]   How can I be a brother and a sister to you this morning?
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:28.720]   Prayer is one of those things,
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:30.000]   it's one of those beautiful things
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.960]   that help us to acknowledge that, again,
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:34.920]   this is not by our own power.
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:38.600]   It's a mysterious thing that when we pray
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:40.800]   and when God speaks and when he works,
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:43.720]   we see him move in power.
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:49.080]   Even though we can't really explain how it works,
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:53.000]   at the same time we know that without prayer, we are nothing.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:59.200]   And so church, just take a couple minutes right now.
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:00.560]   If you came alone, I encourage you,
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:03.160]   you can, if you use a bit of courage,
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:06.120]   pray with the, ask for prayer for the person next to you.
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:10.320]   In the areas of struggle that you have,
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:13.440]   in the areas that you feel like the enemy is attacking you,
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:16.940]   we pray with each other to stand firm in this battle.
[00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:20.120]   So give us a few minutes to do that
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:22.280]   and then I'm gonna close with a prayer.
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:25.660]   (soft music)
[00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:28.080]   (soft music)
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:30.500]   (soft music)
[00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:32.920]   (soft music)
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:35.340]   (soft music)
[00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:37.760]   (soft music)
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:40.180]   (soft music)
[00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:42.600]   (soft music)
[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:45.020]   (soft music)
[00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:47.440]   (soft music)
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:49.860]   (soft music)
[00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:52.280]   (soft music)
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:54.700]   (soft music)
[00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:57.120]   (soft music)
[00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:59.540]   (soft music)
[00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:01.960]   (soft music)
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:04.380]   (soft music)
[00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:06.800]   (soft music)
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:09.220]   (soft music)
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:38.460]   So Jesus, we thank you for giving us this armor.
[00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:42.520]   We thank you that you do not leave us alone
[00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:44.500]   and defenseless and helpless,
[00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:49.320]   but you equip us and empower us to live on this earth
[00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:50.680]   in a victorious way,
[00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:55.340]   in a way that doesn't live in carrying fear
[00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:58.280]   of what the enemy might do to us,
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:01.880]   but in the confidence that no matter
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:03.760]   what the enemy does to us,
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:05.160]   we can stand firm,
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:11.520]   that we have this faith that can quench every single lie
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:15.160]   and doubt and attack that the enemy might try
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:16.400]   to harm us with,
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:19.600]   and still stand firm and say,
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:22.640]   I am a child of God.
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:25.920]   I am in the Lord's army and with my brothers
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:28.840]   and sisters around me in community,
[00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:31.220]   praying with me, praying for me,
[00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:36.300]   the enemy will not be successful
[00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:38.460]   in the schemes that he has planned for us,
[00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:41.140]   but the plan of God,
[00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:43.140]   his will is what is gonna be done
[00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:44.700]   and accomplished in this world.
[00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:49.640]   So Jesus, we give ourselves over to you.
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:53.100]   Father, I pray for those of us out there
[00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:55.660]   who may have strayed in this area.
[00:45:55.660 --> 00:46:00.340]   Perhaps we have switched allegiances
[00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:03.620]   and in a moment of weakness,
[00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:04.700]   in a season of doubt,
[00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:08.520]   we've turned to other spiritual sources for advice,
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:12.500]   for direction in how to live our life.
[00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:17.260]   Father, I pray that if any of us listening online
[00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:19.060]   or those of us who are in this room right now
[00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:22.680]   or family members are in that place,
[00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:26.820]   Father, I pray that the Holy Spirit would come right now,
[00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:28.420]   the power would come right now
[00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:30.820]   and just cut off all schemes and all lies
[00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:34.780]   and all attachments that the enemy has made in that space.
[00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:40.420]   That the enemy has no hold on anybody in this room
[00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:45.480]   and with the full armor of God,
[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:47.040]   we are standing firm.
[00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:54.660]   And that from this day onwards
[00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:59.040]   and in every moment we trust and rely in you.
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:01.580]   We build our lives,
[00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:06.060]   we put our feet solidly on the solid ground on the gospel.
[00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:11.020]   We rest in the truth of you being the almighty King
[00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:18.860]   and together Lord, with your word, we march forward.
[00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:23.020]   We fight back against the enemy
[00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:27.820]   and we await your coming back to this earth
[00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:30.560]   and reclaiming your rightful place on the throne.
[00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:34.500]   Until then Lord, sustain us in this fight,
[00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:38.260]   keep us strong, keep us unified in your love,
[00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:42.160]   keep us trusting in you, keep us loyal to King Jesus.
[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:48.460]   We pray these in your mighty, beautiful,
[00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:53.380]   awesome, victorious name, the name of Jesus, amen.
[00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:56.840]   (gentle music)
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:59.420]   (gentle music)
[00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:03.020]   If you're still praying.
