[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800]   by your word this afternoon.
[00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.100]   In your name we pray, amen.
[00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.100]   - Amen.
[00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.000]   Thank you, promise, for that, I think.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.660]   (congregation laughing)
[00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.060]   Good afternoon, church, how's everyone doing?
[00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.420]   Yeah, upper house, I see you.
[00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.260]   Actually, no, I don't see you, but I know you see me,
[00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.320]   so I wanna say hi.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.220]   Hey, greetings, especially for those of you
[00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.260]   who just put up your hand,
[00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.920]   this is your first time at the Vine.
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.860]   Check out the newcomers, you get to meet us,
[00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.720]   some food, drinks.
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.020]   Just a little bit about myself.
[00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.960]   My name is Justin, one of the pastors here.
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.720]   I know we have many, but that is our Vine family.
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.820]   The Vine has been my home for almost two decades now.
[00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.600]   I've come to Hong Kong, I grew up in Canada,
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.020]   came to Hong Kong as a young adult, served here,
[00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.360]   got involved, got to know a bunch of people,
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.060]   met my wife here, got called to be a pastor
[00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.500]   and still walking this path now.
[00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.060]   And some of you actually recently asked me,
[00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.160]   you know, with all honesty,
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.860]   it's like, Justin, what do you do here?
[00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.200]   Let me answer that, I think this is a good time.
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.820]   I am Pastoral Care Pastor, what does that mean?
[00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.920]   Simply that when you email me, when you email us,
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.020]   I reply and together with the pastoral team,
[00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.400]   we find ways to support you, whether you're getting married,
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.960]   whether you want a visit, a prayer,
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.020]   that's why we're here for,
[00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.520]   so do reach out if you feel like that.
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.600]   Yeah, so we're almost through our series in this year.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.660]   We're almost through our series in forgiveness.
[00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.000]   This is week five of six.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.700]   Pastor Ellison's gonna come back next week
[00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.700]   and wrap it all up.
[00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.300]   And so can I just see a show of hands,
[00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.600]   who's actually been here?
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.400]   Don't be shy, don't be shy, all right.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.400]   So that's most of us actually.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.900]   And so what have we talked about?
[00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.100]   We've talked about the importance of forgiveness,
[00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.300]   what it is and what it isn't,
[00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.900]   that we cannot forgive on our own strength.
[00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.700]   And of course, Christianity is the central tenet
[00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.600]   and one of the pillars of Christianity
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.600]   is that forgiveness renews us.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.800]   Without forgiveness,
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.600]   Christianity would not make that much sense.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.300]   Grace would not make that sense.
[00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.600]   And last week, Pastor Jennifer and Pastor Jess
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.100]   and Allison and Charles reminded us
[00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.900]   that we actually, a lot of times, many times,
[00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.900]   probably all the time, we need each other
[00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.100]   to help us on the journey of forgiveness.
[00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.700]   We need help, we need to be forgiven
[00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.300]   and we also need that encouragement
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.100]   to keep on walking this road.
[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.500]   And church, I'm gonna,
[00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.000]   this is the most confident I'll be today
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.900]   and I can just probably read your mind and say,
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.900]   you know what, it has not been easy.
[00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.200]   This series has not been easy.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.500]   Even preparing this message has been so difficult
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.000]   because forgiveness is a reality,
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.200]   it's a shared reality that all of us
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.500]   must diligently work through and work hard at.
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.700]   Forgiveness doesn't just come through a prayer or two,
[00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.200]   it doesn't come with just attending worship
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.800]   and God does something, it's a journey.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.800]   It takes hard work, it takes thoughtfulness,
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.800]   it takes our faith, it takes the community
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.900]   for us to walk through this.
[00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.300]   So I want to encourage you, you're not alone.
[00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.500]   We walk through it together.
[00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.200]   And so today, this week, week five,
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.100]   we want to explore what it means
[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.400]   for us to receive forgiveness.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.000]   So it really is about us today.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.400]   I wanna talk about you, I wanna talk about me
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.800]   and I want to invite you, wherever you are in this journey
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.000]   right now, forgiveness in your life, what season.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.900]   I want you to just be able to tangibly say,
[00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.400]   yes, this is what I'm gonna do about it.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.400]   Now, I'm gonna take you through a journey,
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.200]   I'm gonna highlight three really complicated
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.200]   and difficult factor that causes us difficulty
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.500]   when it comes to receiving forgiveness for ourselves.
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.800]   And so I wanna ask you right now,
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.000]   what is your sermon strategy game?
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.600]   So I know I saw some eyebrows here.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.600]   So when you come to church, how do you receive God's word?
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.600]   You know, do you take notes?
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.420]   Are you a note taker?
[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.000]   I'm a note taker, I write everything
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.100]   that ever has been pre-preached.
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.000]   And I go home and I reflect on it and I pray about it.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.600]   Whereas some of us just listen and you absorb
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.600]   and you're like, you know, this is what I need to do.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.100]   And so I wanna encourage you, whatever your sermon game is,
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.600]   however you receive God's word,
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.100]   I've been just preparing this message for weeks.
[00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.600]   And my only prayer is that I believe
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.000]   that God's just gonna show us one thing.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.500]   And I just pray that you would have the courage today
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.300]   to lean into this, to just say, yes, Lord,
[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.200]   this is where I'm at, I'm not ashamed,
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.800]   I will not be ashamed, I'm just gonna act and respond.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.300]   Okay, and so I want to just center our entire conversation
[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.900]   in how to receive forgiveness for ourselves
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.900]   on this beautiful gospel story
[00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.100]   in Luke chapter seven, verse 36 to 50.
[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.800]   So before I begin, I just wanna summarize.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.800]   I think some of us appreciate summaries.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.800]   This account is between Jesus and Simon the Pharisee.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.100]   Simon the Pharisee invites Jesus to his house
[00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.600]   and there's always a surprise.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.100]   This sinful woman comes unannounced
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.100]   because she desperately wants to see Jesus.
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.400]   This is where we're at.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.200]   And so as we read this, as we listen to this passage,
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.300]   I just want you to consider one thing.
[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.700]   I want you to think about why is it
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.900]   that some of us can love God more than others?
[00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:14.800]   You ready?
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.900]   All right, I'll take that as a yes.
[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.400]   All right, so chapter seven, verse 36.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.500]   When one of the Pharisees invited Jesus
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.900]   to have dinner with him, he went to the Pharisee's house
[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.700]   and reclined at the table.
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.600]   A woman in that town who lived a sinful life,
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.000]   she was a prostitute, learned that Jesus
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.700]   was eating at the Pharisee's house.
[00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.800]   So she came there with an alabaster jar of perfume.
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.500]   As she stood behind him at his feet weeping,
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.500]   she began to wet his feet with her tears.
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.100]   Then she wiped them with her hair,
[00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.100]   kissed them and poured perfume on them.
[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.800]   When the Pharisee, that is Simon,
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.500]   who had invited Jesus, saw this, he said to himself,
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.100]   "If this man were a prophet,
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.500]   "he would know exactly who is touching him
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.500]   "and what kind of woman she is, that she is a sinner."
[00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.800]   Jesus answered him, "Simon, I have something to tell you.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.300]   "Tell me, teacher," he said.
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.500]   "Two people owed money to a certain money lender.
[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.900]   "One owed him 500 denarii and the other 50.
[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.100]   "Neither of them had the money to pay him back,
[00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.000]   "so he forgave the debts of both.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   "Now which of them will love him more?"
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.300]   Simon replied, "I suppose the one
[00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.000]   "who had the bigger debt forgiven.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.700]   "You have judged correctly," Jesus said.
[00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:35.000]   Then Jesus turned to the woman and also said to Simon,
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   "Do you see this woman, Simon?
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.500]   "I came into your house.
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.500]   "You did not give me any water for my feet,
[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.700]   "but she wet my feet with her tears
[00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.900]   "and wiped them with her hair.
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.000]   "You did not give me a kiss,
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.100]   "but this woman from the time I entered
[00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.300]   "has not stopped kissing my feet.
[00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.200]   "You did not put oil on my head,
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.700]   "but she has poured perfume on my feet.
[00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.800]   "Therefore, Simon, I tell you,
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.100]   "her many sins have been forgiven
[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.600]   "as her great love has shown.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:09.600]   "But whoever has been forgiven little loves little."
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.900]   Then Jesus said to her, "Your sins are forgiven."
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.900]   The other guests began to say amongst themselves,
[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.300]   "Who is this who even forgives sins?"
[00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.100]   Jesus said to the woman,
[00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.800]   "Your faith has saved you.
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.300]   "Go in peace."
[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:28.200]   When we read this, we can see that the response
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.700]   of Simon the Pharisee and the sinful woman
[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.000]   cannot be any more different.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.300]   And so the question I asked you was,
[00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:39.000]   how come some people can love God more than others?
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.400]   Well, I want to bring us back to verse 47,
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.700]   where Jesus says, "I tell you,
[00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.700]   "her many sins have been forgiven
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.300]   "as evidenced by the way she's loving.
[00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.800]   "But whoever has been forgiven little loves little."
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.300]   So for the woman, from the moment this woman
[00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:00.300]   came bursting into Simon's house uninvited, unashamed,
[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.400]   her actions revealed that there is nothing
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.000]   too good for Jesus.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.200]   How could she love?
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.300]   It's because she was grateful.
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.400]   She was indebted to Jesus,
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.700]   who was the one who forgave her for all her sins.
[00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.600]   Everything that she's done, Jesus forgave and said,
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:24.500]   "Go and live this new life in freedom away from sin."
[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.600]   And so I think the critical difference
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.800]   was the woman was fully aware of her sinfulness
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.800]   and that she did something by coming to Jesus.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.400]   And the way she acted is because she is so grateful.
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.100]   Now, by contrast, I think from our perspective,
[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.500]   while Simon was cold, he's a bit rude,
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:48.400]   he was a bit disrespectful because he did not attend
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.700]   to the common courtesies that the Pharisees
[00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:54.100]   would have known to do, such as washing a guest's feet,
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.600]   such as greeting your guest with a kiss on the cheek,
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.400]   and also by anointing your guest's head with oil.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:06.600]   And so I think Simon, he acted this way
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.600]   because he did not feel like he had
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.300]   to acknowledge his sinfulness,
[00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:13.400]   and that he probably did not comprehend the depth
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.500]   of God's forgiveness for this man.
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:19.600]   And so if I were to read this further together,
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.700]   can you imagine what if, what if in that moment,
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:27.700]   you know, Simon invites Jesus to his house,
[00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:32.300]   and suddenly Simon realized the depth of his depravity,
[00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.200]   his sinfulness, and he turned to Jesus,
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.200]   and he said, "Jesus, I want what she's having."
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.800]   Imagine if that's happened.
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.100]   That might have happened, but we don't know.
[00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:45.500]   And I think we can say that in this story,
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.800]   that forgiveness, being forgiven,
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.800]   and being able to receive that forgiveness
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.000]   has everything to do with how we love each other,
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.600]   how we forgive, and whether or not we will,
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.100]   are willing to extend forgiveness to one another.
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:03.600]   This story, when I was preparing,
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.700]   brought me back many, many years ago, when I was 16.
[00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:09.800]   I was running away from God.
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.400]   I knew God existed.
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.600]   I was a liar.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.800]   I stole.
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.900]   I just wrecked all the relationships in my life
[00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.800]   to a point where luckily we moved houses twice,
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.300]   so I don't have to deal with the chaos I left.
[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.900]   But when I think back, you know, when I was saved,
[00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:29.100]   God became everything.
[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.900]   I was like that woman.
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.800]   I worshipped, I wept.
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.000]   I just did not care what people thought.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   My friends and I, we just went to worship the Lord
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.400]   when we could have been doing other stuff.
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.300]   But then, of course, as we grow up, as I grew up,
[00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:45.500]   we encounter life, and life gets difficult.
[00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.400]   Things happen, our thoughts change, our values change,
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.600]   our belief change, they get challenged.
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.200]   And more and more, I hate to admit this,
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.000]   but sometimes I come to church,
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.300]   I come to worship the Lord
[00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.900]   with this Simon kind of attitude.
[00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.800]   I cross my arms sometimes.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.000]   I'm a bit apathetic.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.700]   My heart is cold.
[00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:09.100]   I'm forgetful at what God has done all of these years.
[00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.800]   He has never left me, but yet I just feel like,
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.400]   I don't feel much.
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.900]   And so therefore, I'm kind of like Simon,
[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:19.500]   and I don't know if you can put yourselves in that,
[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.400]   your shoes, and so I say all this
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.600]   because this story radically reframes
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.500]   the way we understand forgiveness.
[00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.000]   Because according to this story,
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.600]   if we want to receive forgiveness for ourselves,
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:36.100]   then it's going to require love.
[00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:39.800]   And we cannot understand and comprehend love
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:43.500]   until we understand how much we are forgiven.
[00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.000]   And so I want to just propose today
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.200]   that our starting point is that
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.300]   each of us have to think about
[00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:55.100]   our ability to receive forgiveness from God,
[00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:59.300]   our ability to receive forgiveness from each other,
[00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:01.700]   and I want to just highlight the three things
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.800]   that always gets in the way.
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.700]   I want to just bring them up to you
[00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:09.400]   so that all of us today will not shy away
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.900]   from critically analyzing and examining
[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:15.500]   how are these three things affecting us right now.
[00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.600]   Because if we just don't do that,
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.600]   then we will get lost,
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.600]   then we just kind of just get cold,
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.500]   we kind of end up like Simon a bit.
[00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.200]   And the three things I want to talk about
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:28.800]   is how our sin, our excuses, and our guilt
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:33.900]   impact and hinder our ability to receive forgiveness.
[00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:37.700]   So the first thing when we talk about our sins
[00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:41.100]   is that I just, you know, I want to say and state
[00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:44.300]   the obvious, that the reality is that all of us sin.
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:46.700]   Sin is the reality, the nature,
[00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.300]   our normal human everyday experience.
[00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:53.600]   We cannot separate ourselves from this reality.
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.600]   Isaiah 64 reminds us, verse four,
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:00.600]   "All of us have become like one who is unclean,
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.100]   "and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags,
[00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.900]   "and like the wind, our sin sweeps us away."
[00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:09.300]   The scripture says that as long as we are in
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:13.300]   this temporal, decaying body, sin will dwell in us,
[00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:16.000]   sin dwells in us, and that we will continue
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.400]   to commit inexcusable acts against God,
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.900]   against one another, against creation.
[00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.800]   And if we allow this sin to be unchecked,
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.600]   unrepented for, then we will experience
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:32.200]   dire and long-term consequences.
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.300]   And some of us have already experienced this.
[00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:36.200]   You know, sin disconnects us.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.800]   Sin erects emotional barriers between us
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:43.500]   so that we cannot actually communicate, we cannot connect.
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:48.800]   Our sin causes us to act on our darkest, insatiable desires.
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.000]   It causes us to act out in our hatred,
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.300]   our jealousies, our self-righteousness.
[00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.000]   And if we allow sin to lead us,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.700]   then we will continue to hurt and manipulate,
[00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:03.100]   control, abuse, and we will always seek retribution.
[00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:07.200]   But church, I want to, once again, just,
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.500]   I want to come back to the gospel.
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:12.000]   The good news is no matter how dark it gets,
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.400]   no matter how much sin controls us,
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.100]   the good news is that we are all, like this woman,
[00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:21.200]   equally placed to receive God's free
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.300]   and merciful grace in our life.
[00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:25.900]   That means all of us have the opportunity
[00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:28.400]   to be set free, to be forgiven,
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:31.500]   to be released on the potentiality
[00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:34.400]   to have a new life with Christ.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.600]   And that's why he died for us,
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.300]   so that we can experience this.
[00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:41.400]   1 John 1, verse nine reminds us,
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.000]   I know we've read this in this series,
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   but this is such, this is a scripture that you should,
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.800]   and all of us should memorize.
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.400]   It says, "If we confess our sins,
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.700]   "God is faithful and just and will forgive us of our sins
[00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:56.700]   "and purify us from all unrighteousness."
[00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.300]   This means that as we confess,
[00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:02.000]   as we come to the Lord acknowledging our sinfulness,
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   the Holy Spirit will renew us, restore us, heal us.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.200]   And this promise is as sure as the rising sun
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.800]   and the setting of the sun.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.600]   However, this is conditional,
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.800]   depending on what we make of our sin,
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.300]   what we do with our sin.
[00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:22.700]   Because, church, once again, if we ignore the reality
[00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:25.400]   that sin is always against, working against us,
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:26.700]   and that sin dwells in us,
[00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:28.800]   then our lives will remain miserable,
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:32.600]   it will be burdensome, it will not be a pleasant journey.
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.400]   And all of us have experienced that.
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:40.100]   And our tendency to not adequately,
[00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:44.000]   as in to not honestly face and confront our sin reality
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   is probably the cause of a lot of my internal stress
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   and suffering, anxiety,
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.300]   and eventually, whatever happens in here,
[00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.900]   you will feel it, you will know it
[00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:56.800]   through my words and actions.
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.600]   And so, church, we ask, how should we respond then?
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:04.000]   I want to just say something very simple.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.300]   I think we can respond by accepting our propensity to sin.
[00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:11.400]   Now, I'm not advocating an acceptance
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:14.200]   of our sinful lifestyle and that we continue in it.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.600]   I'm saying that we should accept by examining
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.500]   and being honest to say, you know what?
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.200]   My sin has caused so much hurt
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:25.900]   and it continues to wreak havoc in these certain ways.
[00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:28.700]   And if we need further proof,
[00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:31.900]   our very attempt to avoid the reality
[00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:33.700]   and the consequences of our sin
[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.400]   is actually symptom of our sinfulness.
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:40.700]   Because sin wants to keep us in the dark.
[00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:44.500]   It does not want our dirtiest deeds exposed.
[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:46.800]   Sin also prevents us from seeing clearly.
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.100]   It distorts our vision.
[00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:50.300]   We do things out of ego, selfishness.
[00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:51.600]   I've already been in that.
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.200]   And sin keeps us from doing
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.400]   what we truly, genuinely want to do.
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.500]   And so, church, today, this afternoon,
[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.500]   if you are serious like me,
[00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:04.200]   that you want to follow Jesus for this rest of this life,
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.400]   you want to be faithful,
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:11.400]   then can I say to take your sin and our sin seriously
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.800]   and to take time and to examine
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:17.100]   how it is at work in our life?
[00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:19.200]   I would say that acceptance is the immediate
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.100]   and also long-term solution for us
[00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:25.500]   because as we journey, as we find comfort
[00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:27.200]   in the spirit and what God is doing,
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.500]   we encounter Jesus.
[00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:30.500]   And just like this woman,
[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:33.300]   we meet Jesus and he forgives us.
[00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:34.700]   And we experience freedom.
[00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:39.200]   A second thing that hinders our ability,
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.300]   I think, to receive forgiveness,
[00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:42.700]   that we don't talk about enough,
[00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.000]   is our tendency to make excuses.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.300]   As broken people, as sinful people,
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:52.200]   we cannot help but to habitually make excuses.
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:56.100]   We make excuses or we excuse ourselves
[00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.800]   out of doing something because, you know why?
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:00.600]   Because generally and probably most of the time,
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.200]   we're just afraid to face the truth.
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.000]   We are afraid to confront what we've done
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.400]   and how things really are.
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.500]   So what we do is we lie
[00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.100]   and we say deceptive things
[00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:14.300]   in order to make us feel better
[00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:16.000]   and to maintain this appearance
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.800]   of being good, moral people.
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.700]   Sometimes we run away.
[00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:23.200]   Sometimes we take substances to numb ourselves
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:26.500]   so that we can ignore what is actually happening.
[00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:32.000]   And so this, our incredible ability
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.200]   to excuse ourselves from wrongdoing
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:39.200]   is gets perpetuated by rationalizing, by blaming,
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:44.500]   by trying to put together obsessively the perfect excuse
[00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:45.800]   so that we don't have to deal with God,
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:48.100]   so I don't have to say sorry to you.
[00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:50.500]   When I think about Simon's distancedness
[00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.900]   when the day that Jesus visited him,
[00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:58.200]   I think that Simon must have told himself certain excuses.
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.900]   He must have rationalized where he stood,
[00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:02.400]   you know, because he was a Pharisee,
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.100]   so he knew and he probably said to himself,
[00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.600]   "Well, I'm religious.
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.200]   "I attend to the temple, I teach, I tithe,
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.700]   "I do everything I'm supposed to.
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.400]   "I have memorized the Torah."
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.600]   You can ask my colleagues here.
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:16.600]   They know me.
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:20.500]   And if Simon kept on saying that
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:21.700]   and carrying with that narrative,
[00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:24.800]   then there's actually nothing for him to repent of.
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:26.700]   He has done no wrongdoing.
[00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:31.800]   And I think this, in Simon,
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.300]   I think there is a cautionary lesson here
[00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:37.100]   that as Christians, it's really easy for us
[00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:39.500]   to come here on a Sunday
[00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.300]   and never have to actually deal with our sin
[00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:44.400]   because we're very vague about our sin.
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:46.700]   You know, we're very general.
[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:50.400]   We're not actually trying to specifically call out
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.400]   how we've hurt each other.
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.300]   And so we can come here and just say,
[00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:57.000]   "I'm sorry, God," but we go away just deceived
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.500]   because we actually haven't asked for forgiveness.
[00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:02.200]   We actually haven't rectified our wrong.
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:06.600]   And so how should we respond to our excuses?
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:09.200]   Well, I'm gonna quote the great C.S. Lewis
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.800]   because he offers a little bit,
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.000]   well, not a little bit, but very helpful thoughts
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.300]   on how we can counter our excuse-making.
[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.100]   The first thing C.S. Lewis would call us to do
[00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:24.600]   is to remember that God knows of all our actual excuses
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:25.900]   even before we say it.
[00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:28.900]   You know, because if Jesus was the one
[00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:31.600]   that died in our place on the cross,
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:34.300]   he died for our sins and our excuses
[00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:37.700]   and everything that causes us to be disconnected
[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:40.400]   so that we can be forgiven,
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.100]   so that we are not condemned for the same thing.
[00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:45.900]   I think this is why the sinful woman
[00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:48.700]   was able to run to Jesus because she knew
[00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:53.800]   that she would be free if she came to him.
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:58.200]   And I think the surest way,
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:00.800]   another way that C.S. Lewis would call us
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:04.900]   to counter our excuse-making is to simply believe
[00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:09.600]   that Jesus is willing and wanting to forgive us.
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.100]   You know, after years of making excuses,
[00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:14.100]   after years of making excuses,
[00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.900]   of living in these false narratives
[00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.600]   because we just don't wanna deal with the pain
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.300]   and we don't want the suffering,
[00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:21.600]   we'd rather just run away,
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.400]   we start believing the very things that we say.
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:29.900]   And the incessant anxiety to make excuses
[00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:33.800]   eventually causes us to believe a false gospel.
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:37.300]   It starts making us believe that God will not forgive us.
[00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:41.100]   But today, the good news, based on Luke 7,
[00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:42.800]   we realize and you realize,
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:45.300]   I want you to know that if you come to God today
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:48.700]   and ask for forgiveness, you know he will say,
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:52.300]   "I will, I will forgive you, I will set you free."
[00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:58.000]   And the third factor, the third thing I want us to address
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.900]   that is a bit more complex, a bit more difficult
[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:03.600]   is to talk about our guilt.
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:07.000]   You know, to what extent does our guilt
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.300]   hinder our ability to receive forgiveness?
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:12.100]   You know, because I think all of us can agree
[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:13.800]   that there are so many moments in life
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.900]   when we are overwhelmed by our guilt
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:19.500]   because of what we've done, what we continue to do,
[00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:22.300]   even though we try to stop, what we've done in secret,
[00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:25.400]   when we told ourselves we need to stop doing this,
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.300]   and all the ways that we've hurt people
[00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:30.400]   and we've left just bodies behind us
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.500]   but we don't wanna deal with it.
[00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.500]   And that guilt, if we don't look at it honestly,
[00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:38.300]   it turns into shame, it turns into stress,
[00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:40.300]   it turns into fear, it turns,
[00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:43.500]   it just causes us to want to hide.
[00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.500]   And then we spiral into this place
[00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:47.700]   where we eventually start believing that,
[00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:52.200]   you know what, I'm so unworthy, I am unlovable,
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.700]   I'm actually unforgivable.
[00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:57.200]   And we live like that, I think a lot of us
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.400]   just live like that.
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:03.100]   You know, think about Simon, Simon invites,
[00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:06.400]   he had perfect intention to invite Jesus to his house,
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.300]   and what happens, Jesus is like, Simon,
[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:09.500]   you didn't do this, you didn't do this,
[00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.900]   you didn't do this, imagine the guilt
[00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:15.300]   that the guy would have felt, and maybe that's why
[00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.200]   he couldn't say anything else, he didn't know what to say,
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.400]   he was just stuck.
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:23.600]   And you know that as hard as we've tried,
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.900]   we've probably come to the same conclusion.
[00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:28.700]   We've tried to get rid of our guilt,
[00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:32.100]   but we realize we don't have the power,
[00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:35.000]   we don't have the authority to forgive ourselves
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.900]   or to release ourselves from our guilt,
[00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:40.300]   otherwise there would be no need for Jesus to die for us.
[00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:42.600]   But equally true, we've also, I think, realized
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:46.500]   that we cannot mitigate or lessen or get rid of our guilt
[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:49.400]   by just being more disciplined, more balanced,
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:52.500]   by our own effort and strength and willing
[00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:54.000]   that the guilt goes away.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.700]   And so Paul omits exactly the state we're in,
[00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:02.800]   he says, what a wretch, what a wretch we are.
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:06.400]   We are consumed and overwhelmed by this sin and guilt
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.000]   and who can rescue us?
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.500]   And so perhaps of just thinking about,
[00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:14.800]   well, how do I get rid of this guilt, Justin?
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.400]   I want us to maybe think about it
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.500]   as how do we work at our guilt?
[00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:21.100]   How do we take steps towards God where we say
[00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:22.500]   this is the guilt we have now,
[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:24.300]   Lord, can you help me deal with this?
[00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:27.200]   Walk with me, teach me how to let this go
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:30.300]   so I'm not led astray by my own guilt
[00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:32.900]   and all these feelings having to do with it.
[00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:37.500]   And so I think how we can respond is we start in Romans 8.1
[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:41.000]   and Paul says, there is therefore no condemnation
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.500]   to those who are in Christ Jesus.
[00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:46.700]   This scripture reminds us of the gospel once again
[00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:48.900]   that we are no longer condemned
[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:51.100]   because of what Jesus did on the cross.
[00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:52.600]   Because he died for us,
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:56.800]   he did something that we can never do for ourselves.
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.900]   And so that Jesus died the most gruesome
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:05.800]   and violent, unspeakable death as the only son of God
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:10.400]   in our place so that we can know what freedom from guilt is
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:14.700]   so that we can live on the resurrected side of the cross.
[00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:17.800]   And each time we confess our sins to God,
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:20.600]   he doesn't condemn us but he gives us the Holy Spirit
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:23.200]   and through the Holy Spirit, we are renewed,
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.300]   we are set free.
[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:27.900]   And so this sinful woman could approach Jesus
[00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:31.400]   because despite everything that she's done,
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:35.200]   all the shameful things that she does not want to say,
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:39.200]   she knew that she didn't have to hold up any excuses
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.900]   and that for all the guilt and shame,
[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:43.100]   she knew that Jesus would forgive her.
[00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:46.300]   And she came boldly because of that.
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:53.500]   And so church, I want to raise and propose a question
[00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:56.400]   that I think for the rest of our life, we should wrestle with
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:59.500]   that we should be aware and should be asking ourselves
[00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:00.400]   concerning guilt.
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.700]   And this question is super important
[00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:04.300]   because this question is,
[00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:07.400]   is the guilt that you feel right now
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.600]   a conviction of the Holy Spirit
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:12.900]   or is the guilt and the condemnation you feel
[00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:16.200]   something that the devil is causing you to feel on purpose?
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:19.200]   Because sometimes if we don't think about this,
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.600]   if we allot everything to God and what he's doing,
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.600]   when bad things happen, we think that this is God leading us
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.000]   because there's no other option.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.800]   But actually there is another option.
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.300]   There's another realities that we live in this world
[00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:33.800]   where Satan is the prince
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:37.300]   and that he does influence many things.
[00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:39.900]   And so we cannot be naive about this.
[00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:41.100]   We cannot be ignorant.
[00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:46.100]   And I think guilt is such a practical real entry point
[00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:49.700]   to understanding is God's truth and what he's saying.
[00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.500]   Do I believe that?
[00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:54.300]   Or will I allow myself to just be swept away
[00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:55.300]   by what the enemy is doing?
[00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:56.700]   He wants to keep us in the dark.
[00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:59.600]   He wants us to just continue to be condemned
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:01.300]   and live in darkness.
[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:05.300]   And so how do we discern this?
[00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:08.000]   Today I want to just propose one thing.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.800]   I want to invite you to allow the Spirit
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:16.300]   to open up your heart, open up my heart
[00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:18.600]   to show us what is true
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:21.100]   so that we can authentically seek change.
[00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:23.800]   Because in all these years, we've lived with our excuses.
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.900]   We've lived with sin.
[00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:27.800]   It's like living without an arm,
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.600]   living without a feet, living with this like ugly wound.
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.300]   This is how a lot of us have been living.
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:34.900]   But we don't have to live like this.
[00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.700]   And today I want to share the good news
[00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:41.500]   that perhaps guilt could be a gift of God to us
[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:43.100]   if we allow it.
[00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:44.800]   Because through guilt,
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.600]   we can journey into an awakened state
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.700]   where we realize I don't have to live in sin.
[00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:53.100]   I don't have to keep on giving excuses
[00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:56.500]   and to pretend that my life is perfect when it's not.
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:02.900]   And so guilt has the potential to bring us closer to God,
[00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:05.500]   to experience his kindness and his mercy.
[00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:09.300]   And guilt makes us aware of what we actually need
[00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:12.000]   to be forgiven for rather than what we think we need.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.300]   And finally, guilt is a gift that enables us
[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:20.700]   to know and experience God's so amazing grace
[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:22.700]   because he knows how much we need it.
[00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:28.300]   So now let me just tie everything together so far, okay?
[00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:33.300]   If I were to propose an idea that encapsulates
[00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:38.000]   how we can counter our sin, our excuses, our guilt
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.500]   in one practice that the church has been called to practice
[00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:43.800]   through the generations,
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:46.300]   it would be the practice of confession.
[00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:50.500]   And I'll be the first to admit that I think as a church,
[00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:52.900]   we don't talk about confession as much.
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:58.800]   I grew up with confession 'cause the people around me,
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:01.900]   we just knew the importance of it.
[00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:04.700]   And so I remember it and I want us to remember it.
[00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:06.800]   I want us to know about confession
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:08.800]   because it's a matter of life and death.
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:13.200]   You know, I don't know if you follow church news,
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:16.000]   but in recent years, there's just been so many scandals
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.100]   involving Christians, pastors, people we respect
[00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:21.500]   and followed for many years.
[00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:23.900]   And I just think, I was thinking this week that,
[00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:26.600]   you know, what if these pastors
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:29.400]   in the community practiced confession?
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.500]   Then maybe these churches and these communities
[00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:35.100]   could have mitigated just the chaos,
[00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:38.800]   the internal inside secret chaos that we all carry.
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:40.100]   We could have mitigated that
[00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:43.700]   and we could just avoid all these news scandals.
[00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.100]   And I want you to remember this verse.
[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:49.300]   I think this is one of those verses, once again,
[00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:50.800]   I've just committed to my memory.
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:52.600]   It's James 5, verse 16.
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:55.900]   And I want you to hear this in this context
[00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:57.300]   of what we're talking about.
[00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:01.400]   If you're serious about wanting to be free,
[00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:04.900]   wanting to be able to receive forgiveness
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:09.400]   and to be able to love again freely and unashamedly,
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:10.500]   then listen to James.
[00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:13.800]   James says, "Therefore, confess your sins to each other
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:17.800]   "and pray for one another so that you may be healed."
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:20.300]   See, confession is God's idea.
[00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:24.600]   Confession is God's way of not allowing the church
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:27.300]   to be sucked and destroyed by sin.
[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:31.500]   Confession is a way in which we can bring our sin,
[00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.200]   our guilt, whatever it is,
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.000]   that keeps us from being forgiven,
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.900]   that keeps us from God into the light
[00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:38.800]   so that there's no more excuses.
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:42.700]   And that we would, in confession,
[00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:46.500]   see things for what they really are and not be ashamed,
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:49.100]   but knowing that God forgives us.
[00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:54.000]   And so I think how James and how confession is practiced
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.600]   is that we are to go to one another
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:59.300]   because as brothers and sisters in Christ,
[00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:00.900]   we represent Christ to each other.
[00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:04.100]   We represent Christ and light and salt to the world, right?
[00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:07.200]   So in confession, we just go up to someone
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:11.200]   and we say, "Hey, I wanna be frank with you about my sin.
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:14.100]   I wanna be frank about my excuses.
[00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:16.200]   I wanna tell you how my shame and guilt
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.400]   has been at work in me."
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:21.800]   And James says, "We then, rather than just judge
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:25.000]   and just be in shock, we pray for another."
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.600]   And can I say what I'm about to say,
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.200]   this is what defines Christianity.
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.800]   When you confess and you pray for another
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:36.000]   and you know that God is in that conversation,
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.700]   the miraculous happens.
[00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:40.300]   You get freed, you experience God's grace
[00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:42.200]   and there's no theology.
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:45.800]   I don't have words to explain that moment.
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:48.100]   But all I can say is that as Christians,
[00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:51.300]   if we do not confess our sins, if we do not repent,
[00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:54.500]   if we do not ask for forgiveness, then we do not grow.
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:58.700]   Because forgiveness and asking for forgiveness,
[00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:03.000]   confession is a discipleship issue.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.600]   If Jesus says it's important,
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:07.600]   then I think we should take that a bit more seriously.
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:11.600]   (sips tea)
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:15.500]   I just want to maybe share a little bit.
[00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:19.900]   You know, I have three beautiful children,
[00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:22.200]   two are here right now.
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:25.200]   And I think since having these three children,
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:27.200]   I've learned something about myself.
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.400]   I've learned that I have road rage
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:30.800]   even when I'm not driving.
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:35.200]   And it sucks, it really is terrible, you know?
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:39.100]   And I think, unfortunately, fortunately,
[00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:41.900]   my wife, my helper, my three children
[00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:45.000]   are the ones that actually see this part of me.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.900]   And the hardest part, I think, every day, every week,
[00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:52.000]   every month is to have the courage to say sorry.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.600]   It's to have the courage to apologize
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:56.700]   for what I've done wrong.
[00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:58.900]   You know, of course, before I get to that point,
[00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:01.600]   there's a lot of excuses, there's a lot of excusing,
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:03.900]   there's a lot of guilt, a lot of just fantasizing,
[00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:07.500]   what if, you know, the first worst case scenario is
[00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:09.400]   what if my children don't forgive me?
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:13.400]   You know, but you know what causes me to do this,
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:14.900]   to ask for their forgiveness?
[00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:19.800]   It's that I cannot move on otherwise.
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:23.700]   I can't live my life, I cannot continue another day
[00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:25.700]   knowing that we are disconnected,
[00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:29.900]   knowing that my sin, my excusing, my guilt, my shame,
[00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:33.400]   my acting out is causing us to have,
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:35.600]   keeping us from having a good relationship,
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:36.900]   a healthy relationship.
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:40.000]   And so it's the possibility,
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.100]   even the slightest possibility of shalom,
[00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:46.600]   of reconciliation that I say, you know what, screw it,
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:49.600]   I'm gonna run to Christ, I'm gonna do this.
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:56.500]   I wanna quote what my wife said recently.
[00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:59.300]   It's just a truth bomb, she didn't realize she said this.
[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:01.000]   We were teaching marriage prep together
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.200]   and we were, week four, the last week,
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.800]   we talked about the importance of forgiveness
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:08.600]   and working out all our stuff.
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:10.400]   And she said this, she said,
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:15.400]   "Even if things are dead inside, forgiveness revives them."
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:20.100]   And I think you can replace forgiveness
[00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:22.800]   with repentance, confession, asking for forgiveness,
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.900]   extending forgiveness.
[00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:27.900]   And the reality is, just like the sinful woman,
[00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:29.100]   I want us to come back to her
[00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:33.800]   because she models what all of us need.
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.900]   We need an openness, a belief,
[00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:38.500]   a genuine belief that God will forgive us.
[00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:42.600]   And we need to know in faith that when we go,
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:46.000]   that he will free us and liberate us
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.800]   like nothing we've ever experienced.
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.600]   And this is the mystery of our Christian faith.
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.600]   This is the grace of our Christian faith.
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.300]   And this is why to this day,
[00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:57.000]   as hard as it is to be a Christian,
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.700]   I'm still a Christian because I've experienced
[00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:02.900]   God's grace coming through confession,
[00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:06.900]   through asking for forgiveness and being forgiven.
[00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:08.900]   I don't know if you can recall the last time
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:10.700]   you were forgiven for something.
[00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:12.700]   You know, that just sets you free.
[00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:14.300]   It causes, you're just lighter.
[00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:18.000]   And I know I said, I can't really explain in theology
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.800]   and words what that feeling is like, but let me try.
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.900]   So when you confess, when you ask for forgiveness,
[00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:24.700]   when someone forgives you,
[00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:26.900]   it is just the most surprising feeling.
[00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:28.300]   You're like, what?
[00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:29.100]   What?
[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:29.900]   What?
[00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:34.600]   And you experience this unconventional release and relief
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:37.100]   that you're like, wow,
[00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:39.400]   that you just cannot anticipate until it happens,
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:42.100]   until in that moment someone says you're forgiven,
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:44.100]   until you feel like the Spirit just released you
[00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:46.600]   of many years of guilt.
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:51.200]   And you will never regret this decision.
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.000]   To confess and to receive forgiveness
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.300]   is like having the pain of a toothache suddenly gone
[00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:59.800]   because the dentist has removed that tooth.
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:03.200]   And you feel that gap of openness.
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:06.000]   And when you eat ice cream, you feel the chilling numbness
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.600]   and you're so glad that it's not pain.
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.500]   It feels unfamiliar because this world tells us
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:14.500]   that you should not forgive.
[00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:17.700]   Eye for an eye, right?
[00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:20.200]   Our love, our relation is conditional.
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.500]   If you treat me well, I'll treat you well.
[00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:24.900]   But actually that is not what Jesus came to teach us.
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:27.800]   He taught us the very opposite.
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.100]   He said to take a risk.
[00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:31.500]   He says to trust me, to lean into me,
[00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:35.400]   and I will teach you how to live this life
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:42.600]   with a yoke that is light, that is not burdensome.
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:44.400]   And so I just pray, church,
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:47.000]   that you would be willing to give this a try
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.800]   because if you do not,
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:53.900]   we lose out on an opportunity of growth.
[00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:59.400]   Worship team, can I invite you up?
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:02.300]   I want to conclude, church, to remind us
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:05.000]   that the journey of forgiveness,
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.700]   the journey of the Christian faith,
[00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:10.500]   it is a long journey.
[00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:11.700]   It is an ongoing journey.
[00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:13.700]   It is actually a marathon.
[00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:17.100]   But what keeps us running is that whenever we fall,
[00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:18.800]   whenever we get tired,
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:21.100]   whenever we need some kind of encouragement,
[00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:25.500]   Christ meets us through the church.
[00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:28.300]   And therefore we can get healing.
[00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:29.900]   We can ask for forgiveness.
[00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:31.100]   We can be encouraged.
[00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:32.600]   The Spirit fills us up.
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:36.400]   The Word of God encourage us, and we keep on going.
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.600]   And so, church, I, you know,
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:41.100]   sometimes I think, well, what do I want to do with my life?
[00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:44.000]   My simple answer is I just want to finish well.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.300]   I want to be faithful to Jesus.
[00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:49.600]   I want to serve the church as I can.
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:51.200]   But I want to be faithful.
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:53.000]   And so, church, I want to remind us
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.400]   that if you are serious about being a Christian,
[00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:57.200]   then just, you have to be patient,
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:58.400]   as God is patient to us,
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:01.900]   because growth and clarity comes in time.
[00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:04.300]   It doesn't come right away.
[00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:07.800]   And, church, I just, lastly, just want us to remember
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:10.800]   the difference of the sinful woman and Simon the Pharisee
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:13.400]   and how they responded.
[00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:18.300]   Because the woman was able to accept her sinful life.
[00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:21.000]   She was able to repent, and as a result,
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.900]   she was just set free.
[00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:24.700]   She was so grateful that she was forgiven
[00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:27.400]   that she decided that wherever Jesus is,
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:28.800]   I'm going to be there.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:29.900]   I'm going to anoint his feet.
[00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:30.600]   I'm going to weep.
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:31.500]   I'm going to worship him.
[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:34.200]   I'm going to give the best of what I have to Jesus
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:38.900]   because she is so grateful.
[00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:40.000]   And therefore, she can love.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.600]   Now, Simon, I think at that point in this story,
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:45.300]   he remained in a bit of darkness.
[00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:49.100]   He wasn't fully able to live the life fully
[00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:53.200]   because maybe, perhaps, of his understanding of his sin,
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:58.700]   and he didn't understand how much God yearns to forgive him.
[00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:04.700]   And so I pray, church, I want to ask you to stand.
[00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:07.800]   I'm going to come back to that prayer I shared with you.
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:11.500]   My only prayer for you today, this afternoon,
[00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:15.600]   is that you would have courage to come to Jesus this afternoon,
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:18.000]   just like this woman,
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.400]   that you would seek to be released and forgiven from your sin,
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:26.700]   that you can just say, "Lord, I don't have any more excuses.
[00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:31.600]   I don't need excuses because I'm with you."
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:34.500]   And would you say, "Lord, Holy Spirit,
[00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:39.900]   would you help me to work at this guilt by confession?
[00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:45.100]   Would you help me to just lighten this load I've been carrying?
[00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:48.600]   Would you give me an opportunity to say sorry,
[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:52.800]   to rectify, to go to someone who I've hurt,
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:58.400]   and just start this conversation of reconciliation?"
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:03.600]   Whatever it is, church, I just want to invite you and to imagine.
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:12.200]   I want you to just imagine the Jesus that this woman poured her tears upon,
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:15.100]   this Jesus that no longer condemns her,
[00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:23.000]   this Jesus that set her free and said, "Go and live this new life."
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.900]   I want you to come to this Jesus this afternoon.
[00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:32.800]   I want you to consider just that one thing the Spirit is showing you right now,
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:40.400]   so that you can just say, "Lord, help me to see this from your perspective."
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:45.900]   Or maybe some of us, we just need to respond in adoration today
[00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:51.600]   because you recognize how much you've been forgiven.
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:53.700]   And so, church, would you go out and encourage?
[00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:56.000]   Would you worship with your heart?
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   Would you continue just to be steadfast and say, "I'm in it to win this marathon"?
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.100]   So, Jesus, would you walk and run with us, we pray?
[00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:09.000]   Amen. Let's worship, church.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   [Music]
