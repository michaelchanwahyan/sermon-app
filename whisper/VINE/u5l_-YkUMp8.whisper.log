[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080]   When she was talking about having passion and all of that,
[00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.240]   I really admire her passion for workout as well.
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.200]   She loves exercise and she would, you know, go on workouts.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.840]   While I struggle to go on workout once every three months,
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.520]   I join the gym next door.
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.200]   But I have promised myself that I will go after VBS.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.440]   And then my next statement was,
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.080]   I'll go after I preach this Sunday.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.280]   Hopefully tomorrow I'll bring you good news that I will go.
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.120]   Right?
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.920]   I don't have the motivation to get changed into my work
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.320]   workout clothes.
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.600]   And I really need that empowerment,
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.520]   that motivation, as you can say.
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.040]   And I think that when I,
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.240]   and reminds me of my younger days,
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.680]   when I was studying in university,
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.800]   I joined a Christian choir and it was one of the wildest
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.680]   thing I've ever done up to that point in my life.
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.680]   And you go, Christian choir?
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.640]   Wild?
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.000]   How they go together?
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.960]   But if you mix in a bunch of 20 year olds,
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.600]   it's a whole different story.
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.520]   There was this year when I first joined the committee
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.120]   of that Christian choir,
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.680]   and I was tasked to do a musical for,
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.240]   not only for that university,
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.400]   I was in Baptist university, right?
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.000]   Not only for the university Baptist choir,
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.200]   we had to join another university's Christian choir
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.920]   to do something together, to put on a musical together.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.280]   Well, doing a musical on its own is really hard
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.000]   because all the garments, all the props,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.680]   look at this, all the choreography, everything.
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.320]   You can actually see me there,
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.680]   but I hope that you don't see me
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.200]   'cause I look really different.
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.560]   Everything, you have to do it from scratch.
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.040]   And not only that, I have to work with another university.
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.640]   What about the scheduling?
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.000]   What about the cohesion, you know,
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.160]   the communication between the two conductors?
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.360]   What are the dynamics like?
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.960]   And if you still think this is still tame, listen,
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.720]   I have to do this without WhatsApp.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.440]   There's no WhatsApp group, there's no AI, there's nothing.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.200]   Okay, so I often tell my K4C class, I'm really old,
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.360]   I'm like 84, because I remember the first year
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.360]   I was in university, I'm really embarrassed to say this,
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.080]   I have to hand in my homework through a floppy disk.
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.400]   For those of you that don't know what a floppy disk is,
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.400]   it is that little icon on the Word document
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.600]   where you wanna push save,
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.720]   and you see this weird square, right?
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.360]   That weird square was a floppy disk.
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.760]   It was from the ancient day, and I have to,
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.800]   you can only save around two to three documents
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.200]   in a floppy disk.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.560]   So it was really fun.
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.400]   It was fun to have, you know,
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.560]   a production using just word of mouth,
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.920]   just call, just trust that person.
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.480]   When I schedule something, you will be there.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.200]   I couldn't double confirm you through my WhatsApp, right?
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.520]   If you don't show up, I don't know how to contact you.
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.800]   And I so vividly remember how overwhelmed I was
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.280]   when in the meeting,
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.160]   when I was tasked with this responsibility.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.120]   How could I possibly handle everything?
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.040]   It was my first time being in a committee member,
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.360]   and now you're telling me that I need to run
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.120]   this whole thing.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.000]   They have chosen the wrong person.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.280]   They have made a huge mistake.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.440]   But that's the thing.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.640]   Jesus gives every one of his volunteer a task
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.880]   that can feel just like that daunting sometimes.
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.040]   In Acts 1.8, right before Jesus ascended to heaven,
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.840]   Jesus said, "You will receive power
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.480]   "when the Holy Spirit come on you,
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.440]   "and you will be my witness in Jerusalem,
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.480]   "and in all Judea and Samaria,
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.000]   "and to the ends of the world."
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.520]   Can you imagine how overwhelming it is
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.480]   for the first disciples?
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.640]   The small, ordinary group of men and women
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.000]   were told to bring the message of Jesus to the whole world.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.840]   No social media, no microphones, no Bible app,
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.840]   just their voices, their stories,
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.480]   and the promise of God's power.
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.640]   And honestly, that could feel overwhelming for us too.
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.640]   For many of us, it's not easy or natural
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.080]   to talk about our faith,
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.320]   especially with people close to us.
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.480]   Maybe you feel nervous to bring up Jesus in your family
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.800]   because you don't wanna cause tension
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.680]   or to be misunderstood.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.240]   Maybe you feel awkward sharing your faith with friends,
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.960]   worrying that what they will think about you,
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.400]   maybe they think that you're very pushy, maybe at work.
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.040]   You wonder if it's even possible or wise
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.680]   to share what you believe.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.800]   Our series of Uncharted
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.520]   led us to examine the unchartedness of our early churches
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.200]   and the season our church is in.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.880]   Just like those first believers,
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.440]   we are finding ourselves stepping into territory
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.400]   we have never been before,
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.800]   facing new challenges, new opportunities,
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.560]   and sometimes new fears.
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.000]   The early churches didn't have a step-by-step manual
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.040]   for what to do next.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.720]   They were called to trust God
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.640]   and they have to follow the Spirit's leading
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.080]   and to share the message of Jesus in places and ways
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.160]   that was unfamiliar and even risky.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.480]   In the same way as a church family,
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.640]   we are navigating our own uncharted waters.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.000]   Maybe we're starting a new ministry,
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.400]   reaching out to new people,
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.360]   or simply learning to trust God in our journey.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.160]   In situations where we feel uncertain or overwhelming,
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.280]   just like the early disciples,
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.840]   we might feel small, unprepared,
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.880]   unsure of how to move forward.
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.400]   But the good news is we are not alone.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.440]   In the first week, our elder Deborah shared with us
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.320]   about what it means to wait in active faith.
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.520]   Waiting isn't just about sitting around doing nothing.
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.720]   It's a posture of hope and expectation.
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.240]   The early believers didn't wait passively.
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.800]   They trusted in Jesus' promise and the Holy Spirit
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.480]   and their waiting was filled with purpose.
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.400]   And then last week,
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.680]   Pastor John spoke about what it means to,
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.960]   to remember the word, receive, thank you,
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.760]   to what it means to receive.
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.080]   The waiting was finally over.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.960]   Through Christ, God sent us the Holy Spirit,
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.560]   not just to gather in the upper room,
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.920]   but as a gift for everyone,
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.280]   men and women, young and old,
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.440]   people from every nation.
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.240]   It's a gift for all.
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.240]   And today, we're gonna talk about what it means
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.840]   to be empowered by the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.560]   As the theologian, Gordon Fee, has said,
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.800]   "The gift of the Spirit is not given
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.600]   "so that believers may enjoy
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.560]   "a private spiritual experience,
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.200]   "but so that they may participate
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.600]   "in the life and mission of the church
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.200]   "as the new people of God."
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.120]   There is a purpose and mission behind this gift.
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.720]   There is a purpose and mission behind this gift.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.120]   The Holy Spirit empowers us
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:18.080]   for what God is calling us to do.
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.600]   We're not left alone to face this daunting task.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.080]   We are empowered together by the Spirit
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.600]   to live out God's mission in the world.
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.600]   But what is our mission?
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.880]   As Acts 1.8 says, before Jesus ascended to heaven,
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:39.320]   He said, "You will, we will be His witness in Jerusalem
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.320]   "and in all Judea and Samaria,
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.640]   "and to the ends of the world."
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.080]   It was clear that the mission to the disciples
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.400]   was to be Christ's witnesses,
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.800]   not just in Jerusalem, but till the end of the world.
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.840]   But this mission wasn't just for them back then.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.040]   It was for us too.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.280]   We are called to be Christ's witness today
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.600]   in our home, in our workplaces.
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.520]   But what is a mission?
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.240]   What does being a witness mean?
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.400]   When I was younger, I attended a local church
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.040]   where every few months, all the community groups,
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:18.080]   everyone would go out to hand out gospel tracts.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.840]   Do you know what are gospel tracts?
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.200]   There they are.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:26.680]   They are small pamphlets that explain what the gospel is,
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.520]   usually with a simple story.
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.640]   It's very in your face, right?
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:32.920]   They explain what the gospel is,
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.520]   usually with a short story or Bible verse.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.440]   We would stand around the parks and bus stops
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.240]   and wait for people.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.440]   Imagine that you were given out a bunch of these
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.920]   and you have to stand around bus stops.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.720]   And then when the people get off the bus
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.320]   from work or whatever, we have to go,
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.480]   "Hi, I'm June.
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.760]   "I'm one of the Christians around this area.
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.880]   "Have you heard of Jesus yet?"
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.880]   That, to an introvert, is so cringey
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.240]   that every time they made me go,
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.720]   I'll be like, "I don't feel well today.
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.240]   "I cannot go today.
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.680]   "This is going to be so cringey
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.840]   "if I have to walk up to someone sitting,
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.800]   "enjoying their sunny afternoon."
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.040]   And I go, "Hi."
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.800]   So creepy.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.640]   But when I told my pastors back then,
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.280]   she would say, "Oh, but you should not be ashamed
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.160]   "of the gospel.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.240]   "You need to be the witness."
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.120]   Is that what being a witness is?
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.080]   I wonder at that time.
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.360]   Later, during my university years,
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.440]   the pressure looked a little different.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.960]   Remember, I was organizing the musical in my second year?
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:42.400]   I was also motivated by my peers,
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.040]   not by my parents, by my classmates,
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.560]   to have a high GPA.
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.880]   That means like the annual average score
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.400]   for that year, right?
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.000]   And because that is the way to be a good witness
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   to my friends and family.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.720]   Do you know what my GPA was
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.920]   in the first year, first semester?
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.520]   Generally, people get 3.5
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.440]   because it is the easiest semester
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.400]   and everyone wants to get a high one
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.040]   so that by the end of the third year,
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.160]   they have something to sit on, right?
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.320]   Everyone gets around 3.5 or something.
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.760]   I also got a three.
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.160]   I got a 2.3.
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.200]   That was really, really bad.
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.800]   Honestly, and so,
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.840]   but the pressure motivates me.
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.640]   Not only the pressure motivates me,
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.880]   I actually have a friend, my classmate,
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.800]   who's also my dormitory flatmate.
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.680]   She would get up at five o'clock
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.280]   in the morning to study.
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.200]   As a university student,
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.560]   I didn't get up at five.
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.960]   I tried to, but that motivate me.
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.520]   So actually, I raised my GPA
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.960]   from 2.3 to 3.1.
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.160]   And over that time,
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.360]   I realized that I was reducing
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.760]   to being a witness,
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.080]   to just having good behaviors
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:58.160]   or impressive achievements.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.320]   That mindset brought a lot of pressure.
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.640]   I felt like I constantly had to live up
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.840]   to some perfect Christian standards.
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.600]   And when I inevitably fall short,
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:12.560]   it left me with a sense of shame and guilt.
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.520]   But the most difficult place to be a witness,
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.720]   for me, has always been at home.
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.880]   My parents, more than anyone, know my flaws.
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:25.560]   My laziness, my procrastination,
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.440]   and those rebellious moments.
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.240]   Trying to be witness in my own family
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.040]   has often felt impossible
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.960]   because they see the real me
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.880]   and not the church me.
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.480]   If I'm honest,
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.080]   sharing my faith at home
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.480]   is the most difficult.
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:46.000]   So what is being a witness?
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.360]   In the ancient world,
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.720]   a herald was a messenger
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.640]   sent from the battlefield.
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.760]   Imagine a city full of anxious people
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.560]   waiting to hear who had won the war.
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:00.160]   And then the herald finally arrived
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.840]   and shouted the good news,
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:04.280]   the victory, to these people
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:05.600]   and everything changed.
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.720]   The whole city rejoiced.
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.240]   The future looked different.
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.040]   The Greek word for this word,
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.200]   this joyful announcement,
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.240]   is called euangelion.
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.240]   The same word we use for gospel
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.320]   or the good news.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.640]   This is the picture
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.600]   that the first Christian used
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.160]   when they talked about Jesus.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.200]   They believed that through his death
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.480]   and resurrection,
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.320]   Jesus had already won
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.640]   the ultimate victory
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.360]   over sin, death, and evil.
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.600]   The victory is real.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.120]   It has already happened.
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.480]   But just like history,
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.400]   imagine World War II, right?
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:43.840]   For example,
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.920]   even after the enemy
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.280]   was defeated in their homeland,
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.720]   many places still lived under occupation.
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.200]   The news of the victory has arrived,
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.000]   but the effects hadn't reached
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.600]   every corner yet.
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.200]   People in those places
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.320]   lived in the in-betweens.
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.320]   They knew victory was won,
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.680]   but the old powers
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:08.040]   were still in the present for a time.
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.000]   And that's the world we live in.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.520]   That's the world we live in.
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.000]   We've heard the good news
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.080]   that Jesus has won,
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:18.120]   but we still live and experience pain,
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.280]   suffering, and injustice.
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.080]   The effects of his victory
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:25.120]   are not fully here yet.
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.920]   We live in this tension,
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:30.480]   this already but not yet tension.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.960]   So what does it mean
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.200]   to be a witness in Christ?
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.000]   It means being like the herald
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.320]   who brings the news of victory.
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.760]   It means living, speaking,
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.640]   and making choices in ways
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.000]   that show people
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.920]   Jesus has already won.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.040]   Even while we wait for the fullness
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.920]   of his victory to come,
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.680]   our lives become signals to the world
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:55.680]   that a new reality has begun.
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.720]   Even in a world that hasn't yet seen
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.680]   the final peace,
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.240]   we live as a people
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:04.960]   who know that the outcome is secure.
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.840]   And how can we do something
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:09.280]   that seems impossible?
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.840]   That seems impossible, right?
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.640]   We are living in this injustice.
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:15.880]   We're experiencing pain and suffering,
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.760]   and we have to show people that,
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.080]   no, the victory is done.
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:22.040]   We are set free from our sin.
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.880]   We are set free from our pain.
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.960]   There can be justice in this place,
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.840]   but I don't see it yet.
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.560]   Nor my friends have seen it yet,
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.440]   but I have to live and speak
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.360]   and make decisions and choose
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.400]   as if the final victory
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.480]   is here already.
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.640]   How can we do something
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.800]   that seems near impossible?
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.040]   But before the commission,
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:50.080]   there was the promise.
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.000]   You will receive power
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.280]   when the Holy Spirit comes on you.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.640]   You will receive power.
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.080]   We are empowered by the Holy Spirit
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.680]   to live out this command.
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:01.800]   We're not doing this
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.320]   out of our own strength,
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.240]   nor we should be.
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.520]   We have access to the Holy Spirit,
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.040]   who is our ever-present help.
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:13.000]   We are empowered.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.040]   Peter's life and his sermon
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.360]   after Pentecost is a demonstration
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.800]   of how the Spirit empowers us
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.520]   for this mission.
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.800]   Just look at, can you recall
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.200]   some of what Peter has gone through
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.280]   before the Pentecost,
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:27.960]   before Jesus died?
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.480]   He boldly walked on water
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:30.560]   for a moment,
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.280]   and then sank in fear.
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.360]   He tried to defend Jesus
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.320]   by cutting off soldiers' ear,
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.160]   acting impulsively.
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.800]   Most painfully,
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:41.960]   he denied even knowing Jesus
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.800]   three times.
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.880]   In all of these moments,
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.040]   Peter's action was driven
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.160]   by what you called
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.800]   self-reliance zeal.
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.480]   This means that he was relying
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.800]   mostly on his own energy,
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:00.360]   his own ideas of what should be done,
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.800]   and his own desire
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:04.640]   to prove his loyalty to Jesus.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.920]   It was courage fueled
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:08.720]   by his own effort,
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.080]   by trying harder,
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:11.240]   by pushing forward,
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.840]   by reacting in the moment.
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:16.600]   But no matter how sincere he was,
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.000]   it wasn't enough.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.240]   His courage kept running out
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.640]   when the pressure was on.
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.320]   Peter was passionate.
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.160]   He wanted to be faithful,
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.440]   but over and over again,
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.760]   he found himself falling short,
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.840]   sinking, falling,
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.480]   acting out of fear or confusion.
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.480]   He was just like us,
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.320]   full of good intention,
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.320]   but often lacking the strength
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:44.040]   to follow through.
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:46.120]   Don't know if you've ever felt that way.
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.880]   We wanted to do something good
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:50.160]   for people, to serve them,
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.800]   but accidentally,
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.200]   not of our own choosing.
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.960]   We hurt them by forcing our thoughts
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.440]   and ideas over them,
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.640]   by questioning them too hard.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.720]   That was absolutely me.
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:03.880]   When I was younger,
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.400]   in my university year,
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.040]   I had a friend who is like Eeyore
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.880]   in Winnie the Pooh.
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.040]   I know, I know.
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.000]   I feel so sorry for him too.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.480]   Like, he is a Christian.
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:17.760]   We have been together in the church
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:18.960]   for many years,
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.160]   and he would come and say,
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.480]   "Hi."
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:23.800]   And I go,
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:24.520]   "What do you like?
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.600]   You know, you don't have to."
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:28.520]   Also, he served in church a lot.
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.840]   He is in the production team.
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.520]   He also lead worship.
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:34.200]   He also do a lot of stuff,
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.000]   but he just felt so broken
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.960]   and so tired all the time,
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.400]   and nothing brings him joy.
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.120]   In my heart, I really want him
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.520]   to be joyful.
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.040]   I believe that as you're a Christian,
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:45.760]   you should be,
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.160]   you can be joyful.
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.360]   This is the life that Jesus
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.280]   has given to us.
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.960]   That was my intention.
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.560]   But at the end of the day,
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.440]   he go, "June, can you not ask me
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.680]   any more questions?
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.080]   Can you just stay away from me
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:58.760]   for a while?
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.440]   You are pushing me too hard."
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.880]   And I realized that no matter
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.760]   how good my intention is,
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:07.280]   I was hurting him.
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:08.800]   I was pushing my idea
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.840]   of what a Christian look like
[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.760]   onto him.
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.160]   It was good intention,
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.760]   but falling short.
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.000]   But then we see Peter
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.400]   after Pentecost.
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.640]   In Acts 2.25,
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.640]   we see that Peter was not alone.
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:28.320]   He was filled with the Holy Spirit.
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:29.560]   Peter stands in front
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:30.800]   of a huge crowd
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.240]   and preached by citing Psalm 16.
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.040]   He says,
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.600]   "David said about him,
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.800]   'I saw the Lord was always
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:38.720]   before me,
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.920]   because he is at my right hand.
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:42.680]   I will not be shaken.
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.160]   Therefore, my heart is glad
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.440]   and my tongue rejoices.
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.560]   My body will also rest in hope,
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.200]   because you will not abandon me
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.760]   to the realm of the dead.
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.640]   You will not let your Holy One
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.320]   see decay.'"
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.640]   Here is what Peter is doing.
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.840]   He's looking back at what
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:00.600]   King David wrote in the Psalms,
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.280]   and he realized David
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.920]   wasn't just talking about himself.
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.160]   David was pointing forward
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:09.080]   to someone greater,
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:10.920]   the true Holy One,
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.440]   who would not stay dead,
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.280]   who would rise again.
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.160]   Peter saw that Jesus
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.560]   is the only one that truly fits
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.920]   what David describes.
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:22.880]   Jesus is the Holy One
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.640]   who died but did not see decay,
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.240]   because God raised him
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.960]   from the dead.
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.600]   Peter's sermon at Pentecost
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.240]   wasn't about condemning
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.680]   or passing judgment,
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:34.680]   telling them off that,
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:35.520]   "You should have known
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.120]   the Bible said so clearly."
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.480]   He wasn't judging them
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.960]   for not knowing.
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.680]   No, Peter was one of them.
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:45.080]   He was a Jew who had grown up
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.240]   with the same hopes
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:47.600]   and same dreams,
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:49.000]   waiting for God's promise
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.960]   to be fulfilled.
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.520]   Just like everyone who listens
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.760]   to him that day,
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.320]   Peter had wondered,
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.720]   "When will the Messiah come?
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.240]   Who is going to fulfill
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.640]   all that God promised
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.120]   to King David?"
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:03.480]   His heart was full
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.240]   of the same longing,
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.760]   the same question
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:09.480]   as the people gathered around him.
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:10.680]   But now,
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.960]   filled with the Holy Spirit,
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.680]   Peter boldly announces
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.480]   that the answer to those hopes
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:19.240]   and those dreams is Jesus,
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:20.000]   the Son of God,
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.760]   the true descendant of David,
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.560]   and the long-awaited Messiah.
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:25.720]   Peter's message
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:28.120]   was deeply personal.
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.640]   He wasn't delivering
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.560]   cold theology.
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:32.920]   He was sharing
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:33.720]   the fulfillment
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:36.840]   of his people's greatest hope.
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.720]   He stood not as an outsider,
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.280]   but a fellow seeker
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.360]   whose eyes had been opened
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:46.160]   by God's grace.
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:46.960]   This is what it means
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.480]   to be a witness.
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:49.600]   To be a witness
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.080]   is not simply to declare facts
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:54.360]   or argue people into believing.
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:56.160]   It is much more than that.
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:57.360]   Being a witness,
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.680]   as Peter shows us,
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:00.640]   means stepping into the world
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.680]   of the people we are speaking to,
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.240]   understanding their fears,
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.200]   their hopes,
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.440]   and their deepest question.
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.640]   It means that allowing
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.520]   the Holy Spirit to fill us
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.280]   so that our words come out
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:15.200]   not from pride or distance,
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.320]   but from genuine compassion
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:20.080]   and shared humanity.
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.280]   For us today,
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.720]   being witness of Jesus
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.680]   is more than just sharing a message.
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.120]   It is about living it out.
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.120]   It looks like really listening
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.680]   to the people around us,
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:31.840]   our friends, our colleagues,
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.040]   our classmates,
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.040]   getting to know their stories
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:36.320]   and looking for ways
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:37.600]   to connect them,
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.760]   their questions and struggles
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:43.040]   to the hope we have found in Jesus.
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:45.480]   It is living with humility
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:46.920]   and being real.
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.200]   It's not about acting
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.120]   as we have got it all together
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.680]   or that we're better than others
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:52.920]   so that we can tell you
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:55.200]   about who Jesus is,
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.960]   but being honest
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:00.360]   as people who have found hope
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.320]   and healing in Jesus
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:05.760]   and want to share that with others.
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.520]   Peter was not alone.
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:10.320]   The Holy Spirit empowered Peter
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:13.000]   to see the hearts of the people,
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.400]   to see the hearts of what the people need
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.920]   so that he could give them
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.880]   the hope that they need.
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.760]   We are empowered by the Holy Spirit
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.240]   to do the same.
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:26.120]   When our colleagues annoyed us,
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:27.480]   you have a colleague in mind,
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:29.200]   when our colleagues annoyed us,
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.800]   instead of our usual frustration,
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.280]   we're empowered by the Holy Spirit
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:35.960]   to understand.
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.680]   It doesn't mean that we have to go suffer
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.000]   and go, "Yeah, you annoyed us.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   Let me just suffer."
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.160]   But we are empowered
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.720]   by the Holy Spirit to understand.
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:44.960]   When our friends shared
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.400]   about their problems,
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.520]   we are empowered by the Holy Spirit
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:50.360]   to direct them to the hope
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:53.040]   that Jesus has for him or her.
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.280]   What is really amazing about Peter
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.440]   is that he was just
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.280]   an ordinary fisherman.
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:22:59.360]   He wasn't known for being
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:00.480]   a great speaker.
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.520]   In fact, before Pentecost,
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.640]   Peter was often impulsive.
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:05.920]   He made a lot of mistakes,
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.920]   and sometimes he was even scared
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:10.040]   to admit that he knew Jesus.
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:13.000]   But once the Holy Spirit came,
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.640]   everything changed.
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:16.480]   The same is true for us.
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:19.080]   We may feel inadequate, unqualified,
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:21.200]   or unsure of what to say.
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:24.280]   Yet, this is not in our own strength
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:26.400]   or eloquence that matters.
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.560]   Whether we are making
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:29.360]   godly decisions at work,
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:30.760]   befriending someone who feels
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:32.080]   left out at school,
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:34.200]   or choosing to communicate
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:37.680]   with love and patience at home,
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:41.320]   these are all visible expressions
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:43.280]   of our inner conviction
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:45.920]   that Jesus reigns.
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.760]   Each act of faith,
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.440]   each moment of kindness,
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.560]   reflects our trust
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:54.600]   that Jesus has already won
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.200]   and victory over sin
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.000]   and that by His Spirit,
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.480]   we can live differently.
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.840]   It is not out of our own strength
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:04.320]   that we can go and force
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.560]   ourselves to be kind
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:08.000]   and force ourselves to do more.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   It is the Holy Spirit
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.080]   that is with us
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.200]   so that we're able to understand
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.720]   and we want to choose
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.120]   to live differently
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.960]   because we are empowered
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:20.120]   by the Holy Spirit.
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.720]   Moreover, Peter's courage
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.480]   wasn't something he drummed up
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.160]   from within himself.
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:28.400]   He didn't suddenly become eloquent
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.840]   because he tried harder
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:31.200]   or studied more.
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:34.000]   Instead, the Spirit filled him,
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.200]   gave him the words,
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.880]   and gave him the insight
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.200]   from God's Word.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.360]   So much so that when he spoke,
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.360]   his message could cut straight
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:45.040]   to the hearts of the listener.
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.160]   The Spirit empowered Peter
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:50.440]   to be bold through his revelation
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.560]   in his word.
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:55.280]   Look at Acts 2, 22-23.
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.720]   Fellow Israelites, listen to this.
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.680]   Jesus of Nazareth
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.680]   was a man accredited by God
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.960]   to you by miracles,
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.600]   wonders, and signs,
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:07.880]   which God did among you through him.
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:09.120]   As you yourself know,
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:11.080]   this man was handed over to you
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.080]   by God's deliberate plan
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:14.480]   and foreknowledge,
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:17.120]   and you, with the help of wicked men,
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:18.120]   put him to death
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:21.520]   by nailing him to the cross.
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:22.760]   In just a few words,
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:25.840]   Peter brings together two big truths
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.240]   about the cross,
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:29.720]   truths that are both comforting
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:31.480]   and challenging.
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.560]   First, Peter wants everyone to know
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:36.160]   that Jesus' death was not a plan B.
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:38.120]   It was not an accident.
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.160]   The cross, like things,
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.640]   it's not like things got out of control
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.920]   or maybe it's God's original plan backfired
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.640]   so he had to come up with a backup.
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.240]   No, it may look that way,
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.080]   may look that way,
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:54.120]   especially when you see Jesus being betrayed,
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.680]   arrested, and nailed to a cross.
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:57.880]   From the outside,
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:00.560]   it might seem like everything went wrong,
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:04.120]   like evil and chaos won that day.
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:05.880]   But Peter made it clear,
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.440]   this was never plan B.
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:11.400]   Jesus' death was not a surprise to God
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.760]   or a mistake in the story.
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:16.760]   Peter says Jesus was handed over
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:19.040]   by God's deliberate plan
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.560]   and foreknowledge.
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.920]   That means God already know exactly
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:26.160]   what he was doing all along.
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:29.800]   The cross wasn't God's scrambling fix to a problem.
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.600]   It was always the plan to save us.
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.320]   What looked like the defeat
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:38.520]   was actually God working out his greatest victory,
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:40.280]   even in the darkest moment.
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.880]   God was in control,
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:46.000]   turning the very thing that would have,
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.440]   turning it into the very thing
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.360]   that would have rescued us.
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.760]   But Peter wouldn't let the crowd off the hook.
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:53.040]   He said, "And you,
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.960]   "with the help of the wicked man,
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.400]   "put him to death."
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.680]   So yes, it was God's plan,
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.400]   but it was also human sin
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.160]   that nailed Jesus to the cross.
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:07.440]   It was jealousy, fear,
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.760]   rejection that led to his crucifixion.
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.440]   The religious leaders schemed,
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.680]   the crowd shouted,
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:16.000]   the Roman soldiers carried it out.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.600]   And yet, even though God used their actions for good,
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:22.120]   they were still responsible for what they did.
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:26.120]   God's plan doesn't excuse our guilt.
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:29.640]   God's sovereignty and our responsibility go hand in hand,
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.760]   and we can't always explain how that works,
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:34.560]   but both are true.
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:37.440]   Now, here's where the Holy Spirit comes in.
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.080]   As Peter is preaching,
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:43.840]   it is not just a history lesson or theology lecture.
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.040]   The Holy Spirit is at work.
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:48.200]   His empowerment is at work,
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.560]   taking those words and pressing them
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:52.760]   right into people's hearts.
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:54.960]   In Acts 2, 37, it says,
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.840]   "When the people heard this,
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:00.640]   "they were cut to the heart."
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:04.640]   It was not just about knowing it was my responsibility.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:07.560]   It was something that actually were impressed in their heart,
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:11.240]   and they felt for it, they felt about it.
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:12.760]   They have a feeling to it,
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:14.280]   and that's what the Spirit does.
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:17.560]   He brings clarity into,
[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:19.480]   clarity about who Jesus is,
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:23.480]   and conviction about where we stand with God.
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.200]   It's like the lights come on,
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.360]   and suddenly it's personal.
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:30.760]   The crowd didn't just understand the message,
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:31.880]   they felt it.
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:35.640]   They realized that the need for Jesus,
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:39.480]   and cried out, "Brothers, what shall we do?"
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:45.160]   It was this moment of the Holy Spirit in you
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.280]   that brings clarity into our heart.
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:49.880]   And when we sit, and when we are reading the Bible,
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:53.160]   when we are praying, when we are interacting with people,
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.960]   when we are listening in the sermon,
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:59.440]   the Holy Spirit is in work, in us,
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.520]   bringing us conviction,
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:04.880]   and we shout to God, "Oh no, I've sinned against you.
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:07.400]   "What shall we do?"
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:10.640]   When you think back to the moment
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:14.120]   you first put up your hand to receive Jesus,
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.080]   or the time you felt deeply
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:19.240]   that something in your life needed to change,
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:22.800]   that wasn't your reasoning or your emotions at work.
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.480]   It was the Holy Spirit inside you,
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:29.120]   moving you, bringing conviction into your heart.
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:32.800]   It's not a conviction to shame you or to guilt you,
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:36.560]   as if you're letting God down if you don't get it right.
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:38.920]   Rather, it is a conviction
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:42.760]   that wakes you up to the reality of God's love
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:46.200]   and beauty of what Jesus has done for you.
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:52.440]   The Spirit doesn't just simply point out what's wrong.
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:56.560]   He draws us towards what is right.
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:59.840]   He opens our eyes to see Jesus more clearly,
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:03.160]   and moves us to turn away from old patterns
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:06.080]   and step into a new way of living.
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:10.680]   This is conviction that comes not from fear or punishment,
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:11.800]   but from hope.
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:18.000]   Hope that change is possible, that forgiveness is real,
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.960]   and that Jesus welcomes us into this new life.
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:27.880]   So when you feel this gentle nudge to turn from old habits,
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:31.960]   to embrace something new that God is calling you to,
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:35.280]   recognize that it is the Spirit's loving work,
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:39.480]   drawing you closer to Jesus and making you more like Him,
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.400]   not by your own strength,
[00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:44.760]   but by His empowering presence within you.
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:47.600]   We are not left alone.
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:50.480]   We are not left alone.
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:54.240]   The Holy Spirit empowers us to be witnesses,
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:57.320]   not in extraordinary moments,
[00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:00.840]   but in the ordinary, everyday rhythm of life.
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:06.040]   This is what makes our witness undeniable.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:10.320]   It is not about having it all together,
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:13.080]   but about letting the reality of Jesus
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:16.640]   shine through our real transformed lives.
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:20.640]   The world can't ignore a life changed by God.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:24.400]   The world can't ignore you being changed by God.
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:27.640]   The world cannot ignore the fact that in the old you,
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.840]   the past you, you will feel agitated,
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:33.040]   you will be angry, you will react in an impulsive way.
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:36.920]   But then in that moment, you chose to quiet down.
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:38.960]   The world cannot ignore that.
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.880]   The world cannot ignore the fact that
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:43.360]   I should make this decision at work
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:45.720]   because everyone is doing the same,
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:48.000]   but then you chose differently.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.520]   That decision, that turn,
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:52.800]   your colleagues cannot ignore that.
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:55.880]   Your classmate cannot ignore the fact that
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:57.600]   when you go into the classroom,
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:00.520]   you speak to those that were being ignored.
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:03.080]   Your family members cannot ignore the fact that
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:04.680]   usually when they shouted at you,
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:06.880]   when they talk mean things about you,
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:08.120]   you would slam the door.
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:12.000]   They cannot ignore the fact that you chose to listen.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.920]   We do not need to do anything great,
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:20.280]   but in our every moment, in our every decision,
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:24.840]   we choose Jesus because He has won.
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:27.800]   He has freed us from comparison.
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:31.280]   He has freed us from self-centeredness.
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:34.720]   We can embrace this new life and this new hope.
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:38.320]   And if you have not received it yet,
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:42.400]   you do not need to be guilt-tripped by doing this.
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:44.760]   It is not something that we will judge,
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:46.160]   oh, you're not doing that.
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:47.640]   That was a Christian.
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:48.480]   No.
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:52.760]   Before the commission, there was this promise.
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:55.520]   Before you need to do the action,
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:59.400]   remember you receive this new life first.
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:03.200]   You receive this grace that God has given you first.
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:07.280]   You receive it first, and then you be witness
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:10.200]   of what the grace, the love, the freedom
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:13.560]   that you have received to show people
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:16.760]   in your family, in your workplace, and in your home.
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:20.000]   We may feel ordinary.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.880]   We may feel unprepared.
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:25.160]   But God delights in using ordinary people,
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:27.920]   people just like me and you, maybe,
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:30.320]   to carry out His extraordinary mission.
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:32.680]   He doesn't ask us to do it alone
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:34.760]   or to muster up our own strength
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:37.080]   or to pretend we've had it all together.
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:40.800]   He simply asks us to trust Him,
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:44.120]   to seek His presence in His word
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:46.440]   and in our quiet time with Him,
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:49.680]   to receive His Spirit, to receive His grace,
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:54.440]   and to take the next step as witness right where we are.
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:59.920]   What if we truly believe that the Spirit is with us
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:01.480]   in every conversation?
[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:05.920]   What if we believe that the Holy Spirit
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:09.120]   will empower us in every act of kindness,
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:11.520]   every moment when we choose to love,
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:15.440]   to forgive or to speak up for what is right?
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:19.480]   What if, as a church, we lean in together,
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:23.840]   allowing the Holy Spirit to transform our weaknesses
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:28.840]   into testimonies, our failures into stories of God's grace
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:34.280]   and our everyday lives into evidence that Jesus is alive?
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:39.280]   Let's be the people where others see more
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:42.480]   than just good intentions or nice program.
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:47.040]   Let's be a people who live so honestly with such hope
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:49.680]   that those around us can't help
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:53.640]   but see the reality of Jesus in us.
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:56.960]   Let our lives be undeniable proof
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:00.040]   that Jesus' victory is real,
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:04.080]   that His Holy Spirit really does change everything.
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:10.560]   You are called, you are empowered, and you are sent.
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:17.720]   And I don't know where you are at with Jesus right now.
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:22.760]   Maybe at this moment, if you ask yourself, you go,
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:26.520]   actually, I don't have a relationship with Jesus.
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:30.880]   That was the prayer I prayed at home, in the bathroom,
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:34.040]   a few weeks after my father passed away.
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:38.200]   I was a Christian for most of my life
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:40.160]   because my grandma was a Christian.
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:43.040]   She made every single one of her sons
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:47.080]   and in-laws to go to church.
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:50.200]   I also went to church when I was really young.
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.040]   But when my father passed away,
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:55.000]   it forced me to ask this question,
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.560]   God, are you there for me?
[00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:59.680]   And it made me realize that I don't really
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.400]   have a relationship with Jesus.
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:02.880]   I know a lot about Him,
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:06.120]   but I don't have a relationship with Him.
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:11.040]   And today, if you have to be honest with yourself,
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:15.280]   do you feel you have a relationship with Jesus?
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:19.680]   So right now, I would like the worship team to come up
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:23.600]   and I would like to give a moment for you
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:24.800]   to reflect on this.
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:29.160]   And just to be honest, God is a loving God.
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:34.160]   He knows it already, but there is power
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.120]   when we bring things into the light.
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:41.320]   Maybe at this moment, you do not have
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:45.920]   a relationship with Jesus, but He is calling you.
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:50.320]   So with every eyes closed right now,
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:54.880]   with every head bow,
[00:36:54.880 --> 00:37:00.520]   I would like you to speak to Jesus.
[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:08.840]   He loves you.
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:12.120]   And He wants to.
[00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:15.800]   And He wants you to be honest with Him.
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:22.400]   And in this moment, if you know that you may not
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:25.160]   have a relationship with Him, but you want to,
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:27.960]   you want to receive this grace,
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:29.680]   you want to receive this love,
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:36.000]   you want to receive this abundant life that He promised,
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.680]   and you want to turn away from the old way of life
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:43.240]   because that has not been working out for you.
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:46.480]   You have tried, you have used your own effort,
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:49.960]   your own way of living, and it did not work.
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:52.440]   You were hurting yourself, you were hurting people
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:56.080]   around you, and you did not have a relationship with Jesus.
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:38:00.600]   I'd like you, just at your seat,
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:05.320]   that you want to receive this Jesus in your life
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:06.480]   to put up your hand.
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:09.080]   (gentle music)
[00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:15.640]   He loves you, and He waits for you in every single moment.
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:20.880]   I see that hand, thank you.
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:27.680]   Maybe you are a Christian,
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:32.920]   but you have not been relying
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:34.840]   on the Holy Spirit's empowerment.
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:38.200]   You have all the good intentions,
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:44.480]   but when you're trying to show people that Jesus lives,
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:47.400]   you fell short.
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:50.840]   I want to pray for you.
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:57.520]   If you are one of those people that you want to be empowered
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:01.520]   by the Holy Spirit today to live out the victorious life,
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:04.640]   the reality that Jesus is alive,
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.800]   I would like you to open up your hand
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:14.320]   and to receive this Holy Spirit that empowers you
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:18.440]   to live victoriously, to live differently.
[00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:37.000]   Jesus, we thank you, because today,
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:42.800]   someone here has made a decision to follow you.
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:46.920]   I pray that by your grace and your power,
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:50.600]   that you are going to fill him up with the Holy Spirit
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:55.160]   to empower him to turn from his old ways and to run to you.
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:40:01.560]   I pray that as he make his decision to receive you,
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:07.560]   that you will give him and honor him
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:11.040]   and know that you will give him an abundant life.
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:14.880]   Thank you for dying for us on the cross.
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:18.800]   Thank you for forgiving our sin.
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:25.320]   Today, we turn away from our past way of life
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:30.840]   and to turn to you, Jesus, and we thank you.
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:36.840]   For this new life that is ahead of the people,
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:40.560]   and we pray in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:42.520]   And I pray for the people
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:47.240]   who also wants to be empowered by the Holy Spirit today
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:50.760]   to live a life of victorious life,
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:53.560]   that in every single moment,
[00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:57.560]   that we are going to know the presence
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:59.560]   of the Holy Spirit with us.
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:04.440]   In our action, in our speech, in our decision,
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:08.120]   your empowerment is real.
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:11.840]   Your presence is undeniable.
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:17.240]   And today, we're going to learn to seek you.
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:23.760]   We'll learn to be with you in all that we do.
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:27.840]   And we are thankful for that.
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:31.960]   And in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
