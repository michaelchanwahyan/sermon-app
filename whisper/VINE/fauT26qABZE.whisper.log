[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440]   Well, hello, hello, hello.
[00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.760]   So I hope you get to meet someone new.
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:12.800]   I hope that you are sitting around someone that you don't often see and then we can get
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.180]   to know each other and be connected.
[00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.440]   And actually, next week, there's an event going on that can get you connected as well.
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.000]   And that is our Bring Your Own Lunch.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.640]   It is our monthly event where we get together and we, after the service, we all come with
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.240]   our lunches and go buy some food and come back up here.
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.920]   And it's a time for you to get connected with each other.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.760]   So next week, Bring Your Own Lunch.
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.960]   And also today, don't forget, after service today, we are going to have our Feast of Common.
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.880]   So if you like, please stay behind, enjoy the game and the songs and the fellowship
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.860]   and to get to know someone new as well.
[00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.120]   And actually talking about connection, talking about community, there's one particular community
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.840]   that is always in my heart and that is the parents, especially September.
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.440]   September is coming.
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.520]   If you are not in the education sector or not a parent, September is just not a month
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.520]   for you.
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.960]   But if you're a parent or if you're stepping into primary one, September is a month that
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.880]   we all kind of, you know, have some doubts, have some, you know, tension about.
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:31.560]   And so next week, during our Bring Your Own Lunch, we are actually going to have a primary
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.000]   one prep sharing table.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.320]   And what this table is like is that I have invited a few experienced teachers to come
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.600]   and to share about what teachers or what parents should prepare and to help them to feel more
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.400]   at ease about stepping into September as a fresh primary one family.
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.720]   And I've also invited, and if you, if your kid is about to step into primary one, please
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.400]   come to this event so that you're able to listen to, you know, experienced teachers
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:07.160]   talking about what are your expectations and what should you think about and what should
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.880]   you relax about, right?
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.640]   And if you have kids that are already along the way in primary three, four, five, six,
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.720]   you can also come and just share your experience.
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.000]   You know, it's, this sharing table is not about a one-way talk about, oh, this is, you
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.120]   know, what this is going to be about.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.360]   You can think about this, you can think about that.
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.000]   No, sharing table is a table we created for us to have a conversation about things that
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.220]   is in our mind or in our heart.
[00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.220]   So please come.
[00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:42.400]   And if your kid is in like kindergarten stage and you want to know what kind of primary
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.920]   should I enroll my kids into, is all about fun, it's good for my kid, or should I give
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.640]   some, you know, academic expectation from my kid?
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.760]   What are schools like when we enroll into those schools?
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.480]   You can actually come and have a listen as well.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:03.800]   So please scan the QR code and there's also poster over there if you want to enroll later.
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.320]   And also another very important event that is coming up is our Alpha.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:15.080]   So last time we have our Alpha and we all have it all together, try Cantonese, the English,
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.520]   all in the same room and join it together.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.160]   But this time we are going to have a separate day for our English Alpha.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.760]   Okay, so if you want to join or if you want to invite someone, some of your friends to
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.480]   come and join Alpha, please scan for the English, English Alpha.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.000]   We have our own Alpha session this time.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.760]   Isn't it exciting?
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:43.640]   I have often meet friends that have been in, that heard about, you know, Christianity or
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.800]   this or church for a long time from their school, from their friends, but they're kind
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.480]   of scared or shy to ask questions.
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.360]   This is a time for them to come, to come just to learn what this, what church is about,
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.800]   what Jesus is about.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.120]   It's a place for them to come and enjoy a dinner and ask questions and learn about it.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.360]   And there are many times when people just come to faith during these casual conversations,
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.760]   casual but very important life conversations.
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.880]   So please invite your friends to come.
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.360]   Please tell them to come or yourself to come along and to join Alpha as well.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:25.880]   But if you want to serve, if you have a missional heart and you go, actually, when I go and
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.880]   talk to people, I'm often very shy about, you know, evangelize or things like that.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.440]   But in this Alpha course, when you serve, you can listen to what people, what people
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.760]   thoughts and questions are, and you can facilitate a conversation.
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.080]   And there are actually many other different roles in serving Alpha as well.
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.080]   So if you want to serve this time, if you experience it, or even if you have not experienced
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.320]   Alpha but you know you want to serve, come scan this code and be a volunteer.
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.520]   We have a training for you.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.680]   So don't worry if you don't know what it is all about.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.480]   There will be training.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.480]   All right.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:10.080]   And so it comes to our, we're going to step into our part of worship, which is our offering
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:16.880]   and our volunteers are going to pass around the bucket for the offering.
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.960]   Offering is a part of our worship because we realize that everything that we have is
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.240]   from God.
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.080]   And we just want to reflect that with the resources that we have given us.
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.960]   So in the Bible first that it says, each of you should give what you have decided in your
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.200]   heart to give.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:40.120]   You don't need to be worried or you don't have to give, but it is a reflection of what
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.200]   God has put into your heart.
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:48.840]   So as the bucket pass around, take the time to think about God's grace for you.
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.840]   Think about your connection with God.
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.280]   And so as we're doing that, let us pray for our offering.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:05.200]   Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you that you are a God and you sustain us, sustain us with
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.640]   financial income, but also you are sustaining us through all the other different ways as
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:15.120]   well with family, with relationship, with a roof over our head or with many other things
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.480]   that you've given us.
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:20.760]   And so we want to give to you as part of our worship, knowing that you are the one who
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.280]   sustain us, knowing that you are gracious and generous towards us.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.840]   And we just want to give thanks through our offering.
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.200]   And in Jesus name we pray, Amen.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:38.380]   And so today we have our Pastor Tim sharing with us an important word with us today.
[00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:44.720]   So let's all stretch our hands towards Pastor Tim.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:52.200]   I know that there is a word in his mind about worship, about today's sermon that is going
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:58.720]   to change our perspective and our understanding and our hearts about who God is.
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.440]   And so Father, we pray for anointing in Tim.
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.960]   May the word that you have given him, may the sermon, the wisdom that you have given
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:15.120]   him through his life and through his word is going to bless and change and help us to
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.600]   focus on you.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:22.400]   And so we thank you God for your anointing in Tim and may we open up our hearts and ears
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.840]   to listen to what you have got to say to us.
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.280]   And in Jesus name we pray, Amen.
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.280]   Thank you June.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.160]   Well it's great to be back.
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:36.120]   It's been a month since I've stood here, so it's good to be back.
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:43.400]   When I was in my early twenties, I started a practice of journaling.
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.320]   So I'm just curious, does anyone here else journal or am I the only one?
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.880]   Okay, we have some people.
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.960]   Good, so a few.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:56.240]   And as I was home this summer in Germany, I saw some of those old journals and I was
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.240]   like, "Ooh, this is interesting.
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.240]   I want to read."
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:04.600]   And especially about those periods of time where a lot of important things happened.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.720]   So I was like opening my journal, I was reading.
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:16.040]   Some of it is written like okay, but the thing that really struck me and that really stood
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:24.840]   out was just my expression of worship to God as I was reading.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:33.240]   There was this deep desire and longing to praise God, to give him glory and to honor
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.120]   him.
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:41.400]   And so that made me think about different seasons of worshiping, of praising God in
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.720]   our lives, in my own life.
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:52.560]   So I've had seasons where praise flows easily, maybe life is going good, I have a lot of
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.640]   support around me and everything, and I'm praising God.
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.400]   My faith is vibrant and it's awesome and it's amazing.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:06.440]   But then there's also other times where maybe praising God through our songs, but also through
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:10.220]   our lives is a lot harder, where it's not easy.
[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:11.440]   This can be for many reasons.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:16.060]   It can be maybe we get busy with stuff in our lives, maybe there's other things that
[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:23.720]   take on importance that we focus on, and so Jesus moves to the side, to the periphery.
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:29.520]   Maybe we're going through something difficult, like where it's just hard for us to have joy
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:36.880]   and we're just overwhelmed, and so it's just hard to worship and to praise God and to seek
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.120]   to honor him and to give him glory.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:48.520]   And so I was wondering for you, what season are you in right now?
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.120]   What is your worship season right now?
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:57.260]   Is it one where you're praising God, where Jesus is at the center, and where all of life
[00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:03.520]   and all that you do, you want to serve God, you want to love God?
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:10.280]   Or has Jesus moved to the periphery, and for whatever reason, other things have taken over
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:16.760]   and have occupied your heart, your mind, your imagination, your time, your energy?
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:17.760]   Where are you?
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:24.080]   So I want to explore with you through this message a question, that is how is God inviting
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:32.360]   you to renew, strengthen, and deepen your personal worship of God?
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.400]   How is he inviting you?
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:41.360]   And so I hope that today through the message, you hear God, you hear from God, and he meets
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.360]   you.
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:47.480]   Today, we're continuing in our sermon series, "Bringing Glory."
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.760]   Now we started that last week.
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:56.720]   Pastor Chapman kicked off the series, and part of the reason why as a church, why we
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.960]   came up with this four-week sermon series, we're already almost halfway through after
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:09.920]   today, was because there was a sense that God wants to take us deeper in our worship,
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:13.520]   in our adoration, in our praise of him.
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:19.000]   That he wants to do something new among us, something fresh.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.720]   And my personal sense was even that this is not just for the sermon series, but actually
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.120]   for the remainder of the year.
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:29.120]   God just wants to do something new there.
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.320]   So I'm excited about that.
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:35.440]   I don't know how that will express itself or what that will look like, but I'm excited
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:39.320]   about what God wants to do, and so looking forward to that.
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:43.240]   Now since we talk a lot about worship, I also thought maybe it's good to give a definition
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.480]   of what worship is.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:49.000]   I was struggling with that a little bit because there's so many definitions, and some are
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.720]   like super long, so I decided to just choose a very simple one, so here it is.
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:59.680]   It's from John Pipe, he says, "True worship is valuing or treasuring of God above all
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.400]   things."
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:08.400]   True worship is valuing or treasuring of God above all things.
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:15.680]   So that means that all of our lives, this worship of God is expressed that we treasure
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:21.000]   Him, that we value Him, that we care about who He is and what He desires from us, that
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.480]   we seek to bring Him praise and glory.
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:31.320]   And that's in all spheres of life, what we do when we work, how we act in our families,
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:37.240]   but yes also how we sing, how we care for the city, all of those parts.
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:45.000]   And you can see what you're worshiping by seeing what captures the imagination, what
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.760]   are you spending time on, what are you spending money on, what are you spending most of your
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.920]   efforts on.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.840]   And is God part of that?
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:59.120]   And so true worship is valuing or treasuring of God above all things.
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:03.840]   So this is where God wants to lead us deeper into.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:07.720]   Now one of the main places that we learn about worship is the book of Psalms.
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.680]   Now I love the book of Psalms.
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:13.280]   It's the worship and praise book of the Bible.
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:21.440]   And it has all sorts of different songs and poems in it for different seasons of the soul.
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:28.600]   So some, in January we looked at lament, actually shows that complaining is part of our spirituality.
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:37.400]   We can complain to God and that that is actually an act of faith and that is an act of worship.
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.520]   But today we're looking at a different type of Psalm.
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:45.160]   We're going to be in Psalm 96 and I just want to set the context before I'll read it to
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.440]   you.
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:53.520]   So Psalm 96, the context is Israel has just returned from exile.
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:14:00.360]   So they were in Babylon for 70 years and they just got back and it was this incredible saving
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.360]   work of God that he did.
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.560]   And so people were excited.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:09.760]   It was amazing and God was very real for people at that time.
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:15.080]   So let's, let me take you to Psalm 96 and starting in verse one it says this, "Sing
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.800]   to the Lord a new song.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.360]   Sing to the Lord all the earth.
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.360]   Sing to the Lord.
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.960]   Praise his name.
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:28.040]   Proclaim his salvation day after day.
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:31.560]   Declare his glory among the nations.
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.960]   His marvelous deeds among all peoples.
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:39.520]   For great is the Lord and most worthy of praise.
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:43.440]   He is to be feared above all gods.
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:50.440]   For all the gods of the nations are idols but the Lord made the heavens.
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.280]   Splendor and majesty are before him.
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:57.000]   Strength and glory are in the sanctuary.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.640]   Ascribe to the Lord all you families of nations.
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.560]   Ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:07.160]   Ascribe to the Lord glory due to his name.
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.480]   Bring an offering.
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.480]   Come into his courts.
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:15.480]   Worship the Lord in the splendor of his holiness.
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.060]   Tremble before him all the earth.
[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:19.680]   Stay among the nations.
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:22.160]   The Lord reigns.
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.120]   The world is firmly established.
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.760]   It cannot be moved.
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:29.120]   He will judge the peoples with equity.
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.080]   Let the heavens rejoice.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.720]   Let the earth be glad.
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:36.760]   Let the sea resound and all that is in it.
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:40.260]   Let the fields be jubilant and everything in them.
[00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:45.320]   Let all the trees of the forest sing for joy.
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:49.280]   Let all creation rejoice before the Lord for he comes.
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.040]   He comes to judge the earth.
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:58.080]   He will judge the world in righteousness and the people in his faithfulness.
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:06.280]   So let's see how God might be inviting you through his psalm to renew, to strengthen,
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:10.880]   to deepen your worship of him.
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:14.080]   Now I want to break down a little bit how the psalm works.
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:17.520]   So in the psalm there's three movements of the same thing.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:22.160]   There's a call to worship and then there's a reason for why we worship God, a call to
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.640]   worship, a reason for why we worship God, and a call to worship and a reason for why
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.780]   we worship God.
[00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:33.040]   And so the first call is to sing and then we're told because God is great.
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:41.120]   Then there is the call to scribe to the Lord and then the reason is because he reigns.
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.120]   He governs all.
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:43.680]   We sang earlier he is above all.
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:49.960]   I can remember all position, powers, dominions, whatever.
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.480]   Thank you June.
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:58.080]   And then the final movement is like there's this call to rejoice to all creation and then
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:04.400]   it says the reason for why we worship him is because he comes, he comes, that God comes
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:08.340]   to his people, he meets his people and to restore justice.
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:11.880]   So that's the movement of the psalm and it gets more intense as you go.
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.680]   It's intensifying.
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:20.040]   Now I want us to start off by looking at the first reason for why we worship God.
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:25.480]   And so that we find in verse four and says this, "For great is the Lord and most worthy
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.760]   of praise."
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:31.600]   So we praise God because he is great.
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.880]   Now our praise is not empty.
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:34.880]   It's not shallow.
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:35.880]   It has substance.
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.200]   It has a reason.
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.380]   It's based on experience.
[00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:41.040]   It's based on truth.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:48.120]   So in Israel's case right now, what just had happened was absolutely incredible.
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:57.160]   They were for 70 years in exile, 70 years living in captivity and God freed them, brought
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:01.880]   them back to their homeland after 70 years.
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:05.720]   So that they could settle there again, rebuild Jerusalem, rebuild the temple.
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:09.200]   I mean, this was an amazing act of power.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.520]   But it was not just God's power.
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:18.040]   It was also God prophesied, his prophets prophesied that he will do that in 70 years.
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:21.160]   So God is faithful to his word.
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.040]   So God is great because he's faithful.
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:28.080]   God does what he says.
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.440]   But not only that, there's more.
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:34.180]   God also showed mercy.
[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:38.960]   Because the reason why Israel was in exile was because he had sinned over and over and
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.600]   over again.
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:46.040]   But now God was showing his grace and mercy and was bringing them back.
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:53.880]   And so Israel, the community of faith, God's people worship God because he is great.
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.800]   So it's rooted in what God has done.
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:01.300]   It's not just something that somebody says about someone.
[00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:04.840]   It's because of who he is.
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:08.120]   So God is most worthy of praise.
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:18.320]   Now what's interesting is our worship, worship is always revelation and then response.
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:24.820]   So what that means is we worship God because God in some way, in some form has himself
[00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:26.400]   made known to us.
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.480]   He has revealed himself to us.
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:32.860]   So in Israel's case it was this amazing redemption of bringing them back.
[00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:36.980]   For us, maybe it's what Jesus has done when we experience him coming into our lives and
[00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:41.200]   giving us peace and maybe doing some healing work in us.
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:46.680]   And so because of that, we cannot help because God has made himself known.
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.240]   He has revealed himself.
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:50.680]   We cannot help but to praise him.
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:56.320]   That's the only response that makes sense.
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:01.640]   But to move into praise, there always needs to be revelation of God showing his love,
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:06.800]   his care, his mercy, his power to his people in their lives.
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:10.280]   And then because of that, we fall on our knees and we say, we worship you, Lord.
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:11.280]   We love you.
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:12.520]   We praise you.
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:18.520]   We adore you because of God working in this way.
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:25.540]   Now when I was studying to be a pastor, I was going through a difficult season.
[00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:28.240]   I just lost joy in my life.
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:31.680]   I don't know if any of you can relate to that where joy suddenly just seems to have left
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.680]   the building.
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:38.200]   It's not Elvis, it was joy who left.
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:42.300]   And I was just really struggling.
[00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:46.160]   And one thing, looking back on that time, I wasn't praising God much.
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.440]   My praise was very little.
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:51.960]   Here I'm studying to be a pastor, my praise was very little.
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:57.760]   And I had an assignment in one of the classes which was to write down my spiritual journey,
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:02.240]   all the ways that God worked, all these turning points and difficulties, and just kind of
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.240]   map that out.
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:10.760]   So as I was doing that, I just started being overwhelmed by the mercy, by the goodness,
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:14.920]   by the faithfulness of God as I was looking at my life.
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:20.520]   I was remembering how Jesus freed me from spiritual oppression, where I had anxiety,
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.320]   I had fear, I had no peace.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.200]   And Jesus gave me peace.
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:27.960]   I could finally rest.
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:34.200]   Then God in his sovereignty brought me from Germany where I was struggling.
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:37.280]   I was not a good student in Germany, I struggled with the school system.
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:41.940]   It's a little bit like Hong Kong, or at least used to be, where there's not much encouragement
[00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:46.280]   from teachers about your schooling and things.
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:48.560]   And so I just was not doing that well.
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:52.680]   But then because of basketball I went to the US, but later on looking back I saw that God
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:22:00.160]   brought me there, because there I met people my age who loved Jesus, who desired to serve
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.160]   him and follow him.
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.320]   I didn't have friends like that in Germany.
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:06.000]   So suddenly I was in this different, God brought me in this different context.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.560]   I was doing good works in my life.
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:13.600]   Then God called me in just the right timing out of a job in finance.
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:17.800]   I was just about to invest a lot of money for somebody I knew.
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:22.400]   And if that would have gone through, I would have been stuck with it.
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:26.560]   God called me out into a different career path.
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:33.200]   And then I had this incredible experience of serving with YWAM, actually we have some
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:37.760]   YWAM people here, and God confirmed this call in my life.
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:42.120]   And then I felt like, well I probably should go to seminary or something and study so I'm
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:48.680]   qualified to somehow serve God as being a pastor, a missionary, or something.
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:51.880]   But I didn't have any money.
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:55.360]   And then I remember that God provided for me.
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:58.300]   I got a full scholarship to seminary.
[00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:02.160]   Now if you have ever dealt with seminary, that usually doesn't happen.
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:07.040]   Not only that, God provided for me work as a chaplain at the university for two years.
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:12.040]   So my housing was paid, my food was paid, my internet was paid, my electricity bill,
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:14.400]   everything was paid and I got a stipend on top of it.
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.400]   Wow!
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:19.680]   So I was sitting there in my room and recounting what God did.
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.880]   Tears started filling my eyes.
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:25.880]   And I said, "Lord, you are so good.
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:27.840]   You are so faithful."
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.760]   And I started worshipping him.
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:34.000]   Because he showed me, he revealed to me his goodness again.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.720]   And God doesn't just work in the past, but he always does fresh and new things in our
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:39.720]   lives.
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.840]   And there is always new reasons to praise God.
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:45.040]   But we'll get to that in a little bit.
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:48.880]   So if you have the desire to renew and strengthen your worship, one of the things you can do
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:50.280]   is actually look back on your life.
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:51.400]   You know, what has God done?
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:58.000]   And take time, maybe map out your spiritual journey and just allow God to speak.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.520]   You ask God to reveal himself to you.
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:03.440]   Like in a prayer, "God, reveal yourself to me.
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.000]   Show me how you work.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.480]   I'm not seeing you right now.
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:08.400]   I'm not feeling you right now.
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:11.400]   You know, show, reveal yourself to me."
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:17.480]   And then as God does that, you know, he moves us to worshipping and praising him.
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:18.680]   Because we can see his goodness.
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:20.720]   We can see who he is.
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:23.160]   That's incredible.
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:27.360]   Now let's go to the part where there's a call.
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:30.680]   So I said there's a call to worship and then there's a reason.
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:35.920]   So let's go back to verse 1 through 3, where it says, "Sing to the Lord."
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:40.000]   It says that three times, "Sing to the Lord, sing to the Lord, sing to the Lord."
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   Three times.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.560]   Like, what's up with that?
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:51.120]   Now singing, if you think about singing, it's actually something quite vulnerable.
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:55.720]   I'd be a little bit scared if I needed to start singing here right now.
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:56.720]   I might do it.
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:58.440]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:01.800]   Everybody gets scared.
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:02.880]   It depends on the song.
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:05.720]   There might be a song I'm comfortable singing.
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:12.480]   But if you think about it, when we sing, we're really expressing things from our hearts.
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.400]   And the classical thing would be the love song.
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:19.880]   A boy or girl wants to express their love for their beloved.
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:24.440]   And maybe they write a song and then at night, in the whole big building complex, they're
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:29.280]   downstairs with an amp and they're playing the guitar and start singing to their love
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:35.360]   and everybody's annoyed except for the person he's singing to or she is singing to.
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:39.920]   And there's something about words and music that somehow express things differently than
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:43.040]   if it's just words.
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:47.400]   And I find it interesting that God desires his people to sing.
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:55.320]   Not every religion has really singing as a focal point in their practices and their spirituality.
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:26:02.200]   And on one occasion, I wrote a song, the only song I've ever written, and it was a song
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:05.100]   for my father.
[00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:09.960]   My father in 2006 was diagnosed with cancer.
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:17.320]   And Christmas was coming up and we knew that this would probably be his last Christmas
[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:18.840]   unless God does a miracle.
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:22.520]   Now, Christmas was always special and we all, as a whole family, got together.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:27.440]   We were living all over the world as a family.
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.520]   And so I worked with a youth.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:32.200]   I was in Germany at the time working in a youth group.
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.680]   One of my youth, he was a rapper.
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:36.560]   He actually had a contract with a label.
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:43.560]   So he helped me build a beat on Fruity Loops, whatever that is.
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.960]   And so it's an R&B song.
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:51.240]   And so I wrote some lyrics to express to my father what he meant to me.
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:55.640]   Now the lyrics are not particularly good, but they were the right lyrics for that moment.
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:27:07.920]   So I want to share some with you.
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:11.980]   Okay I'll sing the chorus, but I will not sing the other part.
[00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:15.400]   So it says, "The first memory of you and me playing.
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:18.320]   It was me behind the door daily waiting.
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:22.280]   I wanted to scare you every time when you came home.
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:23.640]   Never feeling alone.
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:28.120]   I feel safe and secure knowing you love me whatever I do.
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:34.120]   You made me into the man that I am today.
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:38.840]   You told me all about Jesus the Lord and Savior that changed my life and taught me the right
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:40.320]   behavior.
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:42.200]   You gave me so much more, more than I needed.
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.680]   Now it's time for me to give it back.
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:44.680]   Hope you feel it."
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:50.840]   And then, I don't know if I can sing it now.
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:54.000]   Thank you, thank you dad for being.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.720]   You were not perfect, but the perfect one for me.
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:03.760]   Thank you always believing, always seeing the good side of me.
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:04.760]   Thank you.
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:11.480]   And so it goes on.
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:13.680]   Now I was not going to do that.
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.880]   You guys made me do it.
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:19.400]   How dare you?
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:26.680]   But you know, as we were sitting there and I was singing the recording, I played the
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:30.800]   CD, my whole family was tearing up.
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:34.880]   Because the words plus the music, they just gave expression.
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:39.120]   I was able to narrate back to my father who he was.
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:42.320]   He was the one who pretended like he's scared every time he walks through the door because
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:45.560]   I scared him as a little kid.
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:49.800]   He was the one who made me feel safe and secure that I knew it didn't matter what I did, he
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:50.800]   loved me.
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.560]   He was the one who told me about Jesus.
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.840]   So I'm just telling him and expressing my thanks.
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:59.800]   You know, in this instance, just words would have not done it.
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:00.800]   It needed a song.
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:10.320]   But now when we think of God, how much more has God done in our lives?
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:15.660]   And through song, we can also narrate back to God who he is.
[00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:21.120]   And we can bring expression with our whole being, not just our intellect, but with our
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:27.560]   emotions and feelings and all of that, we can express our worship, our praise, our gratitude
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:31.200]   to God.
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:38.600]   So our singing to the Lord offers us a way to give expression to our feelings, emotions,
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:45.680]   and mood where we can say to God what we cannot simply say through words alone.
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:50.120]   So the psalmist calls us to sing to the Lord, you know, to come before him with all that
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:52.040]   we have and to give him praise.
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:57.440]   And in some way, it's also the giving of all of ourselves, you know, because we're not
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:02.680]   just giving him our intellect, but we're giving him everything, all of us, you know, in our
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:06.320]   worship and praise.
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:09.200]   So God calls us to sing, and that's why we sing.
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.080]   That's why we sing on Sundays.
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:15.160]   And we express with our emotions and feelings, you know, to God how much we love him and
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:16.160]   who he is.
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.880]   But there's a second part I want to get to.
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:18.880]   What do we sing about?
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:21.440]   You know, what's the content?
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:24.640]   Actually verse two and three also give us a little detail on that.
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:28.360]   So in verse two, it says, "Sing to the Lord, praise his name, proclaim his salvation day
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:35.440]   after day, declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous deed among all peoples."
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:39.520]   So to praise the name means to enhance someone's reputation.
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:42.680]   It's like if I say, "June, she's incredible.
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:46.080]   Do you know what an amazing teacher she is in K4C?"
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:47.560]   Like, wow.
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:52.200]   And if I would say that and she's not a teacher or she's not a good teacher, then it wouldn't
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:53.560]   be really meaningful.
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:58.680]   But because she really is a good teacher, you know, so my praise has meaning.
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:30:59.680]   It has substance.
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.280]   It means something.
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:11.080]   And so when we praise the name of God, when we praise his name, we're enhancing his reputation.
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:15.640]   We're saying how incredible, how amazing God is.
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:17.880]   And there's two ways here that we do it.
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:24.200]   First, we proclaim his salvation day after day.
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:25.600]   So we tell of him.
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:29.240]   For Israel, this would have meant to talk about the Exodus, the first one and also the
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:34.920]   second one, and his amazing saving work and the history of the people of God.
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:37.160]   You know, for us, of course, it has to do with Jesus.
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:42.520]   We're talking about Jesus and what he has done and how he has saved us, how he has forgiven
[00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:46.760]   us, how he's given us a new life, how he's transforming us, how he's working things out
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:50.160]   for the good and leads us into purposes.
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:53.400]   And we're just, you know, proclaiming that.
[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:57.240]   It's his saving work as we're singing.
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:02.920]   And again, it's based on real things, you know, and we're enhancing his reputation.
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:08.680]   And then secondly, it says, it talks about declaring God's glory.
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:13.160]   Now, what in the world does that mean?
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:17.520]   So to declare God's glory means to speak of wonders, his work as creator.
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:20.400]   It means to speak of God as king.
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:21.400]   He is sovereign.
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:22.600]   He is ruler.
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:25.440]   Of course, God is savior.
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:31.260]   Now what's interesting that the Hebrew word for glory that's used here, "kabod," is related
[00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:35.880]   to glorify, to verb, "kavad," which really means to be heavy.
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.280]   Actually, it's also used to talk about being fat.
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:39.280]   Interesting, right?
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:41.920]   You're like, "Glory and being fat?
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.200]   Like how does that fit together?"
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:51.200]   Well, what it's about is about that the one we're giving glory to because he has weight.
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:52.200]   He's weighty.
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:53.400]   He has importance.
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:54.840]   He doesn't lack substance.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:57.680]   He's not easily just blown away.
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.760]   And so this is part of the concept of glory.
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:06.600]   So to declare God's glory means to declare God's substance, his weightiness, his significance
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:15.840]   among all people because he is the only one, you know, who has this glory to this level.
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:24.280]   He's the most weighty, the most important, the most worthy God.
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:32.240]   And so in our singing, we proclaim and we declare God's glory because he has substance.
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:38.480]   He has, as I was sharing with this example with June, he is the creator.
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.480]   He is the savior.
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:41.120]   He has the power to do that.
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:42.560]   Nobody else can do that.
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:46.000]   There's nobody else who deserves this kind of praise or glory.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.120]   So we praise God in this way.
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:49.840]   We declare him glory.
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:55.480]   Now, the psalmist also says, "Sing to the Lord a new song."
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:57.440]   Now what's with this new song?
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:00.360]   What does that all, you know, what does that mean?
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:06.480]   Well, there's a need for a new song because God has done something new.
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:08.480]   And so that's why we need to sing a new song.
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:10.320]   We need to bring God praise.
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:12.640]   Again, that's that revelation.
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:14.120]   God has done something new.
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:17.040]   And then now we praise him.
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:23.320]   And again, the appropriate response is to even write a new song, to give him praise,
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:25.680]   to sing it out to him.
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:31.680]   And it's, you know, it's amazing because a lot of times when these new songs arrive,
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:36.120]   it's actually in a season when stuff has been very difficult and heavy.
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:39.600]   That we needed deliverance, that we needed his help, that we needed his mercy, that we
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:43.560]   needed his grace, that we needed him to act in our lives, you know, so that something
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:45.880]   changes.
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:50.160]   And then he does.
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:53.880]   And then there's a reason to sing him a new song.
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:35:00.200]   So we worship God with the new songs because God always, is always doing new and good things
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:02.200]   in our lives.
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:09.240]   He's always doing new and good things in our lives.
[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:17.400]   So one of the practices that I do is once a week, sometimes every two weeks or so, I
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:23.400]   do try to write down how God has been good.
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:29.000]   And one time I read a challenge that was like, don't just write like five things or 10 things,
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.560]   because that's, you know, you'll write the same things.
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:31.560]   Thanks God that I'm breathing.
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:34.580]   You know, thank God that I'm...
[00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:35.580]   Write down 30.
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:42.760]   You know, 30 ways of how God has been good to you in this past week.
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:46.880]   And it's incredible when I do that, there's so many things that I forgot about or didn't
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:47.880]   notice.
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:53.840]   You know, and again, it's a way to renew our worship of him, to strengthen our worship
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:58.400]   because we see that he does new things every day.
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:03.760]   And there's a couple of verses I want to share with you from Limitations 22 and 23, and it
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:04.760]   says this.
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:08.520]   "The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases.
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:11.520]   His mercies never come to an end.
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.540]   They are new every morning.
[00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:16.420]   Great is your faithfulness."
[00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:18.280]   New mercies every morning.
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:24.760]   Every day God is doing something and showing us, is being good to us in new and fresh ways.
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:31.960]   We always have reason for new praise, for new worship, because God is good every day,
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:37.120]   doing new things, showing you his love, guiding you, showing you his care, providing for you,
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:38.760]   whatever it may be.
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:42.400]   And so he deserves our praise.
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:48.920]   Now let me highlight to you a theme that actually runs through most of the song.
[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:56.240]   In verse 3, it says, "Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous deeds among all
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.240]   peoples."
[00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:03.600]   So our praise is not just meant to be sung here on a Sunday morning, but it's actually
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:08.680]   meant to be sung among all the nations, among all peoples.
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:13.880]   We're supposed to proclaim of his salvation, you know, declare his glory and his goodness.
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:15.880]   And I was like, "How do you do that?
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:16.880]   You know, what does that look like?"
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:20.120]   It's like, do you, like when you're at work, do you like start singing?
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:24.560]   Like, you know, in the middle of the meeting, you stand up and like, what does it look like?
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:29.840]   Of course we can talk about that, but the Olympics actually gave me an example.
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:35.800]   So I want to share with you a photo of Yemisi.
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:41.080]   So this is a German gold medalist in the shot put.
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:42.640]   And it was really surprising.
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:45.080]   Nobody was expecting it.
[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:46.080]   And she ended up winning.
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:52.280]   So in one of her interviews in English, she actually praised God through song.
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:55.800]   And she's a gospel singer, so it was good.
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:38:01.920]   And then on German television, they asked her if she can sing more because they liked
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:02.920]   it.
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:08.300]   And so she got the whole like technical crew like clapping, and she was praising God and
[00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:10.240]   proclaiming his goodness.
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:14.840]   You know, in German, on the public TV station, it has the rights for the Olympics.
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:16.920]   You know, amazing.
[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:19.440]   And then now it's making its rounds on social media.
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:27.200]   So she is proclaiming, you know, salvation and declaring God's glory among the nations,
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:28.960]   among all people.
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:33.320]   Amazing, incredible, and so sympathetic.
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:38.920]   You know, such a, you should look her up and then watch some of these, it's awesome.
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:48.080]   Now when we do that, it's actually meant to raise questions in other people's lives.
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:49.800]   What am I worshipping?
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:54.400]   Why is this person singing like this and talking about this stuff?
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:57.240]   Should I think about this?
[00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:02.800]   Do I need to consider that?
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:07.280]   And so then in verse four and five, it goes on, it says, "For great is the Lord, and most
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:08.280]   worthy of praise.
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:13.400]   He is to be feared above all gods, for all gods of the nations are idols, but the Lord
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:16.760]   made the heavens."
[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:23.160]   So Israel singing proclaims the greatness, the power of God, his salvation, his ability
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:26.320]   to rescue, to change lives.
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:30.040]   And they're singing it not just when they gather, but they're singing it so that it's
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:31.480]   overheard.
[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:38.440]   Our worship needs to overflow so that other people hear it.
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:44.440]   And then it's meant to make people think about what they worship.
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:49.400]   And here it talks about the idols, and that the idols are, what does it say?
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:54.600]   For all the gods of the nations are idols, but the Lord made the heavens.
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:59.040]   These other so-called gods and things that we're worshipping, they don't measure up.
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:01.200]   They're not worth our worship and our praise.
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:03.680]   They're not worth dedicating our lives to.
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:08.440]   Now for us, today, of course, that can also mean literally idols, but it can also mean
[00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:16.240]   like worshipping success, or worshipping pleasure, or whatever it is.
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:19.420]   And it doesn't measure up compared to God.
[00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:24.840]   And so our worship is meant to raise this question among other people, what am I worshipping,
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:26.320]   and is it really worth it?
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:31.920]   And of course, it's also an invitation for the nations and for all God's people to worship
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:36.360]   God and to experience him, to know him, that he's the one that's powerful, and he's the
[00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:40.160]   one that can change our circumstances, who can transform our lives.
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:44.880]   And so there's actually this call to worship to the nations is in the next part, verse
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:45.880]   7 through 10.
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:49.720]   "Ascribe to the Lord all your families and nations.
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:51.600]   Ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:53.920]   Ascribe to the Lord the glory due to his name.
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:56.960]   Bring an offering and come into his courts.
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:00.000]   Worship the Lord in the splendor of his holiness.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.400]   Tremble before him, all the earth.
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:07.200]   Say among the nations, 'The Lord reigns.'"
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:13.560]   So this call to the nations to give to the Lord, or ascribe to the Lord and worship for
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:17.840]   him, actually would have been shocking to Israel.
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:21.380]   Because if you think about it, they just came out of captivity.
[00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:26.040]   And now God is inviting all the people to come and worship, to come into the temple.
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:28.240]   That's what this picture, what the psalm is picturing.
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:35.000]   It's inviting foreigners to come into the temple and to worship like Israel worships.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.680]   And the reason for that is God's heart for all people.
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:44.720]   Because he desires for all to know him, to experience his goodness and to worship him.
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:50.280]   And so we worship God because God's heart is for all peoples, from all nations to worship
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:55.720]   him and to experience his salvation and goodness in their lives.
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:42:01.720]   And that should also actually move us to worship and renew and strengthen our worship.
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:05.080]   God wants to touch other people's lives.
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:08.120]   He wants to bring other people in to worship him.
[00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:10.080]   He doesn't want the worship just to be contained here.
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:16.840]   He wants it to flow over into Yuen Long and into the city of Hong Kong and beyond.
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:21.120]   Because he wants other people to know him, to know his goodness and to worship and to
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:23.880]   praise him.
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:29.880]   And so God can reveal us his heart and that can lead us to praise him.
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:33.480]   God is not just a God for some people, he's God for all people.
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:39.680]   And that leads us into praising and worshiping him.
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:44.360]   And then the final reason that I want to look at with you for praising and worshiping God
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:48.400]   and how we can also renew our worship is given in verse 13.
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:55.680]   It says this, "Let all creation rejoice before the Lord, for he comes, he comes to judge
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:56.680]   the earth.
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:43:01.080]   He will judge the world in righteousness and the peoples in his faithfulness."
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:10.240]   Now, the thing about God is that he has come in history over and over again to meet his
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:12.880]   people, to deliver them, to provide for them.
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:20.120]   And of course, he has come through Jesus, which the psalm is also looking ahead to,
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:28.000]   to inaugurate the kingdom of God, to bring his salvation, his redemption to people.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:34.240]   But from the New Testament, we also know that Jesus is coming again to judge and to rule
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:36.360]   the earth.
[00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:38.560]   And it's interesting because that's a reason for rejoicing.
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:42.920]   Like usually, when we think of judgment, we don't think of it as something good.
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:45.080]   But I think with God is he's a righteous judge.
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:46.640]   He judges fairly.
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:48.760]   He judges correctly.
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:57.080]   And for those of us who know God, we can stand in Jesus' righteousness before him.
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:03.600]   And we can stand and we can enjoy his new creation where he makes all things whole,
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:07.720]   where he sets all things right, where he brings about complete justice, where his work of
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:11.600]   redemption is completed.
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:14.080]   And so that's another reason why we worship God.
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:20.160]   We look ahead into the future, praise Jesus because he comes again to set everything right
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:23.640]   and to treat everyone fair.
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:28.000]   Because that's the God that we serve, who has the power to do it, to complete his work
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:35.460]   that he's begun, to wipe away every tear, to bring complete wholeness where there has
[00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:45.480]   been brokenness in our lives and this world has been destroyed and impacted by sin.
[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:51.640]   So I want to invite the worship team to come up.
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:45:01.520]   And I actually want to invite right now all of us to take some time to prayerfully reflect.
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:08.220]   Because at the beginning I asked the question, how can we renew, strengthen, deepen our worship
[00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:10.440]   of God?
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:14.100]   And I asked, where are you on this journey?
[00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:16.780]   What is your worship looking like?
[00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:22.120]   And so I just want to give this time right now to connect with God, for him to reveal
[00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:29.040]   himself to you, to speak to you about who he is, what he has done.
[00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:36.360]   And I want to especially encourage also those of us who maybe it's been right now tough
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:43.480]   and you're struggling, because we serve a God who comes again and again and again to
[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:54.100]   meet his people, to powerfully work in their lives, to bring hope that change circumstances,
[00:45:54.100 --> 00:46:01.100]   to bring healing, to give strength and grace for whatever it is that we're facing.
[00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:13.240]   And so we worship a God who is always working, whose mercies in our lives are new every morning.
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:20.280]   So just want to open up this time to just talk with God, pray, and then in a little
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:25.560]   while all pray for us and then we'll sing to the Lord.
