1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
 Jesus' name, amen.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,920
 - Amen, let's hear it for Carla.

3
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:03,840
 Thank you, Carla.

4
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,800
 (congregation applauding)

5
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,040
 Well, good morning, everybody.

6
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,040
 It's so good to be back here preaching at the Vine.

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,080
 I think you may be aware

8
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,520
 that this is my favorite pulpit in the whole world.

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,360
 I mean, not this piece of metal

10
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,600
 with a plastic on top for my iPad, nice as it is,

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,600
 but this is my home church, and as the phrase says,

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,360
 there is no place like home.

13
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:39,020
 But there's an even more unique reason

14
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,660
 why today is special.

15
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:46,000
 Yesterday was my golden wedding anniversary.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,700
 (congregation applauding)

17
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,540
 Yeah.

18
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:55,680
 Yes, Sandra and I have been married for 50 years.

19
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,240
 Actually, 50 years and one day.

20
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,600
 I know Sandra deserves a medal.

21
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,080
 Go on, say it now, get it over with.

22
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:12,960
 But remarkably, today's passage in our Ephesian series

23
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,400
 is all about unity in relationships.

24
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,260
 It looks like we planned this all along.

25
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:25,320
 Today, I'll be looking at relations

26
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,360
 between husbands and wives,

27
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,060
 and obviously, you'll understand

28
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,980
 why I will concentrate on that rather a lot.

29
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:37,000
 I will look at relationships between children and parents

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,240
 and between slaves and masters.

31
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,480
 But to get us going,

32
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,960
 I wanna talk about airport conveyor belts.

33
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,840
 Now, those of you that follow us on social media will know,

34
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,360
 Sandra and I love travel.

35
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,180
 But one thing always mystifies me.

36
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:04,120
 Why does it always take so long for our luggage to arrive?

37
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,440
 Everyone else's seems to get priority,

38
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,280
 even the times when we have priority label on ours.

39
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,460
 We wait with bated breath,

40
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,500
 looking for ours to come up into the belt.

41
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,160
 But have you noticed, all cases these days look the same.

42
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,260
 So a few years ago, we started a habit

43
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,240
 of tying a red ribbon around our case

44
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,960
 to help us recognize it.

45
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:46,440
 As an aside, we were at Heathrow Airport a few Decembers ago

46
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,400
 and were pleasantly surprised to see our case,

47
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,800
 complete with red ribbons,

48
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,080
 coming off the conveyor belt early.

49
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,600
 Hallelujah, we said,

50
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,560
 feeling rather pleased with ourselves.

51
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,880
 We went through customs

52
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,920
 and we're in Heathrow Terminal 3

53
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,660
 only to discover we had the wrong case.

54
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:19,880
 Someone else had had the same idea.

55
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:25,120
 Not only was their case pretty much identical to ours,

56
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,440
 but I kid you not, it had the same red ribbons.

57
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:35,920
 Embarrassed, one hasty, red-faced U-turn later,

58
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,440
 we found the real owners.

59
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,120
 Dare I say, relieved real owners,

60
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,720
 as their case, unlike ours,

61
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,080
 was packed with expensive Christmas presents.

62
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,160
 But conveyor belts around the world

63
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,460
 aren't always like Heathrow or Hong Kong.

64
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,640
 And we've experienced some horror stories.

65
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,920
 Conveyor belts breaking down,

66
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,160
 having to wait over an hour for our luggage.

67
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,280
 Now, unfortunately, this sermon's come back to bite me

68
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,320
 because I wrote this and then last week

69
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,800
 we went to Seoul in Korea and guess what?

70
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,200
 The conveyor belt broke down.

71
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,560
 Or airports that have just given up

72
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,640
 and they end up dumping the luggage on the tarmac

73
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,840
 for us to sort through, home a fan.

74
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,040
 But there's a picture here.

75
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:36,760
 Relationships can be a bit like airport conveyor systems.

76
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:42,880
 The passage we're gonna look at today will show us

77
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,400
 that a marriage will run smoothly

78
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,560
 if the wife fulfills God's directions

79
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,920
 and is subject to her husband,

80
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,920
 and if the husband loves his wife as himself.

81
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:05,900
 A family will run smoothly if the children honor and obey,

82
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:11,160
 and if the parents do not provoke their children to wrath

83
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,280
 but teach them about God.

84
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,620
 The workplace runs smoothly

85
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:22,620
 if the employees do good work and follow instructions

86
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:28,240
 and if the employers treat the employees well.

87
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,120
 However, if someone doesn't follow the biblical instructions

88
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,140
 the whole machine is impeded or stopped.

89
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,940
 The luggage, as it were, is left on the tarmac.

90
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,560
 Now the key to realizing that we need to fulfill

91
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:52,040
 our places in life, whatever those places may be,

92
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:58,260
 as to the Lord, we will be seeing this in this passage

93
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:04,000
 that we are to fulfill those relationships as to the Lord.

94
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,220
 That means we need to act as if we were

95
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,020
 in that relationship directly with God.

96
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,080
 Now you probably don't look at your boss

97
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,500
 and think of him as God,

98
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,000
 nor do you regard your spouse or children

99
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,820
 or parents in that way.

100
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:27,420
 Yet if we would look at them as to the Lord,

101
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,160
 no doubt we would find it easier

102
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,680
 to behave in a godly manner.

103
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,760
 Let us make sure that we are not jamming up

104
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,040
 the conveyor belts of our lives.

105
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:45,800
 But enough of conveyor belts, let's get on to the passage.

106
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:52,560
 Wives, submit to your husbands as you do to the Lord.

107
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,400
 Now all the guys are wishing this is the finish

108
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,000
 of the reading today, by the way.

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,120
 Wives, submit yourself to your husbands

110
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,320
 as you do to the Lord.

111
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,800
 For the husband is the head of the wife

112
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,920
 as Christ is the head of the church,

113
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,080
 his body of which he is the savior.

114
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,360
 Now as the church submits to Christ,

115
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,360
 so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.

116
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,280
 Bad news, husbands, that's not the end of the reading.

117
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,280
 Husbands, love your wives just as Christ loved the church

118
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:34,240
 and gave himself up for her to make her holy,

119
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,720
 cleansing her by the washing with water through the word,

120
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,840
 to present her to himself as a radiant church

121
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,840
 without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish,

122
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,400
 but holy and blameless.

123
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,360
 In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives

124
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,600
 as their own bodies.

125
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,120
 He who loves his wife loves himself.

126
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,680
 After all, no one even hated their own body,

127
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,400
 but they feed and care for their body

128
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,360
 just as Christ does for the church,

129
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,800
 for we are all members of one body.

130
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,960
 For this reason, a man will leave his father and mother

131
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,920
 and be united to his wife,

132
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,880
 and the two will become one flesh.

133
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,680
 This is a profound mystery,

134
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,760
 but I am talking about Christ and his church.

135
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:31,760
 However, each one of you also must love his wife

136
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:37,760
 as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.

137
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,840
 Those first few words in this passage,

138
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:46,920
 wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands,

139
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,880
 are possibly the top sentence in the whole Bible

140
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,920
 to be taken out of context,

141
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,200
 usually by men,

142
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,440
 men trying to force their wives

143
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,940
 into an ungodly and unbiblical submission.

144
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,480
 Let me say right here and now,

145
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,720
 this is never okay, and this is sinful.

146
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,160
 As a result, on the other side,

147
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,480
 it has been strongly resisted by women over the centuries

148
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,480
 and led to a high degree of controversy and conflict.

149
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:31,920
 So what I wanna do now is attempt to put it into context.

150
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,200
 Firstly, some background.

151
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,840
 The Ephesians were familiar

152
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,240
 with the Roman social order of their day

153
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,640
 in which the husband had full authority

154
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,280
 over the wife and children and owned the slaves.

155
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:50,360
 Slaves were ruled until they were freed,

156
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,740
 which may not happen.

157
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:56,320
 Male children were under the father's authority

158
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,120
 until they became adults.

159
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,360
 Women and female children

160
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,740
 were under the man's authority all their lives.

161
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:12,380
 You'll notice that Paul did not try

162
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,640
 to change the social order,

163
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,240
 but he addressed the proper attitudes for living within it.

164
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:26,240
 Now, while the social order today, praise God I say,

165
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,000
 may be structured differently,

166
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,100
 the principles, the principles still apply.

167
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:37,340
 But what I wanna do first, I wanna ask you a question.

168
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:41,280
 If I use the word submission,

169
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,920
 what comes to mind?

170
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:49,920
 Maybe yielding, compliance, or even capitulation?

171
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:56,840
 But what if I told you

172
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,380
 that Jesus submitted himself to others?

173
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,760
 Philippians 2, five to eight,

174
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,280
 in your relationships with one another,

175
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:10,040
 have the same mindset as Jesus Christ,

176
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,320
 who being in very nature God did not consider equality

177
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,160
 with God something to be used to his own advantage.

178
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,040
 Rather, he made himself nothing

179
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,880
 by taking the very nature of a servant,

180
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,520
 being made in human likeness,

181
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,320
 and being found in appearance as a man,

182
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,920
 he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death.

183
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,360
 Yes, even death on a cross,

184
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,280
 which we celebrated a few moments ago.

185
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,880
 And what if I told you

186
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,680
 that Paul instructed followers of Jesus

187
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,960
 to submit to one another?

188
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,040
 Now, early in this chapter,

189
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,160
 Paul says in verses 18 and 21,

190
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,520
 the verse which precedes the first about submission of wives,

191
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,400
 he says this in verse 18,

192
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,560
 but be filled with the Spirit.

193
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,280
 And then in verse 21,

194
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:14,280
 submitting to one another out of reference to Christ.

195
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:20,560
 So what I wanna do now is put this passage into context.

196
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:26,480
 In verse 18, Paul is addressing spirit-filled believers.

197
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:32,000
 And he is saying, in effect,

198
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,600
 if you are filled with the Holy Spirit,

199
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,840
 you will, in verse 21,

200
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:45,720
 submit to Christ by submitting to each other.

201
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,880
 And in submitting to each other,

202
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,960
 verse 22, wives, submit to your husbands.

203
00:12:53,960 --> 00:13:00,120
 And as part of your submitting to each other,

204
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,640
 in verse 25 onwards,

205
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:07,440
 husbands submit to wives by loving them

206
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,520
 as Christ loved the church.

207
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:16,600
 But we have to realize,

208
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,000
 we have to recognize that submission

209
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,640
 normally carries with it a negative reaction.

210
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,640
 Have you ever thought of why that is?

211
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,160
 Why do we think of submission as negative?

212
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,000
 If Jesus modeled it and commended it,

213
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,840
 if Paul instructed us to do it,

214
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,520
 if it's a result of being filled with the Spirit,

215
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,920
 shouldn't we actually desire it?

216
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:55,800
 Paul gave two reasons for wives to submit to their husbands.

217
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,320
 Number one, Jesus is the head of the church,

218
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,840
 and the husband, as the head of the home,

219
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,040
 is head of the wife.

220
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,760
 But look, and guys, this is important.

221
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,680
 The apostles' instructions to the husbands

222
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:17,160
 were twice as long as those to the wives.

223
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:23,280
 And the central theme of all of this was love.

224
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,400
 (pause)

225
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:31,240
 This perspective presented a sharp contrast

226
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,240
 to Roman society where a wife

227
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,280
 was considered the husband's property.

228
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:43,360
 A husband was directed to demonstrate his love for his wife

229
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,520
 by loving her sacrificially,

230
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:50,880
 just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.

231
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,080
 And Jesus gave his all.

232
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:02,440
 The well-being of the wife was to be of primary importance,

233
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,440
 just as Jesus suffered to provide the needs of the church.

234
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,320
 The man was to care for his wife as he did his own body,

235
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,800
 even as the Lord loved the church.

236
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:21,000
 What an elevated view of marriage Paul presented.

237
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,440
 He went on to state that this relationship

238
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,840
 is a picture of relationship between Christ and the church.

239
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:36,800
 What a responsibility that places on a Christian couple.

240
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:43,920
 As I said earlier, some seem to assume

241
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,120
 that these biblical instructions to husbands and wives

242
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,120
 entitle the man to be domineering

243
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,440
 and require the wife to be subservient.

244
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:02,200
 Such assumptions could hardly be further from God's intent

245
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:07,360
 for he values each soul equally.

246
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:14,440
 My friends, submission is a choice.

247
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:21,680
 The decision to yield one's will to another.

248
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,640
 When Sandra and I do marriage preparation,

249
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:31,640
 we always point out that if a husband loves his wife

250
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:36,640
 the way that Christ loves the church

251
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,240
 and he gave his life for her,

252
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:44,600
 a wife would have no problem submitting to him.

253
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,960
 That's true.

254
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:53,200
 A husband will love his wife as Christ loved the church

255
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,640
 and gave himself for it.

256
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,840
 A wife would have no problem submitting.

257
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,240
 I love the way the message,

258
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,480
 we don't read the message version very much in church,

259
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,680
 but it expressed it wonderfully to me.

260
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,960
 Wives, understand and support your husbands

261
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,680
 in ways that show your support for Christ.

262
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,720
 The husband provides leadership to his wife

263
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,880
 in the way that Christ does to his church,

264
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,840
 not by domineering, but by cherishing.

265
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,280
 Just as the church submits to Christ

266
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,600
 as he exercises such leadership,

267
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,920
 wives should likewise submit to their husbands.

268
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:38,800
 This, my friends, is the model for Christian marriage.

269
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:44,960
 And look, I'm not pretending marriage is easy.

270
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,480
 After 50 years, no, sorry, 50 years and one day,

271
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,480
 it is still not easy.

272
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,480
 We are fallen creatures.

273
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,840
 We are sinners.

274
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:05,720
 However, if a husband and a wife will both submit to Christ,

275
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,480
 they're on the right track.

276
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,760
 I have an omission that might shock you.

277
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,120
 (audience laughing)

278
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,880
 I've been married twice.

279
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,960
 That's right, you heard it.

280
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:30,800
 I've been married twice to the same woman.

281
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,800
 Let me explain.

282
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:38,920
 When we were married on the 6th of July, 1974,

283
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,120
 at Sidcup Baptist Church in the UK,

284
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,280
 we would not have considered ourselves

285
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,600
 to be committed Christian.

286
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:51,640
 Our priorities were elsewhere, home, family, jobs, sport,

287
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,720
 noticeably Tottenham Hotspur Football Club.

288
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,360
 And didn't England do well last night, yeah.

289
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,000
 Less than a decade later,

290
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,680
 we recommitted our lives to Jesus Christ.

291
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,840
 And everything changed for us.

292
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,320
 Our priorities were turned upside down.

293
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,680
 I had a new wife.

294
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,160
 Sandra had a new husband.

295
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,640
 And after 40 years later, we can say,

296
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,640
 there is no comparison with married life,

297
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:34,760
 with Jesus at the center, to that without.

298
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,200
 To be fair, our marriage had been good.

299
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,000
 But this was so much better.

300
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,760
 I wanna pause now to pray.

301
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,960
 I realize there might be people here today

302
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,280
 who've come here and you've,

303
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,520
 maybe you've got spouses that are not following Jesus.

304
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,720
 I'd like to pray for them now.

305
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,240
 I also know, because I pray for it quite a lot,

306
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,520
 there are a lot of people here today

307
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,000
 who are seeking spouses.

308
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,600
 And yeah, I think this is better than Tinder, right?

309
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,120
 We're gonna pray, all right?

310
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:19,600
 So let's close our eyes and let's,

311
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,280
 if you're not in these categories,

312
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,080
 be praying for the people who are.

313
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:27,760
 Those people who have been faithfully following Jesus,

314
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,640
 but their spouse is not at the moment.

315
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,760
 We just pray for that spouse now.

316
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,160
 Lord, we pray for the light of your Holy Spirit

317
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,680
 to come upon them.

318
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,360
 Whatever they're doing now, they may be here in church,

319
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,760
 they may be at home, they may be watching online.

320
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,800
 Lord, I just pray a conviction of the Holy Spirit.

321
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,000
 And I pray in this place,

322
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,080
 we will see,

323
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:57,920
 we will see a flood of people

324
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,000
 where one spouse is following Jesus,

325
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,240
 become couples who are serving Jesus together.

326
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,520
 And I wanna pray for every person here today

327
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:13,200
 who is single but doesn't want to be.

328
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,360
 You've heard their heart.

329
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:20,400
 Lord, I just pray

330
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,600
 we give this to you, we leave this at the foot of your cross.

331
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,400
 Lord, I know I'm always trying to be a matchmaker.

332
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,560
 Lord, I'm not very good at it, but you are.

333
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,680
 Lord, I pray that you would just

334
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:40,400
 have your way, Lord, amongst our singles,

335
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,640
 singles in our society,

336
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,520
 and provide them with godly husbands and godly wives.

337
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,440
 In Jesus' name.

338
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,600
 Amen, I say amen to that, yeah, it's worth saying amen.

339
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,640
 Now, Paul then moves on to instructions

340
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,160
 for parents and children.

341
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:01,120
 He says this, "Children, obey your parents in the Lord."

342
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,120
 I think, again, we'd like the reading to finish there,

343
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:03,960
 wouldn't we?

344
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,000
 "Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.

345
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,240
 "Honor your father or mother,

346
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,080
 "which is the first commandment with a promise,

347
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,640
 "so that it may go well with you,

348
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,920
 "and that you may enjoy a long life on the earth."

349
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:22,320
 Fathers, and I think we can include mothers in this,

350
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,480
 do not exasperate your children.

351
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,120
 Instead, bring them up in the training

352
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,680
 and instruction of the Lord.

353
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,840
 Children were told to obey,

354
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,400
 because that was God's command.

355
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,640
 They were also directed to honor their parents.

356
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,680
 And by the way, those of us that have left home,

357
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,720
 that honor of parents doesn't stop

358
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,000
 the moment you leave home.

359
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,920
 If you've got elderly parents,

360
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,280
 you're still told to honor your parents.

361
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,640
 Honor goes beyond obedience,

362
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,040
 because it shows love and respect.

363
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,440
 Again, it's not very popular in our 21st century culture.

364
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,800
 I'll do what I like,

365
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,440
 has become the culture of today.

366
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,760
 But Paul gives us three reasons

367
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,120
 for children to obey their parents.

368
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:20,040
 Number one, verse one, because it is right.

369
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:25,920
 Verse two, because it is according to Scripture.

370
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,520
 And verse three, because it is accompanied

371
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,480
 by a promise of blessing.

372
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,840
 But what I wanna hone on in is Paul's statement this way.

373
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:43,840
 Fathers, do not exasperate your children.

374
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,400
 Obedience doesn't come naturally,

375
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,720
 so it must be taught by parents through discipline.

376
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:55,120
 But if we discipline in a spirit of wrath,

377
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,040
 it will result in provoking our child to anger.

378
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,880
 And we get this word exasperating.

379
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,360
 I don't know how many times you use that word,

380
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,840
 it's not in a common Linguist language.

381
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,560
 But to exasperate is to frustrate someone intensely,

382
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,520
 to make something feel futile,

383
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,680
 to provoke them to push their buttons.

384
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,080
 The Greek word literally means

385
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,840
 to make angry from close beside.

386
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,840
 Now the point of both of these verses is clear.

387
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:31,720
 While we are in authority over our children's lives,

388
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,280
 that authority is not absolute.

389
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:38,000
 We are bigger, we are more powerful.

390
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,160
 We can sin against them.

391
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,800
 We have louder voices.

392
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:47,960
 We have an adult mind, experiences, and vocabulary.

393
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,560
 And as a result of all that, God in verse four

394
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,640
 commands us to examine ourselves.

395
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,320
 We are not to use our authority haphazardly

396
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,160
 or in a way that injures them.

397
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:09,120
 Given what exasperation is not, what exactly is it?

398
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,000
 Well, I've come up with a list of ways

399
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,600
 that parents can exasperate their children.

400
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:21,280
 This is one that I observe here in Hong Kong and elsewhere.

401
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,800
 The first one won't surprise you

402
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,120
 is to have a favorite and let it be known.

403
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,800
 I need to say favoritism by a parent or a grandparent

404
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,960
 is painful.

405
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,800
 We have two sons and five grandchildren

406
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,440
 and people always ask us the question,

407
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,840
 which one is your favorite?

408
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,440
 I say all of them.

409
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,520
 But don't we show it sometimes?

410
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,240
 You know, you got two kids, one gets grade A's,

411
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,400
 the other one gets grade C's.

412
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,760
 Show that you love the one, gets grade A's the most.

413
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,200
 Or that one gets picked for the school team.

414
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,840
 We're not to have favorites.

415
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,200
 On the other hand, scolding.

416
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,920
 We see this a lot, don't we?

417
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:16,680
 Rather than taking action, scolding is loud, demeaning words.

418
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:23,160
 I have to say, scolding over a long time injures a child.

419
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,920
 Number three on the same lines really,

420
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,600
 being extremely inconsistent in discipline.

421
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,320
 All of us are inconsistent,

422
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:38,040
 but to fly off the handle without a plan is unfair.

423
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:41,680
 When we make up the rules on the spot

424
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:45,560
 and enforce them when we feel like it, it is also unjust.

425
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:51,240
 And that really links to number four, anger out of control.

426
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:56,000
 Anger is really at the root of many of these sins.

427
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,480
 We must get it under control.

428
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,000
 Disciplining out of anger is totally wrong.

429
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:09,600
 Fifthly, not being willing to ask forgiveness.

430
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,680
 We can give the impression to our children

431
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,880
 that we are never wrong.

432
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,960
 If your parents hear today one word

433
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,840
 to put into your vocabulary, sorry.

434
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:24,160
 I'm sorry.

435
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:31,560
 Sinful words that attack their identity.

436
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,640
 We've all heard it, you're a failure.

437
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,280
 You'll never amount to anything.

438
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:42,000
 Words that attack their identity are satanic and wicked.

439
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,160
 Andrew spoke about this last week, didn't he?

440
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,720
 Words that were spoken over him by a school teacher

441
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:53,600
 36 years ago took root.

442
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,360
 He's dealing with it now.

443
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:03,240
 Number seven, being emotionally distant.

444
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:08,240
 Individuals can withhold affection

445
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,920
 or salt to get their own way.

446
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,800
 Rather than talking about a conflict outright,

447
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,560
 they tend to withdraw when they get on their devices.

448
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:24,040
 Number eight, pushing for achievement beyond reason.

449
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,200
 Are we any tiger moms or tiger dads here?

450
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:30,320
 Crazy Rich Asians, you like that one, I loved it.

451
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:35,600
 As parents, we are called to encourage

452
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,240
 and challenge our children.

453
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,440
 But we need to realize their capacity.

454
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,200
 We can be too demanding and never satisfied.

455
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,920
 Number nine, being overbearing,

456
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,160
 overprotecting or domineering.

457
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,000
 Children need to grow into being their own person.

458
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,600
 When our words, our will, our personality

459
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,080
 constantly overrides theirs,

460
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,280
 they will be rightly frustrated.

461
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:07,400
 I love number 10, I see a lot of this in Hong Kong.

462
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:12,400
 Nitpicking, nitpicking, constant critique,

463
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:17,040
 criticism of small things.

464
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:21,760
 Wow, I think my observation in Hong Kong

465
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,360
 is that one of the things as parents,

466
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,400
 what we do is very rarely say, I love you, I'm proud of you.

467
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,680
 We show our love by telling them

468
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,160
 the things they've done wrong.

469
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:39,040
 We're not giving our child a feeling of acceptance,

470
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:43,160
 but pointing out everything that is wrong

471
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,320
 or could be improved.

472
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,840
 Number 11, again, we see this a lot, comparison.

473
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:52,680
 Children have different gifts and talents.

474
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,680
 If we don't recognize those differences,

475
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:58,360
 but instead insist that they be like a sibling

476
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,000
 or ourselves or somebody else,

477
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,560
 we are setting up for long-term anger.

478
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,560
 And of course, the last one is any sexual,

479
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,360
 physical, or emotional abuse.

480
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,160
 Does that list convict you?

481
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,120
 It does me.

482
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:23,440
 So I wanna pause and pray for our children now.

483
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,040
 I'm gonna ask Sandra to come up.

484
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,400
 Pray for our children,

485
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,840
 and let's use this to repent for our own shortcomings

486
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,320
 and pray for the children that God's given us

487
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,440
 in our families and in this church.

488
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,400
 Let's pray together.

489
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,240
 Close your eyes.

490
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,880
 - Father, we just come to you now in this moment.

491
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,800
 May we all say sorry.

492
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:55,120
 Sorry, the things that have been accepted by us as children.

493
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:01,200
 Sometimes it's us saying sorry to the adults in our lives,

494
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,840
 but may we take that moment just to say sorry

495
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,080
 if any of these things reflect in our hearts.

496
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,720
 I pray for the parents that we know

497
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,080
 that have said these things to us.

498
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,560
 May we leave those things of hurts and wounds

499
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,040
 at your throne room now,

500
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:23,760
 and help us to go forward for the children

501
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,080
 that we come across in our communities, in our families,

502
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:33,200
 that we can change our mindset to encourage them,

503
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,800
 to say that we're proud of them, that we love them,

504
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:40,200
 and have that moment that we can hear them speak to us

505
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,880
 and encourage us as we listen to them and vice versa.

506
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:51,200
 The children are gifts to us for a season.

507
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,040
 They're only with us.

508
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,120
 They grow very quickly,

509
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,200
 and we want to see the best of the best

510
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,880
 of these children of humans that are given to us for a season

511
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,520
 but you knew them right from the beginning

512
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,640
 in the mother's womb,

513
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,440
 and we want the very best for those children.

514
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,400
 And remember that we're all your children.

515
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:18,520
 We're your sons and daughters that we wanna be guided

516
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,280
 and love unconditionally like you love us unconditionally.

517
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,440
 Help us to love unconditionally.

518
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:30,720
 Help us to have a mindset of change.

519
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,880
 If we struggle in any of these areas,

520
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,040
 we ask that you help us go forward from today

521
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:42,080
 with a positive and a loving attitude in our lives

522
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,320
 to children, whatever age they are,

523
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,800
 whether they're young, whether they're growing up,

524
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,280
 whether they're youth, whether they're young adults,

525
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:57,280
 they all have and want that love to come from the parents

526
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:02,120
 and the communities that they're brought up in.

527
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,960
 So Father, I just pray, Father, today,

528
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,120
 we honor you that you're our Father,

529
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,280
 and we want you to guide us afresh.

530
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,840
 So bless everyone in this room

531
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,920
 and all the children that are out in Sunday church now

532
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,680
 that may they get the message today

533
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,600
 like we are getting the message from you,

534
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,520
 that you love us unconditionally.

535
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:27,480
 Help us to love unconditionally and to put into others

536
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,680
 and replicate what you've given us

537
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:34,120
 in a positive attitude, in Jesus' name, amen.

538
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,360
 - Amen, thank you, Sandra.

539
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:41,080
 So we've looked at submission between husbands and wives.

540
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:45,160
 We looked at submission between parents and children.

541
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:49,240
 And lastly, Paul addressed slaves and masters.

542
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,960
 I wanna read it to you.

543
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,440
 Verse five, "Slaves, obey your earthly masters

544
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,480
 "with respect and fear, with sincerity of heart,

545
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,500
 "just as you would obey Christ.

546
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,740
 "Obey them not only to win favor when their eye is on you,

547
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,180
 "but as slaves of Christ,

548
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,820
 "doing the will of God from your heart.

549
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:14,040
 "Serve wholeheartedly, as though you were serving the Lord,

550
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,460
 "not people, because you know that the Lord

551
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:21,660
 "will reward each one for whatever good they do,

552
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,580
 "whether they are slave or free.

553
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:28,240
 "And masters, treat your slaves in the same way.

554
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:32,860
 "Do not threaten them, since you know that he is both

555
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,920
 "their master and yours in heaven,

556
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:39,800
 "and that there is no favoritism with him."

557
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,680
 I think the principles that are outlined here

558
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:49,120
 can be employed, can be applied to employees

559
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,060
 and employers today.

560
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:55,960
 So when it says servants, I think we can read employees.

561
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:00,240
 They were to labor as if they were serving Christ,

562
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,880
 because that was and is God's will.

563
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,880
 When you go into work tomorrow,

564
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,920
 serve as if you are serving Christ.

565
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,840
 God himself would give the reward for such service.

566
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:19,000
 And masters, employers, were challenged

567
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,720
 to remember the Christian principles

568
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,540
 and treat their servants, treat their employees

569
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:29,140
 with the proper attitudes and concern for their welfare

570
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,960
 and to avoid threats.

571
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,080
 I think taking this whole lesson together,

572
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,480
 I think what the apostle Paul is actually saying,

573
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:41,440
 that Christianity brings unity

574
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,520
 and blessings in relationships

575
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:50,520
 by a change of heart, resulting in godly attitudes,

576
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:54,800
 and not by a change of social structure.

577
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,320
 His desire was that the Ephesians would fulfill their roles

578
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,080
 as God had appointed them,

579
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,600
 and that the results would benefit both them and the gospel.

580
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,080
 None of God's instructions were meant to be degrading.

581
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:14,000
 Rather, they were and are a guide

582
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,680
 to living a blessed godly life.

583
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:21,160
 God's direction for his followers

584
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:27,600
 are direct opposites of natural human inclinations.

585
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,760
 Let me say it again.

586
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:35,120
 God's direction for his followers

587
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:39,080
 and for their attitudes are direct opposites

588
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:42,120
 of natural human inclination.

589
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:47,880
 A change of heart is essential

590
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,680
 to truly follow his commands,

591
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:54,680
 and then his power and his grace are necessary

592
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:58,280
 to apply his instructions to daily living.

593
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:05,900
 Our workplaces are our mission fields.

594
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:10,780
 You don't need to go to the ends of the earth

595
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,300
 to go on mission.

596
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:17,660
 You are going on a mission tomorrow morning.

597
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:23,380
 Our workplaces are ripe for the gospel.

598
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:26,180
 I'll be honest with you.

599
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:32,260
 I reach more people for Christ as a businessman

600
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,820
 than I do as a pastor.

601
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:40,260
 I spend most of my time these days with Christians.

602
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:45,300
 So what we're gonna do now, we're gonna pause and pray.

603
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,300
 I want you to pray.

604
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,140
 I want to get a picture of your boss.

605
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:52,780
 You've probably not done that very much.

606
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:56,740
 Your boss, your bosses, your colleagues at work.

607
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:00,500
 We're gonna omit our shortcomings

608
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,980
 as representatives of Christ in the workplace.

609
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:08,900
 We're gonna pray for God to really work through us.

610
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:14,180
 If you're a boss here today, pray for your employees.

611
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:19,940
 You know, they will see Christ in you.

612
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:23,220
 They really will by the way you treat them.

613
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,020
 Let's pray.

614
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:26,860
 Let's pray.

615
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:32,380
 Father, we thank you for the people you've given us.

616
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:39,180
 For those of us that are employed or working,

617
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,860
 we thank you for our boss.

618
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,420
 We thank you for our workmates.

619
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:47,660
 For those of us that are in a position of influence,

620
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:50,540
 Lord, we pray for those who are under us,

621
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,380
 our staff, our colleagues.

622
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:57,380
 I pray that even tomorrow morning Lord,

623
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:00,100
 we're beginning of a new mission trip.

624
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:08,460
 Lord, I pray that Lord,

625
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,860
 that you would just give us the right attitudes.

626
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:15,780
 Lord, that people would see Christ through us.

627
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:19,380
 Whether we're a boss or an employee.

628
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:25,100
 And Lord, we repent of times in our lives, Lord,

629
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,380
 where we've shown the wrong attitude at work.

630
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:30,980
 Where we've not represented you well.

631
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:34,180
 Forgive us, Lord, and help us, Lord.

632
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:39,300
 Help us, Lord, to be your soldier and servant

633
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,660
 in our workplace.

634
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:46,140
 In Jesus' name, amen.

635
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:49,740
 As we come to the end of this today,

636
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,900
 I told you a lot of things you've got to do

637
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:52,900
 and you probably would say,

638
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:57,420
 look, it's too hard, can't do it.

639
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,660
 I cannot do it.

640
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:01,660
 And I got to say, you're absolutely right.

641
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:05,300
 All of these things I've been talking about today,

642
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,820
 you can't do.

643
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:13,020
 But you got to remember that this passage

644
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:17,060
 comes immediately after the instruction.

645
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:19,220
 And it is an instruction.

646
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,100
 Not a suggestion.

647
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,700
 By Paul to be filled with the Holy Spirit.

648
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,660
 When he says be filled with the Holy Spirit,

649
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,380
 it's a present continuous tense.

650
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:32,820
 It means continually be filled with the Holy Spirit.

651
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:35,340
 And I'm going to pray now for us, all of us,

652
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:39,420
 that we will be filled with the Holy Spirit today.

653
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:42,780
 And that that Holy Spirit will work in our relationships,

654
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:45,340
 whether with our spouses, with our children,

655
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,900
 or our parents, or in the workplace tomorrow.

656
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,500
 But believe me, you cannot do this on your own.

657
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:56,540
 Holy Spirit needs to come and to fill us.

658
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:59,100
 So as the worship band comes back, can we all stand?

659
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:08,900
 I realize that's quite a lot

660
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,140
 we've had to go through this morning.

661
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:17,220
 But I want to come before God now.

662
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:18,900
 And say, Lord, I need you.

663
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,380
 I need you to fill me.

664
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,100
 Just put your hands in front of you.

665
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:29,820
 Lord, we are a church here at the Vine

666
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,860
 that believes your word.

667
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,620
 We take you at your word.

668
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:35,820
 And even though in that passage today,

669
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,620
 there were some difficult phrases,

670
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:41,540
 some difficult things for some of our minds to comprehend.

671
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:44,580
 Your word tells us that how we can be filled

672
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,980
 with your Holy Spirit is to ask you.

673
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:50,700
 And we are your people, Lord.

674
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,940
 As I look out in front of me,

675
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:55,500
 different faces, different races, different backgrounds.

676
00:41:55,500 --> 00:42:00,300
 Some married, some single.

677
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:04,300
 Some parents, some children, some neither.

678
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:07,460
 And we are your people.

679
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,780
 And we are your people.

680
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,340
 Some children, some neither.

681
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:13,860
 Some bosses, some employees.

682
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:17,540
 What we have in common, Lord,

683
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:20,420
 is we need unity in our relationships.

684
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:23,820
 It's what we've been studying in Ephesians

685
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,260
 these past few weeks.

686
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:28,700
 And I want to say, Lord, I cannot do this.

687
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:32,020
 I need your Holy Spirit.

688
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:37,260
 So as we stretch our hands out, we say, come Holy Spirit.

689
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,540
 Come and fill us afresh.

690
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:43,620
 Guys, just bear with me.

691
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:44,940
 Just do this.

692
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,660
 If you don't feel like doing it, just come and do this.

693
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,940
 'Cause I think it's so important for us to do this.

694
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:52,620
 Stretch out and ask God to come into our relationships.

695
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:55,500
 I want to see better husbands.

696
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,500
 I want to see better wives, better parents, better children,

697
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:02,340
 better bosses, better employees, but it can only be done

698
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:07,460
 with the empowerment of the Holy Spirit.

699
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:10,540
 Don't you go from this sermon and say, must try harder

700
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:11,460
 and go home and try harder.

701
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,300
 You will fail.

702
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:16,660
 Oh yes, it'll work tomorrow and the day after possibly.

703
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:19,420
 But if you do it by must try harder, you're gonna fail.

704
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:24,300
 If you allow yourself to be captivated

705
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,940
 by the Spirit of God, if you allow yourself

706
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:29,700
 to be continually filled with the Spirit of God,

707
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:32,300
 I'm not saying it's easy.

708
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:35,580
 But it's the only way.

709
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:40,140
 Holy Spirit come, fill me afresh.

710
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:41,420
 Fill us afresh.

711
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:51,060
 Fill the husbands here, the wives, the parents,

712
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:55,060
