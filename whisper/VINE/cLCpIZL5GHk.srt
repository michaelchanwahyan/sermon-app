1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,780
 Father, that's just our prayer right now.

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,980
 Father, you would come and pour out upon us.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,120
 Father, we're so grateful

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,680
 that you're not contained to a building,

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,920
 that the home is a sacred place in your heart.

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,960
 So Lord, over every home right now,

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,680
 Lord, would you pour out your Spirit,

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,180
 particularly for us here in Hong Kong in this time.

9
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:28,480
 God, that song that we just sung is not,

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,080
 it's not just words on a page or lyrics on a screen.

11
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,640
 Father, it's our cry in this moment, in this hour.

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,680
 We need revival, Lord.

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,320
 And we ask for revival, Lord, to come in our lives,

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,200
 a revival for your Word, a revival of repentance, Lord,

15
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,840
 where we lay our sin before you,

16
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,160
 a revival, Lord, of just our hearts, Lord,

17
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,560
 but a revival of those spiritual disciplines

18
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,120
 that we need to root us in something

19
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,820
 that is stable in such chaotic times.

20
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:06,120
 Lord, a revival of a heart for justice

21
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,360
 to be able to stand on behalf of the marginalized

22
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,960
 and the oppressed in this time.

23
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,400
 Lord, a revival in song,

24
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,160
 that songs would be birthed in our hearts,

25
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,680
 that melodies would come to us,

26
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,920
 to be able to declare your goodness and your praises

27
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,420
 in this time and in this hour.

28
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,000
 Lord, I pray for a revival of love,

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,200
 a revival of love that would break down dividing walls,

30
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,320
 that would break those chains that we just sung of,

31
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,920
 a love that would go out from us,

32
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,520
 a love that is greater than the hate

33
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,960
 that so often can be in us.

34
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,720
 Lord, we just ask for revival of your Spirit.

35
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,240
 Lord, as we lean into what it is today,

36
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,960
 for your Spirit to flow upon your people,

37
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,960
 to come upon your church, Lord, I wanna pray now

38
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,480
 for the power of the Spirit to be at work, Lord.

39
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,360
 You know every need of every person watching this.

40
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,880
 You know their circumstance and their situation.

41
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,080
 You know what it is, Lord, that they are facing.

42
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,040
 And so, Lord, I wanna pray for your Spirit to be real.

43
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,860
 Lord, your Spirit, Lord, doesn't guarantee an immediate end

44
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,160
 to all of the troubles,

45
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,640
 but it does guarantee the presence of a God

46
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,480
 right in the midst of them, right here, right now.

47
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,580
 So I wanna pray for that presence, Lord,

48
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,960
 for your peace, your shalom, your power, your love

49
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,240
 to be poured out right now on every person

50
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,640
 that needs it most, Lord.

51
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,140
 The ones that are crying out for more of you,

52
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,480
 the ones that need for you to shift something

53
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,000
 in their lives, in their hearts, Lord.

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,880
 Would your presence now be there, Lord?

55
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,200
 And Lord, that's ultimately what we see in the book of Acts.

56
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,200
 We see the pouring out of your Spirit

57
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,320
 so that your presence would come on earth.

58
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,560
 And Lord, that was your prayer

59
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,160
 as you taught your disciples how to pray.

60
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,960
 You say, "Pray that the kingdom of God would come on earth

61
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,080
 "as it is in heaven."

62
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,360
 And Lord, that's our prayer,

63
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,480
 that your Spirit would fall upon the church in this hour

64
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,640
 and that you would move upon us, Lord,

65
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,200
 so that your presence would be known more in Hong Kong

66
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,000
 than it ever has been before.

67
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,100
 You are Emmanuel, God with us.

68
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,120
 Would you come, Lord, and manifest your heart

69
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,880
 through your church in this city, in this hour.

70
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,120
 And we thank you so much for this.

71
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,120
 In Jesus' name, everyone says, amen, amen.

72
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,640
 What a absolute blessing it is

73
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,240
 to be able to just gather together,

74
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,520
 even in this time of virtual church, of church everywhere,

75
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,960
 for us to meet like this

76
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,000
 and just sense God's presence with us.

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,960
 I don't know about you, but here in this room,

78
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,240
 we're here in the auditorium filming this right now.

79
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,440
 And I really felt a deep move of the Spirit of God

80
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,020
 as we were praying for chains to break,

81
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,720
 for God's presence to pour out,

82
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,720
 for the church to awaken, for the city to awaken.

83
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,760
 And that is so much what our heart is.

84
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,880
 And actually, so much of what I wanna preach about

85
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,460
 and talk about with us today,

86
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,120
 we're continuing our series in Acts

87
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,960
 that's called "An Unfinished Story."

88
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,840
 And we're calling it that because it is an unfinished story,

89
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,000
 that God is still at work today

90
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,120
 writing this current chapter of the Great Commission,

91
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,920
 writing the current chapter of the church,

92
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,440
 rising up to walk with people in their hour of need

93
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,840
 to bring the gospel to those that need it the most.

94
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,780
 That's the reason why we're a part of the story

95
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,920
 that began in Acts

96
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,360
 that is still out working through the church today.

97
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,400
 And we, as the church in Hong Kong,

98
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,180
 both the Vine and the many other churches

99
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,380
 represented in the city,

100
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,560
 we get the incredible profound privilege

101
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,520
 of writing the chapter for this generation.

102
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,280
 And part of that is going to be

103
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,320
 because the Spirit is upon us and in us.

104
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,840
 And that's what I wanna turn our attention to today

105
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,560
 as we continue our series.

106
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,320
 I wanna turn to that most famous passage

107
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,320
 in all of Acts, perhaps, Acts chapter two,

108
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,760
 where the Holy Spirit falls on the church.

109
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,760
 And I wanna open up this passage for us today

110
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,800
 in perhaps a different way

111
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,480
 than what you've experienced before.

112
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,880
 And I wanna actually dig into the roots of this story.

113
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,160
 And those roots are found in the Old Testament.

114
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,960
 And those roots provide so much light for us

115
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,360
 to understand both what happened in that moment

116
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,800
 in the first century as the Spirit poured out,

117
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,120
 but perhaps more importantly,

118
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,660
 for us to be able to understand

119
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,040
 what God wants to do in this moment.

120
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,400
 'Cause I don't know about you,

121
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,820
 but we need a fresh Pentecost.

122
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,640
 We need a fresh move of God's Spirit in this hour.

123
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,540
 And I believe as we go through the Scripture together today,

124
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,320
 you'll get a sense of what that sort of Spirit is like

125
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,040
 and what we should be praying for,

126
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,080
 for our city in this hour.

127
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,460
 I'm really excited about this.

128
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,720
 Let's open it straight up.

129
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,780
 Acts two, I'm gonna start in verse one.

130
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,440
 We're gonna read a bunch of the verses.

131
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,020
 When the day of Pentecost came,

132
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,760
 they were all together in one place.

133
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,500
 Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind

134
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,480
 came from heaven and lifted the whole house

135
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,840
 where they were sitting.

136
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,500
 They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire

137
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,080
 that separated and came to rest on each of them.

138
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,840
 All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit

139
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,440
 and began to speak in other languages

140
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,800
 as the Spirit enabled them.

141
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,340
 Now they were staying in Jerusalem,

142
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:04,680
 some God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven.

143
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,640
 When they heard this sound,

144
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,880
 a crowd came together in bewilderment or confusion

145
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,600
 because each one of them heard them speaking

146
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,520
 in their own language.

147
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,680
 Utterly amazed, they asked one another,

148
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,520
 are not all these men who are speaking Galileans?

149
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,040
 Then how is it that each of us hears them

150
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,120
 in our own native language?

151
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,600
 Parthians, Medes, Elamites, residents of Mesopotamia,

152
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,840
 Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus in Asia,

153
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,880
 Phagyra in Philebia, Egypt and parts of Libya,

154
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,480
 near Cyrene, visitors from Rome,

155
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,160
 both Jews and converts to Judaism,

156
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,680
 Cretans and Arabs, basically everybody

157
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,440
 that they could basically summarize in that passage.

158
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,080
 We hear them declaring the wonders of God

159
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,480
 in our own languages.

160
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,840
 Amazed and confused, they asked one another,

161
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,840
 what does this mean?

162
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,560
 Some, however, made fun of them.

163
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,560
 Ah, they've had too much wine.

164
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,760
 Then Peter stood up with the 11

165
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,640
 and raised his voice and addressed the crowd.

166
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,120
 Fellow Jews and all of those who live in Jerusalem,

167
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,480
 let me actually explain this to you.

168
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,280
 Listen carefully to what I say.

169
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,200
 These men are not drunk as you suppose,

170
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,200
 for it's only nine in the morning.

171
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,320
 It's only nine in the morning.

172
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,720
 I remember when I first read this passage,

173
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,320
 I was a new Christian, I was 19 years old,

174
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,720
 I was at university.

175
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,320
 And this became one of my favorite passages,

176
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,840
 not because of the spirit pouring out, that's great,

177
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,880
 but because of that final phrase.

178
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,600
 Peter is standing up in front of the people

179
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,440
 who all thought the disciples were drunk

180
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,120
 'cause they were babbling aloud to everybody

181
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,640
 in their own languages.

182
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,040
 And he says, they're not drunk,

183
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,080
 it's only nine in the morning.

184
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,440
 And I was 19 at university,

185
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,840
 and I remember reading that thinking to myself,

186
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,000
 there are lots of people at university

187
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,320
 that I know right now who are very likely

188
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,080
 to still be drunk at nine in the morning.

189
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,760
 So I don't know what it was like in the first century,

190
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,360
 but in our modern day at university,

191
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,880
 that was quite a common thing.

192
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,760
 I hope right now that is not a common thing.

193
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,280
 I hope right now you're sober and you're focused on this

194
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,400
 and we get to open the word of God together.

195
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,880
 There's so much in this story that is so relevant

196
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,600
 for what the spirit wants to do in and amongst us.

197
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,880
 And in the same way that Peter stood up before the crowd

198
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,080
 and said, let me explain this to you.

199
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,320
 I wanna just humbly over the next number of minutes,

200
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,440
 try to explain to you what I think the spirit wants to do

201
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,440
 in our church here in Hong Kong in 2022.

202
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,080
 To understand the power of this passage,

203
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,440
 we have to understand its Old Testament roots.

204
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,220
 And Luke invites us into that understanding

205
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,480
 right in the first verse.

206
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,040
 Let me read this to you again in Acts 2, verse one.

207
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,600
 He says, "When the day of Pentecost came,

208
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,560
 they were all together in one place."

209
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,520
 He mentions two Old Testament things.

210
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,120
 The first is Pentecost.

211
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,400
 Pentecost was the festival of celebration

212
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,000
 of the giving of the law on Mount Sinai.

213
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,640
 And that took place always 50 days

214
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,480
 after the celebration of Passover.

215
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,440
 Passover being that moment when God released Israel

216
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,880
 from their slavery of Egypt.

217
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,600
 And then 50 days later, they gathered around Mount Sinai.

218
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,600
 And as they gathered around Mount Sinai,

219
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,120
 Moses went up into the cloud of God's fire

220
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,640
 and God spoke and gave him the law,

221
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,720
 which he then brought down to the people.

222
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,800
 And the law was this really important thing.

223
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,120
 The law wasn't a bunch of rules and obligations

224
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,800
 and boundaries that was supposed to put a heavy yoke

225
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,720
 on the people.

226
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,240
 The law was God's way of saying, hey, you are now free.

227
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,000
 I've released you from slavery, now live free.

228
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,040
 And this is how you are to live free amongst you.

229
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,920
 You're to love me with all your heart, mind, soul,

230
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,560
 and strength.

231
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,040
 And you're to love one another.

232
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,560
 And you're to love your neighbors.

233
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,880
 And this is the way to do it.

234
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,640
 Follow this and you will live and you will flourish.

235
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,120
 Now, in the moment, there is this incredible thing

236
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,040
 that takes place that has a lot to say to the Acts 2 experience.

237
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,600
 I want to just jump to Exodus 19,

238
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,480
 where that story of the giving of the law at Mount Sinai

239
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,280
 takes place.

240
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,440
 I just want to read you a few quick verses here

241
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,440
 to help connect in to what happens in Acts 2.

242
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,160
 This is Exodus 19, starting in verse 16.

243
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,760
 "On the morning of the third day,

244
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,040
 there was thunder and lightning, with a thick cloud

245
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,880
 over the mountain and a very loud trumpet blast.

246
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,680
 Everyone in the camp trembled.

247
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,880
 Then Moses led the people out of the camp to meet with God.

248
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,120
 And they stood at the foot of the mountain.

249
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,480
 Mount Sinai was covered in smoke because the Lord

250
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,440
 had descended on it in fire."

251
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,280
 Remember that.

252
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,040
 The Lord has descended on it in fire.

253
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,440
 "The smoke billowed up from it like smoke from a furnace,

254
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,840
 and the whole mountain trembled violently.

255
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,920
 And the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder.

256
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,400
 Then Moses spoke," notice this, "and the voice of God

257
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,640
 answered him."

258
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,560
 The Hebrew word for the voice of God

259
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,600
 here is the word kolot, K-O-L-O-T.

260
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,400
 And that word is actually also the same word

261
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,720
 that's mentioned right at the start of this passage

262
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,600
 in verse 16 when it talks about the thunder and the lightning.

263
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,200
 So this word, which is translated a loud voice,

264
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,440
 can also be translated or used to represent thunder.

265
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,920
 And so what the writer here is trying to get across

266
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,840
 is that God spoke on that day.

267
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,720
 When the law went out, God spoke.

268
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,400
 And his voice was like thunder.

269
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,520
 It was this loud voice that everyone could hear.

270
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,320
 In fact, rabbis writing in the Talmud

271
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,560
 and teaching through the Talmud many years later,

272
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,080
 still up to this day, they teach something very important

273
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,160
 about this moment.

274
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,160
 They say in the thunder of God's voice,

275
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,520
 God spoke in 70 languages at once,

276
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,400
 70 being the idea of perfection, being

277
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,000
 the idea of all of the languages of the earth.

278
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,880
 And so Jewish people understand that at Pentecost,

279
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,600
 there was this outworking of God's voice

280
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,440
 in multiple languages so people could understand the law.

281
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,160
 So as the disciples are gathered there

282
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,320
 in the upper room in Acts chapter 2,

283
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,560
 celebrating the Passover, they would

284
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,760
 have been celebrating that kind of idea,

285
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,040
 that God has the ability to speak to all people.

286
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,400
 Let's go back to Acts 2 then and look at the Second Old

287
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,560
 Testament reference, just from that first verse.

288
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,360
 When the day of Pentecost came, they were-- here it is--

289
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,080
 all together in one place.

290
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,000
 Now on the surface, that just sounds like Luke

291
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,200
 is explaining that, hey, everybody

292
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,040
 is gathered together in the upper room, all 120 of them.

293
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,040
 Well, actually, it means more than that.

294
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,600
 Luke uses a specific Greek phrase,

295
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,000
 "all together in one place," which

296
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,440
 is the exact phrase that's only found in one

297
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,760
 other place in the Old Testament, the Greek version

298
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,000
 of the Old Testament.

299
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,600
 The Greek version of the Old Testament

300
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,440
 was in circulation at the time of this moment in Acts chapter

301
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,280
 2.

302
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,760
 And the place where that phrase is found,

303
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,600
 and the only other place in the Bible,

304
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,200
 is in the story of the Tower of Babel in Genesis 11.

305
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,280
 I want to take us to that story now,

306
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,800
 because that has something to say to us about Acts chapter 2.

307
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,440
 This is Genesis 11, verses 1.

308
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,480
 By the way, I love this in scripture.

309
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,720
 I hope you're loving this too.

310
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,480
 I love just digging into the Bible, connecting things,

311
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,080
 helping us to see the bigger picture.

312
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,520
 And if you stick with me, I think

313
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,640
 you're going to see the big picture here.

314
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,480
 Genesis 11, verse 1.

315
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,920
 "Now the whole world had one language and a common speech.

316
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,680
 As men or people moved eastward, they

317
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,400
 found a plain in Shinar, and there they

318
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,920
 were all together in one place."

319
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,200
 There it is, the same phrase, "all together in one place."

320
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,400
 So when Luke writes this about the disciples in Acts chapter

321
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,800
 2, he's trying to connect that moment back to here,

322
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,160
 to the Tower of Babel.

323
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,040
 Now, we don't have time to read the whole of Genesis 11

324
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,800
 right now.

325
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,720
 Let me summarize basically the story.

326
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,880
 It might be familiar to many of you.

327
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,560
 Up until this point in humanity's growth

328
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,920
 and humanity's development, there was just one language,

329
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,800
 one tongue.

330
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,120
 And here, the God's people had gathered all together

331
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,480
 in one place, but they were about to do

332
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,160
 two things that were in rebellion to God's word.

333
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,560
 This is not a proud moment for humanity.

334
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,280
 This is a moment where they continue

335
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,480
 to rebel in their sin against all that God has done.

336
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,040
 And they do two things to do that.

337
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,000
 The first is that they decide to build a tower.

338
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,160
 They want to build this massive construct

339
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,800
 to be able to reach into the heavens.

340
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,440
 Why?

341
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,840
 Because they believe if they could get into the heavens,

342
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,000
 they would become God.

343
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,960
 See, humanity at this point wasn't

344
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,800
 satisfied with just being the image of God.

345
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,320
 They wanted to be God themselves.

346
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,320
 They wanted to be in the heavens so they

347
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,280
 could take the power of heaven and have

348
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,600
 dominion over themselves.

349
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,520
 Fascinating.

350
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,880
 This is the same temptation, the same sin

351
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,640
 that actually led Adam and Eve into the original sin.

352
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,760
 If you remember in the garden in Genesis 3,

353
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,400
 that temptation from the enemy was

354
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,240
 to take the fruit so that they could become God,

355
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,760
 so that they could be God themselves.

356
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,040
 That same temptation is now happening all over again

357
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,920
 as they decide to build this tower.

358
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,560
 And they do this in a false sense of unity.

359
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,120
 Let's all gather together in one place.

360
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,160
 Let's do this now so that we can see God

361
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,520
 and actually become like God.

362
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,680
 That's the first thing.

363
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,760
 Here's the second thing.

364
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,000
 It's found in verse 4 of Genesis chapter 11.

365
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,120
 Let me read this to us.

366
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,720
 "Then they said this, 'Come, let us build ourselves a city,"

367
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,680
 there it is, "with a tower that reaches to the heavens

368
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,040
 so that we may make a name for ourselves,"

369
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,000
 now notice this, "and not be scattered over the face

370
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,120
 of the whole earth."

371
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,760
 The primary thing that God spoke over humanity in its creation

372
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,080
 in Genesis 1 and 2 was that they were to be fruitful,

373
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:47,000
 to be blessed, and to go out and to be scattered

374
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,720
 over all the earth, subduing the earth, flourishing it,

375
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,600
 being God's helper to help to flourish all of creation

376
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,360
 and bring it into its utmost shalom.

377
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,320
 That was God's command for humanity in Genesis 1 and 2,

378
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,880
 one of the primary things he had created humanity for.

379
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,960
 And now here in Genesis 11,

380
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,800
 God's people are not just rebelling against God

381
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,320
 because they wanna be God,

382
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,680
 they're rebelling against God's demanded

383
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,160
 and created destiny for humanity,

384
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,320
 which is to go into the world, subdue it,

385
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,560
 and to flourish it and bring it into shalom.

386
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,360
 They're standing against the very cool

387
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,680
 that God had given humanity right there at the start.

388
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,000
 And they say, "No, we're gonna stay here all in one place,

389
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,620
 build a tower so that we are not scattered over the earth,

390
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,720
 so that we're not spread out all over the place,

391
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,480
 defying the very thing that God wanted."

392
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,560
 See, this whole Babel and narrative

393
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,040
 is basically humanity fighting against God,

394
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,400
 trying to say, "We can do it ourselves, we don't need him.

395
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,840
 All we need is to be him, we can dominion ourselves,

396
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,720
 and we're gonna stand against the very cooling

397
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,240
 that is upon us in our creation and not spread out,

398
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,080
 but stay in this sense of unity together."

399
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,400
 I want you to see why this is such an affront to God.

400
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,880
 You see, God wanted a free and diverse people

401
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,200
 scattered across all the earth,

402
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,320
 kind of taking his values and his image,

403
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,640
 representing his values and his image.

404
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,880
 Babel wanted a unified, homogenized group of people

405
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,800
 in one place, representing their own values

406
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,600
 and their own image.

407
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,680
 So you can see the depth of how this is rebelling

408
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,960
 against the very thing that God wants.

409
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,560
 And because of this, God in Genesis 11 comes down.

410
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,280
 I love when it says that he comes down,

411
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,480
 they're building this big high tower,

412
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:42,480
 but he comes down to them and he confuses their speech.

413
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,600
 He does this because he knows that with one tongue,

414
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,000
 they will be able to work together

415
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,060
 in this false sense of unity and try to build this tower.

416
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,760
 So he confuses their tongue, their language

417
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,440
 into multiple languages,

418
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,680
 so they wouldn't be able to work in cohesion together.

419
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,120
 Confusion sits at the center of the Babel story.

420
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:07,120
 In fact, Babel comes from the Hebrew word for confusion.

421
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,440
 It's also the same word in English that we get for Babel.

422
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,040
 If you ever heard anyone say, "I couldn't understand

423
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,800
 "a word they said, it was like they were babbling."

424
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,560
 Well, that comes from this same story.

425
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,280
 And so God comes and he judges them,

426
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,080
 curses them by giving them these multiple languages.

427
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,720
 But here's the fascinating thing,

428
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,640
 in that God actually is blessing them

429
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,920
 'cause he's actually moving them back

430
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,800
 into the very thing that he'd always called humanity to.

431
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,080
 And that was to scatter around the earth

432
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,720
 and to bring that diversity to see the world flourish.

433
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,480
 And so in bringing that confusion to language,

434
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,520
 God stops the building of the tower,

435
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,400
 but he also facilitates his very destiny for humanity,

436
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,680
 spreading them out over all the earth.

437
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:56,840
 Now, both that Pentecost context and the Babel context

438
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,200
 is exactly what we need to have in our mind

439
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,320
 as we come back to our story in Acts chapter two.

440
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,480
 Let me now connect some of these dots for you

441
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,760
 and show you this in the scripture.

442
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,460
 I think this will blow your mind.

443
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,520
 Genesis, sorry, Acts two, verse one onwards.

444
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,640
 Let me read this to us again.

445
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,720
 "When the day of Pentecost came,

446
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,120
 they were all together in one place.

447
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,800
 Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind."

448
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,600
 It's the same concept of the thunder

449
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,360
 that took place on the top of Mount Sinai.

450
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,080
 "Came from heaven and filled the whole house

451
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,400
 where they were all sitting.

452
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,120
 They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire."

453
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,920
 Again, connection to Sinai,

454
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,860
 the idea of the fire falling on God's people.

455
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,500
 "That separated and came to rest on each of them.

456
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,380
 All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit

457
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,180
 and began to speak in other languages."

458
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,660
 All of them, there it is again.

459
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,380
 "They'd all gathered around the base of Mount Sinai,

460
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,740
 all of them to hear the word."

461
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,820
 Here they are, all of them together again.

462
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,680
 "And they speak in other languages."

463
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,860
 Where Babel had confused language,

464
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,900
 here now they're speaking

465
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,100
 in these multiple different languages.

466
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,560
 Let's carry on, verse five.

467
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,300
 "Now they were staying in Jerusalem,

468
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,980
 God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven."

469
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,320
 Notice this, every nation under heaven.

470
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,340
 This is the outworking of that Babel moment

471
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,300
 where they were scattered around the world.

472
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,100
 Well, here in Acts 2,

473
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,920
 that scattering is being brought back together

474
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:24,540
 as all the nations of the earth are there.

475
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:27,020
 Verse six, "When they heard this sound,

476
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,860
 a crowd came together in confusion."

477
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:32,900
 There's that idea of confusion linked back to Babel.

478
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,500
 "Because each one heard them speaking

479
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,920
 in their own language."

480
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,180
 All right, here it is, speaking in their own language.

481
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,420
 What's happening in Acts chapter two

482
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,540
 is the significant outworking of what took place

483
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,660
 in Exodus 19 with the original Sinai moment

484
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,540
 and in Genesis 11 with Babel.

485
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,920
 In fact, this is the undoing of Babel.

486
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,180
 This is God stepping into human history

487
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:01,140
 and reversing all that he had done in that Babel moment.

488
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,420
 For in Babel, where humanity rebelled against him,

489
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,100
 wanted to become him,

490
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,980
 wanted to not live out the destiny

491
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,740
 that he had called them to,

492
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,460
 God comes down and confuses their language

493
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,780
 so that they weren't able to be able to be working together.

494
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,620
 Now in Acts chapter two,

495
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,140
 as God decides to start the church,

496
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,700
 how does he birth that church?

497
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,980
 He pours out his spirit

498
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:29,340
 so those that were once opposed to one another

499
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:32,220
 are now able to come back together again.

500
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:36,780
 What God is doing is undoing that curse of Genesis 11

501
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,860
 and restating this for the church.

502
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,560
 Basically at the birth of the church,

503
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,140
 he's drawing a line in the sand

504
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,980
 and saying this is what the church is gonna be about.

505
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:49,020
 The church is gonna be a place where the gospel,

506
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:52,120
 my word is gonna be now be able to be understood

507
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,220
 by people from every language, every culture,

508
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,860
 every background, every diverse person

509
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,860
 is going to be able to hear the gospel

510
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,300
 in their own language.

511
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,940
 The purpose of the church is to take the word of God

512
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,980
 and to bring it into the cultures of this world

513
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,100
 with the hope of Jesus.

514
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,300
 And here's the fascinating thing.

515
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,260
 In Sinai, what you see in that story

516
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:19,680
 is a voice of God in all of those 70 languages

517
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,360
 going out and speaking God's law to people.

518
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,100
 What we have now in this moment

519
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,820
 is God writing his law on human hearts.

520
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,940
 No longer tablets of stone, but now human hearts.

521
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:34,020
 And God once again speaks his voice over all people,

522
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,900
 but it's different this time.

523
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,580
 In Acts chapter two, that voice comes through

524
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,420
 the individual members of the church,

525
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:44,360
 of that gathered group of people in the upper room.

526
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,780
 This is no longer the thunder that's happening in the clouds.

527
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,340
 This is no longer one person having to go up

528
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,860
 to the top of a mountain to understand God.

529
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:57,040
 Now God's word is coming out through the church,

530
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,180
 through his people.

531
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,780
 And when I say that, I'm not talking about Andrew Gardner,

532
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,500
 the senior pastor of a church or any other senior pastor.

533
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,620
 I'm talking about the people of the church,

534
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,740
 the men and the women in that moment

535
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,620
 who were gathered there in the upper room

536
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,300
 became by the spirit of God,

537
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:15,100
 the mouthpiece of God to a broken world.

538
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,700
 And I want you to hear this today.

539
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:20,700
 When we pray for a spirit-filled church in 2022,

540
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,420
 what we're actually praying for is that you would become

541
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:28,820
 a mouthpiece for the word of God in your sphere of influence,

542
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,460
 that you would become someone who is so filled

543
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,940
 with the spirit of God that you get to share

544
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:37,620
 the goodness of God, his law, his freedom, his love,

545
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:41,020
 his mercy, all the things that are in God's heart

546
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,800
 with the people that God has placed around you.

547
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,180
 What happens in Acts two is God basically saying,

548
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,260
 this is the way the church will be.

549
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:53,500
 Not one or two special people with some special voice,

550
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:58,180
 but my whole body infused by my spirit,

551
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:02,500
 able to now speak my word out into the world.

552
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,340
 What an encouragement that is for us.

553
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,260
 What that means is that church is this community,

554
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,560
 this body together at work,

555
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:13,900
 believing together that God is at work in us.

556
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,220
 See, what's happening in Acts chapter two

557
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:19,340
 is not some sort of gift of the Holy Spirit

558
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,020
 for a special group of people.

559
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:24,780
 It's God saying, this is the way the church will be.

560
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:28,100
 And it's almost as if God is basically saying this,

561
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:32,740
 open up your mouths, loosen your tongues,

562
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:37,740
 and speak out the beauty of my gospel for the time is now.

563
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:42,460
 So how do we take all of this and apply it to Hong Kong,

564
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,740
 apply it to the divine, apply it to who we are

565
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,580
 in this moment?

566
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:48,500
 What is Acts two saying to us?

567
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,860
 What should we be praying for?

568
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:54,940
 Well, the first thing it says to us is reconciliation.

569
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,460
 The whole point of Acts chapter two

570
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,900
 is that all of these different nations

571
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,580
 now gathered in Jerusalem in this moment

572
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,220
 are able to hear the gospel,

573
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:08,100
 hear the reconciling work of Jesus,

574
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,580
 his death and resurrection,

575
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,400
 reconciling us through our broken relationship with God,

576
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,780
 restoring that relationship

577
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,500
 so we can be in relationship with him again.

578
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,940
 Reconciling us, not just with God, but with one another

579
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,300
 so that we can love him

580
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,120
 with all of our heart, mind, soul and strength,

581
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,020
 but also love our neighbor as ourselves.

582
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,260
 And you gotta remember that in Acts chapter two,

583
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,620
 all of these different nations that were represented,

584
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,280
 they didn't get on with one another.

585
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,900
 They had issues with one another.

586
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,580
 There was hatred and division.

587
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,740
 There was divide,

588
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,100
 'cause that is what happened in Genesis 11.

589
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,460
 But here is God by his spirit saying,

590
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,500
 this is what my church is gonna be about.

591
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,420
 If my church stands for anything,

592
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:47,420
 it has to stand for this, reconciliation.

593
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,860
 Through the love of Christ,

594
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,260
 through the power of the spirit,

595
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,420
 my church gets the great privilege

596
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:55,540
 of taking the hands of those that are broken,

597
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,700
 of those that are divided against each other

598
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,180
 and bringing them back together again.

599
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:03,060
 And what a message that is for us here in Hong Kong.

600
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,700
 Oh, how we need the spirit of God

601
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,000
 to pour out in this city in this hour,

602
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,180
 to bring together those that are divided.

603
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,080
 I mean, think about it.

604
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,740
 We need the spirit of God so much

605
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,900
 to see the Hong Kong Chinese and the mainland Chinese

606
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:20,020
 come back together in a place of love and respect.

607
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,940
 We need the spirit of God to be at work in our city

608
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:26,180
 so that those that are politically divided at this time,

609
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,420
 so that those families

610
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,340
 that can't talk to each other anymore,

611
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,160
 those people that can't be in the same room

612
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,180
 as that other person,

613
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,800
 those ones that have been deeply hurt

614
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,540
 by the actions of another

615
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:38,180
 can find through the love of Christ

616
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:41,600
 the ability to be reconciled with the other person.

617
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,220
 Oh, how we need the spirit to move upon our city,

618
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,720
 to move upon the church

619
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,960
 so that we can stand against racism

620
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,920
 in every single one of its forms

621
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,920
 so that anyone who is marginalized,

622
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,440
 who is set aside, who is seen as the other,

623
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,760
 who is brought down,

624
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,040
 who is seen as less of a human being than another person,

625
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:03,260
 the church could stand up with a loosened tongue

626
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:06,600
 in its mouth and stand for justice

627
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,580
 and stand against the ways

628
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:11,900
 in which humanity is still trying to separate people

629
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,760
 and instead see through the power of God,

630
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,760
 unity and reconciliation come again.

631
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,320
 What a privilege this is.

632
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,600
 That's a spirit-filled church, my friends.

633
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,880
 A spirit-filled church is not defined actually

634
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,600
 by whether the members of that church

635
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,200
 are manifesting some sort of gift of the spirit or not.

636
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,600
 Acts 2 teaches us this,

637
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,360
 that a spirit-filled church

638
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,080
 is a church that defends the poor,

639
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,520
 that stands for justice,

640
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:44,000
 that actually ministers in reconciliation

641
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,520
 for those that are opposed to one another.

642
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,360
 That's what a spirit-filled church is.

643
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,440
 When I pray for the vine to be filled with the spirit,

644
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,920
 of course, I want the gifts of the spirit amongst us.

645
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,800
 And we pray for that here at the vine all the time.

646
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,880
 But when we're actually praying in line with Acts 2,

647
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,560
 what we're praying for is the breaking down

648
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,100
 of dividing walls and a reconciliation

649
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,520
 to come upon our city like never before.

650
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,840
 That, my friends, is a spirit-filled church,

651
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:14,840
 one that can reach out in love to broken and divided people

652
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,300
 and a church that can deal with the broken

653
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,300
 and divisions within itself as well.

654
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,500
 This is a word for us as much as it is

655
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,120
 for us to bring together those divided outside of us.

656
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,160
 We need to work hard to make sure

657
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,000
 that there aren't divisions in our own midst.

658
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,860
 Within the walls of the church,

659
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,880
 there are many things that divide us.

660
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,880
 And we, if we pray for the spirit like in Acts 2,

661
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,240
 we stand on behalf of unity.

662
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,760
 This is why I love the fact that right now here in Lent,

663
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,760
 we're doing the One Campaign,

664
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,220
 the One Hearing the Word Campaign.

665
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,520
 This campaign has been put together

666
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,940
 by multiple different churches in the city,

667
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,760
 Chinese churches, international churches,

668
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,680
 different backgrounds, denominations,

669
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,800
 different beliefs even about the spirit

670
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,000
 and other things like that.

671
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,180
 These churches have come together to put together

672
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:05,780
 a reading plan and a devotional plan in unity together.

673
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:09,080
 That's a beautiful picture of what reconciliation

674
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,880
 and the power of the spirit can look like upon the church.

675
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,520
 If you're not doing this, you can go onto your app store,

676
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:18,800
 download One Hearing the Word HK, get it on your phone,

677
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,600
 and you can continue to join with many others

678
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,920
 in the city right now in an act of unity,

679
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,960
 of listening to the scriptures together

680
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,400
 so that we might be a unified body

681
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,440
 offering reconciliation in this hour.

682
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,280
 The other thing we see here that we can definitely apply

683
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,480
 to our context and situation is the beauty

684
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,920
 and the importance of cultural diversity.

685
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:46,000
 In Acts 2, what we see here is God speaking out.

686
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,640
 And like I say, almost reversing Babel,

687
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,640
 but another way of thinking about it is not reversing it

688
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,360
 'cause reversing Babel would be like

689
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,880
 taking everybody's language and bringing us back

690
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,080
 to one language and one common tongue.

691
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,160
 Rather than reversing Babel, what God does here

692
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,540
 is actually overcomes the curse

693
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:04,280
 by bringing his word in multiple languages.

694
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,840
 In other words, he doesn't get rid of the multiple languages.

695
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,040
 He doesn't try to push humanity back to one culture,

696
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,000
 back to one language.

697
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,600
 No, God celebrates the beauty of human diversity

698
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,580
 and variety, and he celebrates it by speaking the gospel

699
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:22,040
 in their culture, through their language.

700
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,000
 That's the beauty.

701
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 He doesn't try to reduce culture, reduce language,

702
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,280
 reduce customs.

703
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:31,200
 No, he celebrates the diversity by bringing his word

704
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,720
 in multiple cultures and contexts.

705
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,860
 This is something that the church has not always gotten right

706
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,100
 in church history.

707
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,280
 We just have to look at the Crusades and the power

708
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,740
 and the way in which the church has colonized

709
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,420
 many other countries, trying to get those countries

710
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:49,080
 to be more like the Western culture,

711
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,960
 more like a white person's culture, if you will,

712
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,360
 rather than actually recognizing and honoring

713
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,120
 the culture of the homeland.

714
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:00,680
 What we see here in Acts 2 is God honoring culture diversity

715
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:04,480
 but also bringing the gospel within that cultural diversity.

716
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,280
 See, we are to take the gospel not by force,

717
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,680
 not with the sword, not with violence,

718
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,480
 not trying to change other cultures

719
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,360
 to become like the culture of the West.

720
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:18,000
 We're to take the gospel, which is the kingdom culture,

721
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,840
 not some white culture or some Western culture,

722
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:24,040
 the kingdom culture, and plant that as a seed

723
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,840
 in the soil of every culture.

724
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,040
 And God waters that seed and he brings the conversion

725
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,240
 and the transformation of people's lives

726
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,400
 within their unique, beautiful culture.

727
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,820
 That's what we see here in Acts 2.

728
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:41,720
 God's celebrating that diversity and yet speaking his gospel

729
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,080
 and his hope and his life into it.

730
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,400
 And we as a church, if we are wanting a spirit-filled

731
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,960
 Acts moment right now, what we're actually saying

732
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,080
 is that we will continue to be a church

733
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:59,080
 that deconstructs any attempt to try to homogenize people,

734
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,680
 try to make people all the same, think the same,

735
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,080
 look the same, act the same.

736
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:06,400
 And instead, we would stand for the kingdom values

737
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,000
 that God has for the church,

738
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,160
 values that see the beauty and the richness and diversity

739
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:16,160
 in cultural experiences, and that is enabled to build

740
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:19,960
 a church of multiple culture but one heart.

741
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,920
 Listen, multiple culture, one heart.

742
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,080
 Multiple culture, one story.

743
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,740
 Multiple cultures but kingdom values.

744
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,120
 That's what we see happening in Acts 2.

745
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,040
 That's what we get called to here.

746
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,480
 And you know, here at the Vine, I've been so grateful

747
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,680
 to our asylum seeker and refugee community

748
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:41,280
 and how they brought this diversity amongst us.

749
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,480
 You know, people often say that the Vine has done so much

750
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,360
 for that community, but we here at the Vine always say

751
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,720
 that that community has done way more for us.

752
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,520
 The fact that they have been amongst us,

753
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,560
 sharing their language, their backgrounds, their cultures,

754
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,240
 whether from Africa, from Southeast Asia,

755
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,280
 from the Middle East, we've been so blessed

756
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,760
 to be able to worship on a Sunday

757
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,440
 when we gather in person here

758
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,360
 and see that multicultural environment that we have

759
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,440
 because of the wonder of our asylum seekers.

760
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,380
 We must, as a church, continue to promote that diversity.

761
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,880
 We must be looking to break down divided walls

762
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,560
 between cultures and backgrounds.

763
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:19,060
 And things like what we see when others try

764
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,560
 to create one culture, when others try

765
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,640
 to dominate another culture through aggression,

766
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,960
 what we're seeing right now in Ukraine,

767
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,660
 we have to stand against that in prayer, stand against it,

768
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:33,600
 because we believe that actually there is beauty

769
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,560
 and the gospel will be found in every language group

770
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:41,120
 and every culture, and that's a good, beautiful thing.

771
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,160
 So what does it mean for us to be a spiritful church?

772
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,040
 How do we take Acts 2, apply it to our lives?

773
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,640
 Well, it means that we want to pray for this reconciliation,

774
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,420
 both in our own lives, in our own hearts,

775
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:55,420
 with those that we are the other towards,

776
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:58,040
 but also so that we can model what that reconciliation

777
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,880
 looks like in Hong Kong in 2022.

778
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,280
 And it means that we can continue to stand

779
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:06,240
 for the beautiful diversity that we see in Hong Kong,

780
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,800
 that we see in this city,

781
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,920
 that we can really honour that diversity

782
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,140
 and see within our churches the model

783
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:15,160
 of people from different languages and cultures

784
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:19,560
 and backgrounds, yet finding unity through the life,

785
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,840
 death and resurrection of Jesus.

786
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,560
 It's the gospel that unifies us,

787
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,560
 and we come together in that.

788
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,800
 You see, the unity of the spirit is not found

789
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:34,680
 in monoculture, it's found in the beauty

790
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,360
 and the celebration of human variety.

791
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,760
 That's who we are, and we should pray into that,

792
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,180
 speak into it and believe it.

793
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:45,900
 And when we ask for the spirit to come upon us,

794
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,660
 that's what we should expect,

795
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:50,420
 a heart to reconcile with the other

796
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:53,380
 and a heart to celebrate the beautiful variety

797
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,640
 that we see within our humanity.

798
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,580
 I wanna pray for that over us right now

799
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,580
 and speak that word of life into us.

800
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,860
 Let's pray.

801
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:05,500
 Father, we are so grateful for this passage from Acts 2.

802
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,940
 So grateful for the way in which you poured out your spirit

803
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,680
 at the starting point, the birthing point of the church,

804
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,780
 and brought that church into a place

805
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,620
 where they could understand the importance of reconciliation,

806
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:20,160
 that these Galileans could speak the gospel

807
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,860
 in the languages of all of the world.

808
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:27,220
 Galileans who at one point had been distrustful of Gentiles,

809
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:30,380
 who had been taught to stay away from them.

810
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,540
 Now they were beginning to see that God's heart

811
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:35,140
 was always to bless every nation,

812
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:39,620
 to bring all of those nations under His culture,

813
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,020
 the kingdom culture.

814
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:44,340
 And Father, as we look at Hong Kong in this hour,

815
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:47,540
 we wanna pray that you would break down our dividing walls.

816
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,460
 Lord, we recognize that in the last three years,

817
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,460
 there has been so much that has created division

818
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,340
 in this city.

819
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:55,580
 There is so much still to this day that creates division.

820
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,260
 Lord, would you break our hearts?

821
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:00,040
 Would your spirit move upon your church

822
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,860
 to be a reconciling body, to be a body of justice,

823
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,300
 to stand on behalf of the marginalized,

824
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:09,300
 to stand on behalf of the cultures that are being oppressed

825
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,420
 and be able to bring voice, Lord,

826
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,380
 to those that need it the most.

827
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,100
 Lord, would we reconcile those

828
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,620
 that are opposed to one another?

829
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:21,060
 And would it be done not through some great words

830
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:24,340
 or through some great theory or strategy,

831
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:27,580
 but through your spirit and through your love.

832
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:30,060
 And Lord, we pray for that beautiful diversity.

833
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:32,000
 We thank you for the incredible cultures

834
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,820
 that you've created in this world

835
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:37,380
 that speak so beautifully of who you are.

836
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,900
 And Lord, we ask that the gospel now would come

837
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,380
 to every tribe, every language group.

838
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,300
 We're thankful that in Revelations,

839
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,900
 we get that picture of every tribe, every culture,

840
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,020
 every language bowing before you.

841
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:53,220
 Again, not one tribe, not one culture, not one language,

842
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,620
 beautiful diversity standing before you.

843
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:58,540
 Lord, I pray that the vine and the churches in our city

844
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:01,740
 would stand on behalf of that diversity today,

845
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,780
 that we would look at those diverse groups

846
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,420
 that are perhaps marginalized,

847
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,820
 maybe the ethnic minorities in our midst,

848
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:11,020
 and we would be a church that would reach out towards them

849
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:14,860
 and help walking with them in times that are difficult.

850
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:17,620
 Lord, that we would honor all cultures,

851
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,100
 honor all backgrounds,

852
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,460
 recognizing that your gospel is at work

853
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,300
 amongst all your people.

854
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:27,140
 And that we would do this not for our glory, but for yours.

855
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:30,940
 Lord, fill us with your spirit, Lord.

856
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:33,380
 We need it now more than ever.

857
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:36,380
 If we're gonna be a church of evangelism in 2022,

858
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,740
 may it be reconciliation,

859
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:42,060
 and may it be to all of the beautiful cultures

860
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,740
 that you've placed around us.

861
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:47,260
 And we thank you for this in Jesus' name.

862
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,300
 Everyone says, amen.

863
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,240
 Amen, let's go into a time of worship

864
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,720
 as we begin to really sing out for that spirit to come,

865
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,500
 to break down those dividing walls,

866
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,340
 to change our lives and our hearts,

867
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:00,300
 and to be able to walk out this message,

868
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,740
 not just hear a message,

869
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,920
 but actually walk it out in our day-to-day lives.

870
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,460
 Let's worship now together.

871
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,820
