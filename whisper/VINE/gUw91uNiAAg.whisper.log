[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   Welcome to The Vine if you're new here.
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.280]   My name is Andrew.
[00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.680]   I'm one of the pastors here.
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.000]   Welcome if you're online with us right now.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.080]   We're so grateful that you join us.
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.280]   Some of you join us each and every week from around the world online.
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.120]   We're so glad you're here.
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.640]   Welcome to everybody in the overflow outside.
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.880]   We know we've got a packed overflow outside as well.
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.680]   It's great to have you with us.
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.400]   If you're new to The Vine, you may not know who I am.
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.920]   You may not know where I'm from.
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.280]   I have a weird accent.
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.600]   And when I talk, people, if they don't know me, they're like, they don't listen to a word
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.800]   of what I say for 20 minutes.
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.480]   They just try to work out, is he American?
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.480]   Is he Australian?
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.480]   Like, where is he from?
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.960]   Actually, that question, where am I from, is one that has caused me a lot of stress
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.200]   and anxiety over my life.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.040]   It's actually the question that I have struggled to answer probably the most in my life.
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.040]   I wonder whether anyone else here might resonate with that idea.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.640]   I was actually born in the UK.
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.280]   I lived there for seven years, but then I left the UK and I lived in the US.
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.880]   And I lived in America for four years, some of the most formative years as a kid from
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.880]   seven to about the age of 11.
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:10.040]   And at the age of 11, I came to Hong Kong and moved here with my family and have been
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.140]   here for 36 years.
[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.320]   And so the interesting thing for me is that I've been in Hong Kong for 36 years, so in
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.840]   a way, Hong Kong is home, but the reality is I actually don't speak Cantonese.
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.320]   I know, shocking and shameful.
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.720]   I don't speak Cantonese after 36 years.
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.640]   The reality also is, if I'm honest with you, is that I'm not actually deeply immersed in
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.120]   super local Cantonese culture.
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.360]   And part of that is because I was raised in an international schooling system here and
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.560]   I've actually, for whatever reason, have for the majority of my life lived in districts
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.160]   of Hong Kong that are generally favoured by expatriates or international people.
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.040]   So some of my local friends, when I tell them I'm a Hong Konger, they just smile at me and
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.320]   pat me on the back and kind of go, "No, you're not.
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.320]   No, you're not.
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.320]   No, you're not."
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.760]   Whereas some of my other local friends who know my heart and have seen my life over the
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.160]   last 36 years are like, "You are absolutely a Hong Konger."
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.000]   And so the question I often grapple with is, "Who actually am I?
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Am I British?"
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.200]   Well, my passport tells me so.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.760]   "Am I a Hong Konger?"
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.920]   My heart tells me so.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.520]   The reality is I probably exist somewhere between the two of those realities.
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.440]   I'm a classic third culture kid.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.480]   I would imagine there's a bunch of others in the room online right now who would resonate
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.480]   with that.
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.200]   I was born in one culture.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.120]   I grew up in another culture.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.040]   And over that, I've kind of gotten lost between those two cultures.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.680]   And I've had to try to work out, "Well, who exactly am I?"
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.120]   And to take the best of one culture and the best of another culture and try to bring those
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.120]   things together.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.040]   But if I'm honest with you, I think the way that a lot of third culture kids feel is you
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.260]   just feel kind of adrift on an ocean of cultural and national identity that you never really
[00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.320]   feel like you're settling into.
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.480]   You never really feel like you've got an anchor point that you can kind of put down in any
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.720]   place where you can find some roots and you long to find a home.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.800]   You long to have a group of people where you generally feel like you fully fit into and
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.560]   are, interestingly and importantly, fully embraced by those people.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.700]   It's funny, my wife Christine, she'll often say to me, "Andrew, you're a chameleon when
[00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.840]   it comes to culture.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.040]   You have an amazing ability to adapt to the color of the majority culture that you're
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.160]   finding yourself operating in in that moment."
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.320]   If I'm around a bunch of Americans, I start sounding more American.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.280]   If I'm with Australians, I become...
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.520]   You can't even understand what I'm saying.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:45.640]   If I'm with Australians, because it's Australians.
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.640]   Had to do it.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.640]   Had to do it.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.800]   But I have this amazing ability to sort of adapt to whatever majority culture I'm around
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.880]   because I'm desperately trying to find people that will accept me.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.640]   And in fact, one of the biggest questions, I think, of my adult life has always been
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:10.640]   who exactly are my people and will I ever fit in?
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.280]   And as we continue our Exodus journey and we get to the midway point of the second chapter,
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.760]   that's exactly what is going on for Moses.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:26.640]   Moses is in a growing tension of an identity crisis.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:33.400]   He's wondering, "Who really are my people and where do I fit in?"
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.840]   We saw last week that Moses born to a Levite family, so Hebrew in his blood and origin
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:39.840]   in that sense.
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.920]   But at a young age, he's put in a basket and sent off down the Nile River and Pharaoh's
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.080]   daughter from the Egyptian culture finds him and adopts him into her family.
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.960]   Now God, because He's incredible and miraculous and does all these amazing things, manages
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.880]   to get Moses back to his biological mother who gets the joy of nursing him.
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.720]   Scholars think that that took place over probably three to four years.
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.760]   So for three or four years, Moses was back in his Hebrew family, biological family.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.500]   And I'm sure during that time, his mother and father and everybody else around immersed
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.000]   him in the Hebrew culture, helped him to understand what it meant to be a believer in a monotheistic
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.360]   God, the father of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and Joseph, to help him to journey in the
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.280]   understanding of what it meant to be a person, a part of the people of God.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.280]   But then at the age of three or four, his mother takes him back and hands him back to
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.920]   Pharaoh's daughter, who from that point forward raises him as her own son.
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.600]   And just as if Moses had been taken and drawn out of the waters of the Nile, he's now taken
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.640]   and drawn out of his Hebrew culture and he's placed into a different culture.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:52.680]   And he grows up now immersed around that culture as a prince within the Egyptian royal courts.
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:58.080]   Now interestingly, fascinatingly, Moses, who's writing the book of Exodus, doesn't tell us
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:03.720]   anything about that time, almost as if maybe he's embarrassed to talk about it.
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.400]   But he doesn't mention anything about it.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.000]   In fact, we have to look outside of the book of Exodus to find any commentary about what
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.560]   it was like for Moses that time.
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.640]   There are some commentary in the rest of the scriptures and also external to scripture
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.840]   in history.
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.240]   Let me just give you some examples.
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:22.400]   Acts chapter seven is the story of Stephen standing before the Sanhedrin, his power,
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.240]   authority of his people in the day, the Jewish people.
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.040]   And he's fighting for his life and he's fighting for his life by telling them the story of
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.040]   his people.
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.120]   And he goes right back to Abraham and he works through.
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.000]   And of course, he speaks about Moses.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.840]   Let me read you from Acts seven, verse 21.
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:41.840]   He says, "When he was placed outside, Pharaoh's daughter took him and brought him up as her
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.440]   own son.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.840]   Moses was educated in the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in speech and action."
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.160]   We get a little glimpse right there.
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:56.280]   Moses understandably was raised in the educational system of Egypt, but not just the educational
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.280]   system.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.480]   He's remembering he's in the royal court.
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.320]   And you can do some research here and find out what it was like to be educated in the
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.920]   royal court of that time.
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.560]   Moses would have received the best education in the world at that time.
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.120]   He would have been taught maths.
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.320]   He would have been taught political discourse and political history.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.680]   He would have been taught military strategies.
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:21.760]   He would have been taught languages, architecture, a whole bunch of different things.
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:22.760]   Philosophy.
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.360]   He would have been taught importantly about the Egyptian religious system and how all
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.160]   of the spiritual deities of Egypt work.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.760]   All of this would have been his education.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.760]   And Stephen tells us here, "He was powerful in speech and deed."
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.320]   So he was good at what he had learned.
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:41.200]   He'd learn all this stuff and it had become a part of who he was.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:46.480]   Interestingly, the first century historian, Josephus, also writes about Moses in this
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.520]   time.
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.960]   And he tells us two things.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:55.160]   One, that Moses was being groomed by Pharaoh to take over as Pharaoh in Egypt.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:00.520]   Now it's likely that the Pharaoh of the time of the Exodus did not have his own son.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:06.120]   And although Moses was adopted by Pharaoh's daughter, it looks like through history that
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:11.880]   actually Moses and Pharaoh almost became a father-son kind of relationship.
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:17.160]   And this father figure over Moses was grooming him to take over the running of Egypt.
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:22.680]   The second thing that Josephus tells us is that Moses actually had led a military conquest,
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:27.240]   a victorious military conquest in Ethiopia in that time.
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.880]   So I want you to understand something really important here.
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:34.440]   Moses being adopted into Pharaoh's family doesn't mean that Moses was like the embarrassing
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:38.720]   third uncle that you kind of wish never came to the Christmas party and you're kind of
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:39.720]   embarrassed about him.
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:43.800]   Moses wasn't some Hebrew that was embarrassing to the family and they kind of shoved him
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.040]   off in the side during all the important events.
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:54.840]   Moses was centered into the powerful, oppressive work of the Egyptian empire.
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.680]   He was being groomed to be Pharaoh.
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:02.880]   Not only that, but he had already led military conquest on behalf of Egypt's power and might.
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:11.640]   And he had done all of this in absolute opulent prosperity, living in one of the wealthiest
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:15.360]   families of that time.
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:24.080]   And Moses, now 40 years old, is struggling with exactly who he is.
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.880]   He's basically going to have a midlife crisis in the passage we look at today.
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.760]   And he's like, "Hang on, who am I?
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:31.760]   Am I a Hebrew?
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.240]   Well, by blood, yes.
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.480]   Am I Egyptian?
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:42.480]   Well, by my literal and metaphorical clothes, my identity, yes I am.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:51.480]   So does that mean then that I'm one of the oppressed or am I actually the oppressor?"
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:59.080]   Moses is wondering, "Am I really a liberator of my people or actually am I a part of the
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.640]   very problem?"
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:08.340]   And this internal conflict that's happening for Moses quickly enables Moses to realize,
[00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:13.080]   and for us as we look at this passage to realize, that in the Exodus story, there isn't this
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.880]   clear cut idea of the good and the bad.
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:22.440]   But as so often in all of our lives, there's a lot of nuance and gray and the coming together
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.880]   of a lot of different things.
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:28.360]   And just like me, who had been born in one culture and raised in the other and was desperately
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:33.720]   trying to work out who I am, Moses, born in one culture, raised in another, and now at
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:39.320]   40 years old going, "What do I do next?"
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:45.480]   And it's all of that tension that we now turn our attention to as I take you back to the
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.480]   land of Egypt.
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.480]   Let's have a look.
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:11:05.480]   [Music]
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:10.000]   So the kind of TV shows or movies that I've always been drawn to are the ones where there
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.480]   are no cliché good guys versus bad guys, but where every character has the propensity
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:19.800]   for moments of both great goodness and great evil.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:23.360]   And I think one of the reasons why I'm drawn to this kind of storytelling is because it
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:29.520]   reveals to us something about our shared common humanity, that each one of us has the potentiality
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:35.320]   to be both oppressed and the oppressor, to be winners as well as losers.
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:39.600]   Every single one of us has had moments that we have been deeply proud of, but we've also
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:43.240]   had moments that we've regretted and have deeply buried.
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:47.440]   You know, if we deny this, we actually enter into one of the slaveries that I think so
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:54.840]   many of us become blind to, and that's the slavery of denial.
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:59.320]   As the Exodus narrative continues, we quickly discover that there are no straight cut good
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.520]   guys and bad guys.
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:06.160]   At the halfway mark of the second chapter, we discover Moses as a grown man, and not
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:11.240]   just any man, but a prince of Egypt, having been raised in Pharaoh's very household.
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:15.960]   I mean, consider the privilege and prestige that had been afforded Moses.
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:20.720]   Despite his Hebrew origin, he was raised by one of the wealthiest Egyptians in the land,
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:24.480]   and was surrounded day and night by its customs and culture.
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:29.720]   He had been cared for, raised, and educated by Pharaoh and his family, all while his own
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.840]   people suffered at the hand of their oppression.
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:37.120]   At this point in the story, Moses is not the Jewish people's hero, but actually a part
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.120]   of the problem.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:43.640]   Perhaps even worse, for Moses was a Jew adopted into the family of the oppressors, and he
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:13:04.640]   had not done anything at all to stop that oppression.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.200]   But suddenly, everything changes.
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:11.600]   One day, you see, Moses is out, and he's just observing the hard labor that his people are
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.600]   under, and he sees an Egyptian beating up a Hebrew.
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:18.680]   Now, that was probably an everyday occurrence in that time, but for whatever reason, on
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.800]   this particular day, Moses decides to act.
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:25.600]   He attacks the Egyptian, and it ends up actually killing him.
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:31.880]   And in his panic, he decides to bury the Egyptian in the sand, hoping that in burying that Egyptian,
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:35.960]   he'd be able to distance himself from the violence that he's created, hoping to cover
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.800]   up his crime, if you will.
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:42.120]   Now, before we judge Moses a little bit too harshly, I think we have to realize that all
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.320]   of us have the tendency to do this.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.360]   We may not be out there murdering people, but we hurt people.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.700]   We say things.
[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:53.040]   We actually pull people down, and when we do so, we so often try to bury that hurt,
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:57.960]   try to bury that shame, try to distance ourselves from it, and in so doing, actually, try to
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:01.360]   provide for us a cover for the thing that we've done.
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:06.120]   Maybe, perhaps, just like Moses, rather than burying these things, we need to actually
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.360]   expose them in order for them to be redeemed.
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:32.080]   (Music)
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.560]   In many ways, Moses had been burying things for years.
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:40.440]   He had buried his Hebrew ancestry in the sand of Egyptian culture and customs, hiding his
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:46.120]   true identity in the power of Pharaoh's royalty and prestige, remaining blind to the oppression
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.540]   around him.
[00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:50.760]   This is what we do when we're trapped in the slavery of denial.
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:56.240]   We run from the realities of our own contribution to the oppression of others by burying ourselves
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:02.960]   in self-righteousness that placates our guilt and shame and keeps us aloof, uncaring, unfeeling,
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.920]   and disconnected.
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:09.520]   Moses murders an Egyptian and buries him in the hope that he can remain disconnected from
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:12.520]   his crime and get away from his violence.
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:16.740]   But he's about to discover something we always seem to forget when trapped in the slavery
[00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:17.960]   of denial.
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:31.960]   Our mistakes rarely stay buried forever.
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:36.640]   Edward gets back to Pharaoh about what Moses has done, and not surprisingly, Pharaoh is
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:37.640]   furious.
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:42.560]   I mean, the very one that he had raised almost like his own son, the one who had been adopted
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:47.520]   by his daughter, the one who he had high hopes for in his own court, has actually killed
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.440]   an Egyptian subject.
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.760]   And how does Pharaoh respond?
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:56.520]   Well, he decides he needs to kill Moses, that there needs to be blood for blood.
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:01.020]   Well Moses hears about the scheme of Pharaoh against him, and so he flees to the far side
[00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:07.000]   of Midian and comes to a well that's not so dissimilar to this one right here.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.800]   Now, these wells were a lifeline in the harsh desert conditions like these around me right
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:17.920]   now, and no doubt Moses would have camped near this kind of well for a couple of days,
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:21.080]   perhaps reflecting back on the week that had just been.
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:27.320]   How one random act of violence had turned his whole life upside down, and how now his
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.840]   own family was trying to kill him.
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:35.960]   And this is an aspect of the Exodus story that I think it's easy for us all to miss.
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:41.680]   When we think of the Exodus story, we think of Pharaoh and Moses like bitter enemies against
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:47.160]   each other, as if they're like a protagonist and an antagonist, a good guy and a bad guy.
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:50.800]   But actually the story is far more nuanced than that.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:56.720]   Actually the start of the Exodus narrative is a story about a betrayal within a family,
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:02.200]   about a son who feels betrayed by his adopted father, how a father feels betrayed by his
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.080]   adopted son.
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:09.360]   And all of that combines together to create such fury and animosity and oppression that
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:12.880]   the whole of the Exodus journey begins from that point.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:16.560]   And I think all of this teaches us something that's quite critical about our own journeys
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:19.600]   from slavery to freedom, and it's this.
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:25.160]   That so often the most painful moments of oppression occur not by those who are strangers
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:40.560]   to us, but by those that we love the most.
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.600]   The wound causes Moses to bury once again.
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:48.120]   He's lost his Egyptian family and he's run from his own people who are in need.
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:51.200]   He has a deep sense of shame attached to both.
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:56.440]   And like we all so often do when faced with our failures and our brokenness, he flees
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:02.160]   into lies and self-denial, recreating a new identity with a new group of people, and in
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.040]   so doing hoping he can permanently bury his past.
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:09.480]   But that's not the way it works with God.
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:13.160]   God is in the business of revealing that which is hidden in darkness.
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:27.240]   And for Moses, a new light is about to shine.
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:31.280]   God is in the business of revealing the things that are hidden in darkness.
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:35.960]   What we're about to look at as we open up this story in a bit more detail together is
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:41.160]   I think the most significant thing that you need to open your heart to.
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:46.840]   If you duly want to go in an Exodus journey yourself, I can't stress how important what
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:53.760]   happens next for Moses is for us as we think about our own liberation from the things that
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.560]   we also want to hide.
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:59.200]   Let me read this to you from chapter 2, verse 11.
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.160]   Everybody okay still?
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.160]   How beautiful by the way.
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.000]   That was Jordan, not Egypt by the way.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.680]   Isn't that cool?
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:06.680]   Yeah.
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:09.560]   Every week everybody's coming up to me and they're like, "I want to go to Egypt now."
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:14.560]   And I'm like, "Yeah, that's great."
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:16.680]   But that was Jordan, just want to say.
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:23.080]   One day after Moses had grown up, he went out to where his own people were and watched
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.720]   them at their hard labor.
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:28.200]   He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people.
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:34.560]   Glancing this way and that, he killed him and then took the Egyptian and hid him in
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.000]   the sand.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.200]   The next day he went out and saw two Hebrews fighting.
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.200]   Let's just stop there.
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.200]   Let me read 12 again.
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:46.920]   "Glancing this way and that and seeing no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.320]   the sand."
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:53.920]   This is a turning point in Moses' life, a complete and utter radical turning point.
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.960]   He's about the age 40 here.
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:59.400]   And like I said before, Moses doesn't give us any details about the life prior to this
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.400]   point.
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.120]   Almost as if he wants to just kind of rush over that and get to this point.
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:09.240]   He's 40 years old, dressed in the robes of his Egyptian culture and identity.
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:13.360]   And yet today he goes out and probably does what he had done on a very regular basis,
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:16.640]   take a look at what was happening amongst his own flesh and blood, amongst the Hebrew
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:17.640]   people.
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:22.960]   And he sees a scene that would have been part of the everyday life of that time, an Egyptian
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:27.080]   slave master being tough on a Hebrew slave.
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.560]   And again, Moses would have seen that many, many times.
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:32.680]   But this day, something different takes place.
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:33.880]   Question is, why?
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:38.360]   Well, Moses helps us to understand that by a word he uses here.
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:42.040]   It says in the English, "He watched them at their labor."
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:45.920]   This word "watch" that Moses writes here is the word "ra'ah."
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:49.760]   And ra'ah is a very important Hebrew word that actually is now repeated from this point
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:53.400]   forward about five times in the next three chapters.
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.880]   The word ra'ah means this.
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:21:00.760]   It means to see with emotion, to see something and be moved by it.
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:04.180]   Not just to observe something, but now to be moved by it.
[00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:08.920]   This is the difference you see between Moses having seen the oppression of his people for
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:15.520]   40 years and never done anything about it, to this moment now wanting, stirred to, something
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:19.120]   in his spirit that moves him to want to act.
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:23.080]   This is the exact same word that we saw last week that was applied to Pharaoh's daughter
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:28.640]   when she sees Moses in the waters and she is moved with compassion to save him.
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:35.080]   She ra'ahs, she sees him with emotion, draws him up and brings him into her family.
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:36.880]   The same word is being used here.
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:42.240]   And just like we said last week, the word holds with it the idea that God's spirit is
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:48.400]   involved in the emotive, the compassion, the desire to do something, the heart change.
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.000]   God's spirit is at work in it.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.560]   So what we're seeing here in the start of our story today is that Moses' heart is being
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:57.560]   changed.
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:02.920]   There's a significant shift that's happening for him as he now sees with emotion and compassion
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:06.840]   and he's beginning to understand, "Hang on, these are my people.
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.320]   Hang on, there's something going on here.
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:11.880]   These are not just the oppressed around us.
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:17.840]   These are actually my people and my heart is being stirred to kind of do something."
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:23.840]   But this is a difficult journey for him because he's still caught between these two identities.
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:28.400]   He's still struggling with, "Am I this or am I that?"
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:33.400]   The writer in the book of Hebrews, very interestingly, actually pulls out this exact moment and he
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.320]   says something that's, I think, quite helpful for us to see.
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:39.800]   This is Hebrews chapter 11, starting in verse 24.
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:45.520]   It says, "By faith, Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh's
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:46.520]   daughter.
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:51.280]   He chose instead to be mistreated along with the people of God rather than to enjoy the
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:54.760]   pleasures of sin for a short time."
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:59.240]   Now I think the writer of Hebrews here is writing about what took place for Moses after
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.240]   this moment.
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.120]   Most scholars would argue, "Is it before this moment?
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:03.320]   Is it after this moment?"
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:04.400]   I think it's after.
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:09.520]   I think God is the starting point of stirring something in Moses' heart as he sees his people
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:15.520]   on this particular day and he will go on to align himself more and more with his Israelite
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:18.280]   identity and move away from his Egyptian one.
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:24.800]   But in this moment, he sees something, it stirs his heart, and he wants to respond.
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:31.800]   But this tension is real and this tension is also real for us.
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:38.360]   Moses is struggling with his identity and realizing that the identity that he's embraced
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:42.600]   is not now the identity that God is beginning to speak to him about.
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.360]   Are you following that?
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:49.760]   And that's going to be every person in here's journey if you truly want to go on Exodus.
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:56.720]   You're going to have to realize that the identity that you have embraced is not necessarily
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:59.840]   the one that God wants you to walk in.
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:06.880]   Each one of us wear the clothes of identities that we have embraced throughout our lives
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:12.640]   that do not represent the full truth of who we are.
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.000]   Come on church.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.800]   That's the first thing you need to grapple with here.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:21.000]   That you have identities that have been formed in you, shaped in you by preferences and choices,
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.440]   that have been formed and shaped in you by family dynamics, that have been formed and
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:28.200]   shaped in you by your marriages and by the people around you in your workplaces, that
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.960]   have been formed and shaped in you by your thinking and your attitude, formed and shaped
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:34.960]   in you by your sin and your brokenness.
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:40.480]   And those identities are often the things that we wear to try to find a place in this
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:49.400]   world and you will never, never journey in Exodus until you have the courage to step
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.680]   away from some of those identities.
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:57.360]   The starting point of all of our journeys in Exodus is to remove the clothes that we
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:06.320]   are wearing that cover up the person that we truly want to be in Christ Jesus.
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:11.360]   We have to have the courage to remove those identities, to recognize that those identities
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:16.880]   are ours, to be honest about them and sober about them and say that this identity has
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:20.040]   come and been placed upon me and I'm in this middle ground.
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:23.800]   I'm a third culture person right now and I know what Christ wants.
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.520]   Christ is stirring something in my heart.
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:27.420]   There's a call to liberation.
[00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:31.480]   There's a call to freedom from my sin and my brokenness and yet I recognize that I'm
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:38.560]   still dressed in the clothes of the oppressing identity.
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:40.760]   Something has to change.
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:43.280]   Some of us in this room, here's the honest reality.
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:47.160]   We have gotten comfortable in the clothes of Egypt.
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:58.240]   I'm going to say that again because I just felt strongly the Spirit of God for you.
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:02.900]   The honest truth is I'm like this as well.
[00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:07.840]   We have become comfortable in the clothes of Egypt.
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:12.440]   If we're going to really be honest and truthful and sober about this series that we're in,
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:18.800]   it's only going to happen if we're willing to recognize that we've become comfortable
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:23.440]   in identities that have come to shape and form us and make us think that we're someone
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:29.520]   when the reality is we're only someone in Christ Jesus.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:33.680]   That invitation is a bold one from God and it's not an easy one to wrestle with and Moses
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:37.380]   is wrestling with it and here's how he tries to respond with it.
[00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:42.640]   He sees an Egyptian slave master beating on one of his own people and in kind of going,
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:43.840]   "Well, I think I am Hebrew.
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:48.000]   I am Hebrew and I want my Hebrew people to identify with me and I want them to accept
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:54.080]   me," he steps in and does what only he knows because of how he's been raised to kind of
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.720]   sort of sort out a problem that's happening between two people.
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.120]   He goes in and he kills the Egyptian.
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:01.800]   I want you to see this church because it's super important.
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:06.840]   Moses being stirred by God in his heart to stand on behalf of the oppression of his people,
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:12.880]   his first act to be a liberator of his people is violence and murder.
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:18.600]   In other words, Moses, even though his heart is beginning to be stirred, his clothes are
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:22.800]   still very Egyptian and so he has a heart to move.
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:31.120]   He has the right idea, the wrong method and the Egyptian clothes that he wears metaphorically
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:35.600]   and as well as literally are shaping him still and he thinks, "Oh, well, this is the way
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:36.720]   I liberate my people.
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:41.120]   I need to go in with that mighty kind of military strategy.
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.560]   Look what I did in Ethiopia.
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:44.600]   I can do that now on behalf of my people."
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:49.760]   He's basically acting like Pharaoh in order to be a liberator of his people.
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.440]   Are you following this?
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:58.120]   And when we act in the brokenness that we embrace, in the wrong identities that we have
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:04.280]   to try to do God's will, there's always going to be a problem with that.
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:09.720]   Need to understand that you cannot bring about God's exodus through your own brokenness.
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:10.720]   Hello?
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:13.520]   You guys okay?
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:17.360]   You cannot bring about God's exodus through your own brokenness.
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:18.360]   Here's the reality.
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:20.720]   It is not your exodus.
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:25.200]   So many of us, as we start this series, we're wanting exodus from the things that are holding
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:30.320]   us, from the things that are enslaving us and we have an idea of what that exodus will
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:31.320]   look like.
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:36.520]   We have to let go of our agenda of exodus to actually receive God's exodus that he has
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:37.520]   for us.
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:42.520]   Your brokenness is never going to be the vehicle by which you're going to be able to act in
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:43.520]   exodus.
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:48.560]   And here's Moses' brokenness as one of Pharaoh who's thinking that it's all about power,
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:51.920]   it's all about prestige, it's all about might.
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:55.200]   That psalm that says, "Some trust in horses, some trust in chariots, but I trust in the
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.200]   name of the Lord."
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:59.960]   Moses has the mentality, "We trust in horses.
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:01.960]   We trust in chariots.
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:03.000]   It's our wisdom.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   It's our strength."
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   And I think Moses took it even further.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.160]   I think Moses was thinking, "This is maybe why God has raised me in Pharaoh's household,
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:15.920]   so that I would be well-educated, so I would be strong, so I would know all the strategies,
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:20.320]   so I can now go and stand in the gap and just in the way that we killed all of those Ethiopians,
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:23.680]   I can now kill this Egyptian in the hopes of setting my people free."
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:31.600]   And you get the sense that God is standing back from all that and going, "Hmm."
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:37.480]   Moses buries his sin.
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:40.560]   He kills somebody, had no authority to do so.
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:44.040]   And he knew it was wrong, that's why he buries the Egyptian.
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:47.880]   And he buries him in sand because he wants to get away with the sin.
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:50.360]   You can almost see the shame that's inside of him.
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:53.320]   It says in the scripture that he looked left and he looked right.
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:56.680]   The thing he failed to do was to look up.
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:59.880]   And he takes this Egyptian and he buries him in the sand, hoping he's going to get away
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:03.680]   with it, thinking he's gotten away with it.
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:07.480]   In fact, so much so that he goes back the next day to see how his people is doing, thinking
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:10.560]   that he's completely got away with everything.
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:15.960]   And we have to be really honest with ourselves and realize we do this too.
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:21.600]   Just like I said in the film, we have a habit of burying our sin.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:25.420]   We have a habit of covering up the things that we do that we know is not what God wants
[00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:27.280]   for us, what we know is not right.
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:31.140]   And we cover these things up and we kind of pretend like they haven't happened.
[00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:36.720]   You want to know what I think is the true global pandemic in the church today?
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:38.720]   It's secret sin.
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:45.640]   In fact, when I was preparing this series four years ago, I felt the Holy Spirit say
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:50.760]   to me very strongly, "Andrew, there's a lot of secret sin in the vine.
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:31:02.360]   There's a lot of sin that we're doing knowingly and we're covering up with the sand to avoid
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:04.240]   and we think we're getting away with it."
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:08.040]   Yeah, I was on that website, but I cleared the history.
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:10.040]   My wife won't see it.
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:14.360]   Yeah, I did that dodgy business deal, but I trust the person.
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:15.360]   He's not going to tell anyone.
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:18.600]   It's going to be fine.
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:25.820]   When the church walks in the secrecy of sin, the enemy has won because the enemy's nature
[00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:28.400]   is to be secretive.
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:33.160]   The Lord's nature is to be open and vulnerable and transparent and real.
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:37.560]   And the more that we operate in the secretness of our sin, the more the enemy has won and
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:41.180]   the power of the church is reduced.
[00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:47.480]   And God's standing over us and He's going, "You can bury all you want, but I know.
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:48.480]   I see it.
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:49.480]   I love you.
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:52.120]   I'm not here to condemn you.
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:54.480]   I'm not here to make you feel terrible.
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:55.920]   I'm here to set you free.
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:32:00.400]   But in order for you to be set free, you've got to stop burying stuff.
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:01.920]   You've got to stop doing that.
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:09.760]   You've got to start working out that actually your honesty, your transparency, your willingness
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:14.660]   to not be like Adam and Eve who were once naked and unashamed, who through their sin
[00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:18.000]   became naked and ashamed, covered themselves up.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.120]   And God shows up and says, "Who told you you were naked?"
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:26.000]   In other words, I'm welcoming you back into a relationship with me where there doesn't
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.560]   need to be secrecy, there doesn't need to be hiddenness, there doesn't need to be brokenness.
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:33.520]   I want to set you free.
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:42.320]   And Moses, like us, has killed, has felt shame, has buried.
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:49.280]   And any time you bury sin, any time you bury shame, any time you bury guilt, it is just
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:53.680]   festering and festering and festering, and it has the power to come up and ruin you unless
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:58.660]   the Spirit of God comes and enables you through His beautiful kindness and conviction that
[00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:04.080]   leads to repentance where you can say, "Lord, I am ashamed of this, but in your eyes, you
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:05.080]   love me.
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:06.080]   Here it is.
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.080]   Set me free."
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:08.920]   That's the heart of Exodus.
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:11.800]   Are you with me still so far?
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:16.360]   Now I want you to see what happens next, verse 13 onwards.
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:17.360]   I'm enjoying this.
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:19.920]   Are you guys okay?
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:26.120]   Verse 13 says this, "The next day he went out and saw two Hebrews fighting."
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:29.080]   So the next day, thinking he's gotten away with everything, goes back out to be the savior
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:31.160]   of his people, right?
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:34.040]   He asked one that was wrong, "Why are you hitting your fellow Hebrew?"
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:38.040]   The man said, "Who made you ruler and judge over us?
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:40.880]   Are you thinking of killing me just as you killed the Egyptian?"
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:41.880]   Ouch!
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:44.800]   It's like a mic drop moment.
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:46.640]   We know what you did.
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:47.640]   Everybody knows what you did.
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:49.480]   We're all talking about it.
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:50.480]   We all know.
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:51.480]   You can't hide this thing.
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:56.600]   You killed an Egyptian, and that's really bad news for all of us.
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:58.680]   So are you going to kill us now like you killed the Egyptian?
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:04.280]   Are you going to try to cover up all of your mistakes all the time?
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:10.640]   Then Moses was afraid, understandably, and thought, "What I did must have become known."
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:11.640]   I love it.
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:12.640]   It's really interesting what they say here.
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:15.800]   They say to Moses, "Who made you ruler and judge over us?"
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:18.600]   In other words, we didn't ask for a deliverer.
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:20.480]   We didn't ask for you to be our deliverer.
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:23.520]   "Who made you ruler and judge over us?
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.720]   Because you're still dressed in your Egyptian identity.
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:27.640]   You're still dressed in your Egyptian clothes.
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:34.600]   You're still thinking like a pharaoh, and we see you, Moses, as one of the oppressors,
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:35.600]   not one of the oppressed.
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:38.720]   Oh, you might have our blood, but that's all you have.
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:40.040]   Who made you?
[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:42.120]   Who decided that you could be our ruler and judge?"
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:46.120]   What they were basically saying to him is this, "Don't you realize that we don't want
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:47.400]   you?
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:50.760]   We don't want your pharaoh power in our lives.
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:53.560]   In fact, Moses, you're a part of the problem.
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:58.760]   You killing the Egyptian yesterday has made our lives worse."
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:00.680]   He's seen this.
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:03.160]   Now there's also something else going on here.
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:05.760]   God is also speaking to Moses.
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:09.800]   Because when these two Hebrews say to him, "Who made you ruler and judge over us?"
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:15.840]   God is speaking to Moses, and God is saying, "Who made you ruler and judge over my people?
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:16.840]   Have I done that yet?
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:19.520]   No, no, no, I haven't done that yet.
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:21.440]   Oh, I'm stirring your heart by my spirit.
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:22.560]   I'm rehiring you.
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:24.400]   You're beginning to see the injustice of my people.
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:29.000]   I'm beginning to work, but there's so much, Moses, that has to happen in your life, so
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.840]   much that needs to change in your life before I am going to use you to be my deliverer.
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:36.960]   Because if I used you now, your methods and your thinking is going to be the world's wisdom,
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:39.040]   the world's strength, your mighty army strength.
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:43.320]   I have so much I need to unravel, so much I need to get out of you, so much I need to
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.320]   change in you.
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.320]   I have not released you.
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:50.320]   You're in fact going to live for 40 years in Midian in this horrible desert before I
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:54.520]   even show up as a burning bush and begin to officially call you to be a liberator.
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:58.840]   You are not that person right now, and you need to realize there's work that needs to
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:35:59.840]   be done."
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:03.320]   Do you see it?
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:05.600]   And God is being pretty strong with Moses here.
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:11.360]   "I haven't told you yet, and yet you're jumping the gun.
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:18.600]   You're getting straight into this stuff, and that's not the way it works here."
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:26.680]   And Moses realizes that there is so much he needs to deal with.
[00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:35.160]   You see, for Moses, he is going to quickly realize that in order for him to be his people's
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:40.440]   deliverer, he's first of all going to need deliverance himself.
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:42.040]   Come on, church.
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:46.120]   In order for him to eventually become his people's deliverer, he's first of all going
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:48.760]   to have to experience deliverance himself.
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:52.220]   And I want to be bold and stand before you all today and say this.
[00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:55.960]   If you are enjoying this series, if you're feeling like the Lord is calling you into
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:59.240]   Exodus, here's the bold, sobering reality.
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:03.280]   You will need some deliverance.
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:08.600]   You are going to need, like Moses, to get rid of some of your faulty identities.
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:14.400]   You're going to need to be willing to allow God to come and stir some things in you.
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:20.240]   The journey of Exodus is not all cupcakes and My Little Ponies.
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:24.440]   The journey of Exodus is gritty and real.
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:30.220]   And if it's going to have any lasting change, it starts with the reality that we are dressed
[00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:34.680]   in the wrong clothes some of the time.
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:40.600]   And God, would you come and, hmm, would you come and help me?
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:43.600]   Notice what happens next, because this is tough.
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:47.560]   Verse 15, "When Pharaoh heard of this, he tried to kill Moses.
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:49.920]   But Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in Midian."
[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:50.920]   Fascinating.
[00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:54.320]   Remember what I said in the film, and this is so true.
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:57.720]   This is not just a good guy and a bad guy who are suddenly fighting against each other
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:58.960]   now.
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:04.980]   This is an adopted father who is now heartbroken because of what his adopted son has done.
[00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:10.280]   This is an adopted son who's wrestling with the oppression of his adopted father, who's
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:13.500]   trying to work that through in his head.
[00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:17.940]   This is Pharaoh who probably always harbored insecurities that maybe one day Moses might
[00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:19.440]   turn against him.
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:22.440]   That maybe one day because of his Hebrew blood, maybe one day he might.
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:29.160]   And so perhaps Moses, oh sorry, perhaps Pharaoh in hoping to get all of that out of Moses,
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:33.400]   puts him in the school, gets them all pharaohed up, tells him he's going to groom him to be
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:37.480]   the next leader, sends him on a conquest to Ethiopia, because all of that is designed
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:42.040]   by Pharaoh to get the Hebrew out of Moses.
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:49.380]   And now we're at a point where Pharaoh realizes that all that hard work has achieved nothing,
[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:54.040]   because when it came to it, Moses has now chosen his people.
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:56.920]   And so Pharaoh's response is blood for blood.
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:01.840]   You kill one of my subjects, I'm going to kill you.
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:05.120]   And couldn't you imagine the depth of pain now for Moses?
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:08.960]   I want you to see this, really important, because not only has Moses been rejected by
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:15.080]   his own people, the Hebrews, who have said, "We don't want you as judge over us."
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:21.800]   He's now been rejected by his own family, his own people that loved him and raised him
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:23.720]   for 40 years.
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:25.960]   They now want to kill him.
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:30.880]   And Moses is now in a place where he's like, "Hang on a sec, literally a minute ago I was
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:34.560]   somebody and now I'm nobody."
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:38.760]   And God goes, "Now we can get to work."
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:43.080]   Come on church, now we can get to work.
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:48.320]   There's a journey that you have to go on, from being a somebody in the world's eyes
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:52.520]   to being a nobody in the world's eyes, so that God can then turn you into a somebody
[00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:53.520]   in his eyes.
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:57.760]   So that he can now come and begin to form and shape in you the person that he truly
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:00.360]   is calling you to be.
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:04.640]   This is Moses' great moment of disruption and disorientation.
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:09.200]   And if you're anything like me, seasons of disorientation are disorientating.
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:10.200]   They're not easy.
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:11.640]   They're hard.
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:13.320]   They're painful.
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:16.280]   But you need to understand something very central to the Exodus journey.
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:25.380]   There is no process of liberation until there is first a process of disorientation.
[00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:30.800]   There is no ability for you to be set free until you first wrestle deeply with the reality
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:32.960]   of your brokenness.
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:38.600]   There is no liberation that can happen until you first face disorientation, disruption,
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:44.040]   the recognition of a brokenness, and to say, "This is not what I want."
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:48.920]   And Moses, as painful as it is, is now stripped from all of his identities.
[00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:53.320]   And he flees to Midian, and he sits down at a well, and he begins to form a new identity.
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:56.320]   And we don't have time to look at the story today, but he meets a woman, and he does this
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:41:01.440]   amazing thing, and he saves this family, and they suddenly bring him into their family,
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:05.080]   and he has kids, and he builds a whole new life as a shepherd.
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:06.640]   His father-in-law is a shepherd.
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:08.360]   He becomes a shepherd.
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:12.520]   All of that for 40 years before God even shows up in the burning bush and does anything.
[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:17.000]   And it's like God is saying this, "What the world meant for evil, I'm going to use for
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   good.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.360]   You just got rejected by your people and rejected by me, sorry, by Pharaoh's family.
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:25.920]   I'm going to step in now, and what was meant for evil, I'm going to now turn for good."
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:30.880]   None of this was a surprise to God, and God steps into the circumstances of brokenness,
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:34.240]   and he meets Moses and says, "Now we can begin."
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:49.880]   And here's the question, are you willing to embrace the disorientation of the broken identities
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:51.080]   that sit over your life?
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:42:01.160]   Are you willing to soberly see them with emotion, to recognize them, and where you have up until
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:06.720]   now just buried them, be willing to come to the Lord with an open hand and say, "God,
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:11.400]   this is what's going on, and I cannot, will not, don't want to.
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:12.820]   And Lord, it is breaking me.
[00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:13.920]   It is warring in me.
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:15.240]   I am disorientated.
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:21.240]   I am disrupted, and God, I am desperately in need.
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:26.000]   And in order for me to move into your spirit and with what you want, I need to now purge.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.160]   Help me, Lord, do that."
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:35.560]   The season of disorientation starts by asking three very important questions.
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:37.920]   I want to share these questions, and then I'm going to pray with you.
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:40.240]   Here's the first question.
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:45.240]   What clothes are you wearing today that God needs to strip away from you?
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:49.160]   All of us are carrying identities that I've talked about earlier that God wants to deal
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:50.160]   with.
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:51.720]   What are the ones that you're carrying with you?
[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:59.440]   Number two, what sins have you committed that you have long since buried that God in his
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:02.920]   love and grace wants to expose so he can heal you?
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:08.800]   What is the sand that you've been placing over the box that you've put stuff in, hidden
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:13.640]   away from everybody so they can't see it, and you're covering it all up?
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:17.840]   What are the sins that you're getting away with or think you're getting away with right
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:22.240]   now that God actually wants to begin to speak to you about and put his finger on out of
[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:25.680]   his grace and mercy so that he can truly set you free?
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:27.180]   Here's the third and final one.
[00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:32.640]   What desert might God need to bring you to in order to remove from you the earthly power
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:38.320]   and privilege that only gets in the way of God's power being made manifest in your life?
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:41.640]   That's the place of disorientation.
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:47.680]   Where does God need to bring you to so that he can shake away the comforts of this world
[00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:51.880]   so that you can finally find comfort in him?
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:53.960]   That is how we start Exodus.
[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:58.180]   And Moses, as painful as it was for him to sit down in that well and wonder, "How did
[00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:01.060]   my life just get turned upside down?"
[00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:06.940]   It is now that God can meet him and begin to form in him the leader he would become
[00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:11.840]   so that he wouldn't stand before Pharaoh with Pharaoh's authority and power, but instead
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:19.800]   with a simple shepherd's staff and say plainly before him, "Let my people go."
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:23.680]   As I stand before you today as your pastor, that's what I feel for you.
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:32.160]   I stand before you and I say to the enemy who is trying to hold you back, "Let my people
[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.160]   go."
[00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:36.680]   I wonder whether you would pray with me.
[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:37.920]   Let's pray.
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:44.040]   Father, we come before you here.
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:58.200]   Father, just settling ourselves into the uncomfortableness of disorientation, being willing to be disrupted
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:00.200]   by you.
[00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:07.800]   Father, I want to pray for us as a community of faith.
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:14.800]   Father, for each person here, it's their own journey.
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:20.320]   But Lord, I want to pray for the kindness of your presence to convict, particularly
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:30.760]   for us who have secret sin that we haven't shared with anyone, maybe out of shame, guilt,
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:36.500]   whatever it might be, that we are hiding from our loved ones, and most importantly, hiding
[00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:39.400]   from you.
[00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:41.000]   We know we can't hide anything from you.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.200]   You see all things, but we bury nonetheless.
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:55.480]   Father, I pray for each person here who can resonate with the reality of buried sin.
[00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:59.920]   I pray in your gentleness and kindness you'd meet them now.
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:06.660]   I pray for courage for each person in this room to do the right thing.
[00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:13.700]   Father, I pray for those of us in this room who are trying to bring about Exodus on our
[00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:20.680]   own terms, just like Moses wearing the wrong identity, thinking that liberation could come
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:23.620]   by might and power.
[00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:28.660]   Forgive us, Lord, where we think our own Exodus comes through might and power of our own strength.
[00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:33.260]   Let's try harder, power of positive thinking, whatever it might be.
[00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:39.420]   Father, would we submit ourselves to your Exodus and your Exodus alone?
[00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:47.140]   And even if that means an uncomfortable season of disorientation, Father, would you give
[00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:53.260]   us the courage to walk into it?
[00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:59.460]   And Father, anyone here who knows that there's an identity that they're holding, maybe something
[00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:07.620]   that they've made an idol of, maybe it's the work you do, maybe it's the status you have,
[00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:13.460]   maybe it's the followers you've got, maybe it's whatever it is, but there's something
[00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:17.300]   that is, there's an identity that works in you and works, and you know it's your weak
[00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:18.300]   place.
[00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:20.500]   You know it's the place that you use to cover up insecurity.
[00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:23.580]   It's the place that you use to cover up your brokenness.
[00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:29.620]   It's the outward facing, I've got it all together person.
[00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:37.580]   And I wonder whether over this series you would have the courage to allow God to change
[00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:45.780]   that identity, to trust him that he knows you better than you know yourself, and that
[00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:49.460]   you'd be identified as his child, as the greatest identity you could ever hold.
[00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:54.020]   And it doesn't mean that you can't be a great banker or a great lawyer, or you can't have
[00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:57.020]   a great marriage, or you can't be influential.
[00:47:57.020 --> 00:48:01.580]   All those things can be there, but they come through our identity in Christ.
[00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:03.580]   Those things are not our identity.
[00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:08.860]   And I say that over some of you in the name of Jesus, because you need to hear it, and
[00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:10.860]   God wants to deal with it in your life.
[00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:14.860]   So whatever it might mean for you, just take a moment now to let the Holy Spirit speak
[00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:17.100]   to you.
[00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:19.680]   (upbeat music)
