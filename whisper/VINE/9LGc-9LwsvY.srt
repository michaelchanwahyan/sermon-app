1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
 I know there's people standing around as well.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,240
 It's kind of standing room only today.

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,840
 So if you are standing around, please come on in,

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,680
 grab a seat.

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,500
 There's a couple at the front here,

6
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,880
 there's a couple around the place.

7
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,640
 We're so glad you're here at the Vine.

8
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,520
 If you're new, my name is Andrew.

9
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,340
 I'm one of the pastors here.

10
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,620
 If you're watching us online, joining us online, welcome.

11
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,420
 We're so glad that you're with us as well.

12
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:24,420
 And we are excited because I honestly believe this.

13
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,440
 I said this in the 915.

14
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,560
 It's not in my script at all,

15
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,000
 but I honestly believe that this week ahead

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,960
 is gonna be the best week of your life.

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,240
 (audience laughing)

18
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,960
 The way you're sitting there looking at me right now

19
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,040
 is like I have no idea what you're talking about.

20
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,320
 You're lying to me.

21
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,940
 That might sound like a bit of pop psychology.

22
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,700
 Hands up if you just had the best week of your life.

23
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,540
 Hands up.

24
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,200
 Anyone get married or something this week?

25
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,520
 Jenny, come on.

26
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,280
 I know you guys got married this past week.

27
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,640
 There you go, there you go.

28
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,520
 It's funny, isn't it?

29
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,560
 So often we base the reality of having like the best day

30
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,840
 or the best week of our life

31
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,760
 by our circumstances and situations.

32
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,180
 You know, like if I have a great week

33
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,320
 because I've done something amazing or new

34
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,600
 or my circumstances are great,

35
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,240
 we're like, we respond with the idea

36
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,640
 of I just had the best week of my life.

37
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,520
 But it's really interesting

38
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,120
 that God is the same yesterday, today, and forever,

39
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,120
 that our relationship with Jesus is new every morning,

40
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,520
 that it's almost like the next seven days

41
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,200
 can be the greatest that you've ever had in your life

42
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,720
 because you have a shepherd.

43
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,800
 You have Jesus in your life

44
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,640
 who's longing to shape and mold and transform you

45
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,960
 and renew you and come to know you more.

46
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,400
 And I think so often we think that our best weeks

47
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,080
 are because of circumstances, situations.

48
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,720
 Maybe our best week is simply knowing

49
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,800
 that Jesus is with us again.

50
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,360
 So when I come back here next week and I say,

51
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,020
 did you just have the best week of your life?

52
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,600
 You're all gonna go, yes.

53
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,320
 Okay, maybe not.

54
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,140
 All right, whatever.

55
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,880
 Here's why I just had the best week of my life.

56
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,680
 Because I can honestly stand before you and say this.

57
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,680
 The Lord is my shepherd, so I shall not be in want.

58
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,560
 The Lord is my shepherd,

59
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,220
 so there has never been a better week of my life.

60
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,280
 The Lord is my shepherd.

61
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,580
 I have never felt more alive than I do right now.

62
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,740
 The Lord is my shepherd, so I shall not be in want.

63
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,240
 Perhaps one of the most famous verses

64
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,960
 in the whole of the Bible.

65
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,200
 Certainly the most famous verse,

66
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,260
 perhaps in the Old Testament.

67
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,300
 It's a verse, it's a Psalm that's read in funerals.

68
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,280
 It's read in a variety of different places.

69
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,040
 Perhaps you've come to hear it

70
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,940
 in a lot of different TV shows

71
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,920
 and things that happen around the world.

72
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,200
 This is what Psalm 23 is for us.

73
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,640
 It's a famous Psalm.

74
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,720
 But it's a famous Psalm

75
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,120
 'cause it sits with an incredibly important metaphor.

76
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,460
 In fact, it's a metaphor that's found

77
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,800
 throughout the whole of Scripture.

78
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,240
 It's not just a metaphor that's mentioned once or twice.

79
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,200
 It's a metaphor that starts at the beginning in Genesis.

80
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,560
 And it's a metaphor that's also repeated at the end,

81
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,120
 towards the end of Revelation.

82
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,600
 And it's the idea that God is our shepherd.

83
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,480
 Now, if you're anything like me,

84
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,600
 that is a metaphor that is about as far removed

85
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,280
 from the context of Hong Kong

86
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,920
 that you could ever possibly imagine.

87
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,760
 I mean, follow this.

88
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,960
 If this was the last time you were at a cocktail party

89
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,120
 and you said those words

90
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,520
 that we always say at a cocktail party,

91
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,360
 what do you do?

92
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,940
 And someone responded, "I'm a lawyer."

93
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,640
 And you're like, "Yes, of course."

94
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,840
 And you say to the next person, "What do you do?"

95
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,920
 They said, "I'm a doctor."

96
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,200
 You're like, "Of course you're a doctor.

97
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,160
 Do we have any bankers in here?"

98
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,320
 Then you ask the person next, "What do you do?"

99
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,240
 And they say, "I'm a shepherd."

100
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,280
 And you're like, "Oh, okay."

101
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,440
 Doesn't happen, does it?

102
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,580
 (congregation laughing)

103
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,840
 We don't know what shepherds are

104
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,100
 'cause there's really not any shepherds in Hong Kong.

105
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,720
 But here's the powerful thing.

106
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,760
 I think actually this metaphor of being a shepherd

107
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,000
 is actually the primary metaphor that God wants to speak

108
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,680
 over the Church of Hong Kong right here and now

109
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,680
 in this incredibly critical time in Hong Kong's history.

110
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,760
 In fact, Psalm 23 is a Psalm that's not just designed

111
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,920
 so that you personally would know

112
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,800
 that you have a God who loves you,

113
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,080
 that you're secure in,

114
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,900
 that has filled your life with great things

115
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,640
 so that you know that He provides for you and protects you.

116
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,080
 Psalm 23 is not just so that you would feel good

117
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,080
 about yourself and feel good about God

118
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,440
 and know that you've got a great life.

119
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,440
 Psalm 23 is actually designed to cause you

120
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,680
 to purposefully live out the reality of that security

121
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,960
 right in the midst of the craziness of the world around you.

122
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,760
 So often we read Psalm 23 and we think,

123
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,920
 "Oh, green pastures, quiet waters."

124
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,480
 In other words, I need to get out of Hong Kong.

125
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,720
 I need to get away from the crazy mess that I'm in.

126
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,560
 I need to get away from the stress and the anxiety.

127
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,000
 I need to get away from the rat race.

128
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,520
 I need to get away from all the stuff

129
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,480
 that seems to fill my mind with anxiety.

130
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,760
 I need to just get away from life

131
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,360
 and then I can know a God who secures me.

132
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,160
 Psalm 23 is actually designed to say this,

133
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,920
 you can know the rest and the beauty and the security of God

134
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,200
 even in the craziest moments of your life.

135
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,560
 And because of that, every week can be your best week.

136
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,840
 That is not dependent on circumstance or situation

137
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,280
 but you know you've got a great God.

138
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,440
 God is right here with you right now.

139
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,440
 Do you know when David wrote this Psalm?

140
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,200
 We know actually, scholars know exactly

141
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,040
 when he wrote this Psalm.

142
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,840
 He wrote this Psalm when Absalom was hunting him down

143
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,800
 in order to kill him.

144
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,960
 He was living at the time in the wilderness,

145
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,900
 the Judean wilderness in Israel.

146
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,480
 It was in the middle of nowhere, a barren place.

147
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,160
 He was on his own and somebody was seeking him

148
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,160
 with armies to kill him.

149
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,000
 And he sits down to write a poem.

150
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,760
 If I was in that situation and I wrote a poem,

151
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,720
 I would not start with, "The Lord is my shepherd,

152
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,160
 "I shall not be in want."

153
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,440
 I would start with something like this,

154
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,480
 "I am completely alone, God,

155
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,040
 "and somebody is trying to kill me, where are you?"

156
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,680
 Anyone else vibe with that?

157
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:02,320
 David, in the middle of perhaps the worst moment of his life

158
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,120
 writes one of the most beautiful Psalms

159
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,200
 about the security that's found in God's presence.

160
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,040
 Why?

161
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,040
 Because David is demonstrating something.

162
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,480
 He's not just writing a nice fluffy poem for you.

163
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,840
 He's saying, "This is what it looks like

164
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,200
 "when God actually is your shepherd.

165
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,040
 "You can be rooted in the place of peace,

166
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,040
 "no matter what's happening around you."

167
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,260
 Jesus, many years later from David's writings,

168
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,260
 picks up on this idea and he says,

169
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,740
 "You wanna know what the kingdom of God is like?

170
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,600
 "The kingdom of God is like a little piece of yeast

171
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,160
 "that you place in a massive bit of dough.

172
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,920
 "And when it gets kneaded through the whole dough,

173
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,380
 "it influences that whole dough.

174
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,920
 "That little piece of yeast,

175
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,360
 I think Jesus was talking about this idea

176
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,080
 of living out the gospel in the world,

177
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,400
 not becoming Christians so that we can escape the world,

178
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,880
 bungee jump up into heaven and la la on the clouds,

179
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,400
 but so that we can be deeply rooted

180
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,400
 in the crises of our society.

181
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,240
 So that as Christians,

182
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,280
 we could find a home in the midst of the turmoil.

183
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,120
 So that when a city has protests

184
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,140
 and there's tear gas and Molotov cocktails flying,

185
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,560
 when there's a pandemic that enrages us all

186
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,480
 and shuts us behind closed doors,

187
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,520
 as Christians, we go, "Woo!"

188
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,640
 It's my time to lean into the chaos around me

189
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,060
 with the hope of the gospel.

190
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,320
 'Cause the Lord is my shepherd.

191
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,520
 And even in this moment, I shall not be in one.

192
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,080
 Which means that you don't need to be in one either.

193
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,280
 Are you with me, church?

194
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,840
 The whole point of Psalm 23 is this,

195
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,800
 that you would be a non-anxious presence

196
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,400
 amid a chaotic world.

197
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,680
 Think about that for a second.

198
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,160
 Hands up if you would like to be a non-anxious presence.

199
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,640
 Okay, those that didn't raise your hands,

200
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,120
 we're gonna talk later, okay?

201
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,920
 We wanna be a non-anxious presence.

202
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,080
 I wanna be a non-anxious presence.

203
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,640
 Could you imagine how beautiful it'd be

204
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,200
 to live in Hong Kong as a non-anxious presence?

205
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,680
 To be rooted so deeply in the security of Christ

206
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,320
 that people are attracted to us,

207
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,200
 and we can say, "Well, the reason I'm this

208
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,280
 is because of Jesus."

209
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,080
 If you're anything like me, you're starting this series,

210
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,720
 and we're gonna take five weeks to unpack,

211
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,800
 and I'm gonna teach you as much as I can

212
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,840
 about this Psalm over the next five weeks.

213
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,100
 But if you're anything like me, this is where we start.

214
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,440
 We start in the reality of our anxiety.

215
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,400
 Amen?

216
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,880
 We start in the reality that we're not

217
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,240
 a non-anxious presence.

218
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,760
 We start in the reality that we are stressed at times,

219
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,400
 that we are overwhelmed, that despite our Christian faith,

220
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,760
 we are still overwhelmed.

221
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:52,200
 And I think that's exactly where God wants us to start.

222
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,440
 And so I actually wanna lead you

223
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,800
 in a meditation right now.

224
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,760
 Now, don't freak out.

225
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,160
 It's not a new age thing, meditation, okay?

226
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,760
 It's actually biblical, it's in scripture.

227
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,200
 I wanna lead you in a starting point

228
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,800
 of just reflecting where we are in the reality

229
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,120
 to the chaos that's around us.

230
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,840
 So I wonder whether you'd just close your eyes,

231
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,400
 and if you're comfortable, you could just open your hands.

232
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,760
 You don't need to, but if you're comfortable.

233
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,800
 If you're online right now,

234
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,120
 I wanna encourage you to do this as well.

235
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,160
 Just close your eyes where you are, open your hands.

236
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,960
 I wanna encourage you just to take a moment

237
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,380
 to start this series before God with an open heart.

238
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,800
 I want you to take a moment to think honestly

239
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,360
 about the places of anxiety in your life right now.

240
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,780
 We all have them.

241
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:46,880
 None of us are immune to worry, to concern,

242
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:52,760
 frustration, hurt, being overwhelmed.

243
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:58,040
 Wherever it might be in your life right now

244
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,680
 where you sense some anxiety, maybe a sense of fear,

245
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,900
 maybe a sense where you're not satisfied,

246
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:13,240
 where there's need in you.

247
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,660
 I wonder whether you just take a moment

248
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,600
 to think about those places for you.

249
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,400
 Some of you might wanna invite the Holy Spirit

250
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,200
 just to reveal to you those places.

251
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,120
 (congregation member coughing)

252
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,760
 Father, we thank you that although it's not always

253
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,000
 comfortable, sometimes it's important

254
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,160
 to recognize our anxiety.

255
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:43,480
 It's important for us to understand

256
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,480
 that there are things in life that do overwhelm us.

257
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,920
 Father, I just wanna pray that you would come

258
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,920
 and meet each person here with their hands open

259
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,620
 and eyes closed before you.

260
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:02,280
 Wherever it is that they're feeling overwhelmed today,

261
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,680
 you would come.

262
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,160
 Watch your eyes are closed and your hands are open,

263
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,400
 your heart is bowed.

264
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,240
 Listen to this.

265
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,800
 The Lord is my shepherd.

266
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,520
 I shall not be in want.

267
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,320
 For he makes me lie down in green passages.

268
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,200
 He leads me beside quiet waters.

269
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,240
 He actually restores my soul.

270
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:35,600
 He guides me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake.

271
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,280
 Even though I may walk through the valley

272
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:45,280
 of the shadow of death at times, I will fear no evil

273
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,560
 for you are with me.

274
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,360
 Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.

275
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,680
 I mean, you prepare a table before me

276
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,960
 in the presence of my enemies.

277
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,440
 My head is anointed with oil.

278
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,920
 My cup, it overflows.

279
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,920
 I mean, surely goodness and love will follow me

280
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,560
 all the days of my life.

281
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,560
 And I will dwell, live, abide, have my roots,

282
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,560
 find my life in the house of the Lord.

283
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,280
 Forever.

284
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,520
 Okay, you can open your eyes.

285
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,640
 Isn't that a beautiful Psalm?

286
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,760
 Isn't that wonderful?

287
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,720
 Verse one is a summary of the whole thing.

288
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,600
 It says this, "The Lord is my shepherd.

289
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,520
 I shall not be in want."

290
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:36,320
 And Dave starts with that crazy statement.

291
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,560
 And the rest of the Psalm unpacks the power

292
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,400
 of what that means.

293
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,240
 And over the next five weeks,

294
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,240
 we're gonna unpack exactly what David means.

295
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,360
 I wanna provide just a summary of that

296
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,200
 in our time together today.

297
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,560
 I wanna tell you a little bit about

298
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,680
 what being a shepherd is.

299
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,000
 But because you've never been to a cocktail party

300
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,800
 in Hong Kong and met a shepherd,

301
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,320
 I wanna take you now to the very place

302
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,800
 that David was writing about.

303
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,480
 David was writing about the Judean wilderness.

304
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,880
 He was in the Judean wilderness at the time

305
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,160
 and he was writing the Psalm there.

306
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,160
 And I wanna take you there to help you to see

307
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,440
 and get a feel of exactly what a shepherd was like.

308
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,720
 Back in 2016, I had the opportunity

309
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,680
 of traveling to Israel.

310
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,160
 And I had the opportunity of actually filming

311
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,560
 a documentary sermon series called "The Story of Jesus,"

312
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,480
 where we went through the Gospel of Luke together.

313
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,080
 If you were a part of the Vine back then,

314
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,880
 we did that series here together as a church.

315
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,840
 But during that time, me and the film crew,

316
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,800
 we got to spend a day with an actual shepherd,

317
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,680
 like a real life breathing modern day shepherd

318
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,800
 in the Judean wilderness, right?

319
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,880
 Where David wrote this Psalm.

320
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,360
 And during that day, we filmed him, filmed his life,

321
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,040
 and we interviewed him.

322
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,080
 And he told us what it was

323
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,040
 and what it meant to be a shepherd.

324
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,240
 And so I'd love to take you right now

325
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,520
 to the Judean wilderness and introduce you

326
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,800
 to a friend of mine called Abdallah.

327
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,560
 Screen's here or up here.

328
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:03,480
 (speaking in foreign language)

329
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:10,360
 (gentle music)

330
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,720
 (speaking in foreign language)

331
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,640

 (speaking in foreign language)

357
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:46,760
 - All right, there you go.

358
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,160
 (audience applauding)

359
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,920
 If anybody asks you, you've now finally met a shepherd.

360
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,280
 Now there's a couple of things that Abdallah mentions here

361
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,720
 that I think helps us understand where David's coming from.

362
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,080
 Let me read you a few of these.

363
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,480
 "The day of a shepherd doesn't finish," Abdallah says,

364
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,240
 "ever, you are always in the field with them."

365
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,120
 There is no such thing as a part-time shepherd.

366
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,600
 There's no such thing as a shepherd one day

367
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,920
 and then kind of goes off shopping

368
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,000
 in Koso Bay the next day, right?

369
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,840
 He said that himself.

370
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,680
 "I can't go shopping in Haifa or Jerusalem.

371
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,120
 "I have to be here all the time.

372
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,400
 "Even when I'm resting," he says,

373
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,320
 "I'm on the lookout to see if anything needs my help."

374
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,400
 There's this consistency, a sacrifice of 24/7.

375
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,920
 He said he's been being a shepherd for 15 years.

376
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,960
 So for 15 years, he's been with his sheep day in, day out,

377
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,240
 nonstop, that's the life of a shepherd.

378
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,040
 And when David says, "The Lord is my shepherd,"

379
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,600
 what he's trying to communicate to himself and to us

380
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,360
 is that we do not have a part-time God.

381
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,480
 You do not have a God who's a God for you sometimes

382
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,960
 and a God for you another time,

383
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,120
 and other times he's just distant from you.

384
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,400
 I think so often as Christians,

385
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,280
 we actually think that God is sometimes distant from us.

386
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,560
 We think in the good moments of life, we have God's presence

387
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,400
 but in the bad moments, in the times

388
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,600
 where maybe we've done some things we're not proud of

389
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,160
 or we've gotten involved in some things

390
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,520
 that we knew we shouldn't have gotten involved in,

391
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,360
 we think God distanced himself from us.

392
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,560
 That's completely not what scripture teaches us.

393
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,680
 If scripture says that God is a shepherd

394
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,640
 and Jesus himself uses the word,

395
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,720
 he says, "I am the good shepherd."

396
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,080
 So if Jesus is saying that,

397
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,920
 what he's saying is, "I've never given up on you.

398
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,080
 "I've never failed you.

399
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,560
 "I've never walked away from you.

400
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,760
 "I'm always here for you.

401
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,420
 "Even when you think I'm distant,

402
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,800
 "I'm actually closer than you realize."

403
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,760
 Even in the things that you've done that I'm not proud of,

404
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,120
 that I don't want for you,

405
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,960
 that kind of breaks my heart for you,

406
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,900
 my grace is always stronger than my wrath.

407
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,440
 I'm here with you.

408
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,560
 And for some of you in this room,

409
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,440
 that's an incredibly important thing to grapple with.

410
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,540
 It's an important thing for you to know.

411
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,160
 You do not have a part-time God.

412
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,520
 He is always with you.

413
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,140
 Some of you in this room feel like he's a long way away

414
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,440
 because of simply how you're living your life.

415
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,600
 And I wanna encourage you.

416
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,720
 He has never been closer to you

417
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,420
 than right here in this moment.

418
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,400
 You okay?

419
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,400
 I need a little bit more church.

420
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,360
 You there?

421
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,100
 He's never been closer to you than right in this moment.

422
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,100
 'Cause in his eyes, today is the greatest day of your life.

423
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,880
 Here's the second thing he says.

424
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,400
 He says this, "When the sun is strong,

425
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,980
 "I need to provide the sheep

426
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,480
 "with a place for the shade or trees.

427
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,100
 "A shepherd is a provider."

428
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,640
 When David says, "The Lord is my shepherd,"

429
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,760
 he's thinking about the idea

430
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,480
 of a shepherd providing for his flock.

431
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,240
 A shepherd's sole job, notice this,

432
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,320
 his sole job was to keep the sheep alive.

433
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,640
 And the way that he did that was by food and water.

434
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,560
 And here's the thing.

435
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:39,560
 The food and the water were never often in the same place.

436
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:43,040
 So a shepherd had to plan his day.

437
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,800
 He had to decide, okay, at the start of the day,

438
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,000
 we're gonna go to this field

439
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,620
 and I'm gonna get the food for the sheep.

440
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,720
 And then in the second part of the day,

441
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,800
 we're gonna go down the valley here to this river

442
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,800
 and they're gonna have a drink.

443
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,920
 And then in the third part of the day,

444
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,160
 I'm gonna bring them back up.

445
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,840
 The shepherd had to plan all that out.

446
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,040
 He had to think, how do I best provide for my sheep

447
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,240
 to grow and to flourish, to be the best that they can be?

448
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,560
 Well, I've gotta plan that out, map that out.

449
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,440
 And here's the thing.

450
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,360
 A shepherd doesn't just plan it out on a daily basis.

451
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,280
 A shepherd had to plan it out on an annual basis

452
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,920
 because there are seasons.

453
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,320
 And in the summer season, the shepherd knows

454
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,760
 that food is in abundance

455
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,840
 because of the spring and the summer harvests.

456
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,120
 But water is at a premium.

457
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,840
 He also knows in the winter, food is not in abundance.

458
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,640
 And so here's what a shepherd had to do.

459
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,320
 A shepherd had to plan to provide for his sheep

460
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,040
 in the season of winter,

461
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,280
 by in the season of spring and summer,

462
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,800
 actually harvesting more, storing it.

463
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,080
 So in the leaner months during winter,

464
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,840
 it had food to provide and give to its sheep.

465
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,240
 That's how much a shepherd has to think.

466
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,260
 They're a strategic planner over the life of their sheep.

467
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,940
 You need to know that your God is exactly the same.

468
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,280
 And this is a revelation for some of you here.

469
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,000
 God is a strategic planner over your life.

470
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,560
 He knows who you are.

471
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,200
 He knows where you're going.

472
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,720
 And like the seasons that the sheep go through,

473
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,220
 so we go through seasons, don't we?

474
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,640
 Some of you right now are in a season of winter,

475
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,120
 perhaps in your life.

476
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,360
 You would be honest and say,

477
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,440
 "I'm in a bit of a dark season.

478
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,880
 "I'm in a difficult season."

479
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,060
 You need to know that that doesn't surprise God.

480
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,280
 You need to know that He knew

481
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,040
 that you were heading into that season.

482
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,960
 And because He knew you were heading into that season,

483
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,780
 He thought to Himself,

484
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,920
 "I better store up some stuff over here

485
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,700
 "so that when they get into that season,

486
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,760
 "I can provide out of the abundance

487
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,640
 "of what they think they lack in that moment."

488
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:35,480
 You have a God who has planned every step of your life.

489
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,680
 Jesus Himself would describe Himself this way.

490
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,220
 He says, "I am the Alpha and the Omega,

491
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,040
 "the beginning and the end.

492
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,360
 "And if I'm in the beginning and I'm at the end,

493
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,920
 "well, then everything in the middle is taken care of."

494
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,200
 And some of you just need to grasp a hold of this.

495
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,240
 If you're gonna become a non-anxious presence in Hong Kong,

496
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,860
 God's got you covered.

497
00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:01,120
 God has everything in your life covered,

498
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,760
 the beginning and the end.

499
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,240
 That's what it is to provide as a shepherd.

500
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,520
 That's His life over you.

501
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,960
 That's His passion for you.

502
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,120
 And even in the winter months that you're in,

503
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,760
 you think that God has left you,

504
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,280
 you think He's surprised by it.

505
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,880
 No, no, no, He's already stored up the abundance

506
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,920
 of what He wants to give you in that time.

507
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,020
 Here's the third thing Abel says.

508
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,280
 "Sometimes there is a wolf in the middle of the desert,

509
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,920
 "and he doesn't just take one sheep for his food, but many.

510
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,320
 "If there is a virus or a sickness,

511
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,240
 "the shepherd will be concerned for his herd.

512
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,660
 "Not only is a shepherd 100% committed, 100% provides,

513
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,620
 "but he also protects.

514
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:40,660
 "He also protects from the wolves and the viruses

515
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,660
 "and the things that could disrupt the life of the sheep.

516
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,200
 "He's trying to keep the sheep alive,

517
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,960
 "so he's gonna do his utmost to protect the sheep."

518
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,960
 We saw actually in the film how Abdallah does this.

519
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,320
 He has a sheepfold.

520
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,840
 It's a modern one with fences around it.

521
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,600
 And it had that sort of cast iron gate

522
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,800
 that he moves in front of it at one point.

523
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,360
 Well, back in David's day, when he's writing the Psalm,

524
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,800
 there weren't modern day sheepfolds.

525
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,760
 What a shepherd did in those days to protect the sheep

526
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,220
 is he built a little kind of round container of stones.

527
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,620
 And the stones would be built up

528
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,740
 to about four to six feet high.

529
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,580
 And it would be about just the size

530
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,300
 of coming around this area here.

531
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,820
 And he would put the sheep in there at nighttime.

532
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,660
 And guess what?

533
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:25,540
 There was only one entrance in and one entrance out.

534
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,660
 So to protect the sheep from wolves or from robbers

535
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,500
 that might come in and try to steal the sheep,

536
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,980
 the shepherd would lie down at the front of the gate

537
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,540
 to the sheepfold that he had created.

538
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,120
 It was the shepherd's way of saying,

539
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,360
 "Nothing is gonna get past me."

540
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,720
 Have you seen the Lord of the Rings

541
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,440
 where Gandalf gets the staff?

542
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,600
 He goes, "You shall not pass."

543
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,120
 Remember that moment?

544
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,240
 You need to watch Lord of the Rings again

545
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,320
 if you don't remember.

546
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,960
 It's a great moment.

547
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,960
 This is the idea of Jesus as our shepherd.

548
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,200
 He stands before the gateways of our lives.

549
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,320
 And he says to the enemy, "You shall not pass.

550
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,600
 "You're not getting in here.

551
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,480
 "This one's mine."

552
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,000
 God does this in the sheepfold

553
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,880
 of the modern day context, the church.

554
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,760
 We are Jesus's sheepfold.

555
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,840
 He has constructed a church, not a building, but people.

556
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,340
 The people around you right now are your place

557
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:18,480
 of courage and strength and encouragement and life.

558
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,480
 This is who you're sitting around right now.

559
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,280
 The church itself is the sheepfold of God.

560
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,240
 And here's the thing, as a shepherd,

561
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,520
 Jesus is at the front door of the church in Hong Kong.

562
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,960
 He is the gatekeeper.

563
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,960
 He is the watchman over us, his people.

564
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,780
 And I don't know about you,

565
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:37,480
 but that's really encouraging news for me

566
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,440
 as we think about what the church might be going through

567
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,720
 in the years ahead here in our city.

568
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,360
 I mean, we don't know what's ahead for us.

569
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,640
 And I'm not trying to suggest

570
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,880
 that there's gonna be anything crazy,

571
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,880
 but the reality is we don't know right now.

572
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,920
 But what I do know is that we have a God

573
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,360
 who will protect the church,

574
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,320
 a God who will fight on our behalf,

575
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,800
 a God who fights battles for his sheep.

576
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,960
 That's good news for all of us.

577
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,200
 Here's the final thing Abdallah says.

578
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,960
 He says, "The heart is where you learn to lead your sheep,

579
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,820
 to guide them to the right place.

580
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:09,580
 It is where you learn to help and guide other people."

581
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:12,880
 So the shepherd is not just constantly there for us.

582
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,380
 He's not just a provider or a protector,

583
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,500
 but in order to provide and protect,

584
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,780
 the shepherd also has to do the final thing,

585
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:22,980
 and that is to lead, to guide the sheep.

586
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,660
 I mean, this is constantly what a shepherd needs to do,

587
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,260
 whether it's into that field or that field,

588
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,520
 down the valley over here,

589
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,020
 back into the sheepfold at night.

590
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,820
 Constantly the shepherd is thinking about,

591
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:34,420
 "How do I guide? How do I lead the sheep?"

592
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,180
 Now, here's what happened in David's time,

593
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,500
 as David's writing this psalm.

594
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,100
 Normally a shepherd would bring sheep into, say,

595
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,660
 a big open field, like you saw in the film,

596
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:47,620
 just like that, Judean wilderness, massive open fields.

597
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:50,020
 And the sheep would scatter all over the place

598
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,140
 to graze and get their food.

599
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,500
 But every once in a while,

600
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:57,220
 the shepherd would need to gather the sheep back to himself.

601
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,500
 Maybe there's a danger,

602
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,140
 maybe he sees a wolf in the distance,

603
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,140
 or something's happening,

604
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,780
 or maybe they need shade in that moment, whatever it is,

605
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,020
 but the shepherd has to call the sheep in.

606
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,180
 So here's how the shepherd would do that.

607
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,980
 The shepherd would come and stand

608
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,780
 in the middle of all the sheep.

609
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:14,620
 This is the reason why we set up the church this way today.

610
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,460
 All right?

611
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,340
 It's not just to be funky and fancy.

612
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,060
 It's actually to teach you something.

613
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,140
 You are my sheep.

614
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,940
 I'm the shepherd, okay?

615
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,180
 I'm in the middle.

616
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,100
 So the shepherd would come right here

617
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,540
 in the middle of all the sheep,

618
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,540
 and the shepherd would kind of look out,

619
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,700
 and he would make a distinctive call to the sheep.

620
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,420
 In the film, I don't know if you noticed it,

621
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,180
 but Abdallah, he put his hand together,

622
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,180
 and I can't make the noise,

623
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,380
 so he went, "Wee, wee, wee," something like that.

624
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,260
 Sounds like a duck.

625
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,780
 Okay, I'm sure it wasn't a duck.

626
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,820
 But he made a noise into his hand.

627
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,460
 That was his distinctive call.

628
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,980
 Now, a shepherd would come into the center of things,

629
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,580
 make that call, and the sheep,

630
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,260
 no matter how scattered they were,

631
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,820
 would gather around the shepherd.

632
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,700
 They knew the voice.

633
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,900
 This is why Jesus says,

634
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,060
 later on, some 1,500 years later,

635
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,220
 he says, "I'm the good shepherd,

636
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,820
 "and the sheep know my voice."

637
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,500
 Here's the thing.

638
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,740
 You have a God just like that.

639
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:09,020
 You wanna know why you can be a non-anxious presence

640
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,860
 in the chaos of your life right now?

641
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:15,220
 Because you have a shepherd who stands

642
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,900
 right in the middle of the scatteredness of your life

643
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,940
 and calls out to you

644
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,400
 with the distinctive call of the Holy Spirit.

645
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,260
 That's Jesus in your life,

646
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,940
 that he will come into the darkest places,

647
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:31,180
 the hardest places, the most scattered places.

648
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,700
 No matter how crazy your emotions might be,

649
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,580
 you have a God who's able to walk

650
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,900
 into the middle of that for you

651
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,940
 and call you back into peace with him.

652
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,260
 Jesus says, "All who are wearied and burdened,

653
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:47,340
 "if they would just come to me, you would find rest."

654
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:52,020
 So these ideas of security, of provision,

655
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:55,460
 of protection, and of guidance are the four things

656
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,060
 that David's trying to communicate

657
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,620
 about the idea of God being a shepherd.

658
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:03,020
 And in David's eyes, if you can get your head around that,

659
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,660
 that you always have someone with you,

660
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,540
 always have someone who's gonna provide for you,

661
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:09,060
 always protect you, always lead and guide you,

662
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:12,500
 he can make the crazy statement at the end of verse one.

663
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,540
 "I am not in want."

664
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:19,260
 That's a crazy statement.

665
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:26,100
 It's a statement I don't think I have ever made fully.

666
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:29,980
 I mean, imagine if we could say that like David did,

667
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,220
 because of all these things,

668
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,740
 'cause I have a God who's my shepherd.

669
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:35,940
 I know I am not in want, but we all have wants.

670
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,780
 We all have needs.

671
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,100
 What is David actually talking about here?

672
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:43,060
 Well, he's not talking about the fact that in Christ Jesus,

673
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:46,140
 all of your needs and wants will just magically disappear.

674
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,700
 He's not saying he's a genie in a bottle

675
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,940
 who's just gonna wave his little magic wand

676
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:52,260
 and make everything perfect for you.

677
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,860
 What he's talking about is that we have a God

678
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:59,180
 who is able to provide every good thing

679
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,100
 that we need in life.

680
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,700
 Every good thing, not everything we may want,

681
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,200
 maybe not that Ferrari or the perfect body,

682
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,940
 but every good thing that we need for life

683
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,300
 and character and sustenance

684
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,980
 and to get through the things that we face in life,

685
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:17,840
 every good thing to help you in whatever it is

686
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,700
 that God has put in your hands to do,

687
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,780
 he has provided for that thing.

688
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,100
 He is my shepherd, I shall not be in want,

689
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:28,600
 literally means I shall never lack any good thing.

690
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,900
 And because of that, we're able to then say this to God,

691
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:36,360
 I am at rest.

692
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,260
 Think about this for a sec.

693
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:43,400
 If you could honestly say that I lack no good thing,

694
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,880
 then really what you're saying is I'm at rest.

695
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,400
 I'm a restful presence.

696
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,360
 I'm not trying to grasp a hold of things

697
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,280
 that are not for me to grasp.

698
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,800
 I'm not freaking out about stuff

699
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,960
 that's not for me to freak out about.

700
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,440
 I'm not trying to find things in my life

701
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,280
 to satisfy my needs, I'm finding that satisfaction

702
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,840
 solely in Christ Jesus.

703
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:08,280
 I'm alive like I've never been alive before, I'm at peace

704
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,800
 like I've never been at peace before.

705
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,760
 This is biblical shalom.

706
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,700
 Rest in the Bible is not a beach holiday in Bali

707
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,840
 with a pina colada.

708
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:21,420
 Rest in the Bible is this idea of an eternal peace

709
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:26,420
 inside of us, this deep, eternal peace that strengthens us,

710
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:29,820
 that we know comes from a God that we absolutely trust,

711
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,260
 that we're absolutely secure in,

712
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:34,220
 one who protects, provides, and guides in us.

713
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:39,220
 To say I am not in want is ultimately to say I am at rest.

714
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:45,700
 And here's the challenge, right as we start this series,

715
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:50,580
 can we honestly say that we're not at rest?

716
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:56,260
 Can we honestly say that we found a place of complete peace?

717
00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:01,220
 Can we honestly say to ourselves that in every area

718
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:05,700
 of our lives, we have no wants, no anxiety,

719
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,900
 no sense of lack of satisfaction?

720
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:12,540
 'Cause I don't know about you, but I live in Hong Kong.

721
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:15,100
 And if you live in Hong Kong, we live in a society,

722
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,060
 in a culture, in a place where it's constantly

723
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:21,660
 challenging us that we do not have enough.

724
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,560
 It's constantly telling us that we need more,

725
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,580
 that we should get more.

726
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,520
 Look at your neighbor, they have more.

727
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:31,020
 Hong Kong is a place where, although God might be saying

728
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,900
 to us, we need to be able to say, I shall not be in want,

729
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:37,260
 Hong Kong is saying to us, I completely lack.

730
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:40,060
 Are you with me?

731
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,180
 That's where we live.

732
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,820
 And so we have to do some wrestling with the reality

733
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:50,860
 that actually Hong Kong is shepherding us

734
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:53,660
 more than perhaps Jesus Christ is at times.

735
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:57,740
 We have to wrestle as a church with the reality

736
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:00,300
 that if there are things in my life that are not at peace,

737
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,220
 if there is stuff in me, that is this anxiety

738
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,800
 wracked inside of me, if there's stuff going on,

739
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,700
 then there's probably a part of my life

740
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:11,220
 that has not yet been given over to the Lordship of Jesus.

741
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:15,660
 Because if David's true, that God is our shepherd,

742
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:19,140
 and that therefore that means we should not be in want,

743
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,500
 then if I have any areas in my life where I'm in want,

744
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,420
 I have to ask myself, is God fully my shepherd?

745
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:28,300
 Are you following me?

746
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,780
 That's the challenge of this verse.

747
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:33,060
 You could actually read Psalm 23, one in reverse.

748
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,960
 So the actual way of saying it is, God is my shepherd,

749
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,340
 I shall not be in want.

750
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:41,940
 The other way of saying it in reverse is, I am in want,

751
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,900
 therefore God is not fully my shepherd.

752
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,900
 Do you follow that?

753
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:49,020
 That's how we start this series,

754
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:54,500
 by recognizing that there is still something inside of us.

755
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:59,020
 And my question to you right at the beginning is this,

756
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,240
 what is actually shepherding you?

757
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,940
 If you're honest with yourself,

758
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:08,620
 what is actually your shepherd?

759
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:11,820
 Is it culture?

760
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:14,460
 Is it a relationship you're in?

761
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:17,540
 Is it your finances?

762
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:20,780
 Is it some life decision you need to make?

763
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,340
 Is it the pressure of somebody's words

764
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,220
 that have been spoken over you?

765
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,500
 Is it the pressure you put on yourself

766
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,880
 to try to please somebody?

767
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,020
 What actually is it that's shepherding you

768
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,380
 as the person you are today?

769
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,100
 And if there's some things inside of you

770
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:39,260
 that are anxious and stressed and not fully satisfied,

771
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,900
 if there's stuff going on inside of you

772
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:44,100
 like there is in me, I have to do the work of saying,

773
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,780
 "What then is shepherding that bit of me?"

774
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:50,660
 Because if the Lord was my shepherd,

775
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:54,140
 I could honestly say I'm not in want.

776
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:56,540
 I could honestly say,

777
00:35:56,540 --> 00:36:00,100
 "This week is gonna be the best week of my life."

778
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:03,580
 As we start the series, I wanna encourage you

779
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:07,180
 to take the time in your own spiritual devotions this week

780
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,940
 to recognize the things that we started the service with,

781
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:13,140
 those anxious places that I had you bring to mind,

782
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,980
 and to bring those anxious places to God and say,

783
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:18,640
 "Lord, what is shepherding me in this area?

784
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,540
 What is guiding me in this place right here?"

785
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:26,180
 Because I wanna be able to bring that to you,

786
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:30,100
 and I need you to be with me, protecting, providing,

787
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,660
 and guiding me in that area.

788
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:34,500
 Amen?

789
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,300
 Would you stand with me?

790
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,540
 I'd love to pray for you.

791
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:44,500
 Maybe you'd, maybe we'd finish where we started,

792
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,620
 just opening our hands.

793
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,140
 Would you just close your eyes and open your hands?

794
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:54,940
 Father, we say together in our hearts that this is us.

795
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,340
 This is for us today.

796
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:01,940
 We recognize the anxiety,

797
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:04,140
 the anxiety that's in us at times.

798
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:07,500
 We recognize how we are absorbed

799
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,580
 by the Hong Kong culture and systems.

800
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:13,900
 We recognize that we find ourselves unsatisfied

801
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,540
 because of what culture tells us.

802
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:20,380
 We recognize that we have a inherent at times,

803
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,460
 desire for more and more and more.

804
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:25,700
 And we recognize, Lord, that every time we do that,

805
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,020
 it's because something else is shepherding us,

806
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:31,020
 something that is not of you.

807
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,860
 (gentle music)

808
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,260
 Father, we recognize that the foundation

809
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,700
 of a lot of our anxiety

810
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:42,060
 is because something is shepherding us more than you.

811
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:45,020
 Father, we come to you today,

812
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,780
 not because you're angry at us,

813
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:51,980
 not because you're telling us off.

814
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:56,540
 We come to you today because you are creating a space

815
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:00,700
 for that place of intimacy with you

816
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,340
 where rest is truly found.

817
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:05,820
 Lord, we wanna be like David who,

818
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:08,900
 in being hunted down to be killed,

819
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:13,340
 could still write and say that he has nothing to fear,

820
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,860
 nothing to want, no anxiety,

821
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:19,460
 that he could proclaim that you are his shepherd,

822
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:23,820
 his protector, provider, and guider in life.

823
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,500
 Lord, I pray that that would become

824
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,660
 our declaration here at the Vine.

825
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,980
 Lord, I pray for every person in this room and online

826
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,060
 who have their hands open right now.

827
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:37,180
 Lord, I pray that they would also experience the beauty

828
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:40,900
 of a God who is with them right here and now,

829
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:45,260
 who has all their cares and concerns in his hands,

830
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:48,900
 who fights battles for them and loves them.

831
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:54,500
 Father, I pray you would fill us with the courage

832
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,420
 to bring our anxieties to you,

833
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,620
 with the courage to confess the other shepherds

834
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:03,100
 in our lives, with the courage to be able to do that

835
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:06,300
 together in our community groups alongside of one another

836
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:11,700
 so that we could walk in more rest in you.

837
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,740
 Lord, we desire to be a non-anxious presence

838
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,500
 amid the chaos of this world.

839
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,540
 Would that be the focus of the next five weeks

840
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,940
 for us as a church?

841
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,020
 We thank you for this in Jesus' name.

842
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,980
 Everyone says, amen.

843
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:24,820
 Awesome.

844
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,180
 Let's respond in worship.

845
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:29,540
