[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.840]   "And Lord, haste the day when my faithful become sight and the Lord shall return for
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:12.840]   my soul."
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:22.320]   Those beautiful words written by Horatio Spafford in 1876 really echoes so much of what the
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.900]   Advent season is all about.
[00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:32.680]   This idea of longing for the return of Christ and when he comes back, knowing that our faith
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:39.880]   is fully awake, that our faith, as he so beautifully writes, becomes sight.
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.280]   As we started our Advent series last week, I told you about the reality that Advent is
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.420]   the celebration of two important realities.
[00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.340]   It is, of course, the celebration of the arrival of Jesus as a child on the Christmas day,
[00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:00.580]   that first Advent that we celebrate, but it's also the idea of this longing for the return
[00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.160]   of Christ at the end of all things.
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:09.800]   He came, yes, as a child, but we long for him to return again as an all-conquering king.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.820]   And Advent is the celebration of the reality that we live in the in-between time from the
[00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.120]   arrival of Christ to the return of Christ.
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.180]   And those two things are like bookends around the redemptive story of Jesus.
[00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.240]   And because they're bookends, we have the privilege now to live on behalf today of those
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.920]   two realities.
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.860]   Scholars call the time that we live in now the now, but not yet.
[00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.100]   We saw this last week.
[00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.060]   We live now.
[00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.340]   Christ has come in that first Advent.
[00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.160]   He has inaugurated his kingdom.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.060]   He has in his life, death, and resurrection gone to the cross, paid the price for our
[00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.280]   sins, changed how we see ourselves in the world back into reconciled relationship with
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.200]   him, that he's ascended from the cross into the heavens, brought his spirit to fill us
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.200]   today.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.240]   We live in the now, but we also live in this idea of the not yet, that we're longing for
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.080]   Christ to return again into the world, because when he does, all of creation will be made
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.360]   new.
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.500]   And we know that despite the reality of the importance of what Christ has done in his
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.000]   Advent, his first Advent, there's still the impact of sin on us.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.080]   There's still the reality of sin in our world.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.080]   And we long for Christ to return at the end of all things as described in Revelation 21
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:34.080]   and 22, when the world will finally be as God has always called it to be.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.840]   We saw last week that the apostle Paul speaks about this now, but not yet Advent time as
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:46.340]   like seeing through a mirror darkly, like things are not quite perfect yet, that we
[00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.620]   see in part and we know in part in this time, but there's a time coming where we will see
[00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.860]   perfectly, we will know perfectly.
[00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.420]   I love how honest the apostle Paul is with his church.
[00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.220]   He's like in this Advent time of the now, but not yet, we don't know everything, that
[00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.340]   there are gaps literally in our lives, in our experiences.
[00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.180]   And we wish, don't we, that we had all the answers.
[00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.220]   We wish that we did know everything right now, but in this now, but not yet, we don't.
[00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.980]   There is a time coming that when perfection arrives, we will suddenly understand it all.
[00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.900]   But right now we live in the gaps.
[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.180]   And we talked last week about how challenging it is to sometimes live in those gaps, to
[00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.060]   not have the answers for everything, to not understand why there is so much war, brokenness,
[00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.220]   why there is so much evil still around, why we don't always have the big questions that
[00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.820]   are answered in our lives on a regular basis.
[00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.020]   And we cry out and we wonder why this is the case.
[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.580]   There are gaps, Paul says.
[00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.340]   But then he says this beautiful thing right at the end.
[00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.740]   He says, but God hasn't left us alone in the gaps.
[00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.020]   He said in this now, but not yet time where we're longing for the return of Christ, three
[00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.420]   things remain, faith, hope, love.
[00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.180]   And this is Paul's way of saying these three things are the things that help us in those
[00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.140]   gap moments of life.
[00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.100]   Because when we're in the gaps, we humans, we don't like the gaps.
[00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.280]   We try to fill the gaps with ourselves.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.120]   We try to come up with the answers.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.180]   We strive to try to sort it all out.
[00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.980]   And the apostle Paul is saying, no, no, no, the answers are not found in ourselves.
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.100]   We do not know everything, but there is a God who knows it all.
[00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.300]   And he's given us three things to help navigate those times in our lives where we don't have
[00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.060]   the answers, faith, hope, and love.
[00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.500]   These are the things that elevate us, if you will, as humans out of those gaps in life
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:45.340]   and bring us towards the worship of the one who does know it all.
[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.260]   So this week and the next two, we're going to take one of these themes of faith, hope,
[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.260]   and love.
[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.660]   And today we're talking about faith.
[00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.060]   Now there's a lot of things I could say about faith, but I only have one message on it.
[00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.660]   So I'm going to zero down to the things that I think are most critical for us in the now,
[00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.580]   but not yet advent time that we're in.
[00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.740]   The first thing you need to understand about faith is that the way that we speak about
[00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.840]   faith in the modern church is actually quite different to how faith was spoken and written
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.540]   about in the early church, in the first century church.
[00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.940]   Here in the modern day church, when we talk about faith, so often what we think about
[00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.780]   is belief.
[00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.420]   In fact, when we talk about faith, we think about some sort of doctrinal statements or
[00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:34.740]   some doctrinal beliefs that help us to understand what it is that we now live on behalf of.
[00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.660]   So if you were to say to someone, "I have faith in Jesus," what you're really saying
[00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:45.900]   is "I believe in the story that Christ came to this world as a child on Christmas in that
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.920]   original advent, that he did inaugurate that kingdom, that he did go to the cross and pay
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.420]   the price for my sins, that he did raise from the dead three days later, and I believe all
[00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.420]   of that.
[00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:00.540]   When I tell you that Jesus is Lord in my life, my faith, if you will, is based on this idea
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.340]   of a set of beliefs and that I believe that thing.
[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.540]   This is why we actually say that our Christian is a Christian faith.
[00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:13.780]   It's a Christian set of beliefs that we believe, and if you align to those beliefs, you then
[00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.900]   take on the name that I'm a Christian.
[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.240]   Are you following this?
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.960]   This is how we think about it in the modern church, but that is so far removed from how
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:27.500]   they thought about it in the first church, because in the first church, faith was not
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.980]   just about belief.
[00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.580]   More importantly for them, it was also about action.
[00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:38.500]   It was about how we now live on behalf of what it is that we now believe.
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:43.340]   And the reason why this was so important in the first century is because in Greco-Roman
[00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:50.060]   culture and society, they had a pantheon of gods, and they believed in a lot of different
[00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.360]   gods, but that didn't mean they worshipped all of those gods.
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.340]   So if you were to talk to a first century Roman, if you're a Christian in the first
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.140]   century, and you was to talk to them about belief, and you were to say, "We want you
[00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:08.020]   to believe in Jesus," a Roman would probably go, "Sure, I'm happy to believe in Jesus.
[00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:13.140]   I'm happy to add Jesus into the pantheon of all the gods that I believe in.
[00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:17.500]   Believing in him doesn't mean I have to worship him."
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:22.540]   And so the early church realized very early on that if they're going to talk about faith
[00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:27.700]   in Jesus, they needed to find a word that would actually help people to understand that
[00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:35.020]   this is not just about a belief system, that if you believe in this Jesus, everything changes
[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.020]   for you.
[00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:41.060]   That in fact, to believe in this Jesus means that you have to get rid of all of the other
[00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:46.100]   gods in the pantheon, and only believe in this one God, that you're to sacrifice your
[00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:52.580]   whole life, let go of everything, and commit your whole self to following just the one
[00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:53.580]   God.
[00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.140]   That's the core of the gospel.
[00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:59.380]   And so when the early church was saying, "How do we find a Greek word that will help the
[00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:06.080]   Romans to understand what it is to give up your whole life to follow after Jesus?"
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.720]   They chose this word called "Pistis."
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.660]   And "Pistis" means literally this.
[00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:18.060]   It means trust, trustworthiness, relational trust, but relational trust at such a deep
[00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:25.380]   degree that it's like, "I give everything I am to over in my life to this person."
[00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:31.260]   So this phrase "Pistis" was used in common Greek language to talk about a sacrificial
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.620]   trust towards one another.
[00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:38.780]   And so when the early church was trying to help people around them understand what a
[00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:45.900]   faith in Jesus might look like, they spoke about "Pistis," which interestingly is not
[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.460]   how we think about faith today, just belief.
[00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.340]   This is about trust and commitment.
[00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:55.860]   And what's important for you to understand is that the English version of the Bible,
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:09:00.060]   when it translates this word "Pistis," guess which word it translates it to?
[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.020]   You guessed it, faith.
[00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:08.540]   So anytime you read about the word faith in the New Testament, it's translating out
[00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:09.540]   of "Pistis."
[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:14.260]   It's not talking about some doctrinal statement of faith that we use today in that context.
[00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:15.780]   It's actually talking about trust.
[00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.660]   I trust the Lord with everything.
[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.100]   You follow this?
[00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.020]   It's about the totality of who we are.
[00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:26.260]   So maybe one helpful way when you're reading the New Testament and you see the word faith,
[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:32.060]   just kind of put in there, trust completely or fully trust or open my whole life to this
[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.060]   thing.
[00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:37.860]   This is like a whole life sacrifice commitment to this God.
[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.420]   That is "Pistis."
[00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:40.420]   That is faith.
[00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.860]   You're following this so far?
[00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:47.100]   Now the reason why this is all important is because when you begin to see the Bible in
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:52.540]   the New Testament, them speaking about faith, you get really challenged when it's about
[00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:59.000]   the totality of your life rather than just a belief set in your mind.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:05.260]   This is totally life transformative to have faith in Jesus.
[00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:10.320]   There are many examples that I could take you to in the scriptures on this, but I want
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:15.460]   to situate this in perhaps the most famous, the most central to this idea of faith in
[00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:21.460]   relation to this now but not yet advent kind of time that we live in today.
[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:24.140]   And this is in Hebrews chapter 11.
[00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.860]   Let me read you the first six verses.
[00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:27.860]   Listen to this.
[00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:35.340]   "Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and being assured about what we do not
[00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.580]   see.
[00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:39.360]   This is what the ancients were commended for.
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:44.660]   For by faith we understand that the universe was formed at God's command so that what is
[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:48.040]   seen was not made out of what was visible.
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:52.220]   By faith Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did.
[00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:57.420]   By faith he was commanded as a righteous man when God spoke of his offerings.
[00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:01.460]   And by faith he still speaks even though he is dead.
[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:06.680]   By faith Enoch was taken out from this life so that he did not even experience death.
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.620]   He could not be found because God had taken him away.
[00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:16.220]   For before he was taken, he was commended as one who," notice this, "pleased God.
[00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:20.300]   And without faith it is impossible to please God."
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:24.460]   Let me just stop there.
[00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:32.660]   Without faith, not saying without a set of beliefs, saying without a total, complete,
[00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:40.460]   utter, give my life in trust fully over to this God, without that it is impossible to
[00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:42.300]   please God.
[00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:43.300]   That's some heavy stuff.
[00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:46.580]   I don't know if you've ever stopped for a moment and actually thought about that.
[00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:50.820]   I want to start here at the end and then I want to work back to the beginning because
[00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:54.900]   to get a grasp of what the writer is meaning here by without faith it's impossible to please
[00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:55.900]   God.
[00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:59.260]   All of that actually then helps us to interpret the first part of this passage.
[00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:00.260]   So we're going to start at the end.
[00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260]   We're going to work way back to the beginning.
[00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:03.760]   I want you to sit with this for a second.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.580]   Without faith it is impossible to please God.
[00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:10.940]   I don't know if you've ever thought of it this way, but I think that's a very unfair
[00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:13.500]   obligation on humans.
[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.300]   Anyone feel that way?
[00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.700]   Like have you ever tried to please God?
[00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:21.820]   I have many times.
[00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:24.140]   And when we try to please God, what do we do?
[00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:26.420]   We think, okay, I need to live a better life.
[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.100]   I need to live a little bit more pure.
[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:32.820]   I need to offer my life in a different way or I need to make sure that I'm adhering and
[00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.100]   not sinning and that I'm repenting a lot.
[00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.100]   And we do all this activity, don't we?
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:42.400]   In order to try to think that we're pleasing God, that we're getting God on our side.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:46.980]   And the crazy thing is you need to realize that if we do all of those things without
[00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:49.260]   faith, he's not pleased.
[00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:54.260]   So you can do so much activity to try to win God's favor, to try to get his blessing on
[00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.800]   your side, even Christian activity.
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:01.700]   But if there's no trust, if there's no fullness of giving my life over to this thing, then
[00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:03.340]   you do not please God.
[00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:06.100]   And if you do not please God, here's the crazy thing.
[00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.820]   You are not human.
[00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:11.340]   Let me unpack that for a sec.
[00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:15.660]   Does not say in this passage, if you're good enough, you please God.
[00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:19.100]   Does not say in this passage, if you're successful, you please God.
[00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:23.380]   What it says is if you have faith, you please him.
[00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:29.140]   Ever thought about it this way, dogs do not have to live by faith.
[00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:31.220]   Dogs are not called to live by faith.
[00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:33.620]   Squirrels are not called to live by faith.
[00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:35.700]   Trees are not called to live by faith.
[00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:43.580]   See, a dog gives pleasure to God just simply by existing, by being a dog.
[00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:46.700]   Same for a tree, same for a squirrel, same for anything in the animal kingdom.
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:54.100]   The only thing that makes us human, that separates us from all the other animals, because the
[00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:57.860]   other animals are not called to live by faith, but we are, is this idea of faith.
[00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:02.900]   I don't know if you've ever thought of it that way, but faith, the exercise of our trust
[00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:10.180]   in God is the one activity we do that actually makes us truly human.
[00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:16.340]   And because it makes us truly human, when we exercise faith, we're actually coming into
[00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:18.380]   the way in which we were created to be.
[00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:28.340]   And when we live as humans without faith, we are no better than the animals.
[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:30.300]   Get that one in your head for a moment.
[00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:32.380]   Can you imagine what that feels like?
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:37.820]   We think that having faith makes us super human, don't we as Christians?
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:42.580]   Because we talk about all the time about amazing Christians that have such great faith.
[00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:45.420]   And if only I could have faith like those Christians, those are super Christians.
[00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:50.780]   If only I could be like Andrew, he's a super Christian because he has such great faith.
[00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:53.020]   He's super human.
[00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:57.580]   The writer here in Hebrews is saying, faith doesn't make you super human.
[00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:01.060]   It makes you simply human.
[00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:06.060]   It makes you actually the way you were created to be in the first place.
[00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:10.380]   And if you want to separate yourself from the animal world, from everything else in
[00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:16.020]   creation, then the only way we please God is by actually beginning to trust him with
[00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:19.020]   the wholeness of our lives.
[00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:22.140]   And when we do that, we actually come into the way we were designed to be.
[00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:25.540]   See, human beings were designed to live by faith.
[00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:31.660]   And when you live without faith, you basically end up not living in the way that you were
[00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:32.660]   designed to be.
[00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:38.620]   And that strips so much away from the potential that you have as a human being.
[00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:43.160]   The call of this passage is not to some super human moment of life.
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:47.820]   The call of this passage is just to be the way you were created to be.
[00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:54.300]   It's interesting, isn't it, to think that any human being who lives without faith is
[00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:59.180]   living at a sub human level.
[00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:02.900]   And when we're in this now but not yet time between the inauguration of Christ and the
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:07.820]   coming again, we have this opportunity to be human.
[00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:12.500]   This opportunity to cry out and say, "I want to live my life with faith."
[00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:16.860]   And so the question we should ask ourselves as we sit with this crazy idea that it's impossible
[00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:21.420]   without faith to please God, we should ask ourselves, "What then does faith look like?
[00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:23.300]   What does it mean for me to truly be human?
[00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.900]   What does it mean for me to live as my potential of a human being?
[00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:28.300]   How does that actually look?"
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:31.420]   Well, the author goes back to the beginning and he says, "You want to know what it looks
[00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:32.420]   like?
[00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:33.420]   Here it is.
[00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:36.980]   Now, faith is the confidence in what you hope for."
[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:40.420]   Let's just stop there for a moment.
[00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:43.820]   I don't know about you, but this doesn't work for me.
[00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:46.580]   This one doesn't work for me.
[00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:49.780]   Like faith is the confidence in what we hope for.
[00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:54.300]   Hope, I don't know about you, hope seems so wishy-washy, doesn't it?
[00:16:54.300 --> 00:17:01.700]   Hope seems so out there, so ethereal, so intangible, so future, not present, not right now.
[00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:05.660]   I don't know about you, but I actually think the opposite of this passage is true.
[00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:11.020]   That where we usually find our confidence is in what we have.
[00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:15.780]   The Bible is telling us here, our confidence, faith is defined by a confidence in what we
[00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:16.860]   hope for.
[00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:21.340]   But if we're honest with ourselves, we live pretty much every single day with confidence
[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:23.820]   in what we have.
[00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:29.020]   We find our confidence, our assurance in what we can tangibly feel, what we can tangibly
[00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:32.420]   see, what we can bring into our life and experience.
[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:34.380]   That's where we find our confidence, is it not?
[00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:39.140]   We have confidence in our bank accounts, confidence in the strength of our jobs, confidence in
[00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:44.100]   the roof over our heads, confidence in the community around us, confidence in our own
[00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.580]   skills and our strengths and our abilities.
[00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:49.620]   That's where we seem to find most of our confidence.
[00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:56.140]   And the writer here is saying, if your confidence is found in yourself and is not found in what
[00:17:56.140 --> 00:18:01.180]   you hope for, which is not currently yours, not currently experienced, not currently tangible
[00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:07.900]   to you, but if it's confidence here, not confidence there, he's basically saying you're trapped.
[00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.820]   You're trapped in the now and the past.
[00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:17.820]   Because think about this, there's such a difference between what we have and what we hope for.
[00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:20.280]   What we have is possessions.
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:23.540]   What we hope for is expectation.
[00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:26.860]   What we have right now is part of the past and the present.
[00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:31.660]   What we hope for is the future or to put it in the language of this series, what we have
[00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:36.300]   is now, but what we hope for is not yet.
[00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:41.300]   The author here is saying, if you have faith, you are someone who finds your confidence,
[00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.460]   not in these things that you have right now.
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:47.140]   Your confidence instead stretches forward to the things you do not have.
[00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:51.580]   The belief that in Revelation 21 and 20, there's this incredible picture of the end of all
[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:52.580]   things.
[00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:55.820]   And you're believing that the promises of God can come into your life today.
[00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:58.060]   That's where your confidence is found.
[00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:01.260]   That's a human being, the passage is telling us.
[00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:05.140]   And yet so often we find ourselves stuck on the first side of the equation.
[00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:07.580]   I only can find confidence in what I have.
[00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:13.140]   And when that takes place, we're living only in the past and the present.
[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:15.780]   We're not living in the future.
[00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:21.300]   And when you get trapped in only the past and the present, you end up becoming what
[00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.860]   Paul was talking about in that passage last week.
[00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.860]   You're just in the now.
[00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:30.180]   And there's going to be gaps and it's going to be difficult.
[00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:32.440]   And you're going to wear yourself out.
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:36.660]   This is why human beings are called to faith when they're in the gaps.
[00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:41.080]   And faith is not to double down on the stuff that we have right now.
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:48.220]   Faith is to long to reach forward, to expect in hope that better things are coming tomorrow.
[00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:53.480]   It is shifting from the past and the present towards this future that we have.
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:57.080]   Human beings are not supposed to be ones that are stuck in the past.
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:00.700]   Human beings should be the ones that are creating the future.
[00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.900]   That's faith.
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:08.100]   That's the thing that lifts us out of those gaps and stretches us outwards.
[00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:12.860]   And when we begin to live on behalf of what we hope for, what we hope for in our marriages
[00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:17.300]   and in our families and in our communities and in our businesses, not what we're currently
[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.380]   having now, but what we long to hope for in the future.
[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:25.400]   When we begin to live that way, we begin to act differently, think differently, spend
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.400]   differently, do all the things that we are supposed to do today in a different way on
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:32.840]   behalf of that story rather than the broken one we currently see now.
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:35.040]   You following me?
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:42.120]   See, the message of Advent is that true peace is found not in what you have, but what you
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:44.380]   hope for.
[00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:49.960]   And if you do not have confidence in what you hope for, you will end up holding on way
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.800]   too tightly to what you currently have.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:59.320]   And that's going to root you right here and now and is not going to move you into all
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:03.800]   the things that Christ has on his heart for you.
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:07.360]   And it's really important that we wrestle with this because this isn't comfortable for
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.180]   us.
[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:14.280]   Because we think that actually, surely the opposite of this should be true.
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:17.520]   We begin to think that, hang on a sec, God's given us all this stuff and surely that's
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.440]   where my confidence should come from.
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.880]   And God's saying, no, no, no, I want you to be confident in the things that you don't
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:22.880]   have.
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:26.360]   I want you to look forward and hope for those things that you don't have because those things
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.960]   are the things that are going to define you more today.
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:33.200]   And we realize that actually this is our story usually rather than that.
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.640]   And here's the crazy thing.
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:41.280]   When you are more confident about what you have than what you hope for, you are actually
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.920]   not living a life of faith.
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.840]   You're living a life of fate.
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.520]   Let me unpack this one for you, Sveta Tek.
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.240]   You're living actually a life of fate, not faith.
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:56.560]   Because fate is based on everything around me, what it's done, what it's doing, all the
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:01.280]   ways in which it works, all of that begins to determine how I think and act.
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:05.440]   Fate is the idea that everything is already predetermined, already planned out.
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:08.040]   There's no kind of thing nebulous over here.
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:09.400]   It's all present right now.
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:12.320]   And it all is playing out in a certain way in my life.
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:15.200]   And I'm living in the confidence of all of that.
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:18.640]   That's fateful thinking, not faithful thinking.
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:22.640]   And this is really important because so many Christians think they're living a life of
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:24.880]   faith when they're actually living a life of fate.
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:27.680]   Oh, I'm going to preach on that one.
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:32.920]   So many Christians think they're being faithful when their confidence is in their bank account.
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:37.280]   So many Christians think they're being faithful when their confidence is in their own skill
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.200]   sets and who they are.
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:43.360]   So many Christians think they're being faithful when they're actually being faithful because
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:47.680]   faith is the confidence in what we do not yet have.
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:51.600]   And if it's confidence in moving forward into what we do not have, and we're holding on
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:56.500]   to what we have as the place of our assurance and faith, that's fate, not faith.
[00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.440]   And that's a very dangerous place to be.
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:04.840]   Some of you are sticking with a job that you hate because you have more faith in what you
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:08.120]   have than what you hope for.
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:13.160]   Some of you are stuck in a relationship that you know is not healthy for you because you
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:16.800]   have more faith in what you have than what you hope for.
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:24.040]   Don't use what you have today as an excuse to hold you back what you hope for.
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:27.960]   Don't use that as an excuse to hold you back from the way in which you were created to
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:30.560]   be from your humanity.
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:34.720]   Your humanity is not to find trust in the fate things of life.
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:38.880]   Your humanity is to be released to the future.
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:42.360]   To lean forward and say, that is what's going to define me.
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:48.680]   My trust when I'm in the gap is in a God who comes and meets me in that gap.
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:53.240]   Oh, now faith is the confidence in what we hope for.
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:57.520]   I'm going to unpack that a little bit more next week when we talk about hope.
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:00.160]   Then notice what he says in the second half of the verse.
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:04.320]   He says, "And the assurance of what we do not see."
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:07.640]   All right, this one's not going to work for me either.
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:12.720]   And the assurance of what we do not see, which again, if you think about it for a sec, is
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.800]   a crazy thing to say.
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:20.880]   Because every single one of us, we basically find our assurance in what we currently see.
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:24.040]   We define our whole lives by what it is that we see.
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:25.680]   Because again, that's tangible.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:26.720]   We can see it.
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:27.960]   We can experience it.
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:31.440]   What we do not see is not what we are assured of.
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:33.680]   That again, feels nebulous out there.
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:36.200]   We want to root ourselves in what we see.
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:40.480]   In fact, I would put it this way, for human beings so often, the actual definition of
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:43.960]   success is what you can see in my life.
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.760]   This my friends is what social media is all about.
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:48.360]   This is what Instagram's about.
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.360]   Instagram is a ... and I love it.
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:50.600]   I'm on Instagram.
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:52.440]   You can follow me by the way.
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:54.840]   No, just kidding.
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:25:01.400]   But Instagram is all about putting up photos and videos that will help you to see what's
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.400]   happening in my life.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:05.600]   And I'm projecting a vision of what I want you to see.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:06.800]   Are you with me?
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:12.200]   So I want you to define your thinking about my success by the what I stuff out there.
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.560]   And you see it and you go, "Oh, I see that.
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:17.000]   Therefore that person must be this."
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.440]   We can judge that way.
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:20.920]   We can celebrate celebrities, whatever that way.
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:25.960]   What we see becomes what we are trusting, what we are assured of.
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:31.760]   And the writer of the Hebrew says, "If you do that, you are still an animal."
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:36.840]   Because animals live by their senses, by what they see.
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:41.880]   And if you're a human being and you are assured only by what you see, you are no better than
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:42.880]   an animal.
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:45.360]   You're not being a human.
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:49.120]   Humans have faith and faith pleases God.
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:53.000]   And faith is not just confidence in what I hope for, but it's also the assurance of what
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.160]   I yet right now do not see.
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:26:01.440]   In other words, what they're saying is faith changes how you see.
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:07.080]   Because so often we look out on this world, and if you're anything like me, you see brokenness.
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:12.000]   You see sin and death and injustice and decay.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.040]   You see people being mistreated.
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.700]   You see the realities of evil.
[00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:16.700]   You see betrayal.
[00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:21.660]   And when you see all of this, it's so easy to begin to think that that is the wholeness
[00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:22.660]   of reality.
[00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:27.880]   Now, this world is terrible and hard and broken and bad.
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:32.320]   And I just wish I could bungee jump out of here into heaven when everything will be fine.
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.520]   But no, I've got to live in this terrible, horrible, "Oh, I don't want to get dirtied
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.480]   by this terrible world that I see."
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.880]   And God's saying, "Have eyes of faith."
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:45.880]   Because yes, if you're an animal and all you ever see is what is exactly around you, you're
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.040]   going to probably live a pretty depressed life.
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:52.480]   But if you can actually begin to raise the eyes of faith, not just a physical eyes in
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:56.920]   which you see, but eyes of faith that enable you to see the thing that it is not as if
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:01.400]   it already was, then you're living as a human being.
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:04.880]   Then you're beginning to live out the very call of what it is to have faith.
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.920]   This is why when you're in the gaps, you're not lost.
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:13.440]   But faith God has given us to rise us up and say, "Although I see decay right now, I'm
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:16.840]   not going to trust what I only see with my physical eyes because I believe there's a
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:22.240]   spiritual realm behind the physical and there's stuff happening that I don't physically see.
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:25.720]   But with eyes of faith, I see."
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:32.080]   Could you imagine a church filled with people who look at a drug addict and they see the
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:36.680]   decay of the chemical that is ravaging the addiction in that person's life.
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.860]   And they're not ignoring the realities of what they see in the physical.
[00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:42.660]   They see the brokenness of addiction in that man.
[00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:47.340]   But could you imagine seeing then also what they might look like when they were revived
[00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:51.600]   and restored and healthy again, because they've come in a relationship with Christ and they've
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:54.040]   been able to deal with the addiction that's in their lives.
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:57.000]   And when you look at them today, you might only see a drug addict.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.200]   What would it look like if you saw them today as a drug addict and said, "I also see your
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:07.600]   future and I'm assured of the things I do not currently see."
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:12.300]   Imagine if you had a depressed friend who's struggling with a deep mental health issue
[00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:15.120]   and they were once a certain way and you loved hanging out with them.
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:19.300]   But now hanging out with them is hard and tough and you actually don't want to hang
[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:22.560]   out with them and you're not sending the phone calls anymore and you're not making the message.
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:26.680]   You kind of separated yourself because every time you see them it hurts and it's depressing
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:27.680]   for yourself.
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:33.480]   And what if you saw that person, not with eyes that see the reality of what is now,
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:37.880]   again, not ignoring what is happening, but then seeing it beyond that and saying, "Yeah,
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:40.560]   I see the pain that they're going through and the mental health challenge that they're
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:44.640]   going through, but I also see with the right support, with the right therapy, with the
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:47.040]   right help, I can see them flourishing again.
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:50.520]   And I remember what I had in the past, but I can see an even greater, brighter future
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:51.520]   for this person."
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:58.280]   Could you imagine a church that actually was human, filled with people who had faith,
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:03.080]   who could see what the world doesn't see?
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:08.840]   If you have a church like that, that church wants to change the world around them.
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:13.320]   Because God has peeled back that cover of Revelation 21 and 22 and said, "The movie
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:14.600]   ends this way."
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:19.640]   And we go, "All right, but the only way I'm going to work on behalf of that vision, because
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:26.080]   I'm so surrounded by this current one, is if I realize that I need to have hope in what
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:32.240]   is not yet here, I need to be able to see what I cannot currently see.
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:37.840]   That is the only way that I can believe that that thing can happen now and that I can live
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.280]   on behalf of that vision today.
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:45.000]   I need faith."
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:51.400]   Now this kind of faith and the lack of it is what dominates the original Christmas story.
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:54.800]   It's what dominates that story completely.
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:58.720]   You have Zachariah, who didn't have this kind of faith.
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:04.440]   Zachariah, who actually only hoped in what he had and only saw what he currently could
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:05.440]   see.
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:09.800]   So when Gabriel shows up as this angel and says, "Your wife's going to be pregnant,"
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:14.960]   he only believed in what he had, which was old age himself, old age for his wife.
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:18.480]   And he only could see what he's seen all his life, which was barrenness after barrenness
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:19.920]   after barrenness.
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:24.200]   And he responds by saying, "That's not going to happen."
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.800]   And Gabriel judges, God judges him.
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:30.360]   And yet when Elizabeth hears this news, she has different experience.
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:31.760]   She has different faith.
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:35.480]   And despite the fact that she only has what she has, despite the fact that she's had the
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:41.440]   same experiences that Zachariah has experienced, she actually responds, "I know that the Lord
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:43.200]   is pleased with me.
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:47.800]   And I believe that I am going to look forward in confidence with the hope of what I do not
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:48.800]   have.
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:54.280]   And I'm going to see with eyes that are different from what I'm currently seeing in my life."
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:31:01.040]   And Mary, when Gabriel shows up to Mary, Mary, an unmarried, told that she's going to be
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:02.520]   pregnant as a teenager.
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:06.440]   The shame that that was going to bring on her family, if she had operated out of what
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:11.640]   she had, if her vision was all about what she could currently see, she would run a mile
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:12.880]   in the other direction.
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:18.200]   Instead, she so profoundly turns to God in this little faith that she has in her to believe
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.280]   that the future could be better than the now.
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:25.120]   She says these words, she says, "May it be done to me just as you have commanded."
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.120]   That's faith.
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:32.300]   Joseph, who decides in a dream, God shows him to, "Hey, stick around, marry her, flourish
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:34.120]   as a family," when he could have gone.
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:39.720]   The shepherds who were willing to give up all of their flock to go and visit Jesus,
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:43.640]   even though they were leaving their livelihood behind, if they only believed in what they
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:47.000]   had, if they only saw what they could see, they would have stayed with their sheep.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.920]   They leave them in faith and go and visit the baby Jesus.
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:54.160]   You can go throughout the whole of the Christmas story, and it's this crying story of saying,
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:55.240]   "Have faith."
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:57.520]   And look what these people do when they have faith.
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:59.040]   They're not super humans.
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:00.720]   They're simply human.
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:07.500]   But when you live as you have always been designed and created to be, the world changes.
[00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:08.500]   That's Christmas.
[00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:10.220]   That's Advent.
[00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:17.660]   And us who live in the now but not yet, we are called to faith.
[00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:23.700]   The confidence of what we hope for, the assurance about what we do not currently see.
[00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:29.800]   And when we live like that, He is pleased.
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:36.780]   So this week, as you dive into faith for yourself a little bit more personally, here's a next
[00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:38.980]   set of questions I want you to wrestle with this week.
[00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:42.580]   Hopefully last week when I asked you to do this, you actually did the exercise during
[00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:43.580]   the week.
[00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:45.620]   And if you didn't, I still love you.
[00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:48.980]   I'm not happy, but I love you.
[00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:50.540]   I want to give you another set of questions.
[00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:53.020]   So you can take a photo of these as well.
[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:55.660]   What usually comes to mind when you think about faith?
[00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:59.620]   And how has the teaching today helped to redefine this a bit for you?
[00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:04.120]   In this moment of your life, what does exercising faith look like for you?
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:08.580]   Where is God asking you personally to have confidence in what you hope for and assurance
[00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:10.940]   in what you do not see?
[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:16.440]   Where are you currently holding on to what you have more than what you hope for?
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:21.820]   Where are you currently seeing only what is present than what is promised?
[00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:26.820]   I think if you were to take 30 minutes this week and sit with those questions, I think
[00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:31.180]   God would begin to speak to you quite strongly about your life right now and whether you
[00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:35.340]   are more aligned to fate or faith.
[00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:39.820]   And in that process, be willing to open your heart to the Lord and to do some work with
[00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:45.300]   Him to allow Him to begin to speak even deeper to you in this area of faith.
[00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:52.460]   See, I strongly believe this, that God does not want you to settle for the history of
[00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:53.460]   humanity.
[00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:57.380]   He wants you to fight for the future of humanity.
[00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:01.980]   And in order for us as Christians to fight for the future of humanity, we have to have
[00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:04.120]   faith.
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:08.700]   We have to begin to step out in ways that is beyond what we're currently seeing or
[00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:12.300]   what we're currently trusting in the here and now.
[00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:17.500]   And begin to align ourselves differently to this world so that we can rise above some
[00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:18.580]   of the things that we see.
[00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:24.420]   And when we find ourselves in the gaps, we don't fall down in the gap, but we rise up.
[00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:26.700]   And we do that through faith.
[00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:28.940]   Can I pray for you?
[00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:30.380]   Let's pray.
[00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:37.620]   Lord, we are so grateful for Advent, for this now but not yet time where we see through
[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:41.980]   a mirror darkly, where we don't have all the answers.
[00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:47.020]   We're grateful that you haven't left us alone in that space, that your spirit is present
[00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:50.760]   here with us and its fullness within us and around us.
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:53.980]   And that we have this thing called faith.
[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:59.300]   Not a set of doctrinal beliefs as important as they are, but actually a complete trust
[00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:00.720]   in you.
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:05.140]   So much trust in you that we actually let go of our trust of what we see right now and
[00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:08.260]   our trust in what we have right now.
[00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:11.900]   Grateful as we are for those things because they have come from you.
[00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:16.940]   But if our trust is in only what we have, if our sight is in only what we currently
[00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:20.940]   see, then we're making those our God rather than you.
[00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:26.340]   And Lord, you shift us to have a confidence in what we hope for, an assurance about what
[00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:27.820]   we do not yet see.
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:37.500]   You shift us out of making idols of our possessions and you help us to give our lives to expectation.
[00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:43.060]   You take us out of being trapped in the past and the present and you invite us to life
[00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:47.180]   with the future before us.
[00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:50.460]   And Father, as you pulled back that curtain and showed us what the end of the world will
[00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:54.180]   look like with every tribe and tongue and nation coming together with healing being
[00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:55.380]   there for all nations.
[00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:57.380]   Father, we want to live on behalf of that now.
[00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:01.660]   Lord, would you help us to separate ourselves from the animal world around us?
[00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:06.020]   Lord, we recognize that if we live without faith, we are no better than any of your other
[00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:07.740]   species.
[00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:14.220]   You have called and created us in your image and faith is our way that brings pleasure
[00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:15.220]   to you.
[00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:19.360]   So Lord, I want to pray for anyone in this room where this message is really hitting
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:20.360]   for them.
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:25.660]   And perhaps they recognize more fateful thinking than faithful thinking.
[00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:29.960]   Perhaps they see how they're tethered to what they have and not free to long for what they
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:32.860]   do not have.
[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:35.940]   As I'm praying, I want to say this to some of you.
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:41.940]   Some of you are remaining in a job that you hate rather than having the courage to search
[00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:46.140]   for the one that you've always longed for because you put more trust in what you have
[00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:49.420]   than in what you hope for.
[00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:52.380]   I believe that's for some of you here in a relationship.
[00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:57.660]   You're in a relationship that you know is not healthy for you, that is not helping you,
[00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:00.940]   and yet you're remaining in that relationship because you have more trust in what you have
[00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:07.500]   than trust in what you're hoping for.
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:12.480]   So Lord, if there's anybody here where that resonates for them, Lord, I want to pray again
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:16.660]   for the liberation that comes from the work of your Spirit in our lives.
[00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:23.460]   Lord, I want to pray that we would have the courage to live with faith and that in so
[00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:27.420]   doing we would become the people that you've created us to be and we would help to see
[00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:33.060]   this world move towards that grand vision of every tribe, tongue, and nation worshipping
[00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:38.100]   you, of all of the healing on the leaves of the tree in that beautiful city that's to
[00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:41.900]   come, that we would say, "That's the vision that drives my heart.
[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:45.700]   I want to live for the future, not the past."
[00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:47.140]   Lord, this is faith.
[00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:53.580]   I want to just encourage you just to receive that now.
[00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:58.580]   The Bible says that faith is a gift of the Spirit.
[00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:05.700]   So I want to pray for the Spirit of God just to come and stir great faith in some of you.
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:07.700]   Some of you, it's been about faith too long.
[00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:09.980]   It's time for you to move in faith.
[00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:11.700]   It's going to take courage.
[00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:16.580]   It's going to take a different way of thinking, but that is the way you will please the Lord.
[00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:20.900]   Lord, would you release faith in the name of Jesus over these people?
[00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:24.460]   Lord, would faith rise up?
[00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:27.140]   Faith rise up.
[00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:33.380]   Lord, give us eyes to see what we currently do not see.
[00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:39.980]   Give us hope where hope feels like it's been stolen from us.
[00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:43.780]   Revitalize our humanity.
[00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:45.580]   We pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:47.540]   Everyone says, "Amen."
[00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:51.460]   Hey, would you stand with me and we're going to just finish our time together responding
[00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:55.220]   in just a time of worship in response to what the Lord is doing here.
