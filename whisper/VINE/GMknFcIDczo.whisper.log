[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   The past is here at the Vine and we are so glad you're in this room online with us right now watching from wherever you might be watching
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.840]   Around the world around Hong Kong also in our overflow as well. We're so glad that you guys are with us, too
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.760]   It is vision Sunday
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.240]   And vision Sunday is one of the Sundays of this year that we see is
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.600]   most important most dear to the direction in the future of us as a
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.960]   Community if you've not been here at the vine for long, you're probably wondering what is this?
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.440]   Vision Sunday is a time where we share
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.240]   What we see as God's vision for us as a church
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.280]   what we see is God's heart for us as the community that's called the vine and
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:47.720]   We talk about what God wants to see happen in and through us in the year ahead and that as part of that
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.440]   We ask you boldly
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.720]   We ask you boldly to use your resources
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:01.240]   superficially towards the vision that God has for his church and for us here at the vine in Hong Kong and that's
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.680]   What we're gonna do today
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.240]   But as I was praying over the last number of months in preparation for today
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.880]   As we as a leadership here at the vine were praying and seeking God's heart
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.080]   We felt like God was actually calling a shift for us
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.200]   Calling us actually to approach things today a little bit differently
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.400]   As I was praying about two months ago asking God for his vision for the vine. I
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.360]   Hope God say this he said Andrew. What is my intent for my church?
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.160]   Kind of a simple question, right Andrew
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.360]   What is my intent for my church and I figured as a pastor of a church?
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.360]   I should have an answer to this question, right?
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.920]   Have you ever had God ask you a question and then you're like, I'm gonna now teach God something, right?
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.960]   I'm gonna now theologize with God, right? So he's like Angie. What is my intent for my church?
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.040]   And I'm like, I know this question. I've given up my life to build and serve the church
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.400]   I said it's this that that we as the the leaders of the church need to get around the people in the church and and
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.440]   Equip them for works of service
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.400]   So that together we would be built up to become more and more like Christ Jesus
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.800]   I basically started preaching Ephesians 4 at God, right? And I said like this is what it's all about God, right?
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:26.040]   This is about us gathering together in a room or gathering wherever we're sitting online watching this and and spending time speaking life into each
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:33.080]   Other so that we can disciple each other so that we can grow up to more maturity and become more like Christ Jesus
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.080]   I felt really good about myself preaching to God, you know, and
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.040]   It's so funny, you know
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:46.800]   God has such a gentle but also very direct way of speaking back when we're arrogant with him
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.880]   He said hmm
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.080]   Have I heard God say to you? Hmm
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.200]   That's when you know, you're in trouble. Hmm
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.480]   He said I want you to read something because you've forgotten
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.960]   What my intent for the church really is and he led me to a passage in Ephesians chapter 3
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.160]   I want to read this to you because this has changed so much of my life in the last few months
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.460]   He writes this this is Paul writing to the church in Ephesus
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:22.400]   He's speaking of God. He says his intent was that now through the church the manifold wisdom of God
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.980]   Should be made known to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly realms
[00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.320]   According to his eternal purpose, which he has accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.120]   Paul is writing to a small group of people
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.440]   who at this time gathered in house churches in the city of Ephesus a
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:47.240]   City that was filled with people who worshipped sacred and magic cults
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:53.880]   It had one of the largest temples of worship to Diana in the whole of the Greek and Roman Empire
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:00.040]   It was a place that was famous for people to go to to do idol worship to speak about this
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.840]   Magic cult that they're a part of and Paul picks up a little bit of that language and he says here's my intent
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.520]   My intent is that the manifold wisdom of God
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.320]   Would be revealed to the authorities and the powers in the heavenly realms
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:20.800]   Which is Paul using magical language to speak of the reality of God wanting to say something to the world
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:27.560]   And he said here's God's intent. He wants the manifold wisdom of God to be revealed to the world
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.040]   And so we might be wondering what is this idea of the manifold wisdom of God?
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.160]   Well Paul in chapter 1 in the book of Ephesians actually explains what that is
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.160]   And he said here's the will of God. Here's what all of God's wisdom is about
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:49.160]   He wants to see everything on heaven and earth come under one person. That is Christ Jesus
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:57.840]   Paul Paul pulls out his beautiful image of what the whole of God's intent and his will and his desire and his wisdom is for
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:04.840]   the world that everything all of the broken things all of the separate things all the divided things all of the things that hate all of
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:11.520]   The sin all of the stuff that's in us as humanity that all of it would find its rightful place its renewed place
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.520]   It's restored place under Christ Jesus
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.880]   It's this beautiful vision that God's wisdom is reconciliation
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.240]   God's wisdom is
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.160]   Restorative life for people it is so that in him and through him we would become new
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.280]   Creations the old would go would go and the new would come
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:37.960]   So it's a pool lays out this incredible picture of what God's will and desire in the world is that everything that is currently broken and separated
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.040]   would actually come to new unity and life and
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:46.720]   reconciliation and restoration under the person of Jesus Christ and
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:53.600]   Then he says this it is his intent now that through the church
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.920]   That manifold wisdom would be known to the world
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.040]   Here this guy's through the church
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:07.680]   Now remember he's speaking to a bunch of people who are hiding basically in house churches
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.040]   Who are probably 20 30 40 people at that time?
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:18.840]   This is 300 years before the institution of church where church becomes more of an organized religion
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.920]   He's writing to a bunch of people in a house
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:27.860]   And he's saying here's God's vision that through the 40 of you who meet regularly in house churches
[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.800]   That you through you would come the manifold wisdom of God to see
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:38.920]   Reconciliation and love and and forgiveness and grace be seen and heard in the world
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.760]   That should blow our minds
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.120]   through the church
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:51.760]   That actually what we do when we gather in these rooms is not actually primarily about us feeling better about us. Oh
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.520]   I'm gonna preach on this one
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:01.800]   That actually what this is about when we gather together whether that's in larger rooms like this whether it's in homes like those watching online
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:07.680]   Right now whether it's in workplaces wherever it might be where where God's people gather together
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:16.220]   Through that God wants to release a manifold vision of his wisdom in the world. He wants to release restoration
[00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:22.700]   Reconciliation and love to the world which means something and this is gonna sound very controversial
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:27.580]   But stick with me for a second, which means that the church is not actually about Christians
[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:33.100]   Come on, the church is not actually about Christians
[00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:38.940]   That the church gathers together on behalf of the broken world around it
[00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:43.600]   That we get to be the manifold wisdom of God to the world
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.100]   That's exciting
[00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:47.740]   That's what it's supposed to be all about
[00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:53.180]   and so here I am preaching at God about the fact that we're all gonna equip ourselves for works of service so that we might
[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:57.980]   Become mature and to the wholeness and the wholeness of Christ and that is absolutely what God does also through the church
[00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.060]   But then God says but you've forgotten something
[00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:08.100]   You've forgotten actually a hidden imperative that is so critical that actually what I want to do through you is release my love my wisdom
[00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:12.140]   My reconciliation my will to the world out there
[00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:20.140]   So when you gather what better be in your minds what better be in your heart is everything out there and not just what's on in here
[00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:24.620]   Hmm so
[00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:33.420]   When I was praying and saying God, what is the vision that you have for the vine God quite rightly flip the script
[00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:39.660]   And he said to me Andrew your question should not be what is my vision for the vine?
[00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:43.420]   Your question actually should be what is my vision for Hong Kong?
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:47.500]   Because if the church is
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:52.340]   the manifold wisdom of God to the world and if the vine is
[00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:58.700]   Founded and it's growing and it's part of the city of Hong Kong what you should really be asking me Andrew is what is my?
[00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:00.740]   Heart for Hong Kong because I love Hong Kong
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.740]   I love the people of this city
[00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:09.020]   And I see Hong Kong and I have so much for the city and really if you want to be a church that has a vision
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:13.940]   Here's what your vision should be your vision should be in line with what my vision is for the world
[00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:20.700]   What my vision is for the brokenness that's out there what my vision is for the fact that there are so many people who are
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:28.060]   Scrambling trying to find the key to open the lock that would actually set them free and the church is silent. Oh
[00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:31.980]   I'm gonna preach today. Are you ready?
[00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:35.660]   but the church has been given the access code and
[00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:38.500]   It's our season
[00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:40.860]   to release our voice
[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:43.020]   And if you think about it
[00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.740]   Surely now more than ever. I
[00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:53.420]   Mean this is why I think that we have been called into intimacy as a church in this year
[00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:58.220]   You see I think so often when we think about intimacy we actually think about ourselves again
[00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:05.020]   We think about intimacy being primarily about my own personal relationship with God and what that can do for me
[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:09.940]   But I actually think this that intimacy when a church is called to intimacy
[00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:13.740]   It's about drawing closer to the heartbeat of Jesus
[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.420]   closer to the
[00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:20.260]   Relationship we have with the Holy Spirit closer to the power that is found in the love of the Father
[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:26.060]   So that yes, we may hear about ourselves and grow and change and disciple and become more and more like Christ Jesus
[00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:30.620]   But also so that we could hear what God has in his heart for Hong Kong
[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:34.020]   And I believe over the year ahead as we gather together
[00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:41.980]   Individually and corporately on Sundays and connect into intimacy with Christ. It's because he wants to draw us in to send us out
[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:45.380]   He's not drawing us in for in sake
[00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:49.860]   This is really important. We actually saw this last year throughout the whole of the Exodus series
[00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.460]   Didn't we in that series?
[00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:58.260]   We saw that God took his people who were enslaved in in slavery in Egypt drew them out of that drew them into himself
[00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:02.220]   Around Mount Sinai gave them the law so they could understand his heart
[00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:10.020]   Why so that he could then send them out into the promised land so that they could reveal the manifold wisdom of God in the world
[00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:17.860]   Could it be that our year of intimacy is really not so much about just us and our own personal growth
[00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:21.900]   But maybe it's about Hong Kong and its growth. I
[00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:25.340]   Don't know about you
[00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:31.180]   But most of my foreign friends right now. The main question they asked me is this
[00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.060]   Do you really still want to live in Hong Kong?
[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:39.820]   Anyone else heard that recently like do you really still want to live in Hong Kong?
[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:44.620]   Like have you seen Hong Kong right now? I mean, I mean surely there is also
[00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:51.860]   Singapore and Taylor Swift like maybe you can move to Singapore and you would have Taylor Swift you have messy
[00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:57.140]   They have Taylor Swift. Okay, they they have Ed Sheeran. They have Coldplay
[00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:02.820]   They have a great economy like really do you still really want to live in Hong Kong?
[00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:06.980]   And if we're honest with ourselves
[00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:10.580]   There's actually some pretty big challenges in Hong Kong right now
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:14.260]   Hong Kong's been through a rough time over the last five years or so
[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:18.940]   the social unrest and changes that happened off the back of that
[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:25.440]   With Kovac coming into our city and some of the challenges that were found in Kovac for all of us
[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.100]   Hong Kong's had a pretty rough time
[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:33.140]   And although now we're about a year and a half out of some of that really hard stuff
[00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:35.860]   Hong Kong's still struggling I think to recover and
[00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:41.300]   There's still some pretty major issues that are right here on our doorstep
[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:46.100]   One of things we have to realize right now is that Hong Kong is facing a mental health crisis
[00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:52.660]   Recent study was done by the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups and they looked at and interviewed personally
[00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:57.300]   4,000 secondary school students and out of all of these
[00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:02.580]   4,000 secondary school students from a whole cross-spectrum of local schools in Hong Kong. Here's what they found
[00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:07.700]   51.9% of them had early emotional symptoms of depression
[00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:10.740]   51.9%
[00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:14.020]   They then found within the 51.9% that about
[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:22.680]   48.6% of them were actually registering the highest levels possible for anxiety and stress as a scale that you can
[00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.140]   Basically discover somebody's anxiety and stress levels
[00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:32.020]   48.6 had the highest anxiety and stress levels that are possible to be recorded
[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:40.220]   Save the Children Hong Kong did a recent study and they wanted to look at youth suicide and
[00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:43.900]   They looked at the ages of 15 to 24
[00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:48.940]   And they looked at a hundred thousand out of a hundred thousand people in that age range in Hong Kong
[00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:52.580]   How many have actually committed suicide? So what is the suicide rate?
[00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:58.860]   Here's what they found. They found that the rate was six point two people out of a hundred thousand back in 2014
[00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:05.260]   But in 2020 that had risen to ten point four percent or ten point four people out of a hundred thousand
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:11.140]   Now that was in 2020. I wonder what that statistic would be if they did it now in 2024
[00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:16.420]   I would argue it's jumped up even more from that point and here's something else they found in that report
[00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:17.780]   And this blows my mind
[00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:22.660]   They also looked at university students in our city and they discovered that ten
[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:25.300]   percent of the people they spoke to
[00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:31.300]   Had either tried to kill themselves in the past year or had thought about killing themselves in the past year
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.780]   ten percent
[00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:36.980]   We have a mental health crisis in our city
[00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:43.180]   Outside of that you just need to look economically and politically at some of the challenges we have in the city
[00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:45.940]   Hong Kong has always had one of the highest
[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:49.140]   Gini coefficients in Hong in the world
[00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:51.700]   That's the gap that there is between the wealthy and the poor
[00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:55.580]   Hong Kong's always had one of the more higher of those around the world that has actually only
[00:14:55.580 --> 00:15:01.180]   Increased in the last number of years over Kovat the wealthy got wealthier and the poor got poorer
[00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:04.100]   One of the great challenges in our city is affordable housing
[00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:10.340]   affordable housing for the poor the people that really need it and out of some of the affordable housing that we do have the
[00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:13.920]   Quality of that affordable housing is also a challenge for us
[00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:16.980]   add on to that some of the thoughts around
[00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:19.140]   kind of the
[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:22.900]   Population decline that's happened in Hong Kong over the last little while
[00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:29.220]   The government's very aware and is working really hard to try to attract foreign investment back into the city
[00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:32.940]   Track foreign talent also back into our city
[00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:38.460]   Talk about some of the frustrations that are there for young people under the age of 30
[00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:41.900]   a lot of them are worried about their
[00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:46.180]   Ability for freedom and their belief of freedom of speech and freedom of expression
[00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:52.180]   Many of our young people under the age of 30 are asking is the one country two systems really gonna work
[00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:58.220]   Is that going to change more dramatically in the near future a number of them are also wrestling?
[00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:03.060]   With where their future is going in the report by save the children
[00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:06.380]   Here's some quotes that were found in that report. Let me read this to you
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.860]   There is no future anymore in Hong Kong
[00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:15.700]   I have too much pressure to provide for my family. I have no dreams for life
[00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:22.020]   These are representative of what is happening to this generation in our city
[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:26.260]   And so when we actually take a look at some of the challenges that we have in Hong Kong
[00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:30.820]   Maybe the question is do you still really want to live here?
[00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:37.980]   Talk about somebody taking away my my main preaching point
[00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:40.500]   I
[00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:48.020]   Mean I mean do you do you really still want to live here and if it's true if it's true that the church
[00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:50.820]   through the church the manifold wisdom of
[00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.580]   reconciliation
[00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:54.860]   restoration love power forgiveness
[00:16:54.860 --> 00:17:02.100]   Grace is seen through the church if that's true, then surely this is the most important time to be in Hong Kong
[00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:08.340]   Surely this is the time where we would want to double down and invest in our city at this time
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:11.300]   Surely this is the time where we realize as the church
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:16.220]   It is no more important moment in history than right now for us to release our voice
[00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:21.420]   For us not to stand next to the people who are desperately searching for the key to open the lock
[00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:28.980]   But actually to say let me tell you about the manifold wisdom of God because through the church that will be seen
[00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:35.020]   It's not beautiful that God would want to release through this group of people us
[00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:42.580]   And all of our weaknesses and all of our flaws that manifold wisdom of God think about this the church
[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:45.260]   matters
[00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.740]   The church matters
[00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:54.100]   Because together through the grace of Christ we are God's vessels in all of our flaws and weaknesses
[00:17:54.740 --> 00:18:00.020]   To reveal the manifestation of the wisdom power and love of God to the world
[00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:03.780]   That's why we do what we do
[00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:07.980]   That's why you gather here every week if you come here
[00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:12.500]   That's why you join us online from wherever it is that you're joining us right now. We do it
[00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:17.180]   Yes, so that we can grow in Christ. Of course. Yes so that we can heal and be renewed. Absolutely
[00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:20.860]   Yes, so that we can become more like the the wholeness of the wholeness of Jesus, of course
[00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:27.220]   But here's the core reason why you gather it is so that you through you
[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:29.940]   Through me through our weaknesses and our brokenness
[00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:35.100]   We would still be a manifestation of the reconciling and restoring love of Christ to the world
[00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:38.780]   Isn't that beautiful? That's what church is about
[00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:44.300]   Now here's the interesting thing
[00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:49.340]   This is not the first time that God has had a passion for a city
[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:55.260]   In fact scripture is filled with a picture of God's passion for cities
[00:18:55.260 --> 00:19:03.420]   And cities are always on God's heart. And if that's true, then we have to say that God so loves Hong Kong
[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:07.420]   And perhaps if we can take a look at God's heart for a city in scripture
[00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:10.260]   We might be able to connect that to God's heart for our city as well
[00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:15.460]   And in that might get a better understanding of why we do what we do. I
[00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:20.380]   Want to take you actually to one example of this from the prophetic book of Zechariah
[00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:25.900]   Zechariah is important for us to go to you because of some of the connections that I think are to the season that Hong Kong
[00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:27.420]   Is in at the moment
[00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:31.540]   Zechariah is prophesying to a group of people that have returned from exile
[00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:34.300]   You probably know the story in the Old Testament
[00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:40.380]   Jerusalem is there. It's a thriving city, but it's broken and in the sin of idolatry
[00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:44.980]   God brings up Babylon and Babylon comes and actually breaks down the walls of Jerusalem
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:51.260]   actually kills many of the people in Jerusalem and takes a remnant of them into captivity in Babylon and
[00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.500]   For 70 years in captivity
[00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:55.380]   God's people
[00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:57.380]   suffer in Babylon and
[00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:02.940]   After the end of that 70 years God in his grace raises up Persia and Persia comes and actually releases
[00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:06.260]   all of the Jewish people back to Jerusalem and
[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:11.540]   Zechariah is writing 20 years after they've returned to Jerusalem
[00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:16.680]   So they've come out of this really traumatic time and this traumatic season
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:22.920]   They've come back into the city of Jerusalem and for 20 years later Zechariah now begins to speak and here's what's happened
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:27.260]   They are still finding themselves holding on to the trauma of their past
[00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:34.020]   And I think if we're honest with ourselves Hong Kong and we are still processing a lot of the trauma
[00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:36.460]   That we've experienced over the last four or five years
[00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:41.020]   And we're still holding on to so much of that. And like I said earlier
[00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:44.740]   there are some significant issues that we should be concerned about and
[00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:50.380]   Here is a group of people who have returned to Jerusalem being set up in God's city and 20 years later
[00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:55.580]   God has to raise up Zechariah to bring a word of hope and a word of life
[00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:59.100]   To a bunch of people who needed a new vision
[00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:06.820]   They needed to understand what is God's heart for Jerusalem? I think we need to understand. What is God's heart for Hong Kong?
[00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:11.820]   And so I want to show you some of the things that Zechariah said, is this helping anyone? Is this alright?
[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:15.420]   Good all right
[00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:17.460]   Zechariah chapter 8
[00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:22.580]   Starting in verse 18. Let me read this to you again. The word of the Lord Almighty came to me
[00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:30.460]   This is what the Lord Almighty says the fast of the fourth fifth seventh and tenth months will become joyful and glad
[00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:33.480]   occasions and happy festivals for Judah
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:36.060]   therefore love truth and peace
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:41.380]   This is what the Lord Almighty says many peoples and the inhabitants of many cities will yet come
[00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:45.780]   and the inhabitants of one city will go to another and say let us go at once to
[00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:53.700]   Entreat the Lord and seek the Lord Almighty for I myself am going and many peoples and powerful nations will come to
[00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:57.140]   Jerusalem to seek the Lord Almighty and to entreat him
[00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:03.020]   This is what the Lord Almighty says in those days ten men from all languages and nations
[00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:09.900]   Will take firm hold of one Jew by the hem of his robe and say let us go with you
[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:15.260]   Because we have heard that God is with you. This is a glorious vision
[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:23.380]   That God is unwrapping through Zechariah to a bunch of people in Jerusalem who are still wondering. What is the hope of this place?
[00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:28.660]   They're still asking the big question. Do we still really want to live here?
[00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:33.660]   And God through Zacharias says oh, yes you do and let me tell you why
[00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:39.500]   The first thing he says is okay. First of all, your fasts are about to change now
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:45.580]   Let me explain why this is important when Israel was in captivity in Babylon for 70 years
[00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:51.660]   It was a very important time for them to lament there had been so much that they had done
[00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:53.300]   before
[00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:58.460]   Babylon had come into Jerusalem and it was so much that they were still wrestling with and trying to process and
[00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:00.500]   During those 70 years in captivity
[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:05.860]   they actually wrote so many of the lament Psalms that we have in the book of Psalms and those it's a chance for
[00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:12.980]   Actually, actually the Jewish people to to basically process their trauma together in a place of lament and the fast
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:20.020]   What happened was that the Jewish leadership at the time decided we're gonna fast every single month and in those fasts
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:23.860]   It's gonna be a place for us like to tear our garments to put on sackcloth
[00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:30.740]   to realize that the world is not how it's how it should be to understand that we're under trauma and grief and to be able
[00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:37.580]   To try to process some of that in a place of lament and what had happened was although God had now released them back
[00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:44.340]   Into Jerusalem. They were still acting in those ways of captivity back in the freedom of Jerusalem
[00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:48.020]   And so God shows up and he does something really quite powerful
[00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:52.980]   He says I'm gonna take those fasts that you've instituted and here's what I'm gonna do
[00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:57.300]   I'm gonna make them joyful events and happy festivals
[00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:03.460]   In other words what you were doing once to lament and process trauma now
[00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:09.820]   I'm gonna flip the script around and those are gonna be times of hope for you times of joy for you times of happiness
[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:15.020]   For you and you're gonna be able to move forward in a new way a new way of thinking a new way of believing
[00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:21.580]   Before yes, you needed to process your trauma, but now you're back in my city and I've got hope for that city
[00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:24.900]   I've got a future for that city. I'm about to tell you all the things I'm about to do
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:32.340]   but in order for you to capture that you need to start shifting from a place of lament and trauma and grief towards a place of
[00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:35.220]   Hope and life and and courage again
[00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:39.260]   Notice that he doesn't say that your problems are gonna go away
[00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:45.060]   He doesn't remove the fasts because the issues are still gonna be there
[00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:49.900]   I'd be silly to stand in front of you today and tell you just because the church gets its voice
[00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:52.340]   It means all the issues in Hong Kong is gonna go away
[00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:56.580]   The issues will probably still remain those facts that I've talked about
[00:24:56.580 --> 00:25:02.340]   Those are big issues and complex issues that a lot of hard work will need to go in to see a shift and a change
[00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:03.660]   But here's what I am saying
[00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:09.500]   The time is coming the time is now to shift our approach to all that issue from oh
[00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:12.660]   I'm not sure if I want to be here anymore - oh my gosh
[00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:16.100]   I'm so glad I'm planted here because I can see what God is doing in this
[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:21.980]   I can see that there could be a better future that there could be a place of hope that we could move forward and see
[00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:25.100]   the manifold wisdom of God's reconciliation and restoration
[00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:32.380]   Come for the university students and the young people and everybody in this city who doesn't have a vision. We have a vision
[00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:38.400]   And so we're gonna take the thing that we used to lament about and now we're gonna look at it and we're gonna say
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:43.340]   All right, there are issues but we're gonna approach those issues from a place of joy of hope
[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:51.420]   That isn't it a privilege that we get to walk into broken people and show them something of the light of Jesus. I
[00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:55.660]   Think we need this in our city
[00:25:55.660 --> 00:26:02.220]   And I think God is signaling a shift in our city a shift in the spirit of our city
[00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:06.420]   And if the church doesn't do it who else is gonna do it?
[00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:11.620]   I mean think about this if it is through the church that the manifold wisdom of God is revealed in the world
[00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:18.940]   Then if the church doesn't rise up with a fresh vision of joy in this
[00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:23.740]   Season, how could we ever expect the national consciousness to change?
[00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:26.820]   Come on church you with me
[00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:29.340]   Like how could we ever expect the national consciousness?
[00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:36.220]   to change if the church is not rising up with a fresh vision a fresh hope of joy and
[00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:40.060]   Courage and what God sees in this place if we can't do that
[00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:44.680]   How could we ever expect the world around us to change because it is through the church
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:48.420]   That the manifold wisdom of God is revealed in this world. Oh
[00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:51.900]   Man, that should pump our veins more than anything else
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:58.460]   Bible is very clear. The Bible says that it is the joy of the Lord. That is our strength
[00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:01.580]   the joy of the Lord
[00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:03.900]   Not our smarts not our finances
[00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:06.500]   not our
[00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:10.900]   Great things that we do is the joy of the Lord. That is our strength
[00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:16.920]   Which means that when we're in a season where that joy has been taken from us and again
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:23.040]   perhaps there's some right reasons because we needed to lament and we needed to face and we needed to grieve and at the vine over the
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:26.880]   Last five years we've created space many times for us to be able to do that
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:33.740]   But we have to realize that when that happens in a city or in a church community the ultimate
[00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:36.220]   Reality will be that that will result in weakness
[00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:44.780]   when joy is removed people and cities and societies governments and churches get weak and
[00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:49.340]   It's really important that we understand this Jesus did not go to the cross for a weak church
[00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:54.400]   He went to the cross so that we would trade our sorrow for joy
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:28:01.380]   So that the joy of the Lord would be our strength and notice that when the Bible says the joy of the Lord is your strength
[00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:03.380]   He's not just talking about Christians
[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:05.380]   That's the formula for every human being
[00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:10.300]   That when every human person comes into the recognition of the joy of the Lord
[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:16.300]   They will find renewed strength and vigor and they won't be saying I have no vision for my future
[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:22.320]   They were saying I am so glad that I am Hong Kong Chinese that I am in Hong Kong planted in this place
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:26.860]   Oh, I struggled. Oh, I wrestled but guess what the joy of the Lord is in me
[00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:32.460]   And because the joy of the Lord is in me, I want to open my mouth and share the hope share the courage share the future
[00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:35.220]   I want to speak now because I had this
[00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:38.540]   Overflowing sense of the peace and the love of Christ in me
[00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:41.340]   the joy of the Lord is
[00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:43.540]   my strength I
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:47.940]   Wonder whether
[00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:53.180]   we as a church need to regain the practice of the joy in the sacred and
[00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:58.820]   I thought it was really powerful earlier because we didn't orchestrate this when at the end of worship
[00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:04.180]   We just shouted for like I don't know how long it was 30 seconds or so. Some of you were like, okay
[00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:05.900]   I'm kind of done shouting now
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:09.620]   Others of us were just wrapped up in this incredible praise of God. Amen. I
[00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:16.420]   Think we need to restore joy in the sacred again, and I think the joy of the Lord will be our strength. Amen
[00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:19.220]   and in that joy
[00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:22.580]   That joy is not just so that we would feel good about ourselves
[00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:27.020]   That joy is the fuel for the manifold wisdom of God in the world
[00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:29.780]   Now here's the next thing he does
[00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:32.340]   He then says this this is what the Lord Almighty says
[00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:38.900]   Many people's from the inhabitants of many other cities will yet come and the inhabitants of one city will go to another and say let
[00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:44.780]   Us at once go to entreat the Lord and seek the Lord Almighty. I myself am going I love this
[00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:48.460]   This is the opposite to what we've seen over the last number of years here in Hong Kong
[00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:52.700]   God's like here's my vision for my city if people could just understand this
[00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:57.780]   I'm gonna rise up the church to be the manifold wisdom of God in society
[00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:01.620]   So that people actually see that society and go I want to be a part of that
[00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:06.540]   That society is better than my society that city is better than my city
[00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:11.100]   There's something that's going on. Those people are more joyful when they're under persecution
[00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:15.060]   Those people seem to be more joyful, even though things are hard
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:20.660]   Wouldn't it be amazing if people didn't say to us? Hey, do you really still want to live in Hong Kong?
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:23.140]   But actually said to us we're moving to Hong Kong
[00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:25.180]   Come on church
[00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:26.340]   Wouldn't that be awesome?
[00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:33.180]   Wouldn't it be so cool if people were so aware that the church is on fire in Hong Kong and that there's something different in
[00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:36.140]   The spirit of our city that people would want to come here
[00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:42.540]   Would want to actually move themselves here anytime I meet a new family at the vine who have just moved to Hong Kong
[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:45.420]   Here's the first thought that goes through my mind every single time
[00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:51.220]   I think isn't Hong Kong so privileged that God would send this family to us
[00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:55.580]   Because there's something in this family that our city obviously needs
[00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:59.860]   Because we are the manifold wisdom of God in the world. And if this family's just moved to Hong Kong. Oh
[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:02.380]   Watch out Hong Kong
[00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:04.780]   Because there's something that's about to happen. Amen
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:13.500]   Notice what he says next this is what the Lord Almighty says in those ten days in those days ten people from all languages and
[00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:20.780]   Nations will take firm hold of one Jew by the hem of his robe and say let us go with you
[00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:25.100]   Because we have heard that God is with you. I love this picture
[00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:29.220]   Zachariah sees this picture of a Jewish person standing in the city of Jerusalem
[00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:35.620]   And in those days they had these beautiful flowing robes and at the end of the rows with the tassels that mark them as a Jewish
[00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:37.020]   believer and
[00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:42.340]   Here's the vision that God has for Jerusalem and he speaks with Zachariah over his people
[00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:43.860]   He says here's what's gonna happen in the future
[00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:50.740]   Ten foreigners are gonna come around you and they're gonna reach out and grab a hold of the hem of your garment
[00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:55.580]   They're literally gonna grab one of the tassels that are hanging off your garment because they're gonna say this
[00:31:55.580 --> 00:32:00.180]   I know that God is with you. I don't have all the answers. I don't have it all figured out
[00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:03.720]   I don't even know if I fully believe in this God, but I can see it in you
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:09.100]   I can see it in the people that gather with you and I want to have something to do with that because I'm desperately in
[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:13.380]   Need I can't find the code, but I will grab a hold of the one who has it
[00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:21.420]   When you grabbed a hem of the robe in those days it meant three things it meant protection
[00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:24.660]   refuge and security I
[00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:29.220]   Wonder if protection refuge and security could be
[00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:32.820]   Vital things for the generation of Hong Kong in this time
[00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:35.500]   The ones who are asking what is our future?
[00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:38.340]   Well, what all these changes really mean?
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:43.220]   The ones who are wondering about the economy and whether now might be the time to go
[00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:47.780]   Could you imagine if the church rised up in this time with a renewed?
[00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:55.380]   Hope and a renewed vision and a sense of joy that is their strength and was confident in saying that God is
[00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:58.940]   Here he has not moved to Singapore. He is right here and
[00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:03.540]   we know it and we see it and we feel it and it's good and
[00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:07.820]   People around us go. I want to hold on to something like that
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:12.180]   I want to grab a hold of something like that. Here's what you need to understand
[00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:17.420]   This is really important. The church is the hem of the robe of Jesus in a city
[00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:19.820]   church
[00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:25.540]   Church is the hem of his robe in a city. It's the thing that people should look to for refuge
[00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:28.140]   for protection
[00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:30.220]   for security inside their soul
[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:34.340]   Where they feel like they've been so torn aside within themselves
[00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:40.420]   The church should be the place where they go. That's a place of refuge for me. That's a place where I can rebuild my life
[00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:46.900]   That's a place where I can find renewed hope. That's the place where when I meet those people they speak confidently boldly
[00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:53.100]   They love the city. They love what's happening in Hong Kong there. They're involved their need deep in it. They're not leaving
[00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:55.380]   They're here to stay. I want to be a part of that
[00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:58.900]   That's the hem of the robe and here's the thing you are the church
[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:03.540]   This is why here at the vine we have a river model vision
[00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:08.860]   Our river model vision is not about trying to get us all in a building all the time and just making this about church
[00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:12.740]   The river model is about you being the church in your sphere of influence
[00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:20.020]   Because follow the analogy that Zechariah is bringing. It's no point being the hem of the robe if nobody can see the robe
[00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:25.580]   There's no point in that if people can't see that robe and grab a hold of it
[00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:28.740]   The picture he's bringing is actually a picture of the marketplace in
[00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:33.100]   Jerusalem and the Jewish people walking through the marketplace and those on the outside
[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:36.860]   Looking at that and going I see that and I want to be a part of that
[00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:37.460]   and
[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:43.380]   so now more than ever the river model is part of who we are at the vine because if God is saying it is through
[00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:47.820]   the church of the manifold wisdom of God might be seen in the world the reality is people are not
[00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:50.700]   Busting the door down to come in and find out what's going on in here
[00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:55.340]   But what they might do is see you in your workplace
[00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:57.660]   See you in your sphere of influence
[00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:02.860]   See you in the place that God has planted you and see you act different you speak different
[00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:08.420]   You have hope where no one else does you have courage when everyone's afraid you see a vision for Hong Kong
[00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:15.700]   When nobody else seems to and they see that in their workplace and they go that's different and I want to know more about that. I
[00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:20.220]   Want to grab a hold of the hem of that robe because that means something
[00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:26.820]   Let me tell you about some of the robes that are flowing here at the vine in our city
[00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:28.820]   I can tell you about a doctor a
[00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:33.380]   Doctor from within our community who's offering surgery pro bono to people who can't afford it
[00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:35.900]   I can tell you about a teacher a
[00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:42.300]   Teacher who's running afternoon classes out of their own for free out of their own time because they want to compete
[00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:46.380]   Against the the tutor schools that charge far too much money
[00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:54.980]   And they want to offer quality education free as a way of standing against some of the profiteering that's happening in that sector. I
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:58.060]   Could tell you about the banker who is
[00:35:58.060 --> 00:36:05.180]   Incredibly brave and trying to stand up against some unethical practices in their business even knowing it might cost
[00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:08.740]   Them their job and there are many others
[00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:16.540]   You are the hem of the robe of Christ in your workplace in your school and your family and wherever it is that you have
[00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:18.340]   a sphere of influence
[00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:20.060]   Be present
[00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:24.900]   Be present in that place because that's where people will go. I want some of that and
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:32.780]   Then they get to experience something like this and and find out what church gatherings are about on Sundays. Yeah, that's all good
[00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:37.060]   That's all important. We continue to do this. We love this, but they're not gonna knock the door down
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:39.780]   But they are gonna see you
[00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:44.620]   Being someone of joy whilst everyone else is still lamenting
[00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:50.180]   We as a church need to stop saying things like man, Hong Kong is just fill in the blank
[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:55.500]   how amazing would it be if the church actually could change the whole conversation of the city and
[00:36:55.500 --> 00:37:01.700]   Rather than joining in to the conversation of despair actually bring a fresh vision of hope
[00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:04.540]   That's what church is about
[00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:07.020]   That's us and if that's the case
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:13.500]   If that's what God wants to do in the city of Hong Kong then how do we as a church become that let me let me
[00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:15.500]   Read this to you
[00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:18.220]   Just that big long quote thing that's there
[00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:24.180]   If God's vision for Hong Kong is to turn lament into joy and bring back to this city
[00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:25.380]   Hope for a good future
[00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:30.380]   Then this is his vision for the vine to be a church present in every sphere of society
[00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:35.780]   Filled with people who know God and want to make him known who are visible hopeful
[00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:38.740]   joyful courageous and loving
[00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:45.220]   That's what I'm about. That's what our leadership here at the vine is about. That's what the vine is actually
[00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:48.700]   ultimately going to always be about
[00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:54.580]   So I stand before you today and I make no excuses to ask you to give towards that vision
[00:37:54.580 --> 00:38:02.180]   Because what I'm really doing is asking you to give an investment into the church that you're planted in on behalf of the city
[00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:04.220]   That you're living in
[00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:08.820]   I'm asking you to give to this glorious bigger vision that I think sits there
[00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:12.580]   That's through the church. The manifold wisdom of God is made known in the world
[00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:18.260]   I'm asking you to support us because church actually matters
[00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:23.620]   It matters more than just doing the things that we do. It actually matters
[00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:27.580]   Significantly spiritually in the culture that it's planted in
[00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:32.140]   Let me just briefly tell you a little bit about that. I want to show you our finances
[00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:36.940]   This is really important just for you to know transparently where we are with our finances
[00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:42.420]   Of the white box is the white line is income. The grayer line is our expenses
[00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:43.900]   This is the last 10 months
[00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:48.780]   What you'll notice is that one two, three, four, five six seven eight of the last ten months
[00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:53.820]   We have been under in terms of our income over expenses in some of the worst months
[00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:58.900]   We've been over a million dollars under where we need to be. The average deficit is about
[00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:02.780]   $2,000 a month over the last 10 months
[00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:05.940]   We've had a full deficit of two million dollars in the last 10 months
[00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:09.900]   And I'm sharing that with you just because we are a family together
[00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:15.260]   And that's the current state of our finances and I want you to know that that's got nothing to do a vision Sunday
[00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:18.100]   this is just what happens every month and
[00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:21.700]   Every month we're not quite making it where we need to be
[00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:28.020]   But today I stand before you because I'm actually calling you to give beyond your tithes and your offerings
[00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:33.700]   To actually stand on this bigger and this larger vision that we have and so at the vine
[00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:39.980]   We're investing in multiple ways to try to address the joy that we want to see come back to our city Oasis
[00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:41.980]   Which is our psychotherapy center here
[00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:45.340]   We're continuing to invest in that so there's good mental health
[00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:47.980]   That's happening through the vine into the city
[00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:54.300]   The majority of clients now at Oasis are actually outside of the vine community them within which we think is a wonderful thing
[00:39:54.900 --> 00:40:01.480]   We're investing in our restoration ministry because we recognize that there's so much inner healing that's needed in our city at this time
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:04.820]   And we're taking materials for one of the global
[00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:10.500]   schools of restoration teaching and we're actually we've paid for and we're currently doing a
[00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:17.740]   Translation into Chinese of all of that material so that we can have something that could really help and impact those within our city
[00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:22.380]   Our K4C and flight ministries, which is our generation ministries
[00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:29.180]   We're trying to double down there as well so that we're really trying to impact and influence the next generation of people
[00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:35.300]   Here in Hong Kong there are many ways our asylum seekers refugees through branches of hope those caught in trafficking
[00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:39.900]   Multiple things that we're doing to say that we're here to stay and that we love this city
[00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:45.540]   God has a heart for this city and we are the manifestation of his love through the church
[00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:47.980]   and so
[00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:51.300]   When we see that together when we hold that together
[00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:56.780]   We actually become the church that he truly is calling us to be my heart for you
[00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:59.280]   Is that you would feel invigorated by that vision?
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:05.020]   So you would feel cool to be a voice of hope in the city that God has planted you in
[00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:10.380]   He loves Hong Kong so much that he called you here. It's time to rise
[00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:12.420]   Amen
[00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:14.820]   All right. Can we stand together? I'd love to pray for you
[00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:18.180]   Father I'm just so grateful
[00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:22.700]   I'm so grateful for each person here in this room and
[00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:26.620]   Lord as we about to move into the most important part of this service
[00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:30.780]   And whether that's for people in this room watching online in our overflow
[00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:34.860]   The most important thing we do now is we stand together as a community
[00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:38.940]   sacrificially on behalf of this big vision that you have for your church
[00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:42.660]   Lord we are here because we love Hong Kong
[00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:48.660]   We have a vision in our hearts for this city and we believe that you are the answer to the locks
[00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:51.260]   That people are desperately trying to open
[00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:54.900]   we believe that you are the hope to a city and
[00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:58.300]   So Lord, we believe that you are at work here
[00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:02.180]   So Lord today we give on behalf of that vision
[00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:06.980]   We give on behalf of the fact that we believe the vine matters
[00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:09.700]   that church in this city
[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:11.260]   matters and
[00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:13.260]   As we do that together
[00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:15.260]   Lord we do it in a place of worship a
[00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:19.020]   place of openness and a place of joy
[00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:23.220]   Lord, I thank you that you're turning our sorrow into joy. I
[00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:27.620]   thank you that you are repairing the broken walls and
[00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:31.540]   You are using the church to be a place of refuge and hope
[00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:36.260]   And Lord, I pray that each person here would feel that they are the hem of the robe of Jesus
[00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:41.540]   Wherever it is that you have planted them and I pray that today they would leave here inspired
[00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:49.780]   To live out that vision more and more in Jesus name we say amen. Let me hand back over to Ellison
[00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:51.780]   He's gonna lead us in this time
