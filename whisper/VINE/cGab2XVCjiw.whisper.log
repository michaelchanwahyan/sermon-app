[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   Amen.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Amen.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   Thank you.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Hello, church.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Hello.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Hello.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.740]   If you're watching online as well, so pleased that you're joining us.
[00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.160]   It's great that every week we have this contingent that join us online.
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.880]   And so I just want to also give a shout out to Michael.
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.540]   Michael is part of our community and he is in hospital at the moment.
[00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:27.080]   And he has been in hospital for a long, long time battling a horrendous disease, but he
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.300]   is battling it and he's not doing it alone.
[00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.120]   We as a community continue to pray for you and Heather and Ben and Nathan.
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.180]   Isn't it beautiful that as a community, we are able to come together in those special
[00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.920]   moments and pray.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.360]   That's what being the body of Christ is all about.
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.280]   And I love the fact that, you know, Ellison takes a massive chance.
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.040]   I mean, really, what if nobody had come forward?
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.580]   That would have been okay as well, right?
[00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.760]   Because sometimes, you know, we're battling things and there's no way we're coming out
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:04.720]   front, but really honor the fact that we are a community that are willing to lean in and
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.720]   pray for each other.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.760]   And you know, we have been looking at the book of James these number of weeks, and really
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.480]   that reminds us once again, that our faith cannot just be something that is in our mind,
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.360]   but it has to be within our action.
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.560]   That is all about the book of James.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.440]   James is very clear about that.
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.480]   We have to have a radical faith.
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.080]   We have to have an obedience to God, and it's a challenge.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.200]   And I think, you know, when I read the book of James, sometimes I'm like, "Oh, he's pretty
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.200]   direct.
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.680]   He's got some hard words to say to us."
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.780]   But you know, he has an expectation.
[00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:53.200]   He expects us, if we are going to choose to follow Jesus, he expects us to live differently.
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.600]   And as he was talking to his readers, you know, he was calling them out in this.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.040]   So we're looking through chapter four today.
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.560]   We're looking through verses one to 10, and we are going to be encouraged to really submit
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.960]   to God in all areas of our lives, but also encouraged to know that, you know, when we
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:23.120]   fall short of that, which we do, that we are reassured that we have incredible grace from
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.120]   God.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.360]   There's this clear instruction from James that you cannot be friends with the world
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:38.080]   and God, but at the same time, there's this beautiful invitation to draw close to God
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.520]   and a promise that he draws close to us.
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.800]   And we'll know what victory means over things in our life that try to draw us away from
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.800]   God.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:57.120]   Now I think we can sometimes read the letter of James and kind of see it as a telling off,
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:04.760]   but rather I hope through these number of weeks, we actually see just how much God truly
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.800]   loves us through the letter of James.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:16.680]   So let's dive in straight, directly, as ever with James chapter four.
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.240]   What causes fights and quarrels among you?
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.000]   Don't they come from the desires that battle within you?
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.960]   You desire, but you do not have, so you kill.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.760]   You covet, but you cannot get what you want, so you quarrel and fight.
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.000]   You do not have because you do not ask God.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.440]   When you ask, you do not receive because you ask with wrong motives that you may spend
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.960]   what you get on your pleasures.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.080]   You adulterous people, don't you know that friendship with the world means enmity against
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.080]   God?
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.080]   Therefore, anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.760]   Or do you think scripture says without reason that he jealously longs for the spirit he
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.400]   has caused to dwell in us?
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.680]   Ooh, James.
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.920]   So let's stop there for a moment to try and understand, okay, what is James saying and
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:07.920]   why?
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:14.920]   Remember, James is talking to the believers, those that have chosen to follow the way,
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.640]   those that have chosen to follow Jesus, and many have been scattered all over Asia Minor
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.640]   and beyond.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:28.240]   So they're not only facing persecution for their new faith, but they were clearly facing
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.680]   some external challenges amongst themselves.
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.800]   There's infighting and disagreements driven by a selfish ambition.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:46.960]   So James was addressing what he saw as an outward expression of inward struggles.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:53.440]   He refers to the battles within, their motives and how they were affecting their relationship
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.200]   with God, but also with each other.
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.920]   And I believe that these outward expressions of an inward struggle are relevant for us
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.560]   today.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:14.800]   Now I imagine that the majority of us in this room are Christians, you chose to follow Jesus,
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.240]   but there will be some that maybe are on a journey of discovery, maybe in this room or
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:25.080]   watching online, where you're asking the question, who is Jesus?
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:32.760]   And I want to encourage you that this inward and outward struggle is relevant to you too.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:38.280]   And I hope that this message will stir something within you as you continue to journey in the
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:44.440]   discovery of knowing who Jesus is.
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:50.200]   So when we make a decision to follow Jesus, we are choosing to say goodbye to the old
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.680]   way of life, embrace a different way of living.
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.960]   But if we're honest, sometimes that's really hard.
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:03.280]   How often do we find ourselves acting out in ways that align more with the world than
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.280]   they do with the values of Jesus?
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:14.000]   And it can sometimes feel like we're being pulled in two different directions.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.480]   That tension James is talking about is related to our relationship with the world and our
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.880]   relationship with God.
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:27.840]   Now when I talk about the world, I'm not talking about the people, I'm talking about the systems,
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.840]   the values, the desires that drive our decisions and our actions.
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:39.920]   And as James mentions later in this chapter, we're also talking about spiritual forces,
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:46.080]   those that are working against us and working against God.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:51.680]   So this idea of being pulled this way and that way is captured really well by the apostle
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.640]   Paul in his letter to the Romans.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:07:00.320]   He says this, "I do not understand what I do, but what I want to do I do not do, but
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.040]   what I hate I do."
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.040]   You know, I love that.
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.600]   Am I the only one that loves that?
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.160]   I mean, I'm so glad that that verse is in the Bible and it was the apostle Paul who
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.960]   said it.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:20.080]   Our natural inclination tends to be towards the things of the world that cause and can
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.320]   lead us into sin.
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:27.640]   And this idea that we cannot be friends with the world and friends with God is captured
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.760]   throughout scripture.
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:40.520]   You see, the world, its systems, the spiritual forces around us are in opposition to God.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.320]   And Jesus himself taught clearly.
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.000]   He said, "No one can serve two masters.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.640]   Either you will hate the one and love the other.
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.200]   You'll be devoted to one and despise the other.
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:57.960]   But you cannot serve both God and mammon, money and materials."
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:03.440]   And then he said, "If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first.
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:07.400]   If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own.
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.360]   As it is, you do not belong to the world.
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:16.880]   But I have chosen you out of the world, and that is why the world hates you."
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.600]   And he prayed, Jesus prayed to his father and he said, "I have given them," followers
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:26.800]   of Jesus at that time, "and for us now, your word.
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:32.560]   And the world has hated them, for they are not of the world any more than I am of the
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:33.560]   world.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:38.240]   My prayer is not that you take them out of the world, but that you protect them from
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.120]   the evil one.
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:45.880]   They are not of the world, even as I am not of it."
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:50.320]   And John says, "Do not love the world or anything in the world.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.720]   If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in them."
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.680]   So I think it's pretty clear, right?
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.480]   The theologian and scholar N.T.
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:06.060]   Wright puts it this way, "Christianity is a way of seeing the world.
[00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:13.880]   It is a way of being in the world and a way of acting in the world grounded in the story
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.320]   of Jesus."
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:21.960]   So as Christians, our way in the world must be different.
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:29.280]   Gossiping about our colleagues over yum cha with friends as believers, we choose not to.
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:35.880]   The last elderly person on the bus with no seat, as believers, we give up our seat for
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.240]   them.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:42.920]   Invited to a boys or girls weekend away where we know there will be strip bars as part of
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:50.960]   the entertainment, as believers, we choose not to go or we choose to go but we hold strong
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:56.480]   boundaries while we are away so we do not join activities that do not honor God and
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:00.600]   do not honor others.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:06.880]   A colleague has a large hospital bill and they're struggling to pay, and you know that
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:13.520]   as believers, we anonymously give generously because we can.
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.680]   Our tax bill is due, yikes.
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:23.520]   As believers, we pay without trying to distort the numbers.
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:31.540]   A colleague is promoted over you, even though you're better qualified, more experienced.
[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:40.340]   As believers, we refuse to allow disappointment to take root, cause bitterness, and instead,
[00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.280]   we congratulate them.
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:49.900]   And I'm sure you can think of multiple other experiences, examples within your own context.
[00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:55.260]   When our faith is deep, grounded in scripture and our relationship with God, we'll find
[00:10:55.260 --> 00:11:04.300]   ourselves naturally wanting to act differently, different to how the world would act.
[00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:08.220]   We don't do this simply because we want to be different, because it's our faith that
[00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:14.140]   grounds us, it's our morals, it's our choices, our actions are different.
[00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:20.340]   They flow because we've surrendered to Jesus and it is the convicting transformative work
[00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:24.500]   of the power of the Holy Spirit in our lives.
[00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:31.540]   When we choose to follow Jesus, we must live differently.
[00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:35.620]   Let me give you an example of when I first got married.
[00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:42.740]   For the first few months of being a newlywed, I was really awful.
[00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:46.340]   Now, you don't believe that, do you?
[00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:47.820]   How could I be awful?
[00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:51.860]   Like, I'm like the nicest person.
[00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.260]   Well, I wasn't.
[00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.140]   I was awful.
[00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:00.060]   I wasn't treating Richard very well at all.
[00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:06.100]   And to be honest, I was really struggling because I was used to being very independent
[00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:11.620]   and suddenly, you know, I had somebody else to think of.
[00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:16.980]   I was working, Richard was about to go back to study, so he had a little bit more time,
[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:23.340]   but I spent most of my time actually hanging out with my work colleagues.
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:27.940]   And to be honest, you wouldn't even really know that I was married.
[00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:35.060]   When I went home, I was moody, bad-tempered, just not nice to be around.
[00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:40.380]   It got to the stage where close friends of ours confronted me on this.
[00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:48.020]   Now, we've been married for 33 years.
[00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:55.340]   But I still remember when I was confronted, when they said to me about my behavior and
[00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:58.140]   how I was treating Richard.
[00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:00.460]   And so I made that decision.
[00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:01.460]   You know what?
[00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:02.460]   That's right.
[00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:10.060]   I chose to then invest more into my relationship with Richard, focusing on my marriage, stop
[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:13.900]   acting as though I was single.
[00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:18.820]   In a similar way, when we choose to make a decision to follow Jesus, we are making a
[00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:23.680]   decision not to follow the old ways of our life.
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.060]   We want to live differently.
[00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:32.620]   It's intentional, but it's about surrendering to God and working on our relationship with
[00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:33.620]   God.
[00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:38.460]   And I'm sure if you were to ask Richard, he would agree, I'm much nicer to live with now.
[00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:39.460]   Is that right?
[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:40.460]   Yes.
[00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:43.700]   Give me the thumbs up.
[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.100]   So why is this so important?
[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.580]   And why is it so hard sometimes?
[00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:53.820]   I think first of all, we've really got to grasp how much God loves us.
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:58.380]   Now we hear this a lot in church, but we really need our revelation of what that actually
[00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:05.940]   means because when we actually grasp how much God's love is unconditional, not dependent
[00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:11.820]   on what you do, but simply because of who God is.
[00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:20.060]   When you appreciate how James uses language associated with marriage to help us see that,
[00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:28.560]   when he calls the people adulterous, he does this to emphasize how God sees his relationship
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.100]   to his people.
[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:32.700]   It's a metaphor we see reflected through scripture.
[00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:36.940]   It's this marital relationship between God and us.
[00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:43.940]   And I think we would agree that for a marriage to work, it must be built on mutual trust,
[00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:49.060]   commitment, loyalty, and love for each other.
[00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:54.460]   If one partner is not able to do that, when there is a lack of trust, one-sided commitment,
[00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:58.940]   disloyalty, the marriage breaks down.
[00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:05.820]   I recently read that the exclusivity of marriage is the essence of marriage.
[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:09.100]   And I think that is so true.
[00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:14.900]   And so God reminds us again and again that he is faithful to us even when we are not
[00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:23.140]   faithful to him, but there is a righteous jealousy over us and he will not accept our
[00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:29.020]   allegiance, our fidelity, our attachment to other things.
[00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:37.900]   Exodus tells us, "You shall worship no other God for the Lord whose name is jealous is
[00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:40.540]   a jealous God."
[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:44.140]   And the Hebrew for jealous is kanah.
[00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:50.820]   And throughout scripture, we see God as kanah for his glory, jealous for his glory, kanah
[00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:53.220]   for his people.
[00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:55.020]   Why?
[00:15:55.020 --> 00:16:02.580]   Because of his absolute holiness and love, absolute, and the expectation of exclusive
[00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:06.380]   worship from his creation.
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.140]   He loves you too much.
[00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:11.940]   He knows what is best for you.
[00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:16.340]   He knows that if we follow the way of the world, as broken as it is, we will never be
[00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:18.220]   truly satisfied.
[00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:21.380]   We will continue to strive endlessly.
[00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:26.460]   We will continue to try to achieve driven by ambition to be successful, to be wealthy,
[00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:34.420]   to be rich, to be happy, maybe even to do some good, but all on our own strengths.
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:39.900]   Just ask anyone who's achieved great wealth or highly successful or achieved most of their
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.620]   goals, have they stopped striving?
[00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:43.820]   Stopped gaining more?
[00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:47.060]   Are they satisfied?
[00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:48.780]   Usually not.
[00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:56.380]   The world will never give us what we think we need because from the very beginning, Genesis
[00:16:56.380 --> 00:17:04.700]   1 and 2, we were created to be in perfect relationship with God, with each other and
[00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:05.860]   creation.
[00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:09.780]   And then we all know what happened in Genesis 3, right?
[00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:16.020]   When sin entered and our world is fractured.
[00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:19.780]   Because of God's love for us, he'll not accept our friendship.
[00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:24.660]   He'll not accept our friendship with the value systems of the world because they're in opposition
[00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:30.060]   to him and they are destructive to us.
[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:33.500]   So we're also facing that spiritual oppression.
[00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:38.660]   We know, again, scripture talks about powers and principalities that are working against
[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:41.740]   God, but they're working against us as well.
[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:48.260]   So don't be surprised when you find yourself being pulled in two different directions.
[00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:56.520]   But we have a way to overcome this internal struggle which changes our external behaviors
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:02.320]   as you choose friendship over God, over friendship with the world.
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:07.260]   The good news and the encouragement to us is that James is very clear on how to do that.
[00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:13.860]   How we can choose God over the world when in surrender, in humility and in trust, when
[00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:20.540]   we come to God, when we recognize and acknowledge who he is and how much we need him.
[00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:24.100]   When we draw close to him, we'll know his presence.
[00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:28.220]   We'll know victory in our life over the enemy.
[00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:32.260]   From verse 6, let's see what James says.
[00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:35.260]   But he gives us more grace.
[00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:39.940]   That is why scripture says God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble.
[00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:44.300]   Submit yourselves then to God, resist the devil and he will flee from you.
[00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:46.540]   Come near to God and he will come near to you.
[00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:49.780]   Wash your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.
[00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:55.820]   Grieve, mourn, and wail, change your laughter to mourning and your joy to gloom.
[00:18:55.820 --> 00:19:01.420]   Humble yourself before the Lord, he will lift you up.
[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:06.980]   It will be impossible to choose God without God's grace in our life and the power of the
[00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:09.320]   Holy Spirit in us.
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:16.820]   But God promises he gives us grace and we'll have his favor when we simply admit we need
[00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:20.500]   him and turn towards him.
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.200]   James makes it very clear.
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:26.180]   We draw near to God and he draws near to us.
[00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:30.780]   But don't think that this means God is like over there in the distance and we've got to
[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:33.260]   do the work to get to him.
[00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:36.580]   God actually has never left us.
[00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:40.380]   He's here right by our side.
[00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.860]   He's been there the whole time.
[00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:49.500]   The Lord is near to all who call on him, to all who call on him in truth.
[00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:53.680]   Never will I leave you, never will I forsake you.
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:20:00.460]   And behold, I am with you always to the end of the age.
[00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:08.380]   So James is emphasizing this posture of humility that we need to have when we realize we have
[00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:10.380]   to draw close to God.
[00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:11.380]   He's there.
[00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:18.420]   And it's interesting because if you contrast this with the Old Testament, think about Moses.
[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:22.180]   When Moses was drawing near to God and God said, "Stop.
[00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:24.240]   Don't come any closer.
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.060]   Take off your sandals.
[00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:28.300]   The ground is holy."
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:34.420]   Not the holy priest, the high priest who was the only one that could go into the holy of
[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:42.540]   holies to speak on behalf of the people when he went to God.
[00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:44.740]   The only one.
[00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:48.220]   And yet we have an intimacy with God now.
[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.300]   Why?
[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.660]   Why is it different?
[00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:53.540]   It's Jesus.
[00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:55.900]   It's the death and resurrection of Jesus.
[00:20:55.900 --> 00:21:03.340]   It's his blood that allows us to be in an intimate relationship with our God, the God
[00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:05.540]   who created heaven and earth.
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:13.060]   Like we heard last week with Andrew, the God who spoke and the world was.
[00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:18.820]   That's the God that calls us into friendship.
[00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:25.420]   So in that intimacy, James tells us and his readers that when we have God's presence,
[00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:35.140]   we also have the power to face every situation and to face those situations where the enemy
[00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:39.660]   is trying to attack us.
[00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:43.060]   Resist the devil and he will flee from you.
[00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:47.580]   Now I know maybe some of us in the room are thinking, "Hmm, how do you resist the devil
[00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:48.580]   and he will flee?
[00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:49.900]   What does that actually look like?
[00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:51.860]   We can't see anything here.
[00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:57.380]   There's no little minions running around that we can slap.
[00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:59.420]   So what does it actually mean?
[00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:06.900]   Let me give you an example of one occasion recently where I resisted the devil and he
[00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:07.900]   fled.
[00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:12.780]   I had to think what the grammar for flew was then.
[00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:16.700]   Flew, flewed, fled.
[00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:22.860]   So I was traveling to work on the bus and I overheard a conversation between two people
[00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:29.300]   and just so that you're aware, I wasn't eavesdropping.
[00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:30.300]   They were talking in English.
[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:34.860]   They were talking quite loud and I just happened to be sat there minding my own business as
[00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:36.940]   I'm traveling to work.
[00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:43.300]   Anyway, they're talking about money and they're discussing it quite openly.
[00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:50.740]   They're talking about how they were set up for retirement, how much money they were making,
[00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:56.660]   how they were able to be really smart because they were using their...the money was making
[00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:59.340]   them money.
[00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:03.380]   And so I'm sat there listening to them talk about this and I'm not kidding you.
[00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:08.140]   I mean, I was just happily sat there going to work, not thinking about anything, but
[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:11.580]   a thought came into my mind.
[00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:18.140]   Out of nowhere said to me, "You do not have enough.
[00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:21.260]   You will never have enough.
[00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:22.980]   You're too late.
[00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:27.380]   You've wasted your life and you've certainly not been smart.
[00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:28.380]   You should have done better."
[00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:31.540]   Now, I'm not kidding you.
[00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:35.380]   Generally, I'm not an anxious person.
[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:42.740]   Only physically, I felt such stress.
[00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:45.020]   My heart was beating faster.
[00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:46.860]   I felt a weight on me.
[00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:49.140]   I felt sad.
[00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:56.380]   I felt so sad as I began to think, "Oh my goodness, I don't have enough.
[00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:58.380]   Hong Kong's an expensive city.
[00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:01.300]   What about my future?"
[00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:09.220]   And then, because I like to take action, I put in my head a plan of action of how I was
[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:11.700]   going to deal with this.
[00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:15.900]   So my action involved, "Okay, I've got to work out how do I make extra money on the
[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:17.420]   side?
[00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:23.580]   How does Richard make extra money on the side?
[00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:29.900]   And what do we need to cut and sort of start saving on in order that we can save a little
[00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:32.340]   bit more for the future?"
[00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:35.980]   So all of this is going on within my head.
[00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:42.300]   I'm just sat on the bus, but it's like this, "Foom."
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:47.580]   And as I was just trying to work all this out in my head, I had another very strong
[00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:48.660]   voice.
[00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:57.140]   It said to me, "The world's economy is not your economy."
[00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:04.900]   And then a little bit more gentler voice, "God's economy is different."
[00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:08.300]   And I knew immediately then that was the Holy Spirit.
[00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:10.180]   But listen, I had a choice.
[00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:18.140]   I could have stayed with my train of thought that was spiraling into fear, anxiety, and
[00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:23.420]   planning action, which I don't think Richard would have been very happy about.
[00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:26.980]   Or I could have decided, "You know what?
[00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:28.900]   I am not going to accept this.
[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:30.940]   Where did this even come from?
[00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:34.180]   I was just happy on the bus going to work."
[00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:37.080]   So I decided that I refused to accept those words.
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:42.080]   I told myself there and then, "I do have enough.
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:46.900]   God has always been faithful and he always will be faithful."
[00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:52.060]   And immediately, I'm not kidding you, I didn't feel sad.
[00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:59.660]   I felt physically so much better and just the heaviness just lifted and I just felt,
[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:03.580]   "Oh, okay, let's carry on the bus ride then."
[00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:05.620]   But this is an example of what it means.
[00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:09.860]   You know, the enemy, he thinks he's so smart.
[00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:13.820]   He just throws all these little lies at you.
[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:19.140]   The problem is sometimes we don't resist them and so they stay.
[00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:28.340]   We begin to see or act when those are just lies of the enemy.
[00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:35.420]   We have to be able to resist the devil because it says he will flee, not he may be, could,
[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:36.420]   depends on his day.
[00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:40.620]   No, he will flee.
[00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:48.180]   To live genuinely as believers of Jesus, we recognize there is a choice to make in who
[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:51.740]   and what we are aligned to, the world or God.
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:52.740]   Cannot be both.
[00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:58.940]   The inward struggles and the external behaviors we have to overcome, we can if we choose friendship
[00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:01.180]   with God.
[00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:06.780]   We draw close to him and that is key to the victory in living in a world where there's
[00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:13.140]   a lot of tension, in a world where we're being pulled away.
[00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:15.260]   But it's proactive to draw close.
[00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:17.260]   It's not a one-off thing.
[00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:23.900]   It's an intentional, habitual, drawing close day after day after day for the rest of our
[00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:26.700]   lives while we're here on earth.
[00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:34.420]   So in the context of Hong Kong and our very busy lives here, what are some of the ways
[00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:37.100]   that we can draw close to God?
[00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:39.840]   Well I can tell you what it's not.
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.420]   It's not spiritual activity.
[00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:43.660]   Can I hear an amen?
[00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:48.940]   Does anybody want spiritual activity for the sake of spiritual activity?
[00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:50.380]   No.
[00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:53.480]   It is not your daily Bible reading.
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:56.420]   It is not in the activity of going to church.
[00:27:56.420 --> 00:28:04.940]   It is not bringing God a list of prayer requests or even listening to beautiful worship music.
[00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:07.580]   Now don't get me wrong.
[00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:14.420]   These are all good disciplines and we should do them, but they are a means to enter into
[00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:16.540]   his presence.
[00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:23.860]   They are a means in order to commune with God, to have a friendship with them.
[00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:27.580]   So of course we do all of these things.
[00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:34.420]   Absolutely read your Bible, come to church, worship, but ask yourself this, did I meet
[00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:36.300]   with God?
[00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:41.020]   When you leave the service, did you really meet with God when you were here?
[00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:43.420]   Did you commune with God?
[00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:45.220]   Is God a friendship?
[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:46.700]   Is there a friendship there?
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:48.500]   Because that's what God wants.
[00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:52.100]   It's not tasks ticked off a list.
[00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:56.020]   True friendship is about a true relationship with each other.
[00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:58.140]   It's the same with God.
[00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:02.540]   I think in this service especially, some of you really struggle with this idea of friendship
[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:03.540]   with God.
[00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:05.540]   That is so alien to you.
[00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:10.900]   You can't understand how do you have a friendship with God?
[00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:16.660]   Well I really encourage you to pursue this because it will change how you view God when
[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:23.660]   you realize his pursuit of you is to be in friendship.
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:29.740]   It can seem challenging at times to have a conversation with God rather than just bring
[00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:31.680]   him your prayer list.
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:36.260]   But it's being intentional about creating that intimacy with him.
[00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:41.640]   So as I close I want to bring a take home application.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:48.140]   One practical way that I personally have found helps me draw closer to God.
[00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:52.460]   And it's through the idea of contemplative prayer.
[00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:57.160]   Now this sounds really simple, but it's very difficult.
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:02.420]   But if you can commit to some regular rhythm in your life, in your relationship with God,
[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:07.420]   it will deepen your friendship and intimacy.
[00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:13.780]   And contemplative prayer is about being silently focused on God.
[00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:18.620]   It's letting go of every thought and other distraction that is around you.
[00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:22.740]   And let me tell you that is so difficult.
[00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:26.580]   And I challenge you to try this because it is not easy.
[00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:30.980]   And the fact that it's not easy should surprise us.
[00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:36.700]   Because in this, my version of a practice of the 14th century from the book of Privy
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:41.600]   Counseling, they say you should set aside a certain amount of time.
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:44.380]   Now I would say first of all you've got to get a timer.
[00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:48.460]   Because if you don't use a timer, after three minutes you're going to be like, "Okay, what's
[00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:49.460]   time then?
[00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:50.460]   Did we, did I?"
[00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:55.760]   So set a timer first of all for 20 to 30 minutes.
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:31:01.220]   Find a quiet space without distraction or disturbance.
[00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:07.740]   Then believe and accept God's gracious love towards you.
[00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:14.580]   Imagine for a moment you're resting on him as a sick child would rest on a comforting
[00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:18.100]   parent or guardian.
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:22.900]   Next don't allow yourself to analyze yourself or God.
[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:29.340]   This is hugely important because we know our minds play tricks on us or try to distract
[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:36.420]   us or tell us what we haven't done, how unworthy we are, and questions whether or not God really,
[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:37.420]   really does love.
[00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:38.420]   All of this goes in our mind.
[00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:40.260]   You've got to push it away.
[00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:43.340]   Push it away so there are no distractions whatsoever.
[00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:47.180]   You push it away and you'll be encouraged by the simple truth.
[00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:55.860]   You are known, you are loved, and you are accepted just as you are in that present moment.
[00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:59.860]   And if it helps, you repeat, "I am loved.
[00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:01.340]   I am loved.
[00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:03.340]   I am loved."
[00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:06.580]   You see, many of us don't really believe that.
[00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:09.540]   We say it, but we can't sit in it.
[00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:16.900]   If you could sit 20 or 30 minutes and you are telling yourself how much you are loved
[00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:24.260]   in the presence of God, that will do huge wonders for your confidence, that's for sure.
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:30.340]   But to be able to do that isn't easy because we're so busy-minded.
[00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:36.380]   But the most important thing is once that timer goes off, you've had that meditative
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:45.100]   time with God, intimacy with Him, and it's only 20 minutes of your time.
[00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:47.180]   It is life-giving.
[00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:51.580]   I found it hugely freeing for me because it gave me permission not to think about, "Oh,
[00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:53.740]   I must do this, I must do that.
[00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:56.980]   Well, I better ask for this and I better talk about this with God."
[00:32:56.980 --> 00:33:00.020]   Instead, there was nothing.
[00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:02.800]   It was just me and God.
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:08.020]   If you're a parent, you know what it's like when a child climbs up onto your lap and they
[00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:09.940]   just sit there.
[00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:14.580]   They're not talking, wriggling, whining, anything.
[00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:20.060]   They're just there in your presence and it's a beautiful thing.
[00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:26.940]   And that's how God is and wants us to be with Him.
[00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:35.460]   So as you leave today, I challenge you all to ask this question daily, "Am I choosing
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:39.500]   friendship with God or the world?"
[00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:46.260]   And then create within your routine those regular rhythms where you're choosing to seek
[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:51.780]   God because you are close to Him, because you have a friendship with Him.
[00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:59.980]   And victory comes over those internal struggles and then those behaviors when we submit and
[00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:04.260]   draw close and He's with us.
[00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:07.200]   I would love to be able to pray for us now.
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:10.820]   So if you would be able to stand.
[00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:19.100]   When I was preparing this message, one of the pictures that I got was that we were here
[00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:22.940]   and many of us had scales on our eyes.
[00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:26.260]   The scales were on our eyes because for a number of different reasons.
[00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:32.500]   One is for some of us, we don't really know what it is that we are doing that is in the
[00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:33.500]   world.
[00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:37.980]   We've been doing things that are choosing friendship with the world more than friendship
[00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:42.900]   with God for so long, we don't even know what that is.
[00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:48.900]   And the picture that I got was of scales falling off.
[00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:51.580]   We need to be a community of believers.
[00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:57.980]   We need to be a body of Christ that chooses friendship with God, not friendship with the
[00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:00.340]   world.
[00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:05.300]   We need help to see where we've chosen the world.
[00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:12.420]   And so maybe that's you and while we sing in a response song, I believe the scales will
[00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:15.100]   come off and God will show you.
[00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:19.300]   He will draw you into a place of seeing where you need to let go of the things of the world
[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:26.460]   that are holding you, that are causing behaviors that you know are not good for you, not good
[00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:28.820]   for your families.
[00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:34.580]   And then the other side was this sense that the enemy, he does not want you to even think
[00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:42.820]   that he does send words and ideas in your head that would cause you to feel anything
[00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:46.080]   but not good about yourself.
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:48.580]   He doesn't want you to believe that he does that.
[00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:55.340]   And I believe that the scales need to come off here, that we would spiritually, supernaturally
[00:35:55.340 --> 00:36:01.580]   be able to discern when the enemy is attacking because it's very clear in scripture.
[00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:08.620]   We have the power as believers of Jesus, the spirit is within us to resist the enemy and
[00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:10.580]   he will flee.
[00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:14.720]   And too many of us, we're not resisting.
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:24.540]   So as we pray and as we worship, may our eyes be open to truly see so that we can enter
[00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:33.460]   into this world, not in the world, not of the world, but because we know that God is
[00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:36.460]   with us.
[00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:41.020]   So let me pray.
[00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:46.420]   Father, I thank you.
[00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:51.020]   I thank you for everyone here today and everyone watching online.
[00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:54.220]   Lord, we need help.
[00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:59.060]   We thank you that you've given us help by your spirit.
[00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:02.140]   Help us to choose friends with you over friends of the world.
[00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:08.060]   And I pray for those that are struggling in this area, would their eyes be open to see
[00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:10.460]   right now.
[00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:19.040]   I pray, Father God, may our posture as believers be one of humility and repentance as we recognize
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:22.260]   we need you in our lives.
[00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:24.220]   We can't do it on our own.
[00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:26.820]   We are not self-sufficient.
[00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:29.060]   We can't be.
[00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:35.320]   And I pray, Father, that we would be reminded that the enemy has no power over us.
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:39.420]   We resist and he will flee because we belong to you.
[00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:44.420]   And I pray for those in this room that have scales over their eyes and have believed the
[00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:50.780]   lies of the enemy for so long, the narrative over them is distorted.
[00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:57.780]   I pray, Father God, you remove those scales so they can truly see how much they are known,
[00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:03.700]   they are seen, they are loved, and they are accepted.
[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:10.100]   And Father, we pray this, that may we be truly lifted up in your love.
[00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:12.500]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:22.500]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
