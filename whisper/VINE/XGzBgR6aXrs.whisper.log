[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600]   would be a significant shifting moment for many of us.
[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.480]   And we thank you for this in Jesus' name.
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.800]   Everyone says, amen.
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.040]   Amen.
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.440]   So early in December, Andrew asked me,
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.880]   are you free to preach on the 29th of December?
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.680]   And I was like, sure.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.720]   And then he said, and you can preach on whatever you want.
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.920]   I was like, yes.
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.120]   I can preach about this.
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.960]   I can preach about that.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.520]   And then I thought, well, maybe I
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.480]   should actually pray and ask God,
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.800]   is there anything specific you would
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:40.720]   like me to bring on the last Sunday of 2024?
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.920]   And so as I began praying for our time together
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.920]   and for what to share, I sensed that God impressed upon me
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.320]   three words, three words that I believe
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.760]   are important to us as a church and also for us individually.
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.160]   So if you're visiting here and you're passing through Hong
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.360]   Kong or for whatever reason you find yourself right now
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.680]   in the vine at this service or if you're watching online,
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.800]   then this message is also for you.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.440]   We don't believe in coincidences.
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.320]   And again, as I sensed around how to bring this message,
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.680]   I felt that it was important that it was something
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.680]   that we leaned into that would encourage us.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.160]   And that words, these three words
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.480]   God was asking of all of us.
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.920]   So those three words are don't hold back.
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.960]   As I was chatting with a friend a while ago,
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.520]   they were struggling with something.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.800]   And I asked them, well, have you asked God about this?
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.520]   Their response was no, which kind of surprised me.
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.880]   But as we were talking more, it was clear
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.040]   that there was already an assumption about how
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.280]   God would respond.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.080]   So they didn't ask.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.240]   Does anybody relate?
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.840]   Recently, I was talking to a colleague,
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.000]   and she mentioned casually how sometimes it's actually
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.640]   hard to talk to God about areas of your life
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.800]   because you're not quite sure what he's going to say.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.560]   And again, I was surprised.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.520]   But then I thought, actually, there's
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.760]   probably areas in my life, too, that I may not always
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.120]   bring to God and how easy it is to hold back.
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.520]   So when these three words came through strongly
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.480]   about to share with you today, I felt
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.440]   that this was something that God was saying very specifically
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.800]   to us today about how we are to enter 2025
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.000]   and that we are to enter 2025 without holding back.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.240]   Don't hold back is what God would say to us this morning.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.480]   So we'll be looking at two examples in scriptures
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.320]   of not holding back.
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.120]   And through incredible acts of courage and conviction,
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.720]   we see that God moves in surprising ways that
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.280]   dramatically change trajectory of lives
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.720]   and serve as important examples to us today.
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.320]   And my prayer really is, as we open scripture
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.680]   and as we allow the Holy Spirit to speak to us,
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.280]   is that we would learn we cannot assume to know
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.480]   what God thinks on all things because that often
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.840]   causes us to hold back.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.840]   When we choose to hold back, we miss out.
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.480]   If we choose not to hold back, we
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.160]   will experience a depth in our relationship with God
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.760]   as well as freedom.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.680]   And that is what God desires for us as we enter 2025.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.480]   So our first story is found in the Old Testament,
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.160]   is in the Book of Numbers.
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.920]   It's one of my favorite stories.
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.800]   It's the story of five sisters who,
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.320]   with great courage and humility, choose not to hold back,
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.400]   even when holding back would appear
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.840]   to be the right thing to do.
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.280]   So we pick up the story from chapter 27.
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.480]   And the context is Moses is distributing land
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.600]   to the families of the Israelites
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.800]   for when they enter the promised land, land which,
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.080]   according to the law, would pass from father
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.080]   to son for generations to come.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.400]   The daughters of Zelophehad, son of Hepha, the son of Gilead,
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.680]   the son of Mecca, the son of Manasseh,
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.960]   belong to the clans of Manasseh son of Joseph.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.080]   The names of the daughters were Marla, Noah, Hogla, Milcah,
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.720]   and Tirzah.
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.040]   They came forward and stood before Moses, Elizar
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.200]   the priest, the leaders, and the whole assembly
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.040]   at the entrance to the tent of meeting and said,
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.280]   our father died in the wilderness.
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.440]   He was not among Korah's followers who banded together
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.640]   against the Lord, but he died for his own sin
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.000]   and left no sons.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.560]   Why should our father's name disappear from his clan?
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.560]   Because he had no son.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.120]   Give us property among our father's relatives.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.080]   So Moses brought their case before the Lord.
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.600]   The Lord said to him, what Zelophehad's daughters are
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.440]   saying is right.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.440]   You must certainly give them property
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.640]   as an inheritance among their father's relatives
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:47.000]   and give their father's inheritance to them.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.240]   What's interesting about their story
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.340]   is that it holds a prominent place in scripture.
[00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.120]   It's mentioned five times throughout the book of Numbers,
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.600]   Joshua, and 1 Chronicles.
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.400]   So we have to see this as an important incident
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.040]   that the biblical authors want us to take note of.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.720]   See as well, the daughters are all named.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.040]   Again, highly unusual, amplifying this story
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.600]   and the women as important and their actions
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.400]   not to be ignored.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.600]   The daughters of Zelophehad challenged property laws
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.280]   in ancient Israel, which said that only sons could
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.120]   inherit land.
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.400]   They chose to approach Moses, Eleazar the priest,
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.480]   and the leaders of the whole assembly.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.280]   Now that is a lot of people right there,
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.600]   and people of power and influence.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:52.200]   And so no doubt quite intimidating to the sisters.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:57.480]   But they do so out of a concern for their families
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.600]   and for the name of their father.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.520]   Why should our father's name disappear from his clan?
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.320]   Because he had no son.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:11.520]   So they made this request despite the risk.
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:18.720]   Possibly being ostracized from within their own extended
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.520]   family.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.320]   Imagine what their uncles would be
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.880]   thinking who were due to inherit the land
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.880]   and with that a lot of money.
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.040]   It would have put the sisters potentially
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.400]   a very vulnerable position because they
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.680]   would have controlled what to do with the land.
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.000]   They could have asked the sisters to work the land
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:39.680]   as slaves.
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.680]   They could have asked them to leave the land.
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.800]   And possibly within their own broader community,
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.920]   they would face ridicule and even rebuke
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.400]   from their spiritual leaders.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:59.120]   Because after all, this was Torah law.
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:05.440]   So why did they take the risk and not hold back?
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.760]   I believe the sisters understood something
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.440]   about what it means to walk in faith
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:15.800]   with the promises of God, the promises of Yahweh.
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.920]   They knew they were entering the promised land,
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:23.320]   and with it the promise of God's provision for their future.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.160]   The law, however, would leave them
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:31.840]   not only in a vulnerable position, but without land.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.720]   Their father's name would be no more.
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.520]   Zelophehad and his family would be forgotten
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.880]   and would not inherit the promised land,
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:48.080]   not inherit promises of God through no fault of their own.
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:52.440]   And that stirs them to speak out.
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.880]   I wonder at their courage.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.000]   But I'm also inspired.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.560]   I'm inspired because of how much they trusted God would act
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:10.280]   justly and ultimately fulfill his promises to provide.
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:14.440]   So let's pause for a moment and ask ourselves, honestly,
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:19.400]   how much do we really trust God?
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.360]   Where is our faith in God's promises?
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:26.400]   Or as Andrew reminded us during the Advent season,
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:30.120]   our wholehearted trust?
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.880]   Do we trust God enough to speak up
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.440]   about the things that unsettle us,
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:40.160]   enough to bring our big questions or our fears,
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.200]   our frustrations and disappointments to God?
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:49.040]   Do we trust him enough not to hold back?
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.000]   As the sisters go to Moses, we see
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.760]   Moses respond in a way that should be a lesson for us all,
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.480]   especially for those of us who are in this room now
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.120]   watching online where you are holding
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:05.120]   any position of authority or influence
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.200]   or have power over another.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.680]   Remember, Moses was a spiritual leader of the people,
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.360]   revered and respected.
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.960]   And he knew the law.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.720]   He wrote the law inspired by God.
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:25.640]   And yet he chose to go to God first with this request.
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.160]   Why?
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.320]   He could have just said, "No, it's the law.
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.600]   The law is the law."
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.600]   I believe this tells us something very special
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.240]   about the relationship that Moses had with God.
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.040]   He knew God more than anyone else.
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:46.200]   Moses earned the title, "Friend of God."
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.200]   Exodus 33 tells us, "The Lord would speak to Moses
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:55.200]   face to face as one speaks to a friend."
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.840]   I can therefore imagine there was a deep conviction
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.960]   within Moses about the sisters' request
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:06.200]   because he knew God, Yahweh, God of justice,
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:10.480]   always on the side of the poor and the vulnerable.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.760]   And that stirred Moses in his own humility
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:20.680]   to bring their case to God, even though he had the law.
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:27.880]   May we always be willing to go to God first whenever
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:31.120]   we are unsure of something and not just assume
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:35.160]   that we know it all or that we have it right
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:39.720]   or even assume that somebody else does.
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:45.160]   May we not be afraid to question when something feels unjust.
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:49.440]   Remember the gaps Andrew spoke about at the start of Advent,
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.240]   the gaps that the Apostle Paul wrote about in his letter
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:57.880]   to the Corinthians, "I know in part."
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.760]   Even the learned Apostle Paul, he did not claim
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:05.920]   to know everything, and nor should we.
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.840]   I also believe this passage teaches us something
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:15.200]   hugely profound about God and our relationship with him.
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.800]   The laws of the Torah were given by God,
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:22.680]   but I don't believe for a moment that God accidentally
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:26.240]   got this law wrong, mistake.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:29.280]   Oops, didn't think about that.
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.320]   No.
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:35.480]   But rather, God knew the laws could not possibly
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:42.080]   cover every situation and every evolving circumstances,
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:47.320]   but he wanted his people to be responsible to seek wisdom
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:51.160]   from the principles within God's law.
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.960]   He didn't want them just to follow a law for the sake of it
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:01.840]   without fully understanding God's heart behind the law,
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:05.560]   not to hold back from being willing to approach God
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:09.080]   for guidance and wisdom.
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.960]   Now, don't mishear me.
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.440]   God is the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:19.240]   But rather, we understand God's heart and his character
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:22.440]   when we are facing those challenging situations
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.880]   that we wrestle with.
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:31.160]   Why do you think Jesus got so angry with the Pharisees?
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:35.080]   Because of the way that they practiced the law
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:39.640]   and missed completely the heart of God.
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:43.760]   Ultimately, in this account, we see the faith and the courage
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:47.040]   of five sisters not to hold back,
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:50.880]   and that brought the fulfillment of God's promises
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:54.440]   and the literal promised land.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.960]   So we cannot assume to know everything God is saying
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:01.720]   or doing with our own limited knowledge.
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:06.320]   Who God is and what he is doing is so much more
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.840]   than we can possibly fully comprehend.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:15.240]   We cannot put God in our neat little boxes that suit us.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:19.840]   But rather, we work in our relationship
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:23.560]   so that we can work with knowing God more,
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.840]   and then we can fully comprehend what
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:31.480]   it means to not hold back because we trust him,
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:36.080]   because we call him friend.
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.400]   We are far less likely to make decisions
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:44.120]   based on what we think we know when we are willing to seek God
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:45.640]   in prayer first.
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:51.320]   Our second example of not holding back
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:54.040]   is found in the Gospel of Mark, and is
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.840]   a retelling of Jesus encountering
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.840]   a woman who's been sick for many years
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.440]   whilst on the way to heal a child.
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:04.280]   We pick up the story in Mark.
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:07.000]   "A large crowd followed and pressed around him,
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.760]   and a woman was there who'd been subject to bleeding for 12
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:10.800]   years.
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.880]   She'd suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:16.400]   and had spent all she had.
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.400]   Yet instead of getting better, she grew worse.
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.400]   When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:25.200]   and touched his cloak, because she thought,
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:29.040]   if I just touch his clothes, I will be healed.
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:31.360]   Immediately, her bleeding stopped,
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.920]   and she felt in her body that she
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.560]   was freed from her suffering.
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:39.200]   At once, Jesus realized that power had gone out from him.
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.480]   He turned around in the crowd and asked,
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.880]   who touched my clothes?
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.680]   'You see the people crowding against you?'
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:46.960]   his disciples answered.
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.000]   'And yet you can ask who touched me?'
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.560]   But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it.
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.600]   Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her,
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:59.200]   came and fell at his feet, and trembling with fear,
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.560]   told him the whole truth.
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:06.040]   And he said to her, 'Daughter, your faith has healed you.
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.360]   Go in peace.
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:10.800]   Be free from your suffering.'"
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.240]   I love that Jesus makes a point of stopping and acknowledging
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.920]   this suffering woman after he had healed her,
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:24.080]   and that the writer captures the raw details of her suffering.
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:28.520]   Imagine her life before her encounter with Jesus.
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:32.120]   We don't know a lot about her, but we
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.200]   do know she'd suffered physically, economically,
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.800]   and socially.
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.920]   Mark Haidt likes this when he says,
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.840]   "She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:45.360]   and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better,
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.320]   she grew worse."
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.880]   According to Jewish law, she would
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:53.360]   have been considered ceremoniously unclean,
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.560]   which meant for 12 years she would
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:02.240]   have been enforced in social and religious isolation.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:08.080]   Imagine her life if she hadn't held back and not touched,
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:09.720]   Jesus wrote.
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:14.720]   The ongoing suffering, the ongoing hopelessness.
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:19.880]   Then imagine her life after her encounter with Jesus,
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:23.400]   after she did not hold back.
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.320]   Now, you could say, well, she had nothing
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.720]   to lose by reaching out to Jesus,
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.320]   but actually that's not true.
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:33.760]   She carried a lot of shame in her condition.
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:37.520]   She experienced so far disappointment
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.800]   after disappointment after disappointment.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.720]   She would have been setting herself up
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:47.560]   for disappointment again if she was not healed.
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.720]   Plus the public humiliation.
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.920]   She wasn't even allowed to touch another person,
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:58.200]   otherwise they would be considered ritually unclean.
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:02.480]   So the crowd could have turned against her.
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.160]   But she took the risk.
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:08.520]   With faith and courage, she didn't hold back.
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:12.120]   Rather, she literally reached out and touched Jesus
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.800]   and was healed.
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.840]   And I wonder if maybe there are some of us
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:21.840]   today that hold back, because we too believe
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.520]   we have something to lose.
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:28.320]   Maybe you've prayed and prayed and yet to receive an answer
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:32.760]   or to see change, maybe you have experienced rejection,
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:36.640]   humiliation, and you're afraid to talk about it.
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:42.200]   Let alone come to God and ask in prayer.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:47.440]   The woman teaches us that even in our darkest places of shame,
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:53.160]   fear, disappointment, by taking the courage to reach out,
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:58.520]   she was met with love, compassion, and restoration.
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.600]   And we can too.
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:07.400]   Imagine your life if you choose not to hold back.
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:10.000]   So why do we hold back?
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.360]   What are some of the obstacles that we face
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:17.640]   that keep us from truly surrendering to God?
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:23.040]   Shame, societal pressure, faulty beliefs about who God is,
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:26.000]   complacency, fear, to name a few.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.920]   And I'm sure that there are many other reasons
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:34.000]   that you would have for holding back.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.840]   I also know that sometimes our prayers are not answered
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.960]   in the way we had hoped.
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:42.200]   And for some of us, the very real sense of disappointment
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:47.640]   holds us back from being truly honest with God.
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:50.640]   We might think we're being honest,
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:54.920]   but truly being honest with Him.
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.920]   You see, the reality is our world is broken.
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:03.440]   And there is pain and suffering all around us and in our lives.
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.400]   But in the midst of this,
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:09.480]   we have to be able to go to God with our pain
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:14.600]   and trust that we can be completely honest with Him.
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:19.040]   Think of Job, the suffering he went through,
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:22.240]   the death of loved ones, financial ruin,
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:25.320]   betrayal, physical sickness.
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:27.960]   And through it all, he did not hold back his feelings
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.960]   and his sufferings from God.
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:33.000]   He asked a lot of questions.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.840]   But in the end, whilst in the suffering
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:41.240]   and when there was no change in his circumstances,
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.240]   there was a shift in his relationship
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.160]   and understanding of God.
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.600]   Now, we often look at the story of Job
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:51.040]   and we immediately know how it ends.
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:56.400]   But don't forget that right in the midst of his understanding
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:59.160]   of who God truly is,
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:02.480]   he was in the midst of his suffering.
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:06.720]   And I don't think for a moment it was easy for Job
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.040]   to forget all of the suffering,
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:11.400]   to forget the loss of his wife,
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.040]   to forget the loss of his children
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:17.480]   and all the pain that he had gone through.
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:23.800]   So in this place, he comes to be able to say,
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:30.320]   "My ears had heard of you, but now my eyes have seen you,"
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:37.440]   as he experienced true realization of who God was.
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:41.800]   When we don't hold back, even in our pain
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.320]   and with our unanswered questions,
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:47.840]   even in the midst of our suffering,
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:52.760]   there is a deep sense of peace and comfort in who God is
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:56.080]   that builds our faith, that builds our trust
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.320]   and brings us peace.
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:03.000]   And as we remain in this place of being in the now,
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.080]   but not yet, as we are in the present,
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:10.720]   as we are waiting in the hope we have
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:14.760]   of the life we will have when Jesus returns,
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:20.880]   in that place, we don't want to hold back.
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.200]   So as I was praying about, "Well, how do we respond to that?
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:27.240]   How does a room full of people, those watching online,
[00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.120]   how do you respond to a message?
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.080]   You know, what do you do with that?
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:34.800]   And God, what are you saying to us?"
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.040]   And God gave me a picture.
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.560]   And God sometimes speaks to me in pictures.
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:41.960]   He speaks in many different ways, through Scripture
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.120]   and through various different ways.
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:47.080]   And one of them for me is through pictures.
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:50.360]   So he gave me a picture that I would like to share with you.
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:53.360]   And of course, we always test, you know, what is being said
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:58.200]   and, you know, how this resonates with you.
[00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.840]   I leave with the Holy Spirit.
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:05.160]   And so the picture that I got was that this whole auditorium,
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:08.560]   as we are full now, everybody here,
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:11.600]   there were barriers in front of you.
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:15.160]   Do you remember during COVID, you would go into the restaurant
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.600]   and there were the plastic barriers?
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.720]   You know, you would sit and, you know,
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:22.080]   the person in front of you that you were having lunch
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:25.040]   or dinner or breakfast with, there's a barrier
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.360]   and then there's you. It's transparent,
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.080]   but there was still something between you.
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.520]   Do we remember that?
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.600]   Or have we chosen to put that away
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.600]   and never think about it again?
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:37.320]   Well, the picture I had was that this room was full
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.920]   of people with barriers, these transparent barriers.
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:44.920]   And these transparent barriers were between them and God.
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:47.360]   Now they thought they knew God.
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:51.960]   They thought that they had a relationship and they do,
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:54.040]   but there is a barrier.
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:58.040]   And what God was saying, to remove the barrier
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:01.640]   so that you do not hold back.
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:04.240]   There is nothing between you and God.
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:07.080]   Some of us feel that there are things
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:10.600]   that we cannot talk about or say to God.
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:12.440]   That's not true.
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:16.000]   And I felt that God really wanted to impress upon us
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.400]   as we enter into a new year in 2025.
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.560]   And if you're part of the Vine,
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.600]   as we enter into this new season of,
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:26.080]   what does it mean to go and take action for God?
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:30.400]   We have to have the relationship with God
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:34.320]   where there are no barriers and that we can go to Him
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.640]   with everything that we have.
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:41.000]   And so as I thought about some different areas
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.960]   that I believe in this room, those watching,
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:50.000]   are struggling with that are real barriers for you.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.360]   And so I wanna mention a few of them
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.720]   and maybe that's something that resonates with you.
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:58.920]   But I would say, as I was praying earlier,
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:02.280]   thinking about how do I lead this response?
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.120]   What does it look like?
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.480]   I haven't scripted this.
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.480]   So how do I lead this?
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:09.120]   I felt that God was saying, do you know what?
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:10.640]   Don't hold back as a message
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.900]   for every single one of you in this room.
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:15.600]   Every single one of you.
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:19.840]   And so we all can respond.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.080]   But I also felt that God wanted to share
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.480]   a couple of specific things.
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:26.800]   And the reason why He wants to do that
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:31.800]   is to show you specifically, individually,
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:37.240]   how real God is and how much He knows your situation.
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:41.800]   Because it's pretty general, right?
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.000]   Don't hold back.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:49.880]   So as I share these different specific areas,
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:53.560]   then if that relates to you,
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:55.760]   then we're gonna be praying for you.
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:57.260]   We'd love to pray for you.
[00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:00.120]   And again, I believe that the Holy Spirit
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:01.720]   in the picture that I saw,
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:04.440]   He was actually just removing all the barriers.
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:07.000]   It wasn't difficult to remove those barriers.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.960]   You know, you just unplugged it
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.840]   and it was out the restaurant.
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:12.720]   You know, for God, this is not,
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:17.000]   He removes barriers by the power of His Holy Spirit.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.640]   And that is what He wants to do.
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:24.640]   So we enter 2025 with nothing in the way
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.360]   of our relationship with God.
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:30.920]   So a couple of things I just wanna call out.
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:33.880]   (pages rustling)
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:40.520]   So in the room, there are those that are struggling
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:42.840]   in a specific relationship.
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:46.200]   You're in a relationship and you have not talked
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.140]   to God about it at all.
[00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:51.360]   Because you're afraid of what God will say.
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.080]   It's almost like you have this assumption
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.600]   that He's not gonna be happy about it.
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:57.020]   And so therefore, you're not talking to Him about it,
[00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:59.400]   where actually, more than anything,
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:02.160]   He wants to talk to you about it.
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.960]   He wants you to know what it is
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:07.720]   to be in relationship with Him.
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:10.120]   And to do that, not to be afraid,
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:14.160]   not to hold the guilt by withholding this.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:18.440]   So I encourage you, don't hold back, talk to God.
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:23.640]   In this room as well,
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:26.400]   (pages rustling)
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:32.400]   there is a struggle with identity.
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:38.400]   You don't wanna talk to God about who you are,
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.320]   an identity that you're holding onto,
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:44.320]   because you're so afraid of the judgment.
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:45.700]   You're so afraid of it.
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:51.440]   I can feel that judgment sitting on you.
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.000]   You feel you can't talk about this
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   because it's something that you've hidden for so long.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.440]   And yet God would say to you, "I see you.
[00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:04.680]   "Talk to me, don't hold back."
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:09.440]   Often our identities are wrapped in what other people think.
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.840]   But actually, God is saying,
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:16.840]   "The number one person that you should think about
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:21.640]   "how they think about you is God," person and divine.
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:22.920]   Divine.
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:25.520]   So don't hold back.
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:28.440]   I sensed also that in the room,
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:33.440]   there was pressure from lots of different,
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:38.160]   probably family, I would say, but also maybe friends.
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.640]   Pressure that is building up pressure within you,
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:44.200]   and you're feeling also pressure about being a Christian.
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:47.680]   You're feeling the pressure of how you need to perform
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:50.940]   for your family, for other people, and for God.
[00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:52.580]   And God would say to you,
[00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:57.580]   "I do not expect you to perform in any way.
[00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:02.820]   "I just want you to have the relationship with me.
[00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:05.260]   "Come to me, don't hold back."
[00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:09.580]   You're so afraid that you're not doing the right things
[00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:11.460]   of what it means to follow God.
[00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:14.580]   You're actually not even talking to God about those things.
[00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:16.500]   And he would say, "Talk to me."
[00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:19.940]   I think that's the strongest thing that I'm getting
[00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:22.100]   as I'm standing here.
[00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:27.100]   It's like, God is desperate for you to talk to him
[00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:31.660]   because we don't.
[00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:36.540]   We are afraid, we're so afraid.
[00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:39.900]   We have these assumptions and these judgments
[00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:44.780]   that we've already made or other people have made.
[00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:46.060]   There's enough in the world,
[00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:47.460]   there's enough societal pressure.
[00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:49.900]   We don't need God to put that on us as well.
[00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:53.020]   And he's saying to us, "Do not be my people
[00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:56.500]   "who feels that they cannot talk to me about things."
[00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:59.500]   Because when you don't do that, you're building up walls
[00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:00.740]   and there's barriers.
[00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:04.700]   And God wants to remove the barriers so that you're free.
[00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:07.860]   When you know that you can go to God with anything,
[00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:11.260]   in the emotions that you're holding, in your anger,
[00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:15.180]   in the questions that you still don't know,
[00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:17.420]   have not had answered.
[00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:20.260]   If you know you can still go to God
[00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:24.380]   because he's there for you 24/7,
[00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:27.900]   your life will look a lot different.
[00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:31.460]   Imagine if you didn't hold back in that way.
[00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:38.460]   And so I'd like us to take a step of courage,
[00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:40.300]   a step of faith.
[00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:45.220]   The sisters spoke out, the woman reached out.
[00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:50.460]   I'm asking you that as you enter 2025,
[00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:55.660]   that if you want to enter where you choose
[00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:59.460]   not to hold back from God,
[00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:04.060]   I would ask you to stand right now.
[00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:08.020]   And maybe something that I spoke specifically
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:10.940]   has stirred in your heart.
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:14.860]   But I felt strongly for us as a church
[00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:17.820]   and for those that maybe you're leaving Hong Kong
[00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:19.620]   and you're going somewhere else,
[00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:22.860]   there's a reason why you're in the service right now
[00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:25.620]   to hear a word from God that tells you directly,
[00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:27.700]   do not hold back.
[00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:31.460]   God is all powerful.
[00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:36.220]   And so I'm gonna pray for us.
[00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:38.980]   And the picture that I got, I believe is prophetic.
[00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:41.020]   I believe in the power of the Holy Spirit
[00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:43.220]   that is moving amongst us.
[00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:46.620]   I believe the questions we can hold are fine.
[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:50.380]   There is nothing that we've done, that we've said,
[00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:54.660]   or that we think that will separate us from who God is
[00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:56.340]   and the love he has for us.
[00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:58.100]   We sang about it earlier.
[00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:00.940]   There was a strong sense that God bringing love
[00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:03.620]   to this place as Andrew spoke to us.
[00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:07.340]   And I believe in this picture is prophetic
[00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:12.340]   because those barriers, they absolutely were removed
[00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:17.420]   and they were gone, gone completely.
[00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:19.220]   And that is what we will pray now.
[00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:21.580]   You know yourself individually
[00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:23.700]   what those obstacles are in your life
[00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:28.180]   that hold you back from being completely open with God.
[00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:29.580]   You know what they are.
[00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:32.540]   You can talk to God about what that is.
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:33.700]   And whenever you feel like,
[00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:37.620]   ah, I feel like there's barrier again,
[00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:40.100]   then remember these words, don't hold back
[00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:41.740]   because that's not me speaking.
[00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:46.060]   That's God encouraging us to be a people
[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:47.580]   who doesn't hold back.
[00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:53.140]   So Father, I wanna pray and ask for your Holy Spirit
[00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:56.220]   to move in this place right now.
[00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:57.740]   Everybody that has stood,
[00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:59.300]   for whatever reason they have stood,
[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:02.820]   they are asking that you would empower them
[00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:09.340]   to step into 2025 and that they would not hold back.
[00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:15.900]   Father, we're praying that you would remove all barriers
[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:20.500]   that stop them having that open conversation,
[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:22.500]   that open relationship.
[00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:27.900]   Remove them God, remove them in the name of Jesus.
[00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:29.660]   Where there has been those words,
[00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:31.220]   those words that Andrew spoke,
[00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:33.900]   that's coming through so strong,
[00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:36.700]   words that have been spoken over you.
[00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:38.820]   They have hurt you so deeply
[00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:40.860]   that actually the barrier that you've put up
[00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:45.860]   is because you feel that God has let you down.
[00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:49.460]   It's not fair is what you would say.
[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:53.020]   And so God, I pray that barrier be gone
[00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:54.700]   in the name of Jesus.
[00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:58.220]   Where there is fear and guilt
[00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:01.140]   and where there is this sense of judgment,
[00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:03.860]   be gone in the name of Jesus.
[00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:07.500]   And whatever else we carry in the obstacles
[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:09.420]   by the power of the Holy Spirit,
[00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:11.660]   they are gone in the name of Jesus.
[00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:14.300]   And we enter into the new year
[00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:17.860]   with nothing separating us.
[00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:22.100]   We enter into the new year knowing that we have faith,
[00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:25.060]   we wholeheartedly trust.
[00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:26.700]   And in the moments that we don't,
[00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:30.460]   we ask and say, God help us to have more faith.
[00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:34.380]   And Father, we pray for the hope
[00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:37.500]   that we live in knowing that our future
[00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:40.300]   is in the now and not yet,
[00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:41.860]   in the coming of Jesus.
[00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:47.500]   And the love that absolutely drives
[00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:52.500]   who you are and everything about our relationship with you.
[00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:56.980]   We choose God not to hold back.
[00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:59.500]   And we thank you for the work of the Holy Spirit
[00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:01.820]   in this place right now.
[00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:10.220]   And so we're going to respond in worship.
[00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:13.100]   This also might be a time where God wants to speak
[00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:16.180]   to you specifically about those obstacles.
[00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:18.540]   And it's simply a saying,
[00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:21.060]   God, I don't wanna hold back.
[00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:21.900]   That's it.
[00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:23.140]   That's all you have to do.
[00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:24.660]   The Holy Spirit does the rest.
[00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:26.580]   God does the rest.
[00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:27.420]   You don't have to worry about,
[00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:29.380]   well, what does this look like tomorrow?
[00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:30.460]   This is now.
[00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:34.220]   The Holy Spirit is here working
[00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:39.220]   and releasing us to go out into 2025,
[00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:40.900]   where we do not hold back.
