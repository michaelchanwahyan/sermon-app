1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,560
 In your name we pray, amen.

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,960
 Over to you, Sidney.

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,920
 - Hey, thank you, Alison.

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,880
 Well, thanks for the invitation

5
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,840
 that I got a chance to share something

6
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,580
 which I'm really, really passionate about,

7
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,240
 and that is work.

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,560
 I love to work.

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,980
 Sorry, it's a Sunday.

10
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,280
 Well, this is July.

11
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,960
 July is always something memorable

12
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,580
 and significant for us in the medical field.

13
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,600
 In our days, most of the medical practitioners

14
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:37,600
 will start their lifelong career in July 1st,

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,840
 and I'm actually one of those

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,840
 starting on exactly 1st of July, 37 years ago.

17
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,520
 Well, I was so excited and passionate

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,760
 about getting to start to save lives.

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,400
 Well, likewise, even fellow classmates

20
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,880
 who may or may not have a faith affiliation,

21
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,440
 but they also had that sense

22
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,080
 that there's a calling into an unknown world

23
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,720
 where we can grow in our profession,

24
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,520
 serve the community,

25
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,500
 and find our purposeful fulfillment in life.

26
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,160
 Along similar vein, I hope and pray

27
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,220
 that most of us would revisit our first entry

28
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:28,900
 into our work life, the passion, the sweet memories,

29
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,900
 and that should excite you.

30
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,540
 Well, but somehow, July also continued

31
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,540
 to be some of my defining moments.

32
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,380
 10 years into my career life,

33
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,500
 I felt really stuck and began to wonder

34
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:49,020
 how the rest of my professional life would evolve.

35
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,020
 We made a bold decision.

36
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,980
 We decided to emigrate to a foreign land

37
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,140
 to find a venue to fully develop

38
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,220
 my professional life and skills.

39
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:03,140
 I'm most grateful to the opportunities that opens up,

40
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,020
 and I was propelled to a higher level

41
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,120
 than I ever aspired or even dreamed.

42
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:18,040
 Then, July 2003, we finally came out of SARS.

43
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,400
 During those preceding months,

44
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,760
 I was quarantined for two separate occasions.

45
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,640
 We lost dear colleagues and patients.

46
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,220
 So in those stretch of quarantine,

47
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,380
 it was also a time for me to reflect

48
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:41,220
 upon the very notion of success

49
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:47,140
 or transforming from success to significance.

50
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,380
 So success in your career life,

51
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,940
 success in the marketplace is one thing,

52
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:56,980
 but in all of us, there should be a deeper yearning,

53
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,880
 calling into something even greater.

54
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,220
 So that means for me that period,

55
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,920
 I revisited to look at my own calling

56
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,560
 and how I can best serve,

57
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,760
 not only making a difference in the marketplace,

58
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,760
 in my professional sphere,

59
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,980
 but also making a greater impact

60
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,500
 to be fruitful for Christ.

61
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,580
 And I realized that I had a strong desire

62
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,960
 to partner with God to advance his kingdom.

63
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:35,200
 Now today, we shall refer to the passage in Acts 16,

64
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,640
 recalling Paul's second mission trip

65
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,200
 and how he crossed paths with three individuals

66
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,840
 where their lives were impacted.

67
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,840
 They are Lydia and then a demon possessed girl

68
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,020
 and a prison guard in Philippi,

69
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,600
 which I try to approach from their perspectives

70
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,780
 of how new life in Christ would mean for them.

71
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,180
 It might not be July, 2000 years ago,

72
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,500
 but definitely there was their season of transformation.

73
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,100
 It started with Paul's vision of seeing a man

74
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,820
 crying for help from Macedonia,

75
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,680
 prompting the sail across Asia to Europe.

76
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,540
 That mission to Philippi

77
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,640
 became the first major city in Europe

78
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:35,020
 to ever hear of God's good news.

79
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,180
 Luke tells the exciting story

80
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,100
 of the birth of the church in Philippi

81
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,580
 by giving account to three incidents

82
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,640
 involving people who come into contact with the gospel.

83
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,420
 The first one was by the name of Lydia.

84
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:56,420
 She was a prominent and wealthy Gentile businesswoman

85
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:59,700
 who was already a convert to the Jewish faith,

86
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,820
 and they were gathering in the riverbank

87
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,820
 as a small congregation.

88
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:09,620
 The second was a low status slave girl

89
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,860
 who's being exploited

90
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:16,380
 for her spirit-inspired fortune-telling abilities.

91
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,860
 Luke never really tells us

92
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,540
 whether she puts her faith in Christ,

93
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,020
 but the account of Paul's encounter with her

94
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,660
 demonstrates the very power of Jesus

95
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,360
 over the realm of the demonic and the oppression.

96
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,100
 But that the spirit was driven out of this slave girl

97
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,080
 also means that the girl's owner,

98
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,880
 their business, was ruined.

99
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,620
 The story was well known.

100
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:49,700
 Peter and Silas were beaten and imprisoned.

101
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:54,220
 But then there was an earthquake in the middle of the night

102
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,500
 as the two of them were praying and singing hymns

103
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,740
 in the dark dungeon.

104
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,120
 The chains broke loose.

105
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:08,220
 The jailer, worried that the prisoners might have escaped,

106
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,260
 was actually about to commit suicide.

107
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:14,540
 Yes, the two missionaries intervened,

108
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,980
 and the prison guard was in fact converted,

109
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,860
 finding great joy in knowing the Savior.

110
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,500
 Well, why should I choose to share

111
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,540
 from these three individuals?

112
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:31,540
 Well, in fact, the very title for today is "Faith at Work."

113
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,640
 Our faith in Jesus should be experienced

114
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,000
 and expressed in our work and workplace,

115
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,760
 even though it is a work in progress.

116
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:47,560
 Their stories should find and put on real faces of people

117
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,960
 that form a congregation, a community of believers.

118
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,200
 They are ordinary people from the various sectors

119
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,560
 of the work population,

120
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,380
 in the real world of the society in their times.

121
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,600
 As much as any one of you in this congregation,

122
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,320
 who is essentially from the marketplace

123
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,880
 and part of the society.

124
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:12,400
 So bear with me, I'm actually only guessing

125
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,600
 as best as I can about what really happened

126
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,260
 thereafter for them.

127
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,280
 But I love the story of Lydia

128
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,480
 because she's a businesswoman.

129
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,800
 And in a sense, while I'm also a professional,

130
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,280
 but I also carry a business

131
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,760
 whereby we run a small company

132
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,520
 doing professional services related business.

133
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,040
 I'm really excited about learning from Lydia

134
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,680
 through some imaginations.

135
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,280
 Acts 16 here says, "While we sat down,"

136
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,580
 that means Paul, Silas, and the team,

137
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,680
 "sat down and began to speak to the women

138
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,720
 who had gathered there.

139
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,920
 One of those listening was a woman

140
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,280
 from the city of Tyre-Tetra named Lydia,

141
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,680
 a dealer in purple cloth.

142
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,560
 She was a worshiper of God.

143
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,040
 The Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul's message.

144
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,960
 When she and the members of her household were baptized,

145
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,060
 she invited us to her home.

146
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:16,280
 'If you consider me a believer in the Lord,

147
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:20,600
 come and stay at my house,' and she persuaded us.

148
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,320
 In those days, it is not uncommon to find a woman

149
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,360
 undertaking business in Macedonia or in Asia Minor.

150
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,700
 Women had began taking up their significant business

151
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,720
 and civil roles in those societies,

152
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,760
 and evidently, Lydia had moved to Philippi

153
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,180
 and set up a business of selling dyed fabrics

154
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,380
 to Romans in the colony.

155
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:48,260
 While she is in that sense in fashion industry,

156
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:52,820
 she is a merchandiser, and she is doing a trader's job.

157
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,240
 Her business was apparently doing fairly well

158
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,900
 if she owned a house large enough to accommodate Paul

159
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:04,300
 and his team, in addition to all the members

160
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,260
 of her household.

161
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:09,300
 In the subsequent letter to the Philippians,

162
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,020
 written years down the road while Paul was himself

163
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,840
 imprisoned on another occasion,

164
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,260
 he was most encouraged to receive the generous gifts

165
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,400
 from the Philippians' church to support him in the prison.

166
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,660
 You, the Philippian church, sent me aid more than once

167
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,020
 when I was in need.

168
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,460
 Not that I desire your gifts.

169
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:39,300
 What I desire is that more can be credited to your account.

170
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:43,800
 I have received full payment of more than enough.

171
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,800
 I am amply supplied.

172
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,960
 Now that I have received from Epaphroditus

173
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,800
 the gifts you sent, they are a fragrant offering,

174
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,860
 an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God.

175
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,560
 Which means whatever the Philippian church is giving,

176
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,500
 it is a fragrant offering ultimately unto God.

177
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:10,500
 Whatever we give, it will be pleasant and pleasing to God.

178
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,060
 Of course, it's not recorded exactly whether Lydia

179
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:17,000
 was part of that generous community,

180
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,740
 but we may assume that the businesswoman

181
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,000
 would have contributed.

182
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,320
 I'm truly convicted that while businesswoman

183
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,120
 or businessman or anyone else in this congregation

184
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,880
 should give faithfully to the Lord.

185
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,880
 I myself have the joy of testifying his faithfulness

186
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:43,220
 in good times and in bad times in the economic sense.

187
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,020
 Well, indeed, even in our own industry,

188
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,180
 we also face many ups and downs,

189
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,940
 and we often have to make painful

190
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,820
 and difficult business decisions,

191
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,820
 just like any one of you in the marketplace

192
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:01,220
 will need to do day in and day out.

193
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:06,220
 But in the midst of all this, our faith in him is refined.

194
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:10,860
 More importantly, the poem is about

195
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,260
 we can all give of ourselves

196
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,580
 in the very marketplace situation we are put into.

197
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:21,420
 We can all transit from a place of gaining

198
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,000
 to a place of giving.

199
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,900
 Paul was encouraged not only by the presence

200
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,220
 from the Philippians Church,

201
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,980
 but also the very presence of this friend,

202
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,260
 the messenger, a co-worker sent from Philippi.

203
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:45,580
 From gaining to giving, Epaphroditus was a messenger

204
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,940
 sent from Philippi to Paul.

205
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:54,040
 We are messengers sent by God,

206
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,380
 and you are the very messenger

207
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:01,480
 sent to your workplace to encourage someone,

208
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,500
 whether you're a boss, a leader,

209
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,980
 a colleague, or an underling.

210
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:15,340
 From good to great, we talked about faithful giving,

211
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:19,460
 generosity, and being a messenger of Christ.

212
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,200
 These are all good things.

213
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,620
 Lydia was generous in hosting Paul and the team

214
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,520
 and brought the gospel into her household.

215
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:34,380
 But did she move from good to great?

216
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,880
 Well, that is a hypothetical question.

217
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,560
 Now, we know that her industry was lucrative,

218
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,140
 where precious raw materials

219
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:47,940
 was actually extracted from the seashells to purple dyes.

220
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,940
 Her work transforms garments into royal-class fashion.

221
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:58,660
 Can many of us in the business world today,

222
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:02,960
 in partnership with Jesus, transform the world around us?

223
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:07,020
 Can business, or more broadly speaking,

224
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,100
 the workplace, be a mission field?

225
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,980
 And how does that look like?

226
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,020
 According to Paul Stevens,

227
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:20,760
 a important figure in promoting marketplace ministry,

228
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,040
 there are a spectrum of possibilities.

229
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:29,040
 And business can be an arena for individual weaknesses.

230
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,500
 Business can also be a means of church planting,

231
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,580
 a means of society's service, of community building,

232
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:41,540
 or we can even negotiate and wrestle

233
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,740
 with the powers or the government.

234
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,200
 How to weakness and do a church plant?

235
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,740
 Well, let me share how a dare-to-believe

236
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,860
 business owner has been doing.

237
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:56,220
 So my friend is running an oncology cancer clinic,

238
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:00,440
 but he wants to provide chaplaincy care to his patients

239
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,100
 while they are receiving chemotherapy.

240
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:08,100
 So he funded his own official space for pastoral care

241
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,500
 and engaged pastoral staff to provide

242
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,960
 the much-needed comfort during the very tough times

243
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,880
 that the patients are receiving chemotherapy.

244
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:24,980
 Jesus is right there in the midst of his business,

245
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,460
 and a small community of people, patients,

246
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:32,800
 nurses, pastors, doctors, come to form

247
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,700
 a small church congregation in his clinic.

248
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,020
 How about serving the society?

249
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:45,020
 Another friend runs a beauty and well-being business,

250
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:49,640
 but they find that their technology is also useful

251
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,820
 to augment the behavior of autistic kids.

252
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:57,980
 So his company, in partnership with NGOs,

253
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,300
 provide cares for children with such needs

254
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,300
 and become a blessing for many.

255
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:09,580
 Then another schoolmate, he is in the building industry,

256
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:14,580
 but he insisted on fair and uncorrupted practices

257
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:20,580
 despite all the challenges and common practices.

258
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:25,540
 So while they bid for major metropolitan projects,

259
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,060
 his company is well-recognized,

260
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:31,820
 even by the various government officials,

261
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,480
 that they are upright in their project bidding.

262
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:41,780
 So the point is whether we dare to believe

263
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:45,440
 that there are many and numerous opportunities

264
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,220
 and possibilities, but these would open up

265
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:54,220
 only if we, as individual believer in the marketplace,

266
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:58,580
 truly embrace the call from Jesus

267
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:02,400
 to serve in the marketplace, to make a real difference.

268
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:09,780
 We are all called to be ministers in the marketplace.

269
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:14,500
 In case you do not receive this well,

270
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,540
 I want to speak this over you all over again.

271
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:22,820
 We are all called to be ministers

272
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:29,480
 in the very marketplace that God has sent you.

273
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,840
 So shepherd your flock well.

274
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:37,860
 While I did not think of business opportunities

275
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,540
 or kingdom opportunities so much last time,

276
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:45,060
 rather I would just stick with the flow

277
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:50,060
 and the commonest pathway that would be predominant

278
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:53,760
 in our peers would be, well, something like this.

279
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,940
 In your early 20s, you work hard, you try to get ahead,

280
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:01,820
 you put in long hours, put on extra work,

281
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,800
 try to work faster and smarter

282
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,900
 in order to beat the competition.

283
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,680
 Then towards your 30s, you may expect

284
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,900
 that you reap the rewards of your hard work,

285
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:17,100
 you get promoted, you receive better pay and better status.

286
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:22,140
 But then as I closed on to my 40s and then 50s,

287
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,500
 I felt my own battle fatigue.

288
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,220
 I began to realise, well, I couldn't

289
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,180
 and I wouldn't want to live this way forever.

290
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:37,980
 If life turned out perfectly, what should it look like?

291
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,040
 What elements would that include?

292
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,640
 What would I be doing in five years or in 10 years?

293
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,480
 How about you?

294
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,900
 How would you describe your idea of calling and destiny?

295
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,780
 How would you finally arrive at the point

296
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,540
 where you can say, I am doing

297
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,860
 what I have always dreamed of doing?

298
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:08,840
 I'm finally doing what I've always dreamed of doing.

299
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,300
 So I want to share this understanding

300
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,500
 or concept of significance, which I define

301
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,880
 as being fruitful in Christ.

302
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,220
 Well, it actually begins by stopping wherever we are

303
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:27,220
 in this journey to see what's really key in our life.

304
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:31,040
 And then we reorder everything around it.

305
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,100
 So imagine you have this treasure box.

306
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:39,100
 So let's see what you put into your treasure box.

307
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,480
 And when you are stripped of everything else,

308
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,580
 what remains in your treasure box?

309
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:51,580
 So I can probably safely say,

310
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,980
 well, money is not the most important thing

311
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,120
 in my treasure box.

312
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:02,540
 Well, I gained a fair amount of wisdom

313
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:07,540
 through the years of hard work and leadership and teaching,

314
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:12,980
 but probably that may not be the one

315
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,360
 and most important thing in my life.

316
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,700
 So I get that I have a key.

317
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,420
 The one and only thing that I will say,

318
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,220
 while stripped of everything else,

319
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,280
 I still want to be in the box.

320
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:36,980
 And I dare to share that that one thing,

321
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,580
 if I may put, is God.

322
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,300
 God in the box.

323
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,260
 Well, not that we can put God in the box,

324
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,420
 but we choose God to be the one and only

325
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,100
 when we are stripped of everything else.

326
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:58,220
 What is that ultimate one and only thing

327
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,680
 that you most treasure in your treasure box?

328
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:08,680
 As fellow believers, while we put God in the box,

329
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:13,580
 it also means reordering everything.

330
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:19,540
 And that decision of putting God in your box

331
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,160
 leads you thereafter.

332
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,380
 Now, it is unfortunate that most people think,

333
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,920
 well, successful Christians in business

334
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,780
 are just rich people who give a lot of money to the church

335
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,620
 and they don't do anything else.

336
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:37,060
 And whereas for ordinary workers,

337
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,140
 we are just to tithe regularly.

338
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:43,500
 Significance, fruitfulness in Christ

339
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,340
 would be there for us when we,

340
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,960
 business people or otherwise,

341
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,400
 find a way to give of ourselves to God,

342
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,540
 if God is indeed in the box.

343
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:01,680
 But this may or may not need a change of your job

344
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:07,580
 or otherwise, but it always requires a change of attitude,

345
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:12,260
 a transformed heart, a yearning

346
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,460
 to bear fruits for Christ.

347
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:18,400
 Well, generally, I actually do not believe

348
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,900
 that God creates us with such talents, abilities,

349
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,740
 or unique temperaments,

350
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,800
 or maybe unique business connections,

351
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,120
 but then asks us to do things entirely different,

352
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,960
 using different skill sets, different connections.

353
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,960
 But rather, many a times, moving towards significance

354
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:45,100
 does not need a 180 degree course change.

355
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,500
 Instead, we may do some retrofitting

356
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,160
 to find how we can best apply our gifts

357
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,940
 to allow us to spend more time on things

358
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,500
 related to what's in our box,

359
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:01,460
 and do it in such a way to reclaim that very thrill

360
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:04,460
 the first business transaction brought us.

361
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:08,900
 God has a wonderful plan for our life.

362
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,820
 We can serve him by doing what we may like to do,

363
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,460
 and we are good at.

364
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:17,900
 For my instance, I love to teach,

365
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,140
 even in my very young days.

366
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,740
 So I got to teach even younger kids

367
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,700
 when I was in Sunday schools.

368
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:29,040
 Then I got to teach medical students

369
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,540
 and post-graduate residents.

370
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:36,540
 And now, I've got the privilege and opportunity

371
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,340
 to teach or share work with you.

372
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:43,860
 I also got the privilege to teach

373
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,740
 in Tree of Life discipleship courses,

374
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,360
 including calling and phase of work courses,

375
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,500
 which I really was passionate about.

376
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:57,240
 And of course, the forthcoming marriage enrichment.

377
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:04,160
 I'm now excited, or even more excited, to share work

378
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,220
 that my delivering a lecture in a conference hall

379
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,760
 during academic meetings.

380
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:14,640
 I'm hoping I'm transiting from good to great,

381
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,240
 from success to significance,

382
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,920
 from gaining to giving.

383
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:26,420
 That was what I told Andrew

384
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:30,180
 when we shared nine years ago

385
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:34,520
 about signing up to serve as an elder

386
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,680
 in the Eldership Board.

387
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,720
 And I hope that we, fellow elders,

388
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,480
 have served you well all these years.

389
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,140
 Your finding your significance

390
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,680
 could run a very different path,

391
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:53,680
 but be open-minded and keep your entrepreneurial spirit.

392
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:57,860
 Be bold and adventurous.

393
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,560
 The God who gave you much success

394
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,000
 in your business or your workplace

395
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 would lead you into even better next stage of life,

396
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 to fully realize God's given talents,

397
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,760
 to advance his kingdom, and to make a real difference.

398
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,640
 Dare to believe.

399
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:23,160
 But you may say, "Well, I'm no businessman

400
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,520
 "or businesswoman."

401
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,440
 In fact, you may even be saying,

402
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,740
 "I'm at the lowest end, in the bottom,

403
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:33,460
 "in the combined chain of my employment or company.

404
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,920
 "What else can I do?"

405
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:40,300
 Well, let's revisit the story of the slave girl as recorded.

406
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:44,020
 The Greek implies that she is very young

407
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:47,800
 and has literally a spirit of the serpent.

408
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,760
 It is a spirit that predicts the future.

409
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:57,540
 Paul became so annoyed that he turned around

410
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:02,040
 and said to the spirit, "In the name of Jesus Christ,

411
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,680
 "I command you to come out of her."

412
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,440
 At that moment, the spirit left her.

413
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,880
 But her owners realized that their hope

414
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,340
 of making money was gone.

415
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:18,240
 They seized Paul and Silas and dragged them

416
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,560
 into the marketplace to face the authorities.

417
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,320
 Marketplace.

418
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,560
 This poor girl was doubly exploited by the spirit

419
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,800
 and by those who owned her.

420
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:35,800
 But she was set free, as now Jesus holds her future.

421
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:42,480
 You could feel that you are scrutinized by your boss,

422
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,160
 you are bullied by your colleague,

423
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,360
 and you are frustrated by your underperforming underling.

424
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,120
 Or you may just have that sense of being oppressed

425
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,880
 in the workplace.

426
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,360
 But Christ has set you free.

427
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,720
 Well, I have my honest confession

428
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,720
 that I myself is in my career low lately.

429
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,660
 I felt very oppressed myself.

430
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:15,360
 But I'm learning from Paul and Silas

431
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,760
 how they chose to pray and sing at their low points

432
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,780
 in the dark dungeon, the prison cell,

433
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:28,440
 where God responded by shaking the earth

434
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,440
 and all the chains came loose.

435
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,680
 Praying and singing are the natural responses

436
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:41,200
 of that trust in God who holds our future.

437
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:45,860
 And for all you know, many others are listening,

438
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:52,120
 just as other prisoners are listening to Paul and Silas

439
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,680
 as they prayed and sang.

440
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,060
 So dare to believe.

441
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:05,680
 The spirit of deceit falsified that our future

442
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,920
 is held by someone else other than Jesus.

443
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:15,360
 May the spirit of falsehood be cast out from you today.

444
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,760
 Christ has set us free, and we are free indeed.

445
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,960
 On the other hand, well, you may wonder,

446
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,920
 now that you are set free,

447
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,320
 you would devote yourself to follow Jesus,

448
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,120
 and in the literal sense,

449
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,960
 and you even consider quitting your job

450
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,080
 to enter into Christian ministry.

451
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,700
 Wow, what noble thoughts.

452
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,500
 You need prayerful deliberation.

453
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:45,220
 I do want to refer to Jesus' advice,

454
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:49,280
 the once demon-possessed young man.

455
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:53,500
 In Mark 5, as Jesus was getting back into the boat,

456
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:58,500
 the man who was once demon-possessed begged to go with him,

457
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,420
 but Jesus did not let him.

458
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,780
 He said, "Go home to your own people.

459
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:08,660
 "Tell them how much the Lord has done for you,

460
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:12,700
 "how much the Lord has done for you,

461
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,780
 "and how he has mercy on you."

462
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:19,780
 So this man went away and began to tell

463
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:24,780
 the people in the 10 cities how much Jesus has done for him,

464
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,180
 and all the people were amazed.

465
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:33,140
 How much Jesus has done for you.

466
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,860
 I would not be able to offer you a simple solution

467
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:38,460
 if you are struggling in your workplace,

468
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:43,460
 especially regarding decisions to stay put or to venture out.

469
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:48,900
 I myself made numerous transitions to depart,

470
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:53,260
 but I'm glad to share that I saw God's hands

471
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:56,100
 in each of those career moves,

472
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:01,000
 and I emerged stronger in each of those transitions.

473
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:05,780
 But I also strongly believe that regardless

474
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:08,340
 of the tremendous demand in our workplace,

475
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,420
 there must be purposes that God placed us

476
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:14,460
 in those situations in the first place.

477
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:18,160
 He has set us free so that we are liberated

478
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,360
 to work with new strength and a grateful heart.

479
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:27,780
 You might be doing the most mundane thing in the world,

480
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:31,260
 but what you are doing could make a difference.

481
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,540
 Let me share my story.

482
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,500
 I need to be admitted on a regular basis

483
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,220
 to one of the university hospitals

484
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,540
 to receive my chemotherapy.

485
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:46,260
 I confess that sometimes I will be very frustrated

486
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:50,340
 or even angry because it is typically

487
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:53,020
 the most junior medical staff,

488
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,100
 usually the fresh interns,

489
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:59,080
 who perform the routines in the ward that I will be staying.

490
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,820
 So they will make numerous attempts

491
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,520
 to put in the cannula into my vein,

492
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:10,540
 and if they finally did it, I'm truly blessed.

493
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:16,660
 They were doing good for me.

494
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,260
 My chemotherapy could start,

495
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,660
 and my disease will be brought under control.

496
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:27,420
 Their mundane, often unappreciated work,

497
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,820
 and sometimes not even valued by themselves,

498
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:35,820
 made a literal, lifelong impact on my life.

499
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:42,740
 We are all doing something that may help someone

500
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:49,940
 another one's day savor easier or just more pleasant.

501
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:55,320
 Don't despise the small things that you're doing every day.

502
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:00,820
 And now let's come to the last character for the day,

503
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,340
 the prison guard.

504
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:07,080
 This jailer in the story could be a director or a manager,

505
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,920
 as he can command a few other colleagues.

506
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:13,620
 The interesting paradox here is that the prisoners,

507
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:18,620
 Paul and Silas, set this supposedly free prison guard

508
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:25,060
 in the secular sense, really free in the spiritual sense.

509
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:28,660
 Acts 16, the jailer called for the lights,

510
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:33,300
 rushed in, and felt trembling before Paul and Silas.

511
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,300
 He then brought them out and asked,

512
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:39,280
 "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"

513
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,180
 They replied, "Believe in Lord Jesus,

514
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:46,940
 "and you will be saved, you and your household."

515
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,520
 Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him

516
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,660
 and all the others in the house.

517
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:55,140
 At that hour of the night, the jailer took them

518
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,140
 and washed their wounds.

519
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:01,460
 Then immediately, he and his household were baptized.

520
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,960
 The jailer brought them into his house

521
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,320
 and set a meal before them.

522
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,180
 He was filled with joy because he had come

523
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:13,180
 to believe in God, he and his whole household.

524
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:17,660
 This prison guard in the story probably

525
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:20,500
 have more common grounds with the congregation.

526
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,620
 He's an employee, he has a job title,

527
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,580
 he has certain skill sets, he has a few underlings

528
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:29,300
 or colleagues, but he also has his boss,

529
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:32,020
 the magistrate, to report to.

530
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:35,620
 Now how should he express his newfound faith

531
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,660
 in this rather unpleasant workplace,

532
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:42,580
 dealing with people who are not the most likable,

533
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:47,060
 while trapped in the middle as mid-level management?

534
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:49,400
 How should his faith work out?

535
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,360
 Follow the books?

536
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,180
 Well, he didn't, he didn't just follow the book

537
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,660
 and lock up the prisoners all over again,

538
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:59,840
 as per the duty manual or job description.

539
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:04,060
 Instead, he did the extra mile.

540
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,180
 He washed their wounds.

541
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:08,500
 He also brought them into his house,

542
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,940
 set a meal before them, but most of all,

543
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,760
 he was filled with joy.

544
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,920
 Recall how Paul advised the congregation

545
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,840
 in his letter to the Philippians.

546
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:25,260
 For it is God who works in you to will and to act

547
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:29,900
 in order to fulfill his good purpose.

548
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:33,120
 Do everything without grumbling or arguing,

549
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,820
 so that you may become blameless and pure,

550
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:39,020
 children of God without fault,

551
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:42,220
 in a white and crooked generation.

552
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:46,540
 Then you will shine among them like stars in the sky.

553
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:52,860
 Indeed, we sometimes find our workplace white and crooked,

554
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:56,740
 yet we can shine like morning stars in the sky.

555
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:03,580
 The jailer find great joy as he came to know Jesus

556
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:08,100
 in the workplace, as he continue to usher in

557
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:11,780
 Jesus' presence in this workplace.

558
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:16,780
 Likewise, Henry Nolan find his greatest joy,

559
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:20,980
 his inner renewal and his self-discovery

560
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:25,540
 as he served his severely disabled patient

561
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:29,660
 by the name of Adam through routine,

562
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:34,660
 long and tiresome days in Daybreak Community Center

563
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,540
 in Toronto.

564
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:43,300
 And that joy was much more than he experienced

565
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:46,640
 in his lifetime as an academic professor.

566
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:52,560
 Somehow, now, he see Jesus embodied in Adam

567
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:59,700
 and he is serving Jesus.

568
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:05,000
 Dare to believe that you may find your rightful joy

569
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,920
 in your most challenging workplace,

570
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,560
 be it lowly or highly regarded in the secular sense.

571
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,360
 Jesus will call you good and faithful servant

572
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:20,540
 if indeed you're good and faithful.

573
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:25,260
 Dear fellow brothers and sisters,

574
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:29,360
 I wonder whether July bears any particular significance

575
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,640
 for you.

576
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,600
 It's the mid-year term, you have the remaining half the year

577
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,920
 to fulfill whatever you have set forth

578
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,840
 to fulfill for 2024.

579
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:44,120
 But even more importantly, whatever you have set forth

580
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:48,140
 as your calling and destiny you have yet to fulfill.

581
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:53,520
 Season of the year changes like seasons of our life.

582
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,400
 Just continue to ponder upon how you want to move

583
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,140
 from good to great, from giving,

584
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:08,080
 from gaining to giving and from success to significance.

585
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,940
 Let your life speak.

586
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:16,880
 You may be a high-profile businessman, a leader, a CEO,

587
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,780
 or you may feel more like a lowly employee

588
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,380
 receiving only crumbles.

589
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:27,860
 Or you're like many others caught in the middle,

590
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:32,860
 having lots to manage but not a great pay or respect.

591
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:37,160
 Wherever you are, Paul's encouragement remains.

592
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,700
 Let your life speak.

593
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,880
 Do everything readily and cheerfully,

594
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,340
 no bickering, no second-guessing allowed.

595
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:49,160
 Go out into the world uncorrupted.

596
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:54,160
 Be a breath of fresh air in this polluted society.

597
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,300
 Provide people with a glimpse of good living

598
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,220
 and of the living God.

599
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:03,580
 Carry the light-giving message into the night.

600
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,840
 Can I invite all of us to stand?

601
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:11,920
 The worship team will come up.

602
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,280
 And also invite the prayer team and fellow elders

603
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,920
 who are in the midst to come forth.

604
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,160
 I want to invite all of us to respond.

605
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:25,560
 By coming forward to receive a prayer,

606
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,820
 we want to pray with you.

607
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:30,200
 I want to speak to three group of people.

608
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:36,120
 Business, people, men and women, leaders in your industry.

609
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:42,020
 I would like to invite you to come forth

610
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:47,940
 so that we can pray with you to honor your calling

611
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:52,460
 to become a minister for Christ in the workplace.

612
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,840
 Be the shepherd of your flock.

613
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:03,060
 For some of us who feel oppressed in the workplace,

614
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,300
 come forth, we want to pray with you

615
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,740
 that you're indeed set free.

616
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,860
 And for all of us here,

617
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:17,560
 that our yearning to shine for Christ will be stirred.

618
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:23,460
 That we commit ourselves to be fruitful for Christ

619
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:27,420
 so that we may move from success

620
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,280
 to significance.

621
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,860
 (gentle music)

622
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:34,440
 (gentle music)

623
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,020
 (gentle music)

624
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,600
 (gentle music)

625
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,600
