1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 This week has been an incredible emotional roller coaster for me.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 Last week we started this new series called "When the Journey is Too Much"

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 looking at mental health, and I shared with you very honestly and openly last week

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 about my own journey in mental health.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 And I shared with you about my anxiety and the crippling anxiety that I've had in my life

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 and how much of my adult life has been defined to a degree by the reality of that anxiety.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 And I was very honest and open with you guys.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 And Sundays are always draining for me.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Sundays are always emotionally draining.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 They're always physically draining doing this over three services, and I love it.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 But I was really drained at the end of last Sunday.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 And emotions are funny things because they come out of the blue sometimes.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 And as I left here at the end of our third service on Sunday, I felt completely naked and vulnerable.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 And I felt like all the thoughts started to go through my mind, right?

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Like, why did I tell everybody about that?

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 And I began to second-guess so much of it, and I began to feel bad about the whole day,

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 and all of these emotions were there.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 And I literally had to go home, and I had to find my wife and my daughter,

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 and I had to get them, and I had to talk with them for a couple of hours

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 just to be able to kind of find some stability again in the sense of how I was feeling

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 and to try to realize that the way I was feeling was not actually the reality of what was happening

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 or the reality of what had happened, but I was still feeling all of this way.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 And emotions, they're funny things, aren't they?

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 And emotions can kind of sneak up on us sometimes and begin to define and kind of dominate us.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Emotions are these things that it's hard sometimes for us to get our head around.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 And it's interesting because emotions, at one and the same time, are your greatest gift

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 and also your greatest challenge.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 And your ability to understand your emotions, to recognize them, and to process them

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 is probably the defining factor in your life for how you'll be able to understand

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 your overall status of your mental wellness.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 I'm going to say that one more time because it's super important.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Your emotions and your ability to see them, understand them, recognize them, process them in your life

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 will be the determining factor that will actually end up shaping your own mental wellness.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 So many of the mental health issues that we see in society are the result of people

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 being overwhelmed by the reality of their emotions.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 And if humans are anything, we are emotional beings.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 In your lifetime, the average human being, and I'm going to assume that all of you are average here.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 You're much better than average, but I'm just going to say.

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 An average human being over their lifetime experiences some 34,000 different emotions.

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 On every single day, you're likely to experience 6 to 27 different emotional contexts.

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 So we are definitely emotional beings.

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 I want to start today by kind of mapping out a couple of things for you that I think might be helpful

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 for us to understand the way in which we are when it comes to the reality of our emotions

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 and how those emotions are at work in us to try to define who we think that we are.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 I'm going to draw for you a human being.

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 You're welcome.

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 I was at M+ yesterday. If you haven't been to M+, a plug for M+.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 It's an amazing museum.

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 I still reckon that is better than a lot of what I saw yesterday.

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 Now, here's what happens for us as human beings.

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 We have three primary contexts within which our emotions are at work.

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 The first is what's called the psychological.

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 And the psychological is our thinking.

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Oh man, I cannot write.

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Our thinking, our thoughts.

56
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 And this is largely understood of or spoken about in terms of the head or the brain.

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Now, also, there is this thing that flows from the heart, which is our emotional state.

58
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 So as well as a psychological state, every human being also has this emotional state.

59
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 That is our feelings and our affections, our passions, those sort of things.

60
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 And that's commonly considered and thought of in the area of our heart.

61
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 And then finally, there's a third context that all human have.

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 And I'm going to draw this from the shin, but I'm actually meaning the foot.

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 And this is the physical context.

64
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 And the physical context is our behavior and it is our action.

65
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 And this is largely represented, like I say, by the feet.

66
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 Or you might even want to say the hands, something like that.

67
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 But it's the things that we do.

68
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 Okay, here's what I want you to see.

69
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 These three things are always at work shaping how you feel.

70
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 Shaping the way in which you experience emotions.

71
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 And the important thing to know is that each one of these impacts the other.

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 This is an incredibly complex thing.

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 In other words, the way you feel is not just down to how you think.

74
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 The way you act is not just down to the way in which you are emoting at that particular moment in time.

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 No, this is an incredibly complex system.

76
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 So your psychology impacts your emotions and your behavior.

77
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 Your behavior impacts your emotions and your psychology.

78
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Your emotions impacts your psychology and your behavior.

79
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 And all of this is at work in you all of the time.

80
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 It's an absolute complex system that is at work inside every human being.

81
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 Now, here's the critical thing you need to know about this system.

82
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 This system, at all times, is trying to define for you who you think you are.

83
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 In other words, the way in which you feel, the way in which you think, the way in which you behave,

84
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 is always trying to define how you think you are.

85
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 I call this the will of our emotions.

86
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 And I want you to notice that this is trying to say, "This is who I think that I am."

87
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Or, "This is who I feel that I am in any particular given moment of time."

88
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Now, notice I'm choosing my words specifically,

89
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 because this stuff is trying to tell you what you think that you are,

90
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 rather than actually who you are.

91
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 Come on, church.

92
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 It's trying to define what you feel like you are,

93
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 rather than perhaps who you actually are, because those two things can be different.

94
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 And so we need to recognize that sometimes this complex system that's at work in our lives

95
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 is trying to conform us, it's trying to tell us something,

96
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 and ultimately it's trying to shape us to its will.

97
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 Now, because this is a reality for all of us,

98
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 Scripture has a lot to say about this complex system.

99
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 Scripture invites us into a fresh journey of understanding actually who we are,

100
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 not driven by the way we think, not necessarily driven by our emotions,

101
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 and not necessarily driven by our actions,

102
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 but who we are driven by how God sees us, by God's determination, by His will, by His Spirit,

103
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 all shaping the person that we truly are.

104
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 Are you with me still?

105
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 So we need to be really understanding about what the emotions are all about,

106
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 not just from a physiological reality, but from a Scripture reality.

107
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 So the first thing I want to do is actually give you a bit of a theology of emotions.

108
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 I don't know if you've ever sat in church ever and heard a theology of emotions,

109
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 but I want to do this because I want you to begin to really understand what it is that's at work in you.

110
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Here's the first thing. God is in and of Himself an emotional being.

111
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 God is actually an emotional being.

112
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Now I know on the surface that might sound like, "Yeah, okay, cool."

113
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 But here's what we so often think.

114
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 We so often think it's us who are emotional,

115
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 and we've put these emotions onto God so we can better understand Him.

116
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 But you need to understand that God is not made in our image. We're made in His.

117
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 So by saying that God is an emotional being, we're actually saying something fundamentally important.

118
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 We're saying that emotions are not primarily in the first instant a human characteristic.

119
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 They are actually a divine characteristic.

120
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 And if that is true, then our ability as humans to experience emotions to some degree helps to connect us to the divine.

121
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 Are you guys here?

122
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 Now because God is an emotive being, and the Bible will explain this to us,

123
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 we see emotions that God has. He has love. He has joy. He has anger. He has frustration.

124
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 He has compassion. He has all these things that we see in the Scripture.

125
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 Because God is an emotive in that way, here's the second thing.

126
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 Therefore, our emotions are inherently a good thing. Emotions are inherently a good thing.

127
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 And again, I think so often we think as Christians, "Oh, I need to just suppress my emotions."

128
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 But actually that's not true. Emotions are inherently a good thing.

129
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 And because we are made in the image of God, humans are also emotional beings.

130
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 And we're emotional beings because we're made in His image.

131
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 He's emotional, so the way He's created us is to express something of the divine inside of us.

132
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 So we also are emotional, and our emotions are a beautiful reflection of who God is in us.

133
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 Are you with me still?

134
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 So it's okay to be emotional.

135
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 I want to just lift that one off you. You can come to the Vine, and you can be emotional.

136
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 Let me tell you why that's important.

137
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 I was at a conference just about a month ago, speaking at a young adults conference here in Hong Kong.

138
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 And before I was going to speak, we had this little dinner time,

139
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 and I was sitting on this table with a bunch of people who didn't know who I was, which was awesome.

140
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 And they were talking about the next speaker that was coming up.

141
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 And one of the young adults on the table goes, "Oh, he's from the Vine. That's the emotional church."

142
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 That was one of those times in life where I had to hold in the thing that I was thinking in my head.

143
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 But here's how I reflected afterwards. I'm like, "That's awesome. That means the Vine is just like God."

144
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 So you can come here and be emotional, and we will say, "Praise the Lord. Welcome to the Vine.

145
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 It is good to have you with us."

146
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 If you want to be unemotional, there are other churches that you can go to where you cannot be like God.

147
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 That's what I wanted to say, but I didn't say that.

148
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 But we also need to be really careful.

149
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 And this is actually a really important part of the theology of emotions.

150
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 We have to recognize that our emotions are deeply impacted by humanity's fall into sin.

151
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 And because our emotions are deeply impacted by humanity's fall into sin,

152
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 we have to realize that our emotions are not always incredibly trustworthy.

153
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 See, this is the thing that differentiates humanity and the divine.

154
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 See, God's emotions are not complicated by sin.

155
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 God's emotions are always good. They are always holy. They are always just. They are always right.

156
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 But humanity, our emotions are not always good. They're not always holy.

157
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 They're not always just, and I'm going to be honest, they're not always right.

158
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 And because of that reality, we have to understand a few things about how God has designed emotions

159
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 so that we can align ourselves to what the good reality is of these emotions

160
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 that help to connect us to the divine, and what are the bad parts of these emotions

161
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 that are now sometimes at work in us to try to get us to think, to feel, and to act in a way that is not glorifying to God.

162
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Here's a couple of things. God has designed emotions to be gauges, but not guides.

163
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 Emotions are created by God to gauge us, to help us to gauge society and the world around us.

164
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 In other words, to report to us, but not direct us.

165
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 But the world right now will tell you, "Hey, if it feels good to you, just do it."

166
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 You know, like, "Hey, if this feels right to you, don't let anybody else tell you what's right or wrong.

167
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 If this feels good to you, then you should do it.

168
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 Likewise, if you don't feel like doing it today, I know you made a commitment.

169
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 I know you gave your word, but hey, if you don't feel like doing it, don't do it at all. It's fine."

170
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 So the world has this very much this thought that our feelings should drive us,

171
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 but God has created and designed feelings not to be our leader,

172
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 but to be something that helps us to gauge society and environments around us.

173
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 Are you with me still? Here's the second thing.

174
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 Our emotions are feelings. They're not facts.

175
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 Your emotions are feelings, but they're not facts.

176
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 What that means is your emotions are not always truth.

177
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 So in other words, the way you feel is not always reality.

178
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 This was my experience when I left here last Sunday, and I felt all these things that I felt,

179
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 and in a way, understandable to feel those things, but I needed to get home and sit with my wife and my daughter for a while

180
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 for me to understand that the way I was feeling was not fact.

181
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 See, our feelings will try to often try to dominate that to us.

182
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Now, sometimes feelings are factual, and this is the tricky things with your feelings.

183
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 If you're standing in a road and a bus is driving towards you and you feel afraid for your life,

184
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 that's a true feeling, that's a factual feeling, and that is speaking truth.

185
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 But at the same time, a lot of the times, our emotions are trying to tell us things

186
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 that are not actually the way that God sees us or sees that entity or that thing that we're reacting to.

187
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Are you still with me?

188
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Here's the final thing. In Christ, we can have God-honoring, God-centered, and God-glorifying emotions.

189
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 In other words, even though our emotions are tainted by sin, in God, we can actually find those things redeemed within us.

190
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 In Christ, we can find that redemption of our sin.

191
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 Here's the way that happens.

192
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 At the Vine here, we have a mission statement, a vision statement called "Growing Big People."

193
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 What that basically means is if you come to the Vine, we want you to grow in Christ Jesus.

194
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 We want you to grow to become more and more like Christ Jesus.

195
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 And if Christ Jesus and Christ-likeness is actually the goal of His followers,

196
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 then that means Christ-likeness not just in thought and in action, but in our emotions as well.

197
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 My great desire for you is that you would have Christ-like emotions in your life.

198
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 Because those emotions are good, and they'll align you to the beauty and the power of God for you.

199
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 But those Christ-like emotions come in us as we learn to journey in our Christ-likeness in other ways.

200
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 It's not just about trying to be like Jesus in how we think, trying to be like Jesus in how we act.

201
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 We also want to try to be like Jesus in the way we emote things.

202
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Jesus had right emotions about everything that He encountered as a human in this world.

203
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 And there's much we can learn from the ministry of Jesus for how we can also hold right emotions.

204
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 There were times where Jesus actually kept His mouth shut when He wanted to say something.

205
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 There were times where Jesus realized that an emotion He was feeling, He shouldn't act upon.

206
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 Likewise, the Bible is filled with stories who act upon their emotions and get themselves into really big trouble.

207
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 But the good news for us is that in Christ we can be redeemed in all of these areas of our emotions.

208
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 Is that helpful? That's a bit of a theology of emotion.

209
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 Now here's why I've given you that today. It's because of this.

210
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 The thing that we have been created for as human beings is the two great commandments.

211
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 To love the Lord your God with all your mind, heart, soul and strength.

212
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 And love your neighbor as yourself.

213
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 Those are the two things that God has placed upon the call of humanity.

214
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 If we do those two things well, we spread the gospel.

215
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 And here's the reality. You cannot do those two things unless you are an emotional person.

216
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 Love the Lord your God with all your mind, heart, soul and strength.

217
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 And love your neighbor as yourself.

218
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 So in order for us to fulfill those great commandments, God has given you the thing that you need to be able to do it.

219
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 His love, His peace, His guidance, His spirit, His emotions inside of you.

220
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 So that you can fulfill that love and fulfill that love and begin to walk out the gospel.

221
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 So here's the critical thing.

222
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 When we hold our emotions in right balance and in right sort of judgment,

223
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 then we're able to actually have the greatest tool we need to work the gospel out in a broken and hurting world.

224
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 We get to and we are enabled by God to care for the things that He cares about.

225
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 So emotions are good. Emotions are important.

226
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 Emotions are designed to help you to fulfill the great commission and the great calling that God has placed on your life.

227
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 But we need to make sure we bring these emotions, as I say here, in right balance and right perspective.

228
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 And that's the great question that I think sits over us when it comes to mental health and all of our ongoing mental wellness.

229
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 How do we bring our emotions, how do we bring all of this stuff right here into right balance and right perspective?

230
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 Because if we can learn to do that, then I think we can become alive for the gospel in our city like never before.

231
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 Is this okay? So how do we do it?

232
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 How do we get right balance and right perspective in the world of our emotions?

233
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 Well, to unpack that, and we're going to unpack that over the next three weeks,

234
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 I want to take you over these three weeks to the story of Elijah.

235
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 Elijah is found in 1 Kings chapter 17 to about 25.

236
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 And in these chapters, we get to see Elijah be called by God in a critical moment of Israel's history.

237
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 Israel at this time is led by King Ahab and his wife Jezebel.

238
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 And they have done a terrible thing.

239
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 They have brought the worship of Baal and Asherah into the consciousness of Israel.

240
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 Not just the consciousness, but actually the religious life of Israel.

241
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 And because of that, there is this whole situation where there's all this worship happening of all these gods called Baal and Asherah.

242
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 And in fact, what King Ahab and Jezebel do is they raise up 850 prophets to praise and to worship these gods

243
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 to try to get all of Israel to follow these gods.

244
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 And by the time that God comes and calls Elijah, the whole of Israel is swept up in this idol worship.

245
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 And rather than 850 prophets, God calls one.

246
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 He says to Elijah, "I want you to go to the king and his wife,

247
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 and I want you to tell them to turn from their dark and wicked ways and to start worshipping Yahweh.

248
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 And if you can do that, then everything will change.

249
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 We'll get a revival back in Israel."

250
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 And Elijah is passionate about this revival.

251
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 There's everything inside of him that wants to see that revival happen.

252
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 But time and time again, King Ahab refuses to listen to him.

253
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 Turns his back on him, doesn't listen to him, casts him out.

254
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 And Elijah has a terrible, frustrating ministry.

255
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 With this burning desire given by God through the spirit for revival,

256
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 and always seeing walls and doors shut in his face,

257
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 seeing himself coming up against the worst of the worst,

258
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 and he's completely frustrated, and he's getting really angry about all this.

259
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 And many times he comes to God and he's like, "Why? Why did you choose me?

260
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 Why are you asking me to do this?"

261
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 And he has these huge emotions inside of Elijah,

262
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 because he feels like he's a failure the whole time.

263
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 Until this one moment, where he goes up a mountain,

264
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 and he calls the 850 prophets of Baal and Eshurah,

265
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 and they build an altar on top of this mountain.

266
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 I call this the Mountain Showdown.

267
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 And he says, Elijah pours all this water on the altar,

268
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 and then he says to the 850 prophets, he says, "Make this altar come alive.

269
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 Cool down fire from your gods in heaven to set this altar alight."

270
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 And they do. They kind of dance around,

271
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 and they do all their kind of incanting in their prayers,

272
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 and nothing happens at all, of course.

273
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 And then Elijah does a simple prayer, and God, Yahweh, brings fire from heaven,

274
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 burns the altar, all the altar comes aflame,

275
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 and the Bible tells us this amazing thing happens.

276
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 Everybody in Israel starts praising Yahweh again.

277
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 Everybody starts singing Yahweh's praises, starts singing to the Lord.

278
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 And this is the moment where Elijah sees victory,

279
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 the victory he's been longing for for so long,

280
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 fulfilling the calling that God had given on his life.

281
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 He's so excited. He takes the 850 false prophets,

282
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 and they're slaughtered in that moment.

283
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 And then he's so filled with adrenaline, so filled with emotion,

284
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 that he runs down the mountain faster than the chariots are able to be driven by horses.

285
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 I mean, this is a guy who's so pumped up, so emotional, so excited.

286
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 Finally, all those long, hard years of slaving away has paid off,

287
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 and revival can now come to Ahab, to Jezebel, and Israel, and then this happens.

288
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 Let me read this to you from 1 Kings 19, verse 1.

289
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 "Now Ahab told Jezebel everything Elijah had done,

290
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword.

291
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah to say,

292
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 'May the gods deal with me, be it ever so severely,

293
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 if by this time tomorrow I do not make your life like one of them.'"

294
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 Jezebel refuses to bow down.

295
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 In fact, she even says here, she says, "May the gods," plural, "still deal with me."

296
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 She's still worshipping Baal and Eshur.

297
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 And so, by implication, is Ahab.

298
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 And suddenly, Elijah is faced not with what he thought was revival breaking out on the land,

299
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 he's now faced with the reality that it's still idol worship.

300
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 He's suddenly hit with the worst sense of failure that he's ever felt before.

301
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 I mean, you cannot go from hero of the nation to enemy of the state faster than that.

302
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 And he's told that a hit has been put out on him, that there are people coming to kill him.

303
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 And he is completely turned upside down by this.

304
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 I wonder if you can get a sense of the emotional journey that Elijah is on here,

305
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 from this moment of great ecstasy on the top of the mountain,

306
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 to now knowing that the king and his wife want him dead.

307
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 I want you to see what he does next.

308
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 Verse 3, "Elijah was afraid," there's the emotion, "and he ran for his life."

309
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 "When he came to Beersheba in Judah, he left his servant there,

310
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 and while he himself went a day's journey further into the desert, he came upon a broom tree."

311
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 And on this tree, he decides that he would sit down under it.

312
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 And notice what it says here.

313
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 "He sits down under it, and he prays that he might die."

314
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 "I have had enough, Lord."

315
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 I wonder if anybody else has prayed that prayer here.

316
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 "I have had enough, Lord. I'm done with this. This is over. I don't want anything else.

317
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 I am fully at my limit. I'm completely burnt out."

318
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 This is basically Elijah saying to God, "I'm emotionally exhausted."

319
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 He says, "Take my life, for I am no better than my ancestors."

320
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Then he lay down under the tree, and he fell asleep.

321
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 Now, I would like to lie down there and fall asleep, because I'm pretty tired too,

322
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 but I will get up and finish my sermon.

323
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 I want you to see what happens here, because this is what's really critical in this whole process.

324
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 What Elijah goes through is the absolute spiral of all of this.

325
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 First of all, he feels fear. There's an emotion that's happening there,

326
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 which causes a behavioral action, which is to run and to flee.

327
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 As he runs and flees, his psychology, his thinking is, "I have to be alone.

328
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 I have to get alone. I'm all alone."

329
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 Therefore, he wants to die. His emotion is, "Just kill me, God."

330
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 He's having suicidal ideation. Not that he's going to take his own life.

331
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 He's asking God to take his life for him.

332
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 All of this is spiraling out of control.

333
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 What it's telling him is, "You're a failure."

334
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 What it's telling him is, "You should just go. You're done. It is all over."

335
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 What it's telling him, the person that he's now thinking he is, is an absolute failure.

336
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 "I got it all wrong."

337
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 Elijah does two things here that I think all of us do when we're feeling overwhelmed emotionally.

338
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 These two things cause a lot of emotional exhaustion in our life.

339
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 I want to tell you about these two things.

340
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 I think if you can understand these two, it might set you free a little bit

341
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 in how you manage your emotions as well.

342
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 Here's the two mistakes Elijah makes in this moment.

343
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 The first is that he's trusting his feelings over fact.

344
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 He's trusting his feelings here over fact.

345
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 Because here's the fact.

346
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 The fact is God's just done one of the most powerful things that God does

347
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 throughout the whole of the Old Testament.

348
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 Maybe only the parting of the Red Sea is even greater than this moment right here,

349
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 where God comes and takes 850 prophets and shows them up

350
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 and brings fire down in such a powerful and an amazing way.

351
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 I mean, that has just happened.

352
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 Here's fact number two.

353
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 The people have turned to worship Yahweh.

354
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 The revival that he wants has actually begun.

355
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 That revival is going to continue.

356
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 In fact, this is actually an inflection point for Israel.

357
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 And the rest of the narrative here tells us a story of how Israel comes back

358
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 to the worship of Yahweh.

359
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 It starts in this moment. That's a fact.

360
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 Here's another fact.

361
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 If God can send fire down on a mountain, God can stop people from killing Elijah.

362
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 So all these facts are there before him, but he's not seeing any of the facts.

363
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 He's just feeling these incredible emotions, which are telling him far more who he is

364
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 than the reality of what God is doing around him.

365
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 How many of us in this room, when we're overwhelmed with our emotions,

366
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 like me on Sunday evening last week,

367
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 allow those emotions so much to tell us what the reality is,

368
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 rather than actually how God sees what's happening?

369
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Are you with me still?

370
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 Here's the second mistake he makes.

371
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 The second mistake he makes is he's comparing himself to others.

372
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 Comparison is one of the most dangerous things that we can ever do.

373
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 Because either it will make us feel terrible about ourselves,

374
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 or it will so puff up our pride that we become actually arrogant.

375
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 And I want you to show what he says here is something really important.

376
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 He says, "I've had enough, Lord. Take my life. I am no better than my ancestors."

377
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 He's comparing himself to his ancestors.

378
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 When Elijah was called into ministry, he actually said,

379
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 "I don't want to be like my ancestors, who weren't able to turn God's people back to revival with him.

380
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 I'm going to be different from them."

381
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 And now he's sitting under this tree, feeling completely depressed and burnt out,

382
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 and he's saying, "If I compare myself to my ancestors, I'm no better than them.

383
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 I haven't done any better. I haven't succeeded anymore.

384
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 I'm still as terrible. I'm as bad. I haven't helped at all.

385
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 This is all bad." He's comparing himself.

386
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 And I want you to know this.

387
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 When you compare yourself, comparison is perhaps the greatest tool that the enemy will use

388
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 to keep you locked in a painful, emotional prison.

389
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 Come on, church. This is so true.

390
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 Your comparison will be one of the great tools the enemy will use

391
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 to keep you locked in an emotional prison.

392
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 And God's about to change all of this now for Elijah.

393
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 I want to show you the three things that God does.

394
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 Let me read on. It says this.

395
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 "All at once an angel touched him and said, 'Get up and eat.'

396
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 He looked around and there by his head was a cake of bread baked over hot coals and a jar of water.

397
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 He ate and drank and laid down again.

398
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 The angel of the Lord came back a second time and touched him and said,

399
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 'Get up and eat, for the journey is too much for you.'

400
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 So he got up and ate and drank, and strengthened by that food,

401
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 he travelled forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb, the mountain of God."

402
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 God does three things here for Elijah that I believe are the three things he can do for all of us

403
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 when we're overwhelmed emotionally.

404
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 Here's the first thing he does.

405
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 He comes in form of an angel and he physically touches Elijah.

406
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 He didn't need to do that.

407
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 He could have just showed up in angel form and stood over him and said some nice words to him.

408
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 But he actually touches him. In fact, it says that he does it twice.

409
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 He touches him twice. Why?

410
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 Because this is God coming and immediately addressing the psychological turmoil

411
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 that is going on here for Elijah.

412
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 Because Elijah thinks that he should be alone.

413
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 Elijah feels like he's alone.

414
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 And so when God comes and touches him, it changes something in his physiology,

415
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 in his thinking, in the psychological way that he thinks.

416
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 And God's saying, "This touch communicates to you that you're not alone.

417
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 This touch communicates that the thing that you're thinking, 'I'm all alone,' is not fact.

418
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 Let me show you physically that I'm right here with you. Are you with me?"

419
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 So the first thing God does for any of us when we're in an emotional turmoil place

420
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 is he comes up to us and says, "I'm with you. I'm not distant. I'm here with you.

421
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 I touch you. I'm physically here with you. My spirit is here with you.

422
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 We are present together. You are not alone."

423
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 The greatest enemy and the lie that the enemy would try to tell you emotionally

424
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 is that you're all cut off. You're all alone. There's no help for you.

425
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 And God comes and he touches Elijah.

426
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 And I believe if you want it, he will come and touch you

427
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 to let you know that you're not alone.

428
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 The second thing he does is he feeds him, gives him food and drink.

429
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 In other words, he provides for the sustenance of his body.

430
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 This is God coming and ministering to the physical elements of what's in turmoil in his life.

431
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 And you need to understand when you're in a bad emotional place,

432
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 your body is also in a bad place.

433
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 And there's chemicals and things in your body that are making you feel even worse.

434
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 And again, feelings aren't fact. They're reality.

435
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 And these things in our body can do that.

436
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 And God understands that and he comes and says, "The first thing I need to do,

437
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 let you know that you're not alone because I want to change your thinking.

438
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 But now I'm going to come and feed and drink and give your body sustenance

439
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 because that will get you stability for you to be able to then begin to deal with your emotions."

440
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 You need to know that if you're ever dealing with depression,

441
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 psychologists will tell you that 85% of the journey towards healing for somebody who's depressed

442
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 is to begin to deal with the physical side of things.

443
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 Exercise, nutrition, food at the right times,

444
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 bringing that body back to life is a major step forward in all of the other healing.

445
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 And God shows up and says to Elijah, "I've got you and I'm going to physically now work with you."

446
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 But then he says this, most important.

447
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 He says, "Get up and eat for the journey is too much for you."

448
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 Notice this. He says, "The journey is too much for you."

449
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 This is God now dealing with the emotional part.

450
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 Perhaps the most central bit of all.

451
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 And I want you to hear what God says. He says, "The journey is too much for you."

452
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 What he's not saying is this, "Man, the journey is too much for you. You suck.

453
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 I wish you were stronger. I wish you were better.

454
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 Like, man, this journey is too much for you."

455
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 It's not like that at all. Here's what he's saying.

456
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 He's saying, "Man, I get it. The journey is too much.

457
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 The journey is hard, but I'm here."

458
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 This is like what I shared last week when I talked about what my counselor said to me in the counseling room.

459
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 When he said, "Andrew, it's okay to not be okay."

460
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 God shows up and he says to Elijah, "I get it. I see it, man.

461
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 It's been a long, hard road. I understand that you're feeling disappointed.

462
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 I get it. I feel it too. Man, this journey is overwhelming. Isn't it, Elijah?"

463
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 And this is so critical because God's doing something that is so important here.

464
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 He's actually doing something that will enable Elijah to redefine his relationships with his emotions.

465
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 I want you to see what he's doing here.

466
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 By God coming and saying, "Hey, it's okay to not be okay, Elijah.

467
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 It's okay to feel what you're feeling."

468
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 What he's actually doing is he's trying to create space between the person of Elijah

469
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 and what all of this complex system is trying to tell him.

470
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 God's creating a space here and in this space, it's going to enable Elijah to take stock of everything that's happening

471
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 and begin to redefine his relationships with this complex system that's at work.

472
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 Hey, basically, here's what's going to happen for Elijah.

473
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 He's going to go from, "Oh man, I'm feeling this way and it sucks and I want to die."

474
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 He's now going to go, "I'm feeling this way and it sucks, but God feels it with me

475
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 and he validates the reality of that emotion in my life.

476
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 And because he does, I have space now to redefine my relationship with those emotions."

477
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 Are you with me, church? Come on.

478
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 This is so important that God would say, "Hey, I feel what you're feeling.

479
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 I get it and I touch you and I feed you. I provide for you, but I also am here and I feel what you feel,"

480
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 which enables Elijah to go, "There's some distance between what all this is trying to say to me

481
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 and how I can now observe my thinking, observe my emotions, observe the physical things that are happening in me

482
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 and realize that what they're trying to tell me is not the wholeness of truth.

483
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 There's now space for something else to be there.

484
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 Psychologists call this space the observing self.

485
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 It's the self being able to observe the things that are happening inside of the person.

486
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 But I like more the way that the Bible talks about it.

487
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 Let me show you one quick verse and we're going to pull things up around about here.

488
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 But let me go to Romans chapter 12, starting in verse 2.

489
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 It says, "Do not conform any longer to the patterns of this world,

490
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.

491
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is, His good, pleasing and perfect will."

492
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 This is such a powerful verse.

493
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 Paul's saying, "Hey, you want to get back to where things are supposed to be?

494
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 You want to actually begin to see your emotions as they should?

495
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 You want to be able to think in the right ways?

496
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 Well, here, you don't have to be conformed anymore to the patterns of the world,

497
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 the will of your emotions.

498
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 You can be transformed by the renewing of your mind.

499
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 Why? So that you can then discern," and he says this,

500
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 "You can discern what God's perfect will is."

501
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 I'm going to write, "The will of God, His good, pleasing and perfect will,

502
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 which brings your thinking, your emotions and your body, your behavior, your actions,

503
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 all into alignment in Christlikeness."

504
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 Isn't that great?

505
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 If only we could realize that all of this is trying to define us,

506
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 but actually it's the work of the Spirit of God that creates a space in us.

507
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 Not that all of this is evil.

508
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 Remember, emotions are given by God, that they are actually part of His characteristic,

509
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 that it's not wrong for us to feel.

510
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 It's not that we suppress all this stuff.

511
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 It's just that we gain a fresh perspective on it through the lens of the will of God,

512
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 which defines our thinking, defines our emotions, and defines our physicality,

513
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 so we can then be more like Christ in the world.

514
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 And the Bible says the ability, the thing that creates this space,

515
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 and it helps us to understand and discern God's will, is the Spirit of God.

516
00:36:52,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 The Spirit, which is already inside of you, works to align you to the will of God,

517
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 so you can redeem your psychology, your emotions and your physical self,

518
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 so that this comes in alignment with this.

519
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 That's the Bible's answer for how we then journey in our emotions.

520
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 The Spirit of God at work in you, and that Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,

521
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 faithfulness, gentleness, and the ultimate one, what's the last one?

522
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 Self-control.

523
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 It amazes me that God has placed inside of us the very thing

524
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 that can bring all of this under self-mastering control.

525
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 Not that all of this is evil and wrong and bad.

526
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 There is so much good that happens inside of this.

527
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 But if this determines and defines this, then we've got ourselves out of whack.

528
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 And emotional exhaustion is possible.

529
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 But when this enables this to come under self-control,

530
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 well then we're able to live as Christ has always caused us to.

531
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 May I encourage you to redefine your relationship with your emotions,

532
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 so that you can bring all of it under control.

533
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 Know that God touches you, provides for you, and He speaks to you,

534
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 and says, "I know what you're going through. I'm here with you.

535
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 But together we can do this right."

536
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 That's my hope for you, that you would know a God who sets you right.

537
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 Can we pray?

538
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 Maybe you can just open your hands where you're sat.

539
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 Father, I just thank you so much for the people in this room.

540
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 And I thank you so much for this journey that you've invited us into now.

541
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 We thank you for our emotions. What a gift they are.

542
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 We thank you that our emotions are reflected and found and sourced by you.

543
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 You are an emotive being.

544
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 Lord, we recognize that in our emotions and in our sin,

545
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 these things can so often attempt to define us.

546
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 And we know, every single one of us in this room,

547
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 that we've made really poor decisions in our lives based on our emotions.

548
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 Father, we want to come now and just bring that to you.

549
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 Father, we thank you that there is another way,

550
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 that you come to Elijah and you touch him to say, "You're not alone."

551
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 Even though your feelings and your emotions are saying you're cut off,

552
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 you are not alone.

553
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 And I want to say that over some of you in this room,

554
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
 because this is really important.

555
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 Some of you feel alone all the time, and that feeling is not fact.

556
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 And God wants to come and touch you today like he did Elijah and say, "You're not alone."

557
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 God wants to provide for you sustenance and strength for the journey ahead.

558
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 And God speaks over you.

559
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 Sometimes the journey is too much, but it's okay.

560
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 I'm with you.

561
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 We're going to do this together.

562
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 I feel you.

563
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 And I've got you.

564
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 If you'd like the Holy Spirit to transform your mind,

565
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 to renew your mind, so that you would be able to discern God's will,

566
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 so that you'd be able to see your life with a fresh perspective,

567
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 can I just invite you to just open your hands now?

568
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 You don't have to do that, but if you want to respond to this message now,

569
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 if you feel like this is for you,

570
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 you know your emotions have been defining you more than God's will,

571
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 more than God's Spirit, more than the fruit of that Spirit that's at work in you.

572
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 Just open your hands.

573
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 And I want to pray that the Spirit of God would come now and minister.

574
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 I want to pray that you would receive His touch, His words, His love.

575
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 Elijah at the end of his robe, "Kill me, Lord. Take me. This is just too much."

576
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 Maybe you're sitting here today and that's your feeling too.

577
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 Invite God to come.

578
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 I pray you would minister now.

579
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 I'm going to invite the team in a moment just to begin to worship over you.

580
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 But I want you to allow yourself just this time, precious time,

581
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 to have the Holy Spirit to speak to you,

582
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:57,000
 to meet you in your emotional world right now.

583
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 For Him to create some space between all of that emotion and what it's trying to say to you

584
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,000
 and what He says to you and how He sees you.

585
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 And I pray you would hear His voice for you again.

586
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,580
 (gentle music)

587
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,580
