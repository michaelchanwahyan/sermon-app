1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 and we pray in Jesus' name.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,440
 - Amen. - Amen.

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,120
 - Thank you, Jen.

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,200
 And good afternoon, everybody.

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,880
 Good afternoon, welcome back, Andrew, as well.

6
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,640
 I hope you can see, you know,

7
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,040
 you should be proud of your team, Andrew,

8
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,360
 'cause we've really been thriving in the past four months.

9
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,680
 It's been really good.

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,280
 I really wanna-- (audience laughing)

11
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,320
 We have, you know, but it's credit to you, too.

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,680
 And we have an amazing team.

13
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,320
 You know, I wanna honor the team

14
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,720
 that's been leading from the pulpit as well.

15
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,360
 It's such an honor to work with such an amazing

16
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,480
 group of people.

17
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,120
 And for us to be able to hear a variety of, you know,

18
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,200
 perspectives and voices on different topics

19
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,880
 around the Bible, I think it's been really, really good.

20
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,000
 So yeah, shout out to the worship team as well.

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,440
 You know, every time they come together and they plan,

22
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,200
 you know, there's a reason why the service flows together.

23
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,640
 It's because thought and preparation and prayer

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,880
 has been put into it.

25
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,440
 And so yeah, it's been a good journey.

26
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,640
 And we've journeyed through forgiveness, too,

27
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,360
 over the past few months, over the past couple of weeks.

28
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,560
 And today, like Jennifer said, we're wrapping up the series.

29
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,600
 And even though, you know, the topic of forgiveness

30
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,200
 as a sermon series ends today,

31
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,600
 the journey of forgiveness has to continue.

32
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,240
 And so the message that I'm bringing today

33
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,320
 has been sitting on my heart for the past couple of weeks.

34
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,800
 I've been fasting and praying up to today for this message.

35
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,240
 And so before we start, I hope that we can pray again

36
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,680
 and that you can pray for me as I bring God's word

37
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,880
 and open up scripture together.

38
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,880
 So let's pray again.

39
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,160
 Yeah, Jesus, just thank you for this journey

40
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,840
 that you've had us on and that you'll continue

41
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,880
 to lead us into, Jesus.

42
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,640
 And I pray that as we open up your word today,

43
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,280
 that yeah, it would just be truth.

44
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,480
 It would just be encouraging and challenging

45
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,320
 and yeah, lead us closer to you, Lord.

46
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,400
 We pray this in Jesus' name, amen.

47
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,880
 All right, got a question for you before we get going.

48
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,640
 What is the worst date that you've ever been on?

49
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,400
 The worst date you've ever been on, okay?

50
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,040
 Maybe some of you are on a date right now

51
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,960
 and you're like, the worst date is when the person I'm with

52
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,120
 brought me to church instead of to brunch

53
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,200
 or to high tea or something.

54
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,760
 Okay, that was what you were expecting.

55
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,640
 You ended up here instead, okay?

56
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,920
 I hope it's okay, all right?

57
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,840
 I'm gonna share one of my experiences with you, okay?

58
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,800
 Mind you, this was about 20 something years ago now, okay?

59
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,080
 I was a freshman, a fresher at university in London, okay?

60
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,920
 And so, you know, I was trying to get to know people,

61
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,600
 new city, new school.

62
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,120
 I decided to sign up for a psychology class.

63
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,360
 Now, I decided to sign up for psychology

64
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,360
 because people told me a lot of girls do psychology, okay?

65
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,320
 At UCL, so I thought, don't judge me, okay?

66
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,200
 I was 18 years old, okay?

67
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,040
 Some of you come here because of the girls, okay?

68
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,160
 So, all right, so.

69
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,560
 Okay, so. (laughs)

70
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,160
 I'm not looking this way, okay?

71
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,640
 (audience laughs)

72
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,880
 I joined the class, okay, and I got anything I learned,

73
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,360
 but the girl that sits next to me, she's nice, okay?

74
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,760
 And so, and we start talking, and then, okay,

75
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,080
 I thought, you know, okay, we're getting along.

76
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,960
 Maybe I'll ask her out and see what she says.

77
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,000
 So, one day after lecture, I say,

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,360
 tomorrow, you know, after psychology,

79
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,000
 do you wanna go out for lunch together?

80
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,440
 And she says, yes, okay.

81
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,320
 I say, good, so far, so good.

82
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,440
 I tell her, well, let's go to Wagamama's.

83
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,560
 And she agrees, okay, now, for those of you

84
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,880
 who don't know what Wagamama's is,

85
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,080
 it's a restaurant chain in London, okay?

86
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,760
 It's fusion food, okay, where they take Japanese food

87
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,000
 and make it disgusting, okay?

88
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,300
 That's sort of what Wagamama's does, okay?

89
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,040
 Lot of Londoners don't like it, but I love it, okay?

90
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,160
 I'll tell you why in a minute.

91
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,360
 So, lunch date comes along, we're eating,

92
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,360
 conversing, getting along, you know, chatting.

93
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,760
 Oh, you're from Hong Kong, it's fun, isn't it?

94
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,480
 Yeah, all that kind of stuff, you know,

95
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,800
 and having a good time, okay?

96
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,360
 And, you know, the meal comes to an end,

97
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,320
 and it's time to pay the bill.

98
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,720
 Now, being the gentleman that I am, right,

99
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,240
 and the one who initiated the date,

100
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,100
 I thought it was only appropriate that I pay for the meal.

101
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,120
 But it was also because I had a secret weapon, right?

102
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,680
 You see, I had coupons, all right?

103
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,200
 (audience laughing)

104
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,000
 A few weeks before this, all right,

105
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,560
 I found on the internet, buy one, get one free, okay,

106
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,800
 at Wagamama's, right?

107
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,260
 It was just right there on the website.

108
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,980
 So, I, like, printed out, like, 50 of these things, okay?

109
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,400
 It was, like, went to the library, logged in, you know,

110
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,040
 printed off 50 of these Wagamama coupons,

111
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,480
 I had a little stack of them, okay?

112
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,000
 It was amazing, all right?

113
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,680
 I had them in my backpack, ready to use at any time, right?

114
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,600
 So, the bill comes along, it's like, I got this.

115
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,980
 And she seems impressed until I say, I got a coupon.

116
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,880
 It's buy one, get one free, right?

117
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,960
 And I pull out my stack of coupons.

118
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,040
 In my mind, I thought this girl was gonna be like,

119
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,920
 oh my goodness, look at this frugal Chinese man, right?

120
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,620
 Handsome and frugal, right, boyfriend material, right?

121
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,900
 But instead, the look on her face was one of,

122
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,100
 I wouldn't say disgust, but it was pretty close to that,

123
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,220
 okay, and she didn't have to say it out loud,

124
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,620
 but the expression she had told me, like,

125
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,660
 oh my gosh, this guy is so cheap, okay, like,

126
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,260
 he took me to Wagamama's on a two for,

127
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,060
 it's not expensive in the first place, okay,

128
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,940
 on a two for one at Wagamama's, right?

129
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,540
 Now, needless to say, there was no second date, okay,

130
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,360
 but I kept eating at Wagamama's

131
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,500
 and two of those coupons ran out and it was great, right?

132
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,560
 And I wish I could have said I've changed since then,

133
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,440
 but not really, okay, I'm still cheap, all right?

134
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,720
 For example, the first wedding anniversary,

135
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,080
 my wife and I are celebrating 15 years

136
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,800
 in December of being married, okay, so yeah.

137
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,160
 But true story, on our first wedding anniversary,

138
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,960
 I'd planned this, okay, I was saving up

139
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,040
 all the loose change I had for the whole year.

140
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,760
 So I had this little, like, bucket of loose change,

141
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,060
 and I was gonna use that to pay for dinner

142
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,700
 on our first wedding anniversary, right?

143
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,980
 So that in itself was already kind of cheap, okay?

144
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,420
 So I go to the bank and I say, okay,

145
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,740
 I wanna cash this in, I wanna make it into cash.

146
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,460
 And they said, oh, there's a 2% service charge for that.

147
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,400
 It's like, 2%, I'm not gonna pay that, okay?

148
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,820
 So in the end, what I ended up doing,

149
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,060
 I took the bucket, it was like a bucket literally of coins,

150
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,780
 and I took it along with me to our dinner date

151
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,140
 on our first anniversary, excuse me,

152
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:11,540
 and I paid for dinner using coins, okay?

153
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,880
 I'm not joking, okay, it was like a $1,000 dinner

154
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,560
 in fives, twos, and ones.

155
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,520
 I had to count them out after the meal, okay?

156
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,520
 Brittany was, she had run away by the end of the meal,

157
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,800
 so embarrassed, okay, I didn't care, I don't care, okay?

158
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,500
 It paid for the meal, all right?

159
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,620
 So, yeah, that's me, okay?

160
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,500
 Now you'll see in a minute

161
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,400
 why I'm sharing these stories with you.

162
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,520
 But over the past few weeks, like I said,

163
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,160
 we've been taking a deep dive

164
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,720
 into this topic of forgiveness.

165
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,440
 And I hope it's been helpful, right?

166
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,760
 I hope it's given you a better understanding

167
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,280
 of what God's heart is when it comes to forgiveness,

168
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,760
 because we've really needed it.

169
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,740
 I shared it in the beginning of the series as well.

170
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,940
 I felt that this was a heart cry of the church, right?

171
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,000
 And I wanna show you something.

172
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,400
 So this bowl right here, okay,

173
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,560
 this is full of the prayer requests

174
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,340
 that we wrote out during Converse

175
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,520
 at the beginning of this year, right?

176
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,000
 All of these have to do with forgiving others,

177
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,100
 forgiving ourselves, forgiving lots of different things,

178
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,080
 all on our struggles for forgiveness.

179
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,680
 And there's even more, hundreds of them written out,

180
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,580
 your heart poured out on this topic of forgiveness.

181
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,120
 But as I was thinking about this,

182
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,100
 and I was thinking about us,

183
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,320
 and I was thinking about this series,

184
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,120
 I began to realize that actually there might be some pitfalls

185
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,200
 in focusing on forgiveness so much, right?

186
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,720
 In all this talk of needing about to embrace forgiveness

187
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,640
 because it's what God has done for us, right?

188
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,080
 In the realization that yes,

189
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,960
 Jesus has taken away our guilt and our shame,

190
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,400
 he holds nothing against us.

191
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,180
 One of the risks is that forgiveness starts becoming

192
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,680
 something we take for granted, right?

193
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,840
 Our mindset becomes like,

194
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,960
 hey, since forgiveness is always there,

195
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,360
 then I've just accessed it when I need it, all right?

196
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,160
 So we can help ourselves to it whenever we want, right?

197
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,480
 I'm gonna live my life, do whatever I want,

198
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,840
 and just ask for God's forgiveness later

199
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,240
 because it's been promised to me.

200
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,460
 And then on the other side of that,

201
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,240
 we start even to maybe apply that

202
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,600
 to the way we relate to each other, right?

203
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,520
 When it comes to forgiving each other,

204
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,280
 we start using forgiveness like a weapon, right?

205
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,220
 We hurt each other, but instead of doing the hard work

206
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:24,700
 of confessing and repenting and actually changing ourselves,

207
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,880
 we develop the mindset of, well, you know,

208
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,840
 you have to forgive me because Pastor Ellison

209
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,800
 and Pastor Jen and all these people have been saying so.

210
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,720
 Or I can hear right now, maybe you and your spouse,

211
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,120
 you and your partner having an argument.

212
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,700
 You know you're wrong, you know you've messed up,

213
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,520
 but instead of owning up to your mistakes,

214
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,360
 outcomes in your mouth,

215
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,060
 or haven't you been listening to the sermons?

216
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,240
 Why don't you just forgive me?

217
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,040
 All right, listen, if that's what we've come away with

218
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,280
 at the end of the series,

219
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,780
 then I think we've got the wrong end of the stick.

220
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:57,640
 In other words, if we come away from the series

221
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,960
 thinking forgiveness is something that we can do cheaply,

222
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,040
 just like coupons or coins, all right,

223
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,240
 we've wasted our time.

224
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,440
 Because forgiveness cannot be cheap.

225
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,000
 And forgiveness is not cheap because it was God's idea.

226
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,680
 It's this great and amazing gift to us.

227
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,580
 So we really have to treat it as something that's precious.

228
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,260
 Right, in the beginning of this series,

229
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:27,200
 we said also that forgiveness is going to be a journey.

230
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,680
 Right, we're gonna learn how to forgive

231
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,780
 at the end of this series.

232
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,520
 And again, I feel like we've missed something.

233
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,920
 I feel like I missed something.

234
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,480
 Because I've realized the journey

235
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,600
 isn't really learning how to forgive.

236
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,560
 Right, you can actually learn how to forgive

237
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,580
 in lots of different ways.

238
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,960
 Right, in like the scientific world,

239
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,960
 if you wanna use that word,

240
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,780
 forgiveness is something that's good for you physiologically.

241
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,600
 Right, so there's health benefits,

242
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,000
 you embrace forgiveness, right,

243
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,480
 the lowest stress and anxiety in your life,

244
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,100
 all those good health benefits

245
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,240
 that forgiveness can give you.

246
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,920
 Right, Buddhism teaches forgiveness.

247
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,760
 Right, Buddhism teaches that forgiveness

248
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,360
 is the way to reach inner peace.

249
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,960
 Right, so if you want inner peace,

250
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,440
 you have to embrace forgiveness.

251
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,360
 Right, Hinduism says forgiveness,

252
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,800
 you should practice forgiveness for the sake of karma.

253
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,740
 So in the next life,

254
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,640
 you don't wanna come back as something ridiculous

255
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,080
 and you practice forgiveness so you can have good karma,

256
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,840
 right, and eventually reaching

257
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,840
 the heights of self-realization.

258
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,340
 Right, in Islam, the Quran teaches forgiveness

259
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,960
 as one of the virtues that Allah is impressed with.

260
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,020
 So the more you forgive,

261
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:36,400
 the more riches you store up for the next life in heaven.

262
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:41,020
 So the goal cannot simply be good at forgiving.

263
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,380
 There's so many routes we can take to be forgiving.

264
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,300
 No, the goal is this.

265
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:52,300
 Our goal in life is to become more and more like Jesus.

266
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,860
 Our goal is to learn what it means

267
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,100
 to enter through the small and narrow gates

268
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,020
 that leads to life.

269
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,940
 Our goal is to discover that Jesus is the way,

270
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,060
 the truth, and the life,

271
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,580
 that no one comes to the Father except through him.

272
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,580
 And what I've realized is it's only

273
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,780
 when we learn to be like Jesus

274
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:14,860
 that we can truly live out and practice forgiveness

275
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,960
 as God intended it to be.

276
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:21,420
 If we just learn how to forgive

277
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,300
 without learning how to be like Jesus,

278
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,180
 then we've missed the point.

279
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,860
 So we're gonna open up Scripture,

280
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,980
 and the passage we're gonna look at today

281
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,780
 will remind us of this ultimate goal in our life,

282
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,740
 and it will challenge us to follow it.

283
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:41,740
 Matthew 16, verses 24 to 26, Jesus says this.

284
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,340
 Jesus said to his disciples,

285
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,820
 "Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves

286
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,860
 "and take up their cross and follow me.

287
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,720
 "For whoever wants to save their life will lose it,

288
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,620
 "but whoever loses their life for me will find it.

289
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,460
 "What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world

290
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,260
 "yet forfeit their soul?

291
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:06,860
 "Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?"

292
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:12,140
 We like to talk about the benefits of following Jesus,

293
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,340
 and it's good, and it's great,

294
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:16,340
 and forgiveness is one of those great benefits that we get

295
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,860
 when we give our lives to the Lord.

296
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,820
 Once we accept Jesus as our savior,

297
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,140
 we believe that our sins are forgiven

298
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:26,300
 and that we are what is called justified.

299
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,380
 The basic idea of being justified means

300
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,860
 that because of God's forgiveness,

301
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,020
 our sin is no longer on record.

302
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:37,020
 He blots it out, the debt of sin has been paid,

303
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,100
 which means that when God looks at us,

304
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,460
 he doesn't see sin, instead what he sees

305
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,400
 is one who is clean and pure.

306
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,400
 You can think of it as someone as if,

307
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,300
 just as if they had never sinned

308
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,800
 because of what Jesus has done for us.

309
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,400
 But notice though, this is not totally free.

310
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,480
 Of course it's free for you and me,

311
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,160
 but it came at the great cost of Jesus' life.

312
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,000
 And because it came at a great cost,

313
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,880
 like I've been saying, we cannot treat it cheaply.

314
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,680
 We cannot treat it with contempt.

315
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,080
 Because if we do this with cheapened forgiveness,

316
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,280
 you know, you're like me,

317
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,760
 you like seeking for coins and coupons at Wagamama's, right?

318
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,120
 We just use it whenever we need.

319
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,440
 And we have to realize that forgiveness is free for everyone

320
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,360
 only because Jesus paid the price in the first place.

321
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,880
 Right, the price we could not pay for ourselves.

322
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,260
 Now, it is available to all,

323
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,960
 but what we're looking at today

324
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,520
 is that there are certain conditions God gives us

325
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:47,520
 in order to properly embrace this free gift and his benefits.

326
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,120
 The point of forgiveness is not just to comfort you,

327
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,560
 to make you feel better,

328
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,320
 for you to go back and do the same thing over and over again.

329
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,960
 Forgiveness from God is meant to change you,

330
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,520
 to mold you, to encourage you to become more like him.

331
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,360
 In other words, if you really want to know

332
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,240
 the benefits of forgiveness,

333
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,520
 you must become a disciple of Jesus.

334
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,800
 And when it comes to the journey of discipleship,

335
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,440
 when it comes to being like Jesus,

336
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,720
 it comes with a cost, it comes with a change to your life.

337
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,640
 Right, this makes sense.

338
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,080
 This only makes, because if not,

339
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,520
 anyone else, anyone could call themselves a Christian,

340
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,120
 right, and just keep living however you want,

341
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,440
 and just keep asking for God's forgiveness.

342
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,320
 But don't you see again,

343
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,280
 that's cheapening what forgiveness is.

344
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,920
 If you want to call yourself a Christian,

345
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,840
 if you want to truly profess

346
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,720
 that you are following Jesus with your life,

347
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,200
 it's going to come at a cost to us as well.

348
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,560
 And there are things you're gonna have to be changed

349
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:00,200
 in your life in order to live as a disciple of Jesus.

350
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,600
 So what does it cost for us to follow Jesus?

351
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,800
 Well, let's go back to the passage

352
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,960
 and find out what it tells us.

353
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,520
 Verse 24, Jesus starts by saying this.

354
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,080
 If anyone would come after me,

355
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,280
 anyone, this message is for anyone.

356
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,200
 Anyone means anyone, right?

357
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,680
 This means you, this means me, this one, anyone,

358
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,840
 who's listening to this right now, anyone.

359
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,840
 It's an open invitation to all people

360
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,080
 because God wants everybody to follow him.

361
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:36,440
 But also notice the word if.

362
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,760
 If anybody.

363
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,360
 If means this is a choice.

364
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,040
 If you want to do this, this is what it's gonna take.

365
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,400
 Jesus always gives us a choice, right?

366
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,520
 He's not gonna drag you, kicking and screaming.

367
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,720
 That's not free will, that's not free choice,

368
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,160
 that's not real love.

369
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,240
 He's asking us to make a decision.

370
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,160
 If we want to come after him,

371
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,960
 these are the things that we're gonna have to do.

372
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,160
 And he's about to explain there are some requirements, right?

373
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,840
 We're gonna deep dive deep into the definition

374
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,960
 of what it means to follow Jesus.

375
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,840
 And I'll tell you right now, right,

376
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,360
 it's not just coming to Sunday service.

377
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,240
 It's more than just giving an offering or a tithe.

378
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,720
 It's more than just volunteering

379
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,440
 or being a part of a community group,

380
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,640
 as great as those things are.

381
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,760
 So the one serious question we have to ask ourselves,

382
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,480
 maybe the most serious question you'll ever ask yourself

383
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,160
 in your life is this.

384
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,320
 Do you want to go after Jesus?

385
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:39,640
 Do you want to be a disciple of the Lord?

386
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,160
 Because if you say yes,

387
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:47,640
 following Jesus is gonna drastically change your life.

388
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,080
 If you say yes, I'm about to teach us

389
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,920
 what we need in order to follow him.

390
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,720
 Or Jesus is about to teach us.

391
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,160
 So he says this, firstly, we must deny ourselves,

392
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,880
 deny himself, deny herself.

393
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,640
 The first step of deciding to follow Jesus

394
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,360
 is to deny yourself.

395
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,680
 Now, what does this mean?

396
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,080
 Right, it's more than just self-control.

397
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,440
 It's more than just, ooh, I'm not gonna have

398
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,600
 that last piece of cake that's on the table, right?

399
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,840
 That's not really what it means

400
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,480
 when it calls denying yourself.

401
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,240
 No, denying yourself is talking about the full

402
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,240
 and total surrender of your entire life into Jesus' hands.

403
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,040
 Okay, hang on a sec, 'cause we live in a day,

404
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,280
 think about this for a sec, okay?

405
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,280
 We live in a day and age where the prevailing mindset

406
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:42,080
 seems to be you can and you should have whatever you want.

407
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,400
 This world tells us to take control of your life.

408
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,600
 You can do whatever you want,

409
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,880
 you just have to take control of your destiny.

410
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,720
 It's up to you, follow your heart, do all that stuff.

411
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,720
 And there's this belief out there that teaches us

412
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,360
 that we are so in control of our lives

413
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,760
 that you can truly have anything you want can be yours

414
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,200
 if you could only manifest it.

415
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,640
 Right, you guys heard about manifesting?

416
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,600
 Right, this idea of making everything you want

417
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,200
 and to feel and experience into a reality for yourself.

418
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,280
 And you can do this apparently through your thoughts,

419
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,960
 actions, beliefs, and emotions.

420
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,960
 In other words, the world teaches us,

421
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,520
 deny yourself nothing.

422
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,000
 But if it makes you feel good,

423
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,080
 if you think that's what's good for you,

424
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,920
 go and do whatever you want to do.

425
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,320
 Listen, okay?

426
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,360
 This sounds good, it sounds attractive.

427
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,360
 Do whatever you want, have whatever you want,

428
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,240
 deny yourself no pleasures, all right?

429
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,800
 I admit it does sound good.

430
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,560
 Right, some preachers out there might even say,

431
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,440
 you know, this is the life God wants for you.

432
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,160
 Bliss, happiness, all those things, right?

433
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,320
 Blessings all the time.

434
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,200
 But church, this is a lie.

435
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,400
 Right, think about it for a minute.

436
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,320
 If life was all about making yourself happy,

437
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,800
 then why would we need God at all?

438
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,040
 If life was just about pleasing yourself

439
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,200
 and you could just manifest everything that you want,

440
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,160
 we wouldn't need God, you'd need God.

441
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:20,280
 So denying yourself is really about discovering

442
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,840
 the true purpose in your life.

443
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,120
 Right, and your purpose is not for the pleasure of yourself.

444
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,680
 Your purpose in life is not to live

445
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,840
 a happy, comfortable life,

446
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,440
 just to die peacefully in your sleep.

447
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,160
 Your purpose in life is not to climb the corporate ladder

448
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,160
 and get to the highest ranks of your profession.

449
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,680
 Your purpose in life is not to find a life partner

450
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,000
 and spend the rest of your life with.

451
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,600
 No, your purpose in life,

452
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,040
 your only purpose in life is to follow Jesus

453
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,960
 by being an image bearer of God.

454
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,600
 Your purpose in life, church,

455
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,720
 no matter what the world says,

456
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,400
 is to worship Jesus with all your heart,

457
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,640
 mind, and strength,

458
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,080
 and to be an example of his love to others.

459
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,520
 Above everything else,

460
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:14,400
 this has to be your ultimate goal in life.

461
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,640
 And for you and I to be able to do that,

462
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,360
 we have to deny ourselves.

463
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,560
 We have to be willing to say,

464
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,600
 "Everything else in my life is gonna take a back seat,

465
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:29,600
 "and I'm gonna be fully dedicated to being more like Jesus."

466
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,200
 Now, I know this sounds extreme.

467
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,040
 It sounds foolish.

468
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,600
 It sounds almost as though Jesus

469
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,720
 is trying to kill all our personalities, right?

470
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,240
 Make everyone act in the same way.

471
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,080
 It sounds as though Jesus is trying to get rid

472
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,200
 of everything that's enjoyable in your life,

473
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,840
 forced you to be grumpy and miserable all the time.

474
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,240
 It sounds a bit like that, I know, right?

475
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,680
 It sounds a bit like Jesus saying,

476
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,240
 "Don't have fun, don't enjoy your life.

477
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,880
 "Just do what I tell you to do."

478
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,480
 But that couldn't be further from the truth.

479
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,600
 There's a story, famous story in the Bible

480
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,000
 of the rich young ruler, right?

481
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,200
 This is a rich young ruler,

482
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,680
 a person who has everything he has in the worldly sense.

483
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,520
 And he encounters Jesus,

484
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,680
 and he's actually interested in following Jesus.

485
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,880
 But when Jesus challenges him to deny himself

486
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,600
 of his significant wealth and possessions

487
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,320
 so that he could follow him, he couldn't do it.

488
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,520
 And the Bible, Scripture tells us he walked away

489
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,320
 grieved in his heart,

490
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,040
 even though he was still holding on

491
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,960
 to everything that he ever wanted.

492
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,640
 On the other hand, when Zacchaeus,

493
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,920
 also a wealthy man, who was interested in following Jesus,

494
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,400
 when he encounters Jesus, he realizes his sin,

495
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,840
 and he willingly gives up and denies himself his wealth,

496
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,200
 even paying back four times as much

497
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,320
 that he had taken from other people.

498
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,120
 And in his case, Jesus declares,

499
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:56,200
 "Salvation has come to this house today."

500
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,560
 The one who was willing to deny himself

501
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,680
 discovered the meaning of life.

502
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,640
 The one who was not willing to deny himself

503
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,720
 walked away from the giver of life.

504
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,400
 So church, let me remind us today,

505
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,600
 denying yourself, surrendering fully

506
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,160
 to anything Jesus wants you to do

507
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,320
 is the first step we have to take

508
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,680
 in the life that you were meant to live,

509
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,440
 the life of following Jesus.

510
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,960
 But then how do we do it?

511
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:30,240
 How do we do this thing to deny ourselves?

512
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,160
 It's not just a matter of strong will and self-discipline.

513
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,880
 It's gonna take more than that.

514
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,360
 We can achieve a lot of things

515
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,680
 through strong will and discipline.

516
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,560
 I've done two marathons and two trail walkers

517
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,400
 with zero training, literally, I'm not joking,

518
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,680
 based only on my will.

519
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,520
 I kept going.

520
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,880
 It took me like five and a half hours

521
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,760
 to finish the first marathon.

522
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,920
 I was limping across the finish line.

523
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,320
 I just kept myself, just keep going.

524
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,520
 Don't get on that bus, just keep going, okay?

525
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,480
 No training, though.

526
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,320
 I don't recommend it.

527
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,280
 I was dead the next day, okay?

528
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,560
 But that's not the tactic, right?

529
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,040
 This isn't just like grit your teeth

530
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,920
 and I'm gonna deny myself and keep going, keep going.

531
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,320
 It actually takes even more than that.

532
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:18,440
 This is not a call to self-discipline, church.

533
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,360
 This is a call to death.

534
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,560
 Because Jesus says the next step is to pick up the cross.

535
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,920
 Pick up your cross.

536
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,800
 Now again, the idea of picking up your cross,

537
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,800
 it's sort of a teaching that's been cheapened

538
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,120
 by the world's thinking.

539
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,080
 When we hear this phrase, right, it's sort of cutesy.

540
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,600
 Like, you know, I'm gonna pick up my cross

541
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,520
 like a little bird and I have to bear.

542
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,840
 Okay, for example, you know, the gout in my toe.

543
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,280
 You know, every time I have a beer, the gout flares up.

544
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,720
 You know, so, you know, my cross to bear

545
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,240
 is this gout in my toe.

546
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,880
 Or maybe it's an annoying coworker.

547
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,720
 He's like, you know, I have to work

548
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,040
 next to Philip Choi every day.

549
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,840
 You know, so like, picking up my cross

550
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,560
 is having to work next to Philip all the time, okay?

551
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,160
 But it's not that, okay?

552
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:04,440
 The cross is more than just an annoyance.

553
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,840
 The cross was an instrument of death.

554
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,000
 So picking up your cross is not just,

555
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,280
 it's not just, you know, annoyance you have to deal with.

556
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,320
 Picking up your cross means denying yourself

557
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,320
 to the point where we think all of our earthly passions,

558
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,840
 our sinful desires, our past life

559
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,800
 is crucified and put to death.

560
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,920
 Taking up your cross means not only to deny yourself,

561
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,880
 but it means to die to yourself.

562
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,040
 Bonhoeffer, in his book, "The Cost of Discipleship,"

563
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,320
 I recommend all of us read it, says it this way.

564
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,240
 When Christ calls a man or woman,

565
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,600
 he bids him to come and die.

566
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,720
 You see, if we just stopped at denying ourselves, right?

567
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,440
 That stuff is still sort of there,

568
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,680
 like lurking in the background, right?

569
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,800
 And the danger is there's always a risk

570
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,920
 of us running back to it, right?

571
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,280
 Because as messed up as it is,

572
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,760
 there's a sort of a safety that we feel

573
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,280
 when we hide in sin, right?

574
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,840
 I know it's messed up, but we feel that, you know?

575
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,800
 And so we can't just be denying it

576
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,960
 and leaving that stuff there.

577
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,840
 Scripture doesn't just tell us to resist sin.

578
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,240
 That's just the first step.

579
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,560
 Scripture tells us to put the sin

580
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,240
 in our old lives to death.

581
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,760
 Time and time again, it reminds us of this.

582
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,960
 Galatians 5:24, "Those who belong to Jesus Christ

583
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,800
 "have been," what?

584
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,480
 "Crucified," right?

585
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,360
 "The flesh with its passions and its desires."

586
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,760
 Romans 6:11, "In the same way, count yourselves," listen,

587
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:37,680
 "dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus."

588
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,000
 Matthew 5, Jesus himself,

589
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,080
 "If your right eye causes you to stumble,

590
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,520
 "gouge it out and," do what?

591
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,760
 "Throw it away.

592
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,480
 "If your right hand causes you to stumble,

593
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,880
 "cut it off and throw it away."

594
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,320
 2 Corinthians 5, "So then, if anyone in Christ,

595
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:57,560
 "he is a new creation, what is old has passed away."

596
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,760
 Look, what is new has come.

597
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,640
 You get the point?

598
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,920
 Without dying to ourselves, there is always the risk

599
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,920
 of going back and doing things according to our own flesh,

600
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,360
 to our own agenda.

601
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,520
 We're gonna want to say no when God says yes.

602
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,200
 We're going to want to stop when God says go.

603
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,200
 We're gonna say I'm not ready when God says,

604
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,240
 "I need you to do this for me."

605
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,520
 And the attachments we have to the things of this world

606
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,120
 will try and tie us down and stop us

607
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,840
 from living a life with Jesus.

608
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,640
 See, the point is not for Jesus to give you

609
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,560
 a better version of your life now.

610
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,120
 What Jesus is offering when we come and follow him

611
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:42,000
 is a brand new life, a whole new life.

612
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,960
 And in order for you to have a new life,

613
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,120
 your old life has to die.

614
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,240
 This is why we call coming to Christ to be born again.

615
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,680
 This is why the Bible tells us that we are buried within

616
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,040
 by baptism into what?

617
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,880
 Death, in order that just as Christ was risen from the dead

618
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,920
 for the glory of the Father,

619
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:04,440
 we too might walk in newness of life, Romans 6, 4.

620
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:09,520
 Does your heart resonate with this, brothers and sisters?

621
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,000
 Is your desire to know Jesus, even in his death,

622
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 and going to the cross your number one priority in life?

623
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,880
 Are you willing not only to deny,

624
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,800
 but to die and throw away your old life

625
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,240
 so that you may know and follow Jesus?

626
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,440
 And I know I'm repeating myself,

627
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,880
 and it's beginning to sound a bit radical and extreme.

628
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,240
 And even as I was preparing for this,

629
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,960
 I was, "Allison, you know, it's not that serious.

630
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,080
 "You gotta chill with this stuff."

631
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,760
 But it's actually not that radical.

632
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,000
 This is the norm.

633
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,920
 This is what Jesus expects for us as followers of him.

634
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,080
 Can we be like Paul and proclaim,

635
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,640
 "I resolve to know nothing

636
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,760
 "except Jesus Christ and him crucified."

637
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:04,120
 Without dying to our old life,

638
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:09,120
 we will never be able to embrace the new life offered to us,

639
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:16,320
 a life where Jesus now says, "Come and follow me."

640
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:24,720
 This now becomes our only purpose in life, to follow Jesus.

641
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,800
 Not chasing whatever feels good, not satisfying our flesh,

642
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,360
 but our aim after old life has been crucified.

643
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,520
 We're not left aimless and pointless

644
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,160
 wandering around in this world.

645
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,400
 Once our old life has been crucified,

646
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,920
 we can wholeheartedly, single-mindedly

647
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,640
 live our new life of following Jesus.

648
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,600
 This is what discipleship means.

649
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,560
 This is what we mean when we talk

650
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,400
 about growing big people here at the Vine,

651
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,560
 people who have denied their old lives to the point of death

652
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:58,560
 so that they can follow Jesus with nothing holding them back.

653
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,280
 This is gonna be the cost, church.

654
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,480
 This is the reaction, this is the decision

655
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,080
 that Jesus is seeking when he calls us to follow him.

656
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,720
 And if we really want to experience

657
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,360
 his forgiveness over our lives,

658
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,040
 then this is what's required of us,

659
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:21,040
 to deny yourself, to pick up your cross, and to follow him.

660
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,200
 So let me ask this again.

661
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,080
 Do we really want to do this?

662
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,680
 Do we want to follow Jesus?

663
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:34,200
 Because there is a cost.

664
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,840
 There are things that are gonna have to change in our lives.

665
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,320
 A life with Jesus will mean discipline.

666
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,600
 It is gonna mean denying yourself to the point of death,

667
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:48,120
 putting your old sin to life, putting your old life to death.

668
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,600
 It might mean suffering for the Lord.

669
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,200
 It might mean the risk of persecution.

670
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,720
 It might mean being misunderstood by people around you.

671
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,680
 It might mean being whole, it will mean

672
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:06,880
 being wholeheartedly obedient to him and him alone.

673
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:12,360
 It's going to mean walking by faith and not by sight.

674
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,080
 It's going to mean loving your neighbors

675
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,280
 as you've loved yourself.

676
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,880
 It's going to mean loving your enemies even.

677
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,240
 It's going to mean standing up for justice.

678
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,760
 It's gonna mean loving those others have deemed as sinners.

679
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,720
 It's gonna require sacrificial giving.

680
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,680
 It means looking after the widows and the orphans.

681
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:38,240
 It means going down the narrow, more difficult road.

682
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,240
 It means dropping everything as the disciples did

683
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,720
 at the sound of his voice.

684
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,800
 It's gonna mean putting him above all else.

685
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,160
 It's gonna mean meditating and spending time

686
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,000
 marinating in God's word.

687
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,360
 It's gonna mean thinking about things that are pure,

688
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,960
 things that are noble, things that are true.

689
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,800
 It means committing yourself to the church,

690
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,240
 the body of Christ, serving him in this way.

691
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,320
 It's gonna mean forgiving others as Jesus has forgiven you.

692
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,400
 It's gonna mean loving your wife

693
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,040
 as Christ has loved the church.

694
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,720
 It's gonna mean praying for your husband daily.

695
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,520
 It's gonna mean teaching your children

696
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,440
 in the way that they should go.

697
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:20,400
 It comes at a great sacrifice to us,

698
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,280
 a great cost to us, it has to.

699
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,440
 But it will also mean this.

700
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,520
 It means freedom from sin and darkness.

701
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:33,960
 It means joy, true joy in your life.

702
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,600
 It's gonna mean being surrounded by a community

703
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,280
 that truly loves you.

704
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,400
 It's going to mean a life full of the power

705
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,200
 of the Holy Spirit.

706
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,800
 It's gonna mean seeing miracles, signs and wonders,

707
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,360
 things that only God can do.

708
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,360
 It means being filled with wonder and worship.

709
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,960
 Every time you look up at the night sky,

710
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,120
 you can think to yourself, what an amazing God I serve.

711
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,680
 Look at the God who made the universe

712
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,720
 and he loves me as well.

713
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:04,560
 It's going to mean a life full of purpose and direction.

714
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:08,120
 It's going to mean a life that's not governed by fear,

715
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,120
 but directed by God's love.

716
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:14,560
 It will mean a life that's free from shame and guilt.

717
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,720
 It's going to mean enjoying God's blessings

718
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,560
 whenever he chooses to bless us with those.

719
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:24,160
 It's gonna mean whole, healthy families and societies.

720
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,040
 It's going to mean discovering the true purpose

721
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,480
 of what your life is on this earth.

722
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:34,520
 It means Jesus becoming the one

723
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,880
 and only significance for your life.

724
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,960
 And he is the only thing that is worth living for.

725
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,800
 But this is a choice.

726
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:49,480
 Like I said at the beginning, it's a question of if.

727
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,000
 Which is why Jesus also gives us

728
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,600
 some very clear consequences of what life might turn out like

729
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,040
 if we don't choose to follow him.

730
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:04,480
 He says this, "For whoever would save his life will lose it.

731
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,960
 "But whoever loses his life for my sake will find it."

732
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,240
 What Jesus is trying to say is this.

733
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,200
 The more you try to control your own life,

734
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,440
 the more you try to live life on your own terms,

735
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,640
 the more you refuse to deal with the sin

736
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,040
 and darkness that's in your life,

737
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,400
 the more you hold on to vengeance and retribution,

738
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,320
 the more you try to save yourself and be your own savior,

739
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,280
 you will lose your life.

740
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,960
 And I know, I was trying to come up

741
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,920
 with a cute illustration for this.

742
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,640
 At the end of the day, I don't think there is one.

743
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,720
 It's one of those things you have to say,

744
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,240
 if you know, you know.

745
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,760
 Because in the wisdom of the world,

746
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,720
 this doesn't make sense.

747
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,080
 In the way the world thinks, this doesn't make sense.

748
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,200
 The world tells us, look after yourself first,

749
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,720
 take control of your life, you know,

750
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,200
 have your life plans and goals,

751
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,520
 and all those things are good, right?

752
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,680
 And I'm not dogging on life plans

753
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,920
 and all those kind of things.

754
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,000
 Please don't hear me wrong, right?

755
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,600
 This isn't a call into self-abuse.

756
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,480
 It's not about that.

757
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,680
 But what we're saying is this.

758
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:18,560
 When Jesus calls someone into the journey of discipleship,

759
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,960
 it's not just suffering for the sake of suffering.

760
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,000
 It's not just following for the sake of following.

761
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,520
 But he calls us because he says,

762
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,880
 no one can have two masters, right?

763
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,720
 You'll either love one or hate the other.

764
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,600
 He calls us to love the Lord our God

765
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,720
 with all our heart, mind, soul, and strength.

766
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,000
 And we'll never be able to do this

767
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,920
 if we're still holding on to our own vision for our lives.

768
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:48,720
 And yes, I know, like I said, it doesn't make sense,

769
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,680
 but that is actually how it's supposed to be.

770
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:56,080
 Don't be so foolish to be deceived

771
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,920
 by this world's way of thinking

772
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,400
 that the world's way of doing things

773
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,600
 is the right way of doing things.

774
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,600
 Scripture reminds us, and it's counterintuitive,

775
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,120
 it's countercultural.

776
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,720
 It's foolishness from the world's perspective.

777
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,720
 But the foolishness of God is wiser than human,

778
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,320
 and it's the foolishness of human wisdom.

779
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:22,000
 And if it doesn't make sense to you now,

780
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,600
 this will only make sense to you

781
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,200
 when your hearts and minds have been made new.

782
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,760
 When Jesus gives you that new mind

783
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,560
 and that new life that he's promised you

784
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,200
 once you decide to deny yourself,

785
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,200
 pick up his cross, and follow him.

786
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,680
 And once you receive this new life,

787
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,680
 you see the freedom and the fruit and the purpose

788
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,360
 wholeheartedly devoted to Jesus.

789
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:49,320
 Jesus tells us this way in Matthew chapter 13.

790
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,240
 Following Jesus is like discovering treasure

791
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,800
 that's hidden in a field.

792
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,080
 When a man found it, he hid it again,

793
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:01,080
 then in his joy went and sold, gave up everything he had

794
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:05,280
 and bought the field so that he could have the treasure.

795
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,680
 Again, the kingdom of heaven, following Jesus

796
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,920
 is like a merchant looking for fine pearls.

797
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,080
 When he found one of great value,

798
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:17,080
 he went away, sold everything he had, and bought that pearl.

799
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:20,800
 If you want to know purpose in life,

800
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,960
 if you want to know why God has put you on this earth,

801
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,720
 the only way to find out is to give him

802
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,040
 everything you've got.

803
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,960
 Following him will cost you everything, church.

804
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,680
 That is true.

805
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,720
 There are no half measures in this journey.

806
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,040
 It's sink or swim.

807
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:46,040
 But when you give everything you've got to Jesus,

808
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:50,240
 he promises to give us life

809
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,760
 and life in the fullest in return.

810
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,800
 So how does this relate back to forgiveness?

811
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,280
 See, this is why forgiveness is important for us

812
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,240
 as followers of Jesus.

813
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,840
 This is because it can't just be the get out of jail

814
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,520
 free card that we need to use whenever we mess up.

815
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:14,120
 Because forgiveness isn't about cheap grace.

816
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,160
 Forgiveness is about God using it as a way

817
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,760
 to guide and shape and mold us,

818
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,120
 to help us to die to ourselves in order to follow him.

819
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,440
 He knows that along the way it's gonna be difficult.

820
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,800
 He knows that along the way that we're gonna stumble

821
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,880
 and fall, we're gonna sin, we're gonna mess up.

822
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,200
 He knows all that stuff.

823
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,000
 But this is why he gave us his forgiveness.

824
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,160
 Not to use as a way to abuse it,

825
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:44,200
 but to use as a way for him to encourage us,

826
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,040
 to help us along in this journey,

827
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,320
 to say, hey, it's okay, child.

828
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,280
 That's what Jesus is saying.

829
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,800
 Every time we met, I see you, I love you.

830
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,600
 Now let's pick yourself back up.

831
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,920
 I forgive you.

832
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,120
 Keep going.

833
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,400
 Keep walking towards me.

834
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,360
 Keep coming towards me.

835
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,000
 My forgiveness will always be there for you

836
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,600
 if you're willing to take this journey with me.

837
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:12,920
 Without forgiveness, our journey to be more like Jesus

838
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,560
 would not be possible.

839
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:19,200
 But with forgiveness, it becomes this beautiful,

840
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,920
 amazing thing that we can embrace and hold,

841
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,320
 knowing that even if we mess up along the way,

842
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,400
 God's grace is there to catch us

843
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,560
 and to encourage us on this journey

844
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,080
 towards discipleship with him.

845
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,240
 So you see this church, all this, right?

846
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,680
 All these prayers we have about forgiveness.

847
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:41,680
 I don't see it as just about forgiveness.

848
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,800
 I see these prayers, I see these things

849
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,400
 are being written out as a hard cry,

850
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,680
 not to be better at forgiving, but to be more like Jesus.

851
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,360
 Right, we want to deal with these things.

852
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,840
 We want to have forgiveness in our lives.

853
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,440
 We want to be rid of the darkness and the sin

854
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,200
 and the chains that hold us back,

855
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,120
 all these things that we've been holding us.

856
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,000
 We want to give them to the Lord to be free of them

857
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,400
 so that we can be a church that wholeheartedly follows him.

858
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:12,720
 So let's not cheapen forgiveness, church.

859
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:18,920
 In order for Jesus to forgive us, it cost him his life.

860
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:22,920
 So it's only fitting that if we want to live

861
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,640
 in his grace and forgiveness,

862
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:29,720
 if we want to know the true meaning of our lives,

863
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:32,400
 then we have to give that to him as well.

864
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,440
 This is the kind of people he's looking for.

865
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,960
 So don't wait.

866
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,880
 This is my last encouragement for you.

867
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:46,000
 Today, if you've been reminded that Jesus asked you

868
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 to follow him with all your life, make that decision now.

869
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,240
 Do it now.

870
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:57,280
 'Cause the last danger is we might be sitting here

871
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,560
 thinking, oh, you know, it's okay.

872
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,040
 I have time, right?

873
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,840
 There's still things I want to do.

874
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,440
 There's still goals in life I haven't achieved.

875
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,200
 You know, there's still certain things I want to experience

876
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,800
 before giving my life to Jesus.

877
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,760
 And so let me go and do those things first.

878
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,840
 And then I might come and think about following Jesus.

879
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:22,160
 I urge you, church, there is no time to delay.

880
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,000
 Do not delay.

881
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,400
 Don't be like that foolish person in the parable

882
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,800
 who says to themselves, you know,

883
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,320
 I'm gonna take life easy, eat, drink, and be merry,

884
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,560
 just live my life until the right time

885
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,720
 comes to respond to Jesus.

886
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,680
 Only for God to respond to him, you fool.

887
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,360
 This very night, your life will be demanded from you.

888
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:47,520
 I don't say that to scare us or to try and guilt you

889
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,760
 or to try and manipulate your thinking,

890
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,640
 but this is the truth.

891
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:55,080
 We don't know how long we have life on this earth.

892
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:01,800
 Jesus is coming back or your life could be over

893
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,640
 at any moment.

894
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:07,640
 So today, right now, in this moment,

895
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:11,200
 this is the time to make your decision,

896
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,440
 to decide to follow him,

897
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,400
 to decide that you're done with your old life,

898
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,880
 to pick up that cross and discover

899
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,880
 that only through Jesus will you ever discover

900
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,440
 the amazing journey, the amazing fullness of life

901
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,280
 that he has promised to you.

902
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:32,000
 It's going to take pain, it's going to take sacrifice,

903
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,840
 it's going to take you following him

904
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,640
 with everything you've got.

905
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:43,240
 Until we see Jesus face to face,

906
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:47,080
 this is the road that we've been called to follow.

907
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:52,120
 So church, I ask you, will we be that generation?

908
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:56,160
 Can we be that body of Christ who takes Jesus seriously

909
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,760
 at his word to live for him and him alone?

910
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:04,240
 Will we cherish forgiveness so much

911
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:10,120
 that we use it, that we let it shape us

912
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:14,440
 and guide us and mold us, not to do whatever we want,

913
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,640
 but into becoming more like our savior?

914
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:21,360
 If you would close your eyes, church,

915
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:25,640
 I wonder if you would just reflect

916
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,320
 and think about the challenge

917
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:30,000
 the Lord has set before us today.

918
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:43,920
 Yeah, maybe we're in this room

919
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,880
 and there are chains that have been holding us

920
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,080
 and there is sin in our life

921
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,600
 that we haven't dealt with yet.

922
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,000
 (soft music)

923
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:59,480
 And God's forgiveness is on offer, it is.

924
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,960
 It's there for you today.

925
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:08,480
 But he wants to help you deal with that,

926
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,720
 not to go back to it, but to be free from it.

927
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:17,320
 And so Lord, for anyone in that space,

928
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,880
 Lord, I pray for freedom from sin.

929
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,320
 I pray that as we bring these things before you,

930
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:29,840
 the strongholds, the chains that were once holding us,

931
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:34,000
 Lord, would be released, would be broken,

932
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,400
 that the enemy would flee

933
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:42,640
 so that we can take the first step forward.

934
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,120
 Or maybe even just the first glance,

935
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:50,000
 the first look at you, to look towards you for direction,

936
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,280
 for help, for new life.

937
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:57,240
 And maybe some of us in this room

938
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:01,360
 have made that decision to follow you.

939
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,800
 And in our heart, in our minds,

940
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,520
 we've said, yes, this is what we want to do.

941
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:11,000
 But it is really hard.

942
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,920
 I know it's hard to put you above everything else.

943
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:18,400
 And perhaps we've been distracted

944
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,640
 and we've let things of this world entice us

945
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:26,440
 and to draw us and to distract us into thinking,

946
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,760
 oh, that's my purpose, that's my goal, that's my truth.

947
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:40,800
 Lord, I pray that you would help us see our greater purpose.

948
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:45,360
 That you would meet us in those places

949
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:48,360
 and that we would offer that over to you

950
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:53,360
 and allow you to just take our life wherever you wanted to.

951
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:58,200
 Even it means letting go of some of those things

952
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,000
 or all of those things, we're willing to say,

953
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,640
 Lord, I am willing because I want to follow you more.

954
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:09,880
 For some of us, maybe we're out of luck.

955
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,920
 For some of us, maybe we're our lives right now,

956
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,920
 you would say, it's good actually, dude.

957
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:18,920
 Like, everything's set for once maybe

958
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:24,480
 and it's, you know, I like the way I'm living.

959
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,520
 I'm comfortable.

960
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:33,680
 Maybe the challenge for you today is

961
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:37,560
 for God to speak to you and say, yeah, I see that.

962
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,960
 But what the Lord promises us is so much more

963
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,360
 than just comfort and good.

964
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:49,880
 What the Lord promises us in the life with him

965
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,200
 is fullness of joy,

966
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:58,200
 is purpose, and that it could even be better

967
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,160
 than the thing that you think is good right now.

968
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:04,080
 I guarantee you, Jesus is 10 million gazillion times

969
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,040
 better than that.

970
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:08,920
 If only you would pick up your cross,

971
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:11,840
 deny yourself and truly follow him,

972
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:15,800
 you would discover how amazing life with Jesus is

973
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:19,000
 compared to whatever it is that we're chasing right now.

974
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:27,200
 And so, Jesus, we just lay ourselves bare before you.

975
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,880
 And finally, I just thank you

976
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,240
 that we don't do this in our own power.

977
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:38,440
 That we have the Holy Spirit guiding us, walking with us,

978
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:42,640
 empowering us, strengthening us every single step of the way.

979
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,400
 We are not alone in this journey.

980
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,560
 Holy Spirit goes with us.

981
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,840
 Your brothers and sisters along the journey with you

982
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,400
 go with you to encourage you.

983
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:56,120
 And so, Jesus, help us in this.

984
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:59,840
 I pray that we may deny ourselves,

985
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:06,080
 pick up our cross and live lives that are wholeheartedly

986
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:09,680
 and only dedicated to you and you alone.

987
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,880
 This is our prayer, Lord, in Jesus' name.

988
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,720
 Lord, in Jesus' name.

989
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:18,320
 (gentle music)

990
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,920
 (gentle music)

991
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,520
 (gentle music)

992
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,120
 (gentle music)

993
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,700
 (gentle music)

994
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:30,760
 you
