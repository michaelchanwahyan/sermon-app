1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,920
 So there was this moment that happened for me on my recent walk of the Camino de Santiago

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:16,000
 in Spain that deeply reminds me of what we have just been singing about in that song.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,560
 The Camino is around about 800 kilometers of length.

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,360
 You walk from this place called Saint Jean in France all the way to Santiago de Compostela

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,040
 in the west coast of Spain.

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:32,600
 And as you walk every day, you connect to and walk through and pass multiple Catholic

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,600
 churches.

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,760
 In fact, on any particular given day, you might walk through, say, three to five different

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,960
 villages and every single one of those villages will be centered around some form of church,

10
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,360
 this Catholic church.

11
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,160
 And some of those churches are incredibly beautiful, huge, wonderful buildings, like

12
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,260
 architectural wonders.

13
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:59,760
 Some of those churches are small, rural, almost forgotten churches where maybe inside there's

14
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,480
 nothing more than a couple of pews and a rusty old iron cross.

15
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:10,000
 And I used to love when I was walking the Camino to take every opportunity I could to

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,480
 connect with a church.

17
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,680
 If I was walking past a church, inevitably those churches would be open.

18
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,520
 And most of the time, they were open and no one was in there.

19
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,200
 And so I loved that because it meant that I could go in, have a time of solitude, maybe

20
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,260
 take my backpack off for 10 minutes and just sit there and pray and encounter the presence

21
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,260
 of God.

22
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:34,720
 These churches were like wonderful gifts of solitude as we walked every day.

23
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,840
 Well, on this particular day, I was walking into this small village and I noticed that

24
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,400
 there was a church that was off the trail.

25
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,240
 Now this was somewhat unusual because usually the Camino, the official trail, takes you

26
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,600
 to the center of a village or the center of a town and right up to the big church in the

27
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,760
 center of the town.

28
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,160
 But for whatever reason in this particular village, the Camino path was going straight

29
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:02,160
 ahead and avoiding the little church that was over to the left.

30
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,880
 And I saw it would take me maybe about five or seven minutes to walk over to that church

31
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,600
 and I had time and so I decided, "Okay, look, I'm going to go off the path.

32
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,160
 I'm going to go over there and I'm going to just have my time of solitude in this church."

33
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,640
 So I enter into this church.

34
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,640
 It's a small church.

35
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,360
 It's probably got about maybe, it could seat maybe 50 people in total.

36
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,840
 So a small kind of church.

37
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,880
 As I walk straight in, I'm the only person there or at least I thought I was, but as

38
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,920
 soon as I walk in, I hear this kind of like person get up from sitting down over on the

39
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:36,800
 right side and it's this old nun and she runs up to me with this big smile on her face and

40
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,800
 she's so excited that a pilgrim has entered the church.

41
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,200
 I could tell from her face that she's been waiting a long time for someone to come and

42
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,120
 visit her in her church.

43
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,820
 And she's got this big smile on her face and she literally runs up to me and she grabs

44
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:57,560
 my arms with her little hands and she starts speaking to me excitedly in Spanish.

45
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:04,280
 Now if you know me, you'll know I know nothing of Spanish at all, but in that moment I could

46
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,140
 see her enthusiasm and her joy that I had visited.

47
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,280
 So I didn't want to break her heart by telling her I didn't speak Spanish.

48
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:18,800
 So I just let her talk and as she talked, I followed her nonverbal cues as to pretend

49
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,120
 that I understood her.

50
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,400
 So if she smiled, I would be like, "Oh!"

51
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,200
 If she nodded, I would be like, "Hmm."

52
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,480
 And I basically was trying to pretend like, I think probably after a while she realized

53
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:36,280
 I couldn't speak Spanish, but anyway, she kept going and she was so enthusiastic, so

54
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,280
 excited.

55
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,240
 She grabbed me on the arm and she started to walk me through her church.

56
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:45,400
 Now again, it's not a particularly big church, but there were like paintings and icons all

57
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,280
 over this church as there often are in Catholic churches.

58
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:54,720
 And so she wanted to like show me and tell me in incredibly detailed Spanish all about

59
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,060
 these paintings and the icons.

60
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,320
 And so I'm polite and I'm nice and so I'm following her along and nodding at the right

61
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,280
 times and laughing at the right time.

62
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,880
 We get about halfway around and by this time we're standing at the front where the kind

63
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:13,040
 of nave of the church is and we're standing there and she's talking away and we hear somebody

64
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,320
 else enter the church.

65
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,800
 And so we both kind of turn and sure enough in the entrance of the church, another pilgrim

66
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,800
 walks in.

67
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,800
 Now, this pilgrim, you can tell he's a pilgrim because he's wearing his backpack and everything,

68
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,200
 looks like a pilgrim.

69
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,360
 He's probably in his late 50s, early 60s.

70
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,960
 And he comes in and he stands literally inside the entrance of the church and he starts to

71
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,220
 weep.

72
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:39,520
 Now this is not just like your standard kind of like a couple of tears, a little bit embarrassed,

73
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,400
 sort of, "Oh, I don't really mean to be crying here at the moment," kind of tears.

74
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:51,080
 This was like a wailing kind of mourning, kind of gnashing of teeth, kind of very loud

75
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,960
 sort of sobbing that this man was doing.

76
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:01,840
 The nun stares up at me and her eyes are filled with this beautiful picture of compassion

77
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:08,200
 and she leaves me straight away and I don't know if you have ever seen a nun run.

78
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,200
 But if you ever get the chance to see a nun run, I highly recommend it.

79
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:17,580
 She leaves me and she hitches up like the skirt of her habit and she runs down the center

80
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,080
 of the church to this man.

81
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,220
 She runs up to him and embraces him in this big hug.

82
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:29,240
 And then she gingerly and tenderly walks him and sits him down in one of the pews and she

83
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,880
 begins to pray for him.

84
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:37,280
 And there is this profound moment that something is happening in this little church that no

85
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,520
 one perhaps expected.

86
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:46,500
 And that moment of great compassion of hers and the running towards the one in need filled

87
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,960
 and stirred compassion in me.

88
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,920
 And I remember feeling to myself like I just came in here to connect with Jesus, but actually

89
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,840
 now is a chance for me to be pastoral.

90
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:00,680
 And so I walked, I didn't run, I walked down the church and I came up against the man and

91
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,160
 I just gently placed my hand on his shoulder and I began to pray.

92
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,720
 And the nun is praying fervently for him and he's loudly wailing and crying.

93
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:17,600
 And I didn't know anything about this man at that moment, but a few days later I discovered

94
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:23,980
 that he was a Portuguese man and he had been a homicide detective for 20 years.

95
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:29,240
 And he was walking the Camino just as he is retired, he's walking the Camino to purge

96
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,720
 the evil that he had seen out of himself over 20 years.

97
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,640
 And something happened in that moment where he walks into that church, the Holy Spirit

98
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:44,320
 meets with him and we have this profound encounter together.

99
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:51,600
 And as we're standing there praying over him, we're praying in human languages that are

100
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:58,160
 mixed and only partially understood, but we're also praying in a heart and emotional language

101
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,960
 that is clear and fully understood, perhaps more understood than any other language can

102
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,960
 be.

103
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,920
 And that's the universal language of unadulterated love.

104
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,920
 Love.

105
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:20,600
 I wonder if you've ever tried to describe love or try to find words to explain to somebody

106
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,600
 what love is.

107
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:27,040
 It's actually really hard, isn't it, to kind of use language to try to describe a factual

108
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,680
 or logical understanding of what love is.

109
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:36,160
 But when we're swept up in a moment of love, when love breaks through barriers and begins

110
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:43,000
 to do what only love can do, well, it lifts something in us as human beings, doesn't it?

111
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:50,160
 It creates something within us and it binds us together as humans like nothing ever can.

112
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:56,840
 There are three strangers who don't even speak the same language can find a deeper connection

113
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,600
 than in any other time.

114
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:05,240
 When love breaks through, humans become just the way they were created to be.

115
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,040
 It's interesting.

116
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:14,200
 I wonder if you've ever thought of love that way, that love actually makes us truly human,

117
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:21,040
 that the moments of pure love are our most natural and rawest moments as human beings.

118
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:26,720
 There's a lot of talk right now about AI and about the future of AI and particularly about

119
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,960
 the future of humanity swept up in this kind of formation and forming and shaping of what

120
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,440
 humanity will look like in the future because of AI.

121
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,440
 And I think there's a lot of things to be excited for with this development of AI, as

122
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,680
 well as perhaps some things for us to be cautious about.

123
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,520
 But here's one thing I do know.

124
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:52,240
 There is one thing that no matter how advanced AI may become, it will never be able to do.

125
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,280
 And that is the love.

126
00:08:54,280 --> 00:09:01,920
 You see, I'm convinced that love is our unique contribution to the world that sets us apart

127
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,280
 as human beings who are made in the image of God.

128
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,120
 Isn't that a beautiful thought?

129
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,980
 That love might be the one thing that sets us apart.

130
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:17,520
 That love might be the unique thing that has been placed inside of us to help us to contribute

131
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,040
 something to this incredible creation that God has made.

132
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:28,320
 Could it be that love is able to do what no algorithm could ever predict or do?

133
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,880
 I've been in those moments, maybe you have too, where love immediately shifts a very

134
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,640
 difficult conversation.

135
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,920
 Where love brings new hope into what was thought to be a lost cause.

136
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,400
 Where love actually changes the dynamics of a relationship in a moment.

137
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:52,360
 Or perhaps where love actually bridges the divide of hatred or ignorance.

138
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:58,440
 When we are swept up in those moments of love, we know that the world can actually change.

139
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,300
 We know that those moments of love shift and change things in a way that, like I say, no

140
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:07,080
 computer can ever predict or ever do.

141
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,200
 And the reality is also in the reverse.

142
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,280
 You see, strip love from us and we become less than human.

143
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:21,320
 I would say we become programmable animals that are broken and controlled, but place

144
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,320
 love within us.

145
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,440
 And we become the very creatures that we had been created to be.

146
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:36,880
 Human beings filled with vision and imagination and passion and creativity and hope.

147
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:43,760
 And if this is who we've truly been created to be, and if love is the rawest and most

148
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:50,440
 natural form of our expression of what it means to be human, could it be, therefore,

149
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:57,120
 that as the world embraces more of an AI future, this is an opportunity for the world to actually

150
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,080
 become more in love with God?

151
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:06,720
 Because if it is love that is going to set us aside from the computers around us, then

152
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,240
 maybe we should be connecting into the source of that love more than ever.

153
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,200
 The Bible is very clear where that source comes from.

154
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,240
 It says God is love.

155
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,440
 It doesn't say God does love.

156
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:23,240
 It doesn't say God has this kind of, you know, sort of program to love things.

157
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:28,560
 It says the actual very nature and essence of who God is, is love.

158
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,920
 And because he is love, he has first loved us.

159
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:37,320
 And because he's first loved us, our love then is a response to the love that's been

160
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,720
 placed within us from him.

161
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,520
 And if it is love that makes us the most naturally human that we can possibly be, and if in an

162
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:49,060
 AI future we want to retain our humanity, then it follows, does it not, that we need

163
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:52,800
 to be connecting into the source of where that love comes from.

164
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,160
 I'm excited that the future that may well get more AI is an opportunity for the church

165
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:05,920
 to rise up and say, "Hey, there's one who is able to give us what no computer ever can."

166
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,640
 Love like that remains.

167
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,480
 Which is fascinating because although Paul, the apostle Paul, writing to the church in

168
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:20,000
 Corinth had no idea about AI whatsoever, he saw a church that was struggling to truly

169
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 love.

170
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,160
 In fact, he saw a church that was actually fighting each other, a church that was actually

171
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,880
 treating each other incredibly poorly, and so he decides to write to them in the heart

172
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:35,120
 of his letter, chapters 12, 13, and 14 of 1 Corinthians, and talk to them about the

173
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,240
 attitudes and the behaviors and the ways in which they were expressing their humanity

174
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,800
 towards one another.

175
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,560
 And in chapter 12 and 14, he talks about some of the ways within their church community

176
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,440
 they were expressing their humanity through both their natural gifts and spiritual gifts.

177
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,600
 And right in between those two chapters in chapter 13, he actually begins to say to them,

178
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,960
 "But you need to understand that if you try to express your humanity without love, then

179
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,480
 you're not contributing anything to this world.

180
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,680
 No matter how great your gifts are, no matter how amazing the things that you might be doing

181
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,920
 are, if it's without love, it is nothing."

182
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:19,120
 And as he begins to explain this idea of love, he begins to challenge his church in this

183
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,520
 now but not yet time, this time of Advent in which they're living in.

184
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:27,720
 And we've been basing our Advent series here at the Vine over this past month in exactly

185
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,720
 this passage.

186
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,120
 I want to read it to you from 1 Corinthians 13, verses 8 onwards.

187
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,880
 We started the series with this.

188
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,920
 I want to finish the series with this.

189
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,880
 Starting in verse 8, he says this, "Love never fails.

190
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,800
 But where there are prophecies, they will cease.

191
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,160
 Where there are tongues, they will be stilled.

192
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,600
 Where there is knowledge, it will pass away.

193
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,280
 We know in part and we prophesy in part, but when perfection comes," talking about the

194
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:57,280
 end of all things, "the imperfect," this now but not yet time, "disappears.

195
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,080
 When I was a child, I taught like a child.

196
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,320
 I thought like a child.

197
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,920
 I responded like a child.

198
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,640
 But when I became a man, I put those childish ways behind me."

199
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,760
 You see, he's talking about this now but not yet.

200
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,360
 "Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror.

201
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,640
 Then we're going to see face to face when Christ returns.

202
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:20,240
 Now I know in part," he says, "but then I shall know fully even as right now I'm fully

203
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,240
 known."

204
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:28,160
 And now these three things remain right here in this now but not yet time, faith, hope,

205
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,160
 and love.

206
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,440
 But the greatest of these is love.

207
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,760
 I love how Paul is doing this and we've been unpacking this, haven't we, over the last

208
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,880
 couple of weeks here.

209
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,880
 He's talking about this now but not yet time.

210
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,600
 Christ has come in his first advent that we celebrate at Christmas.

211
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,680
 Christ is returning at the end of all things as a conquering king.

212
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,840
 And he's saying, "We live in this time where we don't have all the knowledge.

213
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,240
 We don't have everything worked out perfectly.

214
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,880
 We're living in a time where, yes, Christ has come, died for our sins and raised, but

215
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,040
 we're living in a time where sin still has an influence on us.

216
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,720
 And the culmination, the fulfillment of the redemptive story of Christ will only take

217
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,320
 place when he returns at the end of all things.

218
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:12,460
 And we live in this longing time, this maranatha, come Lord Jesus time.

219
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:16,840
 But he says, "God has not left us alone in the in-between.

220
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,960
 God has given us three things which helps us to navigate when we don't have all the

221
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:25,440
 answers, when we don't have it all worked out, when we are longing but we don't see

222
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,080
 the promises coming through.

223
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,720
 Three things, faith, hope, and love."

224
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,500
 And then he says, "The greatest of these is love."

225
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,560
 Which should raise an important question for you when you read this because it should ask

226
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,720
 or cause you to ask the question, "Why is love the greatest?"

227
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:48,360
 Because we've seen how important over the last couple of weeks faith is, how faith is

228
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,920
 essential to this time.

229
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,840
 And without faith we'd be lost.

230
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:57,360
 We've seen how hope motivates us and draws us out and makes us the people that we want

231
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,360
 to be.

232
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,960
 So we know how important faith and hope is.

233
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,960
 Why is love then the greatest?

234
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,080
 Well Paul gives a couple of answers.

235
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,200
 His partial answer comes at the start of verse eight.

236
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,480
 Let me read it to you again.

237
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,080
 He says, "Love never fails."

238
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,200
 Another way of saying this, actually translating the Greek a little bit better, is "Love never

239
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,400
 ends" or "Love never ceases."

240
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,120
 Which connects with what Paul is saying here because he says, "Look, love never ceases,

241
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,400
 but prophecy, that'll cease."

242
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,920
 All this knowledge that we have, yeah, that's going to cease.

243
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:35,640
 Even I would argue, Paul would say this, "Faith and hope, that will also cease, but the one

244
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:42,320
 thing that never ends, never ceases, and therefore never fails, is love."

245
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,880
 Think about this for a second, right?

246
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,960
 Faith is given to us.

247
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:51,160
 We've defined faith a couple of weeks ago from Hebrews chapter 11, where it says, "Faith

248
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:56,000
 is the confidence of what I hope for and the assurance of what is not yet seen."

249
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,040
 So faith is this idea that we have faith in order to get us to the point where Christ

250
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,040
 returns.

251
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,600
 We are longing for Him to come, and it is the idea that I am assured today of what I

252
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,080
 do not yet see.

253
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:12,800
 But when Christ comes again, as Paul says in these verses, he says, "Then we will see

254
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,240
 face to face."

255
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,000
 So we will see face to face.

256
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,800
 We no longer have to have faith in Him because the fullness of Him will be present with us.

257
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,680
 So faith will cease.

258
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,680
 Same with hope.

259
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:31,520
 See, hope we've defined last week as this confident expectation, this assurance of what's

260
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,600
 going to happen in the future because of our deep understanding of the goodness and the

261
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,300
 grace of God today.

262
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:43,240
 So we are longing for these promises of God to come in this here and now.

263
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:47,480
 But when He does return at the end of all things, all promises will be fulfilled.

264
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,480
 All promises will be there.

265
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,480
 There'll be no more death.

266
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,880
 There'll be no more pain.

267
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,560
 There'll be no more sin or even the possibility of sin.

268
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:59,160
 There's only one tree at that end of all things, other than the two trees that were there in

269
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,160
 Genesis.

270
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,560
 Everything, all the promises of God and the beauty of Shalom will all be ours.

271
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,440
 We won't need to hope anymore because the fullness of hope will be with us.

272
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,920
 Are you following this?

273
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:16,600
 But love, he says, is the greatest because love never ends.

274
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:22,760
 In other words, when Christ comes, our relationship will be fullness of love with Him and with

275
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,420
 others in that place for all eternity.

276
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,000
 That's the beauty of the Christian story.

277
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,360
 And because that's what we're getting, Paul is saying this is the reason why love is the

278
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,760
 greatest because faith and hope, as important as they are right now, they get us, if you

279
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,780
 will, to the place where He returns.

280
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,080
 But when He comes, they're no longer needed.

281
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,280
 But love will endure.

282
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,480
 Love will continue.

283
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,840
 Love will be what we will experience for eternity.

284
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,280
 It's a wonderful thing.

285
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,280
 But I want you to hear something else.

286
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:58,520
 He's saying love is the greatest, not just because it'll be the thing that we will have

287
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,720
 for all eternity.

288
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,440
 It's because we can experience the fullness of it now.

289
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,440
 We don't need to wait until we get there to experience it.

290
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:13,920
 It actually can be a part of our human story today.

291
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,480
 Now to understand what Paul is saying about that, we have to actually understand what

292
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:25,240
 he means by love when he uses the word love throughout the chapter 13 here in 1 Corinthians.

293
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,760
 You may know that in the Greek language in the first century, there were six words in

294
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,360
 the Greek language that we would translate into English as love.

295
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:39,520
 The two most popular in the first century was eros, which is kind of sexual or romantic

296
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:45,760
 love, and philia, which was like loyal friendship and kind of love that is happening between

297
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,880
 two committed friends.

298
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,640
 But there was this other word for love, one of the other six words, it's the word agape.

299
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,520
 You probably have heard this if you've been a Christian for some time.

300
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:03,280
 Agape is this idea of a love that was defined in the Greek culture as radical, sacrificial,

301
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,480
 selfless love.

302
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,240
 And when the church was thinking, what is the word for love from the Greek language

303
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,720
 that we're going to apply to our relationship with God and to who God is, it's this word

304
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,880
 agape that they chose.

305
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:21,200
 Now what's fascinating for us is that we often, when we think of agape love, I think in the

306
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,560
 church today, we most genuinely focus on God and God's love for us.

307
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:31,560
 We think God's love is agape, which is absolutely true.

308
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,560
 But Paul is wanting us to understand that it's not just an agape love that comes from

309
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:42,120
 him to us, but agape should also be the love that we give to one another.

310
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,720
 And that, my friends, changes everything.

311
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:50,080
 And I want to kind of unpack this by taking you quickly just to another passage outside

312
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,080
 of Paul.

313
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,440
 I want to take you to 1 John, starting in verse 4.

314
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,240
 I want you to listen to how the disciple John writes this.

315
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,640
 In verse 10 he says this.

316
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,320
 He says, "This is agape love.

317
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,280
 Not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for

318
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,280
 our sins.

319
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:15,560
 So, dear friends, since God so loved us, agape-ed us, we ought to now agape one another.

320
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:23,200
 No one has ever seen God, but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made

321
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,200
 complete in us."

322
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,440
 I think this is really powerful because what he's kind of saying here is, here's what the

323
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,760
 ultimate picture of agape is.

324
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,400
 You want to know what agape is?

325
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,400
 This is what it is.

326
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:39,000
 It is this unadulterated, selfless, other-centered love.

327
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:48,480
 See, agape is when we give of ourself completely to sacrificing for somebody else's benefit.

328
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,040
 And John goes, "Okay, what's the best picture I can give you to understand what agape is?"

329
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,040
 "Oh, I know what it is.

330
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,040
 It's the cross of Jesus."

331
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,060
 How could it be anything else?

332
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:00,160
 You want to see the ultimate picture of what agape looks like?

333
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:06,880
 It's a God who so loved the world that he was willing to send his only Son into the

334
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:13,120
 darkness, into the brokenness, into the sin, into all the pain, come and be born as a helpless,

335
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:20,360
 defenseless child, grow up around a world tainted so deeply and marred so ugly with

336
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:26,880
 sin, go and be eventually killed on a Roman cross, essentially a torture device, in order

337
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:33,440
 that everyone else who would ever align in relationship and belief and faith in him would

338
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,680
 not ever perish to death, but know eternal life.

339
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,000
 The writer John is saying that's agape.

340
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,280
 It is completely sacrificial, completely selfless.

341
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,880
 It is other-centered love.

342
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:54,520
 It's the kind of love that would take an old Spanish nun who has never had a person visit

343
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:59,680
 her for weeks, who then shows that person around the church and is having a great time

344
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:04,400
 with that person, but when somebody turns up who is more in need, she is willing to

345
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:10,200
 let go of that one and run as fast as she can towards the person in need.

346
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,160
 That's agape.

347
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:18,480
 That's sacrificing everything else in order the other would flourish as God would desire

348
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,480
 them to.

349
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,960
 If I was to give you a definition of agape, here's how I would straightaway define it.

350
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:29,600
 Agape love is the overflow of our delight in God that joyfully cherishes and seeks the

351
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:35,240
 best interest of another even when it comes at great sacrifice to ourselves.

352
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,280
 I want you to hear what John says here.

353
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,600
 He says, "Here's the greatest example of agape love.

354
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:46,960
 It's the cross, but because we have the cross, because God has loved us like that, we now,"

355
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,920
 he says, "should love one another."

356
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:53,600
 He doesn't say we now should eros one another or philea one another.

357
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,520
 He says we should agape one another.

358
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:00,600
 In other words, the sacrifice seen on the cross should be the starting point for how

359
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,360
 we now love each other.

360
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:07,320
 And that if we could love each other in that way, we might actually begin to model and

361
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:12,720
 shape the future of this world to be a place that when Christ returns, we would come to

362
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:18,000
 see the fullness of that love fulfilled.

363
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,120
 This my friends is what Christmas is all about.

364
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,840
 The love of Christmas is agape love in its fullness.

365
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:29,560
 It is the decision that God made to give his son.

366
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,840
 And of course, the cross is going to happen later.

367
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:39,080
 But in that moment in Bethlehem, in that moment of calling Mary, this sacrificial love comes

368
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:43,400
 to us so that we would eventually know how it is that we should treat one another.

369
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,000
 Think of it this way.

370
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:54,360
 Jesus is God's expression of other-centered love, which comes at a high cost, the highest

371
00:24:54,360 --> 00:25:02,520
 cost of one who gives up his life, gives something so that everyone else might receive.

372
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,800
 That's Christmas.

373
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,640
 That's what we're going to be celebrating on Wednesday.

374
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,960
 That should be driving everything we think about as we go through this season that we're

375
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,800
 celebrating right now.

376
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:17,120
 That Jesus is this representative of agape love, something given so that everybody else

377
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,120
 can receive.

378
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,920
 And if you look through the Christmas story, it's a story of agape love.

379
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:28,120
 I mean, think about Mary and Joseph who had to sacrifice their reputation and what everybody

380
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:32,480
 else thought of them and all the judgment everybody was making because they were unmarried

381
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,280
 and she was pregnant, but they were willing to sacrifice it in obedience to what God had

382
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,960
 called them to do, agape.

383
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:44,880
 Think about the shepherds, the shepherds who are called by the angels in the sky to leave

384
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:51,280
 behind over a year's worth of finances, their livelihood in the sheep, and leave them to

385
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:57,400
 wander off into the wilderness so that they could go to Bethlehem and meet the Savior.

386
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,800
 Agape love.

387
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,000
 The Magi who travel from afar, that's not where their love was found.

388
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 Their love was found in the fact that they were willing to risk their own lives by disobeying

389
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,640
 what Herod had said and said, "Come back and let me know where Jesus is."

390
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,360
 When the Magi decided they were not going to return to let Herod know, they were putting

391
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,520
 their lives at central risk.

392
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,840
 Agape love.

393
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,960
 So when we think about Christmas, what we should be asking ourselves is, are we living

394
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,480
 this agape love?

395
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,280
 It's a challenging question and it's the question you have to have in mind when you read 1 Corinthians

396
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,280
 13.

397
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,760
 I want to take you actually to the beginning of the chapter.

398
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,360
 Now that you've got that context in mind, now that we understand a little bit more of

399
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:46,360
 what this love is that we're being called to, now we go back and we actually read what

400
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:50,160
 Paul is trying to teach to his church at the beginning of 1 Corinthians 13.

401
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:54,360
 And let me say this, it is not about marriage or weddings.

402
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,960
 You've heard this a lot of times and as I start to read this, you're immediately going

403
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,800
 to think of a wedding.

404
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,240
 Please do not.

405
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,360
 I want you to stay seated in the bigger picture of what I'm talking about.

406
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,680
 Does that make sense to you?

407
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,160
 Okay, let me read this to you.

408
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,240
 This is 1 Corinthians 13 starting in verse 1.

409
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:15,040
 If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding

410
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,080
 gong or a clanging cymbal.

411
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:20,880
 If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, if I have

412
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,380
 faith that can move mountains but not love, I am nothing.

413
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:31,480
 If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love,

414
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,080
 I gain nothing.

415
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,600
 It's fascinating what Paul does here.

416
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,040
 He basically is talking to the current church about their natural and spiritual gifts.

417
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:45,920
 But I think we can broaden it to us to think about humanity and how we express our humanity.

418
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,520
 And he mentions three things in these three verses.

419
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:53,200
 In the first verse, he basically says, what if somebody was a really good speaker, a really

420
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:59,960
 good presenter, told a really great story, but if they did it without love, it's nothing.

421
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,680
 In the second one, he talks about wisdom and knowledge and prophecy and understanding.

422
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:08,300
 It's like he's saying, hey, if you had someone who did a great TED Talk and opened up a new

423
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:12,040
 way of thinking, gave you data to understand something, and you were like blown away by

424
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:17,000
 their intellect and their wonder and what they thought, but if they did that without

425
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,860
 love, it's nothing.

426
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:23,520
 Then in the third bucket, he says, what about you have someone who looks like they're loving,

427
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,520
 but they're not?

428
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,520
 In other words, they're giving away.

429
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,520
 They're giving away all their money.

430
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,480
 They're giving away all their time.

431
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:34,280
 They're loving in what looks like a sacrificial way, but they do it without sacrificial love.

432
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,320
 It is nothing.

433
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:41,000
 Which is Paul saying something very challenging to the church.

434
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,500
 He's saying, if you really want to be human, if you want to be the way that God has created

435
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:50,880
 you to be, you can do all of these things that on the surface appear great human things.

436
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,080
 Oh, the artist who tells an amazing story.

437
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,840
 Oh, the incredibly smart person who knows it all.

438
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,600
 Oh, the person who's so generous with everything.

439
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,820
 You can do all of those things, but if you do them without love, here's what happens.

440
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,820
 This is very important.

441
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:06,200
 He says, you are nothing.

442
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,480
 Notice, he does not say your gift is nothing.

443
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,600
 He doesn't say, hey, if you do all these great things without love, then the gift is worthless

444
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,600
 and nothing will happen.

445
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,400
 No, he says, you're worthless.

446
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,120
 You have gained nothing.

447
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,840
 You are nothing.

448
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,140
 I can get up here, and this challenges me deeply.

449
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:31,140
 I can get up here and do an amazing sermon and wow you with my oratory and tell you incredible

450
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,400
 stories about nuns in Spain.

451
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:39,680
 I can do all of this, and you can leave here going, that was a great message.

452
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:46,080
 Wow, God spoke to me and I learned something, which can happen, and I can do that without

453
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:52,680
 love and you can still go away being blessed, but I am nothing.

454
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,160
 This is the danger of what Paul's saying.

455
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:58,800
 He's saying we can have a world where it appears like there's all this great human wisdom,

456
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:03,800
 all this great human stuff, but when it's done without agape, when it's done without

457
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:10,400
 sacrificial, other-centered thinking, what it essentially will do is basically try to

458
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,720
 build yourself up rather than build anyone else up.

459
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,960
 See, I can preach the greatest sermon to you, but if I don't have love, I'm essentially

460
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,480
 trying to make myself great and not Christ great.

461
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:25,000
 If I do it without love, I'm not actually thinking about you.

462
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 I'm thinking about me.

463
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,240
 I'm thinking about making sure this is the perfect sermon that you're going to love and

464
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,960
 you're going to go and tell all your friends and more people will come to the vine, because

465
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,480
 that's about me.

466
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,720
 It's about my church.

467
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,760
 It's about this stuff here.

468
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:42,480
 And Paul's saying, when you do that, you are nothing.

469
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,840
 And Paul's saying, I don't want you to be nothing.

470
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,680
 I want you to be something.

471
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:51,080
 I want you to be the very person that Christ has called you to be, who he's made you to

472
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,080
 be.

473
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:57,480
 And he's saying, do those things, yes, but do them from sacrificial, other-centered love.

474
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:02,240
 And when you love like that, oh, the world changes, he's saying.

475
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,480
 When you love like that, things shift and change.

476
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:14,080
 But when you fail as a human being to love agape ways, you will always end up imaging

477
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,240
 yourself to the world.

478
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,220
 You will always end up filling the earth with your glory.

479
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:25,360
 And you will basically fail to become the person that you were called to be.

480
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,840
 It's really important that you hear that.

481
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:33,480
 When we fail to live as human beings from a place of agape love, we image ourself to

482
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,480
 the world.

483
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,660
 We fill the earth with our glory and we fail to become the people that we were actually

484
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,660
 intended to be.

485
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:43,560
 And when that happens, that breaks the heart of God.

486
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:52,540
 Agape is this incredible thought that actually I was designed to give everything to you so

487
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:58,020
 that you would be the best that you can be, trusting that you're going to give everything

488
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:02,120
 to me so that I might become the best that I can be.

489
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,180
 And we do that because God has first loved us.

490
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:08,420
 We're not trying to love sacrificially in our own strength.

491
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:12,900
 We're not trying to love one another in our niceness and try to be a little bit better

492
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,900
 than others.

493
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:18,620
 No, I've received a sacrificial love that is founded in the cross of Christ.

494
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:22,940
 And out of the overflow of gratitude, out of the overflow of feeling that love and forgiveness

495
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:28,660
 of my sins for myself, I can now stand before others and want the very best for you without

496
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:32,000
 thinking what's the very best for me.

497
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,060
 This is radical because what Paul's essentially doing here is he's turning upside down common

498
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:40,540
 thinking about self-help and self-love.

499
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:44,820
 See this world is like, "Hey, you need some more self-love.

500
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,500
 Get on that retreat.

501
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,060
 Get away.

502
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,180
 Prioritize yourself.

503
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,520
 Put up more boundaries.

504
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,640
 Make sure you're better.

505
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,380
 Make sure that you've got your time.

506
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,360
 Make sure you're prioritizing you.

507
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,700
 Love your truth.

508
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,580
 Love yourself."

509
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:02,700
 And Paul's flipping it all upside down and he's saying, "You want to know where self-love

510
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,100
 is?

511
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,560
 It's found in other-centered love.

512
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,640
 You want to know how to flourish yourself best?

513
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,400
 Give yourself away.

514
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,720
 You want to know how to feel the best that you could ever feel?

515
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,260
 Love others like they're the center of your world.

516
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:24,320
 When you do that, something transcendent happens and you become fully alive.

517
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:29,680
 When a nun hitches up her habit and runs to a broken man, when I go over not understanding

518
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:34,120
 a word but lay a hand on his shoulder, not knowing anything about his story, I can feel

519
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,200
 the most alive that I have felt ever.

520
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:44,560
 When we truly agape in this world, we actually love ourselves."

521
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:51,920
 Which is a very beautiful, complicated, incredibly deep theological but also very practical thing.

522
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,240
 And it's this practical thing that Paul now turns to.

523
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:59,840
 Let me show you these words that he then speaks of and these are so famous to us but again,

524
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,720
 try to follow along with this new thinking we have about sacrificial love for the other's

525
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,720
 benefit.

526
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,200
 Love is patient.

527
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,540
 Love is kind.

528
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,540
 It does not envy.

529
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,540
 It does not boast.

530
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,540
 It is not proud.

531
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,540
 It is not rude.

532
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,000
 It is not self-seeking.

533
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,640
 It is not easily angered.

534
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,680
 It keeps no record of wrongs.

535
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:21,040
 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.

536
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:26,120
 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.

537
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:31,000
 It's really important you understand that what Paul's not doing here is trying to define

538
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 love.

539
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,680
 Remember I said earlier at the start, it's hard for us to find the words that define love.

540
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,280
 He's not trying to define love here.

541
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,080
 What he's trying to say is you want to know what a world looks like when people agape

542
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,360
 one another.

543
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:46,280
 You want to know what it feels like for you when somebody agapes to you.

544
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,600
 You want to know what it feels like when you're able to give of someone else.

545
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,000
 It feels like this.

546
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,960
 But also you want to know what happens when we don't do those things from a place of love,

547
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:00,760
 when we don't find love as the driving factor to the way in which we serve and love one

548
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,760
 another.

549
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,120
 So it then feels and seems and acts like this.

550
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:09,800
 So he's not trying to define some like, you know, dictionary version of love.

551
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,840
 He's trying to paint a picture of how the world might be and give us the reason why

552
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,840
 the world isn't always like that.

553
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:20,440
 So he gives seven descriptors of positive outcomes and eight of negative.

554
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,720
 Look at this.

555
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:26,760
 What love is, patient, kind, truthful, protects, trusts, hopes, perseveres.

556
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:32,740
 But it isn't envious, boastful, proud, rude, self-seeking, angry, shameful, evil.

557
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,340
 What he's essentially saying is this.

558
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:40,280
 If you do all the great things you can do as a human being, whether that's great speaking

559
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:45,600
 or great knowledge or great generosity, but you do it without love, here's what you're

560
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,760
 putting out in the world.

561
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,960
 You're putting out envious, boastful, proud, rude, self-seeking, angry, shameful, and essentially

562
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,080
 evil.

563
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:56,000
 That's what you're shaping in the world.

564
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,320
 But when you love with agape in the way that Christ has loved you and demonstrates that

565
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,400
 love on the cross, well, here's what you put out in the world.

566
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,840
 You're patient.

567
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:10,200
 You have long suffering with those that don't always get it or kind of annoy you or kind

568
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,960
 of have hurt you.

569
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,440
 You have this kind, truthfulness to you.

570
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,740
 You protect, you trust, you hope, persevere.

571
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:20,220
 You want to do all these things for others in the world.

572
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,800
 And Paul's not saying, "Hey, don't do these things.

573
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,800
 Try and do these things."

574
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:30,080
 He's not saying, "Okay, the application of this sermon is just to try to be nicer this

575
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,080
 week."

576
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,200
 If you could try to be nicer, that would go along.

577
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,520
 That's not what Paul's trying to say to his church.

578
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,100
 It's not what I'm trying to say to you this morning.

579
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:40,920
 This is not about finding within yourself more niceness.

580
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,200
 This is about realizing that the love that we receive through the Holy Spirit, remember

581
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,040
 the fruit of the Holy Spirit, first of all, is love.

582
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:52,420
 The love that we receive through the Holy Spirit, which is other-centered and sacrificial

583
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:58,600
 to us, overflows within us and causes us to want to do anything other than these things.

584
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:03,440
 It causes us to want to serve and to love and be kind and be grateful.

585
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,320
 It's not about trying to be nicer so I'm on the right side of the equation.

586
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:12,260
 It's about asking the Holy Spirit to create a fruit of agape in me so that when a broken

587
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:17,720
 man walks into a church, I'm the first one to run rather than the none.

588
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,720
 Come on, church.

589
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,340
 I got such a thing.

590
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:26,380
 She had such a thing in her that when he stepped in, she went straight away and left me behind.

591
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,380
 It hurt.

592
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,380
 No, it didn't hurt.

593
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,380
 It didn't hurt.

594
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,860
 But I could tell the tour was over.

595
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:36,100
 But why wasn't I the first one to run?

596
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,980
 Where is this agape-ness with me?

597
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:42,380
 When I look at these lists, if I'm honest with you, I connect a little bit more on that

598
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,860
 side.

599
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:49,900
 I realize that so often my thinking is so self-centered and not other-centered.

600
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:54,380
 And I realize that if we could flip that around and begin to love in the only ways that Christ

601
00:37:54,380 --> 00:38:00,260
 has loved us, which is always other-centered, never for his gain, but for ours, man, could

602
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:05,060
 you imagine what the world would be like if we could live like that?

603
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:10,620
 See, it's that kind of love that enables you to turn the other cheek.

604
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:14,740
 It's that kind of love that enables you to embrace an enemy.

605
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:19,420
 It's that kind of love that causes you to take your cloak off and give it to someone.

606
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:24,960
 It's that kind of love that actually asks you to repent of your sin.

607
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:31,180
 It's that kind of love that causes you to give to those who could never repay you.

608
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:35,780
 It's that kind of love that causes you to get on your knees and to pray for this world.

609
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:43,140
 It's that kind of love that is other-centered focus that changes it all.

610
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:46,340
 And it's really important that you understand that this is not a soft love.

611
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,340
 No.

612
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:51,820
 Agape love is not the kind of love that just kind of lies down and lets everything walk

613
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,820
 over it.

614
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:58,020
 It's not the kind of love that tolerates everything, that kind of allows everything to happen.

615
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:01,420
 It's not the kind of love that denies yourself nothing.

616
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:08,180
 No, this kind of love, as Paul describes, it rejoices with the truth.

617
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:11,620
 It does not delight, he says, with evil.

618
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:14,820
 So this is not a love that just basically says to the church, "Hey, just treat everybody

619
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:19,340
 how whatever and just everything goes and there's nothing bad in the world and don't

620
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,340
 be mean to..."

621
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:23,440
 Well, you shouldn't be mean to anyone.

622
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,580
 It's the kind of love that's not so soft and whimsical that it's like, "Hey, anything goes.

623
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,020
 Just live your life and it's cool.

624
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,020
 Be your truth."

625
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,020
 No.

626
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:35,820
 It's the kind of love that rejoices with truth of God, that rejoices with scripture and the

627
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:41,740
 promises of God, that actually understands that and doesn't delight in the distortions

628
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:46,740
 of those things, doesn't delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.

629
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:51,460
 It's the kind of love that actually causes us to say, "Hey, I love you doesn't mean I

630
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:55,120
 accept everything that comes out of your mouth, everything that you do.

631
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:59,740
 My love of you, my agape of you doesn't mean you can just act however you want against

632
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,740
 me."

633
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,360
 It's not like a soft love.

634
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:10,180
 It is a robust, beautiful, tough, run through the church towards the broken kind of love

635
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:15,340
 that stands for the truth of God's word even when that might come at a cost.

636
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,700
 Oh, a cost.

637
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:23,460
 Maybe agape love is sown more beautifully in cost than in anything else.

638
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:27,940
 When we're found in those moments, it changes everything for us.

639
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:33,780
 And I remember the great privilege I had of standing next to that man as he wept the horror

640
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:39,220
 of 20 years of being a homicide detective out of himself whilst he was being administered

641
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:46,300
 to by a nun, unadulterated agape love.

642
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:50,420
 The man just sat there for about half an hour after we prayed for him just on his own, just

643
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,700
 weeping and gently being ministered to.

644
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:58,060
 The nun took me to the side and as she went to the side, she reached into her habit and

645
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,860
 she pulled out this.

646
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:00,860
 She pulled out a pendant.

647
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:03,300
 This is the exact pendant that she pulled out.

648
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:11,780
 And in Spanish, she explained something about this pendant that I will never know.

649
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:14,500
 But apparently it was very important.

650
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:19,700
 And she placed it in my hand like this and she clasped her hand over my hand.

651
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:24,900
 And she said something in Spanish which I assume was, "I want you to take this to remember

652
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,660
 this moment of love."

653
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:31,620
 As I left the church, here's what God was saying to me.

654
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:37,180
 He was saying, "Andrew, I've placed pendants of love around your neck over the years that

655
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:40,620
 I'm calling you to take off and give to those around you.

656
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,620
 That's agape."

657
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:48,180
 And as I close our series on Advent, and as we prepare our hearts for Christmas on Wednesday,

658
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:50,820
 let me ask you the same thing.

659
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:56,380
 What pendants of love has Christ placed over you over the last number of years that you

660
00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:02,020
 might now be able to remove and give outwardly towards the other?

661
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:05,580
 Do that and the greatest of these remains.

662
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:09,220
 Can we pray?

663
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,620
 Let's pray.

664
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:24,260
 Father, we are deeply grateful that you love with agape love, other-centered, sacrificial,

665
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:27,340
 loving in its fullness.

666
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:34,580
 Lord, we recognize that we have distorted such love and that it's not just the world

667
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:40,100
 that distorts it, but the church does at times too.

668
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:46,500
 And we recognize, Lord, that often we live in a lesser vision of love and that we act

669
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:50,460
 out a lesser vision of love.

670
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:56,140
 We recognize that so often we can be selfish, self-centered, that even in pretending to

671
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:59,700
 be loving, we're actually just looking after ourselves.

672
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:06,180
 Father, I pray for anyone here this morning where that might be part of their story, that

673
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:13,540
 they would have the courage today to bring that to you, that in your agape love we would,

674
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:16,300
 out of your kindness, be led to repentance.

675
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:21,620
 Lord, I recognize also that there's people in this room watching online in our overflow

676
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:30,260
 who have been hurt by broken love, who somebody else's brokenness of love has acted upon them

677
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:32,500
 in ways that has deeply hurt them.

678
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:39,260
 Father, I pray for anyone here where that's their story, and because of how broken love

679
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:43,900
 has impacted them, they have been loving brokenly themselves.

680
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:48,340
 Father, we do know that we are able to love because you first loved us, and I pray that

681
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:52,580
 if there's anyone in this room where that's a bit of their journey or a bit of their story

682
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:57,460
 right now, they've been broken and hurt by love, and they find that they're swept up

683
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:59,060
 in that story.

684
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:05,460
 I want to pray, Lord, that your Spirit, which you have poured out in this time, in this

685
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:10,500
 now but not yet time between your birth and your return, I pray that that Spirit and the

686
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:18,300
 fruit of that Spirit of love, pure, unadulterated, agape, sacrificial, selfless, other-scented

687
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:26,740
 love would fall on them, would come up and be birthed within them for your glory.

688
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:31,740
 Lord, I pray for families that have been torn apart by broken love.

689
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:40,380
 Father, I pray for husbands and wives in this room, those that are struggling to love, those

690
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:47,540
 that perhaps loved before but find themselves without it in this time, marriages that are

691
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:50,620
 strained and difficult.

692
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:53,420
 Lord, we don't downplay that.

693
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:56,100
 We don't brush over that.

694
00:44:56,100 --> 00:45:02,060
 And Lord, we recognize that the only thing that heals that kind of brokenness is the

695
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:06,780
 kind of love that is seen on the cross of Christ, and a love that brings us once again

696
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:10,580
 to the most natural state of what it is to be human.

697
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:16,060
 Lord, I pray for marriages in this room that you would restore agape love in the name of

698
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:17,060
 Jesus.

699
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:20,940
 Lord, I pray for businesses and families.

700
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:23,860
 I pray for relationships that have been strained.

701
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:29,140
 Lord, we pray that we would be able to become a church that has received such agape love

702
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:35,860
 ourselves that we cannot but help to move out in that love for the glory of Christ,

703
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:39,220
 imaging you to the world and not ourselves.

704
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:45,940
 Lord, as we come to celebrate your birth on Wednesday, would it be this agapeness that

705
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:47,820
 would mark the Vine Church?

706
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:52,740
 Would it mark us in the days ahead, and would it mark us as we enter into 2025 and all the

707
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:54,540
 things that you have for us ahead?

708
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:58,420
 Would we love in the way that you truly called us to love?

709
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:01,340
 And we give you glory for this.

710
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:03,340
 In Jesus' name.

711
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:04,340
 Amen.

712
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:08,380
 Would you stand with me, and we're going to just respond together in a time of worship.

713
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:09,900
 Amen.

714
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:11,420
 Amen.

715
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:14,980
