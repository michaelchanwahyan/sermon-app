[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800]   So last week we had Vision Sunday here at The Vine, so if this is your first Sunday
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.200]   with us or if you weren't able to be with us last week, we know that a lot of people
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.400]   travel and things like that.
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.540]   So welcome back.
[00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.440]   We did Vision Sunday last week where we released really to you as a church a sense of what
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.080]   we are kind of feeling that God is saying about us as a church community here in Hong
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.640]   Kong in this time and really a word that we believe is going to sit over us as a church
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.440]   over the rest of this year and probably into the year to come in 2026.
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.680]   And it's a word for us as a community together because if this is your home church, you're
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.640]   not here just as yourself.
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.440]   You're here a part of a community, but it is also, as I said last week, a word for you
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.680]   individually, for you personally in what is happening in your life.
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.960]   And it is this word that we're in uncharted territory, that the Lord is wanting to move
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.880]   us into uncharted waters.
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.520]   And I shared a picture last week that I had a few months ago about us as a church community
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.480]   like this, one of those early pioneer ships where they would be in safe harbour, but then
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.600]   they would set out from safe harbour out into the ocean and they would literally be sailing
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.200]   out to where there was no maps.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.440]   And they had this early kind of unreasonable hope that they believed that if they just
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.160]   sailed beyond what they had currently mapped out, that there might be lands beyond what
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.960]   they could realise or what they thought.
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.540]   And this idea of the uncharted is exactly that, that there is no map, there is no ability
[00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.540]   for us to know what's ahead because we've never been there before.
[00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.320]   And the great encouragement that the Holy Spirit is saying to us as the Bind Church
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.320]   is I desire to take you to a place corporately and individually where you've never been before,
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.760]   where you've never experienced me like that before, where you've never seen my kingdom
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.060]   and my spirit at work like it's going to work ever before.
[00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.840]   And therefore there is no strategy, there's no current resource, there are no current
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.320]   gifts that are going to be appropriate for what is to come, that this is a completely
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.520]   different time, different season.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.280]   And what God is saying is are we ready to prepare ourselves for what that is that is
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.960]   to come?
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.680]   And it's interesting because he's pulling us out of our comfort zones.
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.680]   He's put us in a place where we're going to be not with the things that normally would
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.080]   tether us and give us stability, we're going to be a little bit out of what's comfortable
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.080]   for us.
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.680]   But I want you to know that the greatest moments of growth in your life will always occur with
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.940]   Christ Jesus when you're out of your comfort zone, where you're in a place where you're
[00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.200]   going to have to rely on him.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.280]   Last week I shared a few things that I felt would shape this season.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.460]   It's going to be a season of discovery and adventure focused on the unknown but anticipated.
[00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.020]   This is really important, the unknown but anticipated.
[00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.920]   It's unknown because this is an uncharted season.
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.760]   So by its very definition, we don't know what's ahead.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.280]   But because it's unknown doesn't mean that our posture at this time as a community should
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.280]   be passive.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.400]   It doesn't mean that, "Oh, okay, we don't know what God's going to do, so we're just
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.680]   going to sit back and kind of just wait for it."
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.160]   In the picture I had last week of that sailing ship that's heading out into the unknown,
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.140]   the captain's there at the bow at the front leaning forward with his telescope looking
[00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.140]   for what's to come.
[00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.480]   The intentionality within his spirit to look forward with hope for what is to come.
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:28.180]   So it's unknown, but we need to have a posture of heart, a focus within us of anticipation
[00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.180]   for what's about to come.
[00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.560]   Does that make sense?
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.840]   The second thing we shared is that it's going to be a season of wholehearted reliance and
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.220]   trust in Jesus above everything else.
[00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:46.260]   Because we don't currently have the map and the strategy to hold us where God's taking
[00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.780]   us.
[00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.420]   And we shared last week that it is this purging season.
[00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.180]   That perhaps as a church community and perhaps as you as an individual, there have been some
[00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.260]   things that you've gotten comfortable with to rely on, that you've been trusting and
[00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.020]   putting your hope and your faith and your reliance on that are not Jesus.
[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:11.100]   One of the primary reasons why God brings his church into a season of the uncharted
[00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.980]   is to shake off some of the things that we've begun to rely on that are not him.
[00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:22.180]   And so as we go through this year, we're going to be challenging ourselves, challenging you.
[00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.060]   Have we gone over reliant on something?
[00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.860]   Are we trusting in our own strength?
[00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.660]   Are we trusting in the things that we've trusted in the past?
[00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.940]   And maybe they were great for us in the past, but these are not the things that we should
[00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:32.940]   be trusting on now.
[00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:40.500]   No, this is a season where Jesus gets the wholehearted reliance and trust in our lives.
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.740]   The third thing we shared is that it's going to be a season where God's people, and this
[00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:51.100]   is really important, a season of intentional readiness where God's people rely and prepare
[00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.580]   not with a plan of action, but a purpose of their hearts.
[00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.100]   In other words, because this is uncharted, we don't have the map or the strategy that
[00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:05.780]   will help us to plan the action steps we need to take in order to benefit from the season.
[00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.740]   No, instead, it's not about an action plan, it's about the posture of my heart.
[00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.260]   It's about what's going on inside of me.
[00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:19.180]   It's about the values that I hold to, because when God acts, I want to be one who responds.
[00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.340]   And so you need to understand that in a season of uncharted, the spotlight that the Holy
[00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.300]   Spirit is shining is on our character over our competencies.
[00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.020]   I'm going to say that again.
[00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.220]   It's shining on our character over our competencies.
[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.500]   Not that we can't have gifts, not that we can't be good at things, not that God hasn't
[00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.300]   blessed us with things that we're good at, of course, but in this season, the focus becomes
[00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.780]   more the character than the competencies.
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:49.260]   Because here's the thing, we don't know what competencies we're going to need for the future.
[00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.340]   It's uncharted.
[00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.780]   No one's ever been there before.
[00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.020]   We've not been there before.
[00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.020]   We've not experienced it.
[00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.820]   We don't know what strategies or ministries or responses we're going to need when God
[00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:58.820]   acts.
[00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.620]   So it's not about trying to come up with the competencies that are going to hold us
[00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:03.820]   when God moves.
[00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:09.060]   It's about the character we need today so that when God does move, when the treasure
[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:15.560]   is discovered in the field, when we see that pearl of great price, we give everything.
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.100]   We're ready to give it all.
[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.540]   We're ready to respond straight away.
[00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.980]   It's a little bit like the people that work in the fire service, who are trained to respond
[00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:31.220]   without fear immediately when the fire takes place.
[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:37.580]   Could you imagine a church that was trained to respond without fear when the kingdom of
[00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.420]   God is at work?
[00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.060]   When God begins to do something in our workplace and we don't have the fear of going, "Oh my
[00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.940]   gosh, I'm not going to pray for this person in front of everybody because if I did that,
[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.140]   I'm going to be judged."
[00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:52.620]   But instead, we're over our fear and we've got the character that says that when God's
[00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.140]   presence is here, I will respond and here's somebody who desperately needs prayer.
[00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.020]   I'm going to ask them if I can pray for them.
[00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.940]   Or perhaps we're at that family dinner and we're sitting next to the uncle or the aunt
[00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:06.220]   that's twice removed, who we know is really abrasive against the Christian faith and they're
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.900]   beginning to ask us how things are going in our lives and what's happening in their lives.
[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.580]   And we're thinking, "Well, I better not share anything about church because it's going to
[00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.340]   upset them."
[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:17.660]   And we sense that the Holy Spirit is saying, "This might be a moment where you can begin
[00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:22.060]   to testify about what God's doing in your life and you've been trained and equipped
[00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.540]   to respond to the kingdom without fear."
[00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:29.020]   Can you imagine a church like that?
[00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:34.780]   This is not the first time in history that God has called his church to focus on their
[00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:38.980]   character over their competencies because he's moving them into the uncharted.
[00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.740]   In fact, perhaps the most important moment that this has happened in church history is
[00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.480]   the early church in the first century.
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:50.540]   Those first disciples as they're wrestling with the profundity that Jesus has risen from
[00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:51.540]   the dead.
[00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:55.340]   I mean, imagine the experience they went through believing that Jesus was the Messiah and then
[00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:59.060]   seeing him killed on a cross and then walking away from that going like, "Well, maybe we
[00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.060]   got that wrong.
[00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:01.820]   I guess he was just a prophet."
[00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:05.540]   But then Jesus raised from the dead, shows himself to them and suddenly they realize
[00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:06.900]   he is the Messiah.
[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.460]   He is the one that we've been longing for.
[00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.020]   He has come.
[00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:12.740]   And then Jesus says to them, "Hey, here's the great commission.
[00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:16.780]   Go into the Greco-Roman empire, sharing the faith of the gospel, teaching people to obey
[00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:19.380]   my commands and I'll be with you forever.
[00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:23.380]   And then stay here in Jerusalem and I'm going to send the Holy Spirit to empower you to
[00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:24.380]   go."
[00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:30.540]   And then suddenly the disciples are thrust into uncharted territory, uncharted waters.
[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:35.380]   They had no idea that Jesus was going to expect them to do what he expects them to do.
[00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.380]   And he doesn't give them a roadmap or a strategy or a plan.
[00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:43.380]   He sends them out in the power of the Holy Spirit to experience the kingdom, to find
[00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:45.540]   the treasure, to see the pearls.
[00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:51.220]   The beautiful thing about the gospel of Acts is that it's this wonderful idea of what happens
[00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.860]   when God shows up when you're least expecting it.
[00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:58.900]   Throughout the whole book, you have these moments where the writer, Luke, is writing
[00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.540]   these things and he uses this Greek word for suddenly.
[00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:05.300]   He uses it a lot because he's trying to express the suddenness of God's kingdom.
[00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:09.940]   He's like, "Suddenly the person is there," and the disciples try to pray for him.
[00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:13.620]   "Suddenly the chains break off and they're free from prison.
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:14.620]   Suddenly this happens.
[00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:15.620]   Suddenly that happens."
[00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:19.100]   And it's amazing because you see time and time again, the disciples just going about
[00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:25.000]   their normal average day, not expecting anything, and suddenly the kingdom of God appears.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.980]   And here's the question, will the disciples respond when they see a suddenly of God?
[00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:34.460]   And one of the things that you almost see all the time in the book of Acts is that when
[00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:40.220]   there's a suddenly of God, there's an immediate response from the church.
[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:44.820]   There's an immediate respond in faith to what the kingdom and what the spirit is doing in
[00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:45.820]   that moment.
[00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:49.780]   And this teaches us something so important about uncharted seasons.
[00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:56.780]   Look, we cannot predict the suddenlies, but we can prepare for the immediatelies.
[00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.060]   Come on church.
[00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.860]   We can't predict the suddenlies.
[00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.980]   This is uncharted season.
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:08.300]   So by its very definition, we can't predict when or how or what God is going to do.
[00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.860]   God's not asking you to predict the suddenlies.
[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.060]   That's his domain, not yours.
[00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.140]   You can't do that.
[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:18.340]   What you can do though is prepare yourself for the immediatelies.
[00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:22.340]   That when God does show up, when you discover the treasure, when you see the pearl, you
[00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:26.100]   respond because you put character over competency.
[00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.740]   You put your values over anything else.
[00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:33.260]   And your value is to say, "God, when you act, I want to be one of the workers in the work
[00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:34.260]   field.
[00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.500]   I want to be one of the ones that's reaching out with the gospel of hope.
[00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.300]   Lord, would you choose me?
[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.460]   If you act, I'm going to respond."
[00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:43.460]   Are you with me?
[00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:46.180]   So what we're going to do with you over the next six weeks, we're actually going to walk
[00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:47.300]   through the story of Acts.
[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.740]   We're not going to look at it as like a book study.
[00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:53.900]   We're going to pull out actually a study on the character of the disciples, the early
[00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:55.060]   church.
[00:10:55.060 --> 00:11:00.020]   And we're going to look at what are some of the key values that they hold in them that
[00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:05.140]   enables them to be positioned for the immediatelies when God does it suddenly.
[00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:06.820]   And we're going to teach you six of these things.
[00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:10.180]   And the reason why we're focusing on this is because these are the things that we feel
[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:12.460]   like the Holy Spirit is wanting to teach in us.
[00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.460]   Let me show you what the six values are going to be.
[00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:20.160]   Stepping out, the obedience to respond to the way that the Holy Spirit is, even when
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.000]   it's uncomfortable to do so.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:29.100]   The openness to changing our thinking and our traditions when God challenges them.
[00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.620]   The willingness to be persecuted for our faith.
[00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:33.620]   Come on church.
[00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.340]   Yeah, this is going to be a great series.
[00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:36.740]   Do come back next week, by the way.
[00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:37.740]   It's going to be...
[00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:42.180]   The sacrifice of trusting in Jesus, even when it might cost us dearly.
[00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:46.940]   The ability to commit to hardship when we know it has redemptive purpose.
[00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:50.140]   The call to sharing our faith radically, honestly, and hopefully.
[00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:57.780]   My friends, these are the core character values that the early church held inside of them,
[00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:00.980]   which enabled them to do the things that God wanted to do through them.
[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:06.220]   Not that they had a monopoly on what God was going to do, but when God acted, these things
[00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:10.540]   enabled them out of obedience, out of trust, out of the willingness to be persecuted, out
[00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:14.300]   of the openness to walking through hard times and hardships.
[00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:19.900]   They positioned themselves time and time again for the glory of God in the place that he
[00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:20.900]   had placed them.
[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:30.660]   Could you imagine a church in Hong Kong that was willing to be persecuted for its faith?
[00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:35.100]   Could you imagine a church that's willing to go through hardship knowing it has redemptive
[00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.340]   purpose?
[00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:41.740]   Could you imagine a church full of courageous and bold people sharing their faith because
[00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:46.940]   they've been liberated from the fear of man?
[00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:50.540]   I think this is not just something that God wants the Hong Kong church to hold.
[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:55.300]   I think it's something the global church needs at this time.
[00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.900]   We're going to go through this series together step by step, and we're going to bring some
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:01.100]   pretty challenging messages to you over the next six weeks.
[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:07.340]   My prayer is that God would do something within us, preparing us for the immediate lease of
[00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:08.340]   his sudden unlease.
[00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:11.740]   We're going to start today by just looking at the first of these.
[00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:16.020]   It's really just the first few verses of the book of Acts itself, because in these verses
[00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:21.300]   you see Jesus do something before any of the sudden unlease occur.
[00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:27.140]   Jesus prepares his disciples for their next step, for the way in which he can liberate
[00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:32.780]   them, release some things from them so that they could be best prepared for the sudden
[00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:33.780]   unlease to come.
[00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:36.340]   Let me read this to you from Acts chapter one, starting in verse one.
[00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:41.700]   "In my former book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and teach until
[00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:43.860]   the day that he was taken up to heaven.
[00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:47.900]   About giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles that he had chosen.
[00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:51.420]   After his suffering, he showed himself to these men and women and gave many convincing
[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:53.540]   proofs that he was alive.
[00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:58.100]   He appeared to them over a period of 40 days and spoke about the kingdom of God.
[00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:01.740]   On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command, 'Do not leave
[00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:07.180]   Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my father promised, which you have heard me speak about.
[00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:12.660]   For John baptized with water, but in a few days' time you will be baptized with the Holy
[00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:13.660]   Spirit.'"
[00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:15.500]   I love what Luke's doing here.
[00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:21.500]   He's writing this book to his Gentile benefactor, probably a wealthy Gentile called Theophilus
[00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.700]   who was interested in the Christian faith.
[00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:28.740]   He's writing a story about what happens in the early church to this person.
[00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:33.500]   He starts by capturing this moment where Jesus is in his resurrection and he's beginning
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:37.140]   to shape and mold the disciples for all that's next.
[00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:40.860]   I wonder if you've ever put yourself in the shoes of the disciples at the start of the
[00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:45.220]   book of Acts because here's these disciples and they've just encountered Jesus' death
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.220]   and resurrection.
[00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:50.580]   They've had to wrestle deeply with the reality of that, but now he's risen.
[00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:51.580]   They've seen him.
[00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:57.260]   He's appeared to them over 600 times, over a lot of times, and he's beginning to teach
[00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:58.500]   them about the new things.
[00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:02.980]   There's the great commission and then he says, "Stay in Jerusalem because I'm going to send
[00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:07.220]   you the spirit, which is going to be the thing that will power you for what's ahead."
[00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:11.500]   He's speaking about this, but the disciples are now wrestling with the reality that Jesus
[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.780]   actually is the Messiah.
[00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:16.980]   I want you to follow this because this is really important for the beginning of Acts.
[00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:21.060]   The disciples know that now Jesus is absolutely the Messiah.
[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:28.100]   In their mind, they're thinking that Jesus is going to do some very specific things next
[00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:32.380]   because they're thinking that they're in a situation where Jesus is now going to act
[00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:36.940]   how they had always anticipated he was going to act.
[00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:41.500]   They're posturing themselves for that, but then Jesus says, "Hey, I'm leaving."
[00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:45.100]   You can imagine the disciples going, "But you've only just come back.
[00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:46.100]   You've only just returned.
[00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:48.300]   What do you mean you're going to leave again?"
[00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:49.300]   They're thinking, "No, no, no.
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:50.300]   That can't work.
[00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:51.300]   That can't be."
[00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:52.300]   It's funny, right?
[00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:56.100]   The disciples have always struggled with the reality of trying to tell Jesus what to do.
[00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:57.940]   Have you noticed that?
[00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:01.100]   It's almost like the disciples look at Jesus and go, "God loves you, but we have a plan
[00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:02.860]   for you."
[00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:06.540]   Because remember right back before when Jesus was saying, "I'm going to have to die on the
[00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.660]   cross," there's Peter going, "No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:09.660]   That's not part of our plan.
[00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:11.220]   No, no, you don't need to die.
[00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.220]   It's cool, dude.
[00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:13.220]   You'll be fine."
[00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:14.900]   And he's like, "Get behind me, Satan."
[00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:15.900]   Remember that moment?
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:20.540]   Well, here's another moment like that because Jesus is saying, "Hey, I'm going to go, but
[00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.780]   I need to go because I'm going to send the Holy Spirit to you."
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:26.260]   And they're saying, "We don't want to downgrade Jesus.
[00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:27.980]   We want you here.
[00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:28.980]   You've resurrected.
[00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:30.100]   You're the Messiah.
[00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:31.100]   We want you here.
[00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:35.420]   And not only do we want you here, but there's still work for you to do, Jesus.
[00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:39.620]   You've still got some ideas for the things that you should be doing in your resurrection."
[00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:43.780]   In fact, it actually says here, notice this, follow on in verse six, it says, "So when
[00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:48.860]   they met together, they actually asked him this, 'Lord, are you at this time going to
[00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:50.380]   restore the kingdom of Israel?'"
[00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:54.900]   In other words, the disciples are like, "We have an idea, Lord, of what you're supposed
[00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.540]   to now be doing.
[00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:00.620]   And we know this because our rabbis have been teaching this in the synagogue and our prophets
[00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:05.980]   of old, prophets like Jeremiah and Isaiah and Amos and Daniel, they've been saying that
[00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:09.260]   a day will come when the Messiah will be here.
[00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.460]   And it will be like a day of Yahweh.
[00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:16.700]   The Son of Man will come down and be with us and sin will be eradicated and Israel will
[00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:17.980]   be restored."
[00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:19.180]   That's the word they use here.
[00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:20.340]   Are you going to restore?
[00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:23.980]   Are you going to bring everything back into the hands of Israel?
[00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:26.980]   They're expecting Jesus now to do that.
[00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:30.180]   And this is their idea of what they want Jesus.
[00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:33.620]   This is like, they're literally coming up to Jesus and going, "Yeah, that's nice about
[00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:35.500]   the Spirit, but Jesus, you're forgetting something.
[00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:37.540]   We've got a plan here.
[00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:39.840]   And we've been talking about this plan for a long time.
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:43.300]   And this plan, I just want you to show, we've actually done a really nice, cute map of this
[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.300]   plan, Jesus.
[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:45.300]   Let me just show you this."
[00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:46.300]   Right?
[00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:47.860]   The very first thing you're now going to do is get rid of the Romans.
[00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:50.220]   Yeah, you know, the nasty Romans.
[00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:51.380]   You're going to get rid of them.
[00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:54.020]   After that, you're then supposed to get rid of sin.
[00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:57.100]   If you want to get rid of sin first before the Romans, that's fine, but we'd rather you
[00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:58.420]   punish the Romans first.
[00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:00.660]   So that's why the Romans are there first.
[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:01.660]   Do you see this, Jesus?
[00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:05.500]   Don't worry, we've summarized it all in a bullet point form here, easy for you to follow.
[00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:08.100]   Here it is, Jesus.
[00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:11.420]   Now we laugh, but here's what I want to say to us.
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:14.860]   I think this is the first thing that Jesus wants to release from us as his church.
[00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:21.060]   I think so many of us, myself included, that's really how I am in relationship with Jesus
[00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:22.060]   in prayer.
[00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:24.060]   Come on, church.
[00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:28.740]   Jesus, I love you, but I have a plan for you.
[00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:32.260]   My plan for you is this, because I have some important things that I'm trying to do in
[00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:36.140]   life, and I'm trying to achieve some things, and I've got some ideas, Lord.
[00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:40.180]   In fact, if you have a moment, Jesus, I'd like to just take you into my map and just
[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:42.300]   show you a little bit of what I had in plan.
[00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:46.300]   Right here is when you're supposed to give me my spouse.
[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:52.740]   You haven't done that one yet, but I'm just highlighting it for you in case you forgot.
[00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:53.740]   But that's cool.
[00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:57.500]   After that, you can see that promotion I've been praying for.
[00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.420]   I know that's coming, right?
[00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:00.420]   And I know you want to do that.
[00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:01.420]   Are you with me?
[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:06.900]   Isn't it interesting that we as Christians, we have this plan, we have this idea, we have
[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:12.860]   a map for what we want Jesus to do, and it's like we're in this moment where we want him
[00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:15.380]   in our prayer lives to basically enact what we're doing.
[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:20.540]   Let me just say, not the whole of your plan that you have is bad, but it's your plan.
[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:21.540]   It's not his.
[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:25.700]   And maybe elements of it he will do, and the elements of it are great, and elements of
[00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:29.780]   it he might want to respond to, but it's not about you having a plan of what Jesus is going
[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:30.940]   to do in your life.
[00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:36.100]   It's about recognizing you're in an uncharted season, which means the plan has been stripped
[00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:42.620]   from you, which means he's placing you specifically in a moment where all the things that are
[00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:48.140]   on the list that you're constantly asking him to respond to, again, are not necessarily
[00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:52.740]   bad things, but he's wanting to shift your thinking and shift your spiritual life away
[00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:53.740]   from Jesus.
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:59.260]   Here's the things I need you now to do for me, to Jesus, what is it that you desire to
[00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:01.220]   do?
[00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:06.380]   What is on your heart, not just for me, but for the vine, and for Hong Kong, and for the
[00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:07.380]   city?
[00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:12.540]   We're in times where I don't know what's next, so Lord, I'm relying and I'm trusting on you.
[00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:17.220]   I'm letting go of what I would like, and I'm putting myself in an uncomfortable position
[00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:24.780]   to ask what you would like, and I'm willing to release anything from me that you do not
[00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:32.620]   like, even the plans that I have to prosper you, Jesus.
[00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:38.820]   That scripture, by the way, is I have plans to prosper you, says the Lord, but we Christians
[00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:42.980]   so often live in our prayer lives as we've got plans to prosper you, Jesus.
[00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:45.620]   Are you with me?
[00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:48.460]   We need to purge ourselves from that.
[00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:51.940]   Notice how Jesus responds, I think this is so beautiful.
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:56.260]   He says in verse seven, he said to them, "It is not for you to know the times or dates
[00:20:56.260 --> 00:21:00.020]   the Father has set by his own authority."
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:04.300]   He doesn't say it's not going to happen, he just wants to shift them away from something
[00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:05.540]   that is so critical here.
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:12.260]   He's saying, "It is not for you in a season of uncharted to have the answers to the timing
[00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:14.000]   of everything.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.100]   It's not for you to know the when of God," he's saying.
[00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:21.300]   In fact, he's basically saying to the disciples, "I want to liberate you.
[00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:22.380]   I want to free you.
[00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:28.080]   I want to release you from the prison that is created by your desire to know when I'm
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.420]   going to do everything."
[00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:33.740]   It is not for you to have the understanding of the when.
[00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:37.860]   The when of God is such a thing that we as Christians, I think, so hold onto.
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:42.380]   I know that so much in our prayer life, in our pastoral work, it's like, when is God
[00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:43.380]   going to come through?
[00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:44.380]   It's an interesting thing.
[00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:48.620]   When Christians have an idea of what they think the time frame should be for God and
[00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:53.420]   God doesn't act in their time frame, they get angry at God.
[00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:55.900]   I know I've done this many times in my own life.
[00:21:55.900 --> 00:22:00.980]   You've heard me tell many stories over the years of times where I've put God in a time
[00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:06.140]   box and God doesn't do it in that time box and I get frustrated and angry at God because
[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:10.180]   he hasn't done what I've wanted him to do when I was hoping he could do it.
[00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:12.820]   The disciples come to him and go, "Is now the time?"
[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:16.740]   And Jesus goes, "The first thing I need to do as you move into uncharted territory is
[00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:21.740]   to release you from the worry of time."
[00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:29.260]   Some of you in this room, you are so tied up in the frustration of the perceived delay
[00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:35.340]   in the delivery of God's activity in your life or the obsession you have for the need
[00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:41.300]   of the foreknowledge of it that you are totally unprepared to react and respond to it when
[00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:43.300]   it actually arrives.
[00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:50.180]   Church, man, I need you to read that and pause on that for a second.
[00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:57.660]   Some of us are so wound up by knowing the when, by holding on to the time frame that
[00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:05.100]   we have and the first thing God wants to do is liberate you from the desire that you have
[00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:07.300]   to know it all.
[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:12.500]   This was the desire that Adam and Eve had when they took the fruit in Genesis 3.
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:16.140]   What Satan said to them through the form of the snake was, "If you take this, you will
[00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:18.260]   be like God.
[00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:19.260]   You will know it all."
[00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:21.540]   It's the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:26.660]   And here's the disciples again saying, "We need to know what it is you're going to do."
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:31.140]   And Jesus says, "It's not for you to know the time.
[00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:34.820]   I want to liberate you from the concerns that you have for time."
[00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:39.020]   Because here's the thing, the reason why we are so concerned with time is because we want
[00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:41.200]   to control.
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:46.140]   We want to find some stability, particularly when we're out of our comfort zones.
[00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:50.540]   We want to find something that we can ridge ourselves into and if we could just know the
[00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:55.620]   timing that God has for certain things that can happen in our lives, that would, we think,
[00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:57.260]   free us to relax.
[00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:01.380]   And what God is saying is that your obsession with time, when that is not in your hands
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:04.980]   and not something you can control, that's you trying to be God.
[00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:06.460]   You're not God, you're human.
[00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:11.860]   I'm going to release your desire for the knowledge of the time of everything and you will find
[00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:17.380]   yourself at greater peace.
[00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:23.060]   See the path for peace in times that are uncharted is not the knowledge of the timing of everything
[00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:31.140]   but the release of the need for control and certainty in all that's going to happen.
[00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:34.020]   And we cannot start this time.
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:38.420]   We cannot start as a church in this season of uncharted until we've recognized that we
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:42.220]   need to release control.
[00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:48.380]   Release the control and the certainty that God is going to act and respond and instead
[00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:55.660]   posture our hearts in the place of character and values to be able to respond when he acts.
[00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:57.820]   Are you with me?
[00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:02.200]   Some of you here, this is a really, I'm going to pause on this one more time.
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:07.220]   Some of you here, this is a really significantly fundamental thing that you need to release
[00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:10.500]   today.
[00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:13.180]   And it's scary.
[00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:15.860]   It'll put you in your, out of your comfort zone.
[00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:20.180]   It'll put you in a place where you'll feel like you're losing control.
[00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:25.980]   But sometimes the need for us to feel like we're losing control or that we're out of
[00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:31.060]   that place of comfort is the starting point of everything that Jesus now wants to do in
[00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:32.700]   us.
[00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:35.180]   Notice how this is actually here in the scripture.
[00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:40.020]   Is this helping some people?
[00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:43.460]   It says here in verse 7, "It is not for you to know the times and the dates that the Father
[00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:48.580]   has set," verse 8, "but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you and you
[00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:52.660]   will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria and to the ends of the earth."
[00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:53.660]   I love this.
[00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:56.780]   He doesn't say, "Hey, I'm going to give you the answers."
[00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:58.820]   He doesn't say, "I'm going to sort out all your problems."
[00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:02.020]   He doesn't say, "I'm going to answer your timeframe, how you have it."
[00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:03.820]   We've come to him with our maps.
[00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:06.020]   He's gently rolled them back up again.
[00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:07.020]   But here's what he's saying.
[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:08.020]   "I'm not leaving you alone."
[00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:14.460]   He said, "You're going to receive power when my Holy Spirit comes upon you.
[00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:17.460]   So I'm not leaving you to just be here on your own.
[00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:20.860]   Equally, I'm not giving you a detailed map that's going to give you all the answers straight
[00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:21.860]   away.
[00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:24.060]   What I'm going to do, though, is put my power inside of you.
[00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:29.460]   I will pour out my Holy Spirit on you and that power will be what will mark you, will
[00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:30.860]   be what defines you.
[00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:32.380]   You're not getting answers.
[00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:34.580]   You're going to get my power.
[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:36.900]   You're not going to get the timing of everything.
[00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:39.420]   You're going to get my Spirit in your life.
[00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:43.140]   And when you have my power, then you can become."
[00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:44.940]   This is so important.
[00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:48.980]   So often, I think as a church, when we think about the power of the Holy Spirit, we think
[00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:50.020]   it's for us.
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:52.660]   We think it's for what happens here on a Sunday.
[00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:56.380]   We come in here longing for the worship and longing for the movement of the Holy Spirit
[00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:57.380]   amongst us.
[00:26:57.380 --> 00:26:58.380]   And we love that.
[00:26:58.380 --> 00:26:59.380]   And of course, we should.
[00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:00.380]   It's something to be celebrated.
[00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:02.180]   It is something to be expected and looked for.
[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:08.820]   But the power that Jesus is talking here about is not a feeling in a worship service.
[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:12.260]   What he's talking about here to the disciples is you're going to receive power.
[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:13.580]   And then notice what he says.
[00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:17.700]   He specifically says, "And then you will become."
[00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:19.900]   In the Greek, it says, "You will become."
[00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:21.860]   In our translation, it says, "You will be."
[00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:23.060]   It's future tense.
[00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:25.940]   What he's saying is, notice the journey, what Jesus is doing.
[00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:28.780]   He's saying, "Your plan, not going to work.
[00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:32.060]   Your obsession with timing is only going to cause you stress.
[00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:36.700]   I need you to release all of that so that you're a vessel ready to receive the power
[00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:37.700]   of my Spirit."
[00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:41.420]   But that power of the Spirit is not just there to make you feel good or to give you some
[00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:43.220]   gifts or to give you some fruit.
[00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:44.220]   As much as that is good.
[00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:46.260]   Here's what the power of that Spirit will do.
[00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:49.260]   It will make you to become.
[00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:51.140]   It will transform you.
[00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:57.140]   It will form you, shape you into the person that I need you to be in the time of Uncharted.
[00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:02.580]   The reason why the Holy Spirit is poured out in seasons of Uncharted is because the Spirit
[00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:05.180]   longs to change us.
[00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:07.380]   Longs to transform us and renew us.
[00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:10.580]   The focus is on character over competency.
[00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:14.320]   So the Spirit comes to reform and to change.
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:20.820]   And so a season of Uncharted is a spiritual formation season.
[00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:26.580]   By its very nature, times of Uncharted are Spirit empowered.
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:31.660]   And because they're Spirit empowered, they're designed to change something within us.
[00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:33.340]   To release sin from us.
[00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:34.740]   To strengthen us.
[00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:40.460]   To give us the character and the values that we will need so we can respond immediately
[00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:42.500]   to the sudden needs that are around us.
[00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:46.520]   And our vision here at the Vine is growing big people.
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.460]   It's a maturity vision.
[00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:50.660]   It's a spiritual formation vision.
[00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:53.020]   And this is why God's bringing us into the Uncharted.
[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:54.740]   It's not to freak you out.
[00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:56.660]   It's not to make you feel uncomfortable.
[00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:59.780]   It's actually to change you.
[00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:03.340]   You got to understand that the greatest times of spiritual growth and change will happen
[00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:07.540]   in your life when you have to rely 100% on Jesus and nothing else.
[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:11.620]   The greatest times of spiritual growth and change in your life will happen when you let
[00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:15.100]   go of your need to know everything.
[00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:23.180]   The greatest spiritual change that will happen is when you actually say, "I am open to whatever
[00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:27.620]   is your heart, your agenda, your plans, your strategy, whatever it is that you want to
[00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:28.620]   do.
[00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:29.620]   I have no idea.
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:33.380]   But whatever it is that you want to do, I want to receive it in the name of Jesus.
[00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:34.540]   Make me into one."
[00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:37.900]   Oh, let me preach on this real quick.
[00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:38.900]   This is not my notes.
[00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:42.420]   Let me preach on this real quick.
[00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:44.060]   The prodigal son is one of my favorite stories.
[00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:46.340]   And it's because the prodigal son goes in this journey.
[00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:51.340]   At the start, he goes to his father and he says, "Give me my inheritance."
[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:54.700]   And then he goes and he squanders it and he's in a place of incredible uncomfort because
[00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:56.260]   of his sin and his brokenness.
[00:29:56.260 --> 00:30:00.360]   And he decides in that place that it's better to be a servant in his father's household
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:02.660]   than to be in the muck and the mire that he found himself in.
[00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:06.020]   And as he goes to his father, his father runs towards him.
[00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:12.500]   And the first words out of the mouth of the prodigal son is this, "Lord, make me.
[00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:14.420]   Make me like one of your servants."
[00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:17.980]   There's something that happens in the life of the prodigal where he goes from, "God,
[00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:22.060]   give me," to, "God, make me."
[00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:24.500]   And that's the journey of the uncharted.
[00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:27.660]   That's the spiritual formation journey that we're in right now.
[00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:31.660]   And I want to encourage you, challenge you to be open to whatever the Holy Spirit wants
[00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:32.660]   to do.
[00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:34.060]   Because there is a make me that I need.
[00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:37.900]   And I'm sure there is for you too.
[00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:39.780]   What is it that he is making us into?
[00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:45.660]   He then says this, "That you would become my witnesses in Jerusalem and in Judea and
[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:47.580]   Samaria and to the ends of the earth."
[00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:49.980]   He says, "You will become my witnesses."
[00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:50.980]   Notice this.
[00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:55.140]   The word witness there in the Greek is the word martyris, which is where we get martyrdom
[00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:56.140]   from.
[00:30:56.140 --> 00:31:00.180]   It's the idea of living such a way that people can see.
[00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:05.420]   It was actually a legal term and it was literally designed in the legal concepts of those days
[00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:10.780]   to be somebody can prove the verification of facts by how they've experienced and lived
[00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:11.780]   their lives.
[00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:18.180]   A witness is someone who demonstrates and declares what it is that has happened for
[00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:19.180]   them.
[00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:24.140]   So this emphasis of demonstrating and declaring, not just saying, but living.
[00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:28.060]   Remember a few weeks ago, we spoke about the idea of a new song that is on our mouths so
[00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:30.460]   that we can live it out so people can see it.
[00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:32.100]   That's a witness.
[00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:38.620]   So when Jesus says, "My spirit is going to fall on you and empower you to become a witness,"
[00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:43.440]   what he's saying is, "This is all about you in public space.
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:48.900]   This is all about me doing something in you so that you would be something of me out there."
[00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:52.740]   He doesn't come to the church, to the disciples at the beginning of their formation of the
[00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:58.060]   church and say, "I'm going to pour out my spirit of power upon you so that you would
[00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:00.340]   be my privately blessed individuals."
[00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:02.860]   Come on, church.
[00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:06.500]   He doesn't say, "So that you will be my privately blessed individuals and you'll have a great
[00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:08.580]   time for 90 minutes on a Sunday.
[00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:09.580]   Woo-hoo!"
[00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:13.540]   He says, "No, I'm pouring out my spirit on you because I'm moving you into uncharted
[00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:14.540]   seasons.
[00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:15.540]   Take away your strategy.
[00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:18.540]   Take away your obsession about the timing of everything.
[00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:23.180]   Receive my power because I want to shape and form in you something so much that you would
[00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:30.780]   then be a public testimony, a public witness to my power, my spirit, my life in the world.
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:34.700]   You're going to be a witness," he says, "in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, to the ends of
[00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:35.700]   the world.
[00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:42.260]   It's going to be about what I do within you so that the church would be public, not private,
[00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:47.460]   huddled together as much as we love doing this, but we do this on behalf of everything
[00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:50.780]   that's going to happen in your week ahead.
[00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:55.860]   This is uncharted, that we would be so filled with the spirit, that we're so changed within
[00:32:55.860 --> 00:33:01.260]   us that we become the living witnesses of God in the world."
[00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:06.420]   This is why the first value that Jesus is instilling into the disciples right at the
[00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:12.140]   start is this obedience to the work of the spirit, even if that means it's going to be
[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:14.900]   uncomfortable for you.
[00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:18.860]   Are you going to be obedient to what the spirit is doing, even though that might put
[00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:20.900]   you in some challenging situations?
[00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:24.380]   Maybe that will put you in a place where it's uncomfortable, but are you willing to live
[00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:29.700]   your life so much that you would become a witness of him, one who demonstrates and declares
[00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:32.380]   to the glory of God in the world around him?
[00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:36.300]   And this, my friends, becomes all of the book of Acts from this point.
[00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:40.020]   This is why all of this is so important and why Jesus is teaching this right at the start
[00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:43.760]   into his church because he's shaking off some of the dust that was going to settle on them.
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:45.260]   He's preparing them for what's ahead.
[00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:49.740]   And in the future, in the weeks ahead, and we're going to see this in the series a lot,
[00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:56.620]   his people become responders, witnesses to the power and the glory of God simply because
[00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:59.460]   they said they were open.
[00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:03.340]   In fact, let me show you one example of this very quickly here this morning as we draw
[00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:04.340]   to a close.
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:05.340]   I love this example.
[00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:07.420]   This is found in Acts chapter 8.
[00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:08.420]   Follow this.
[00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:13.060]   "Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, Philip, one of the disciples, 'Go south to
[00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:17.220]   the road, the desert road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.'
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:19.020]   So he started out."
[00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:21.220]   Notice this.
[00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:23.900]   Philip had no idea what God was going to do that day.
[00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:28.380]   He didn't go, "Okay, God, thank you for speaking to me this morning in my quiet time.
[00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:29.380]   I really appreciate that.
[00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:31.260]   Great to have your voice in my life.
[00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:32.260]   You want me to go down a road.
[00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:34.540]   First of all, I need to know exactly how to walk down that road.
[00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:37.500]   It would be really good if you could tell me what's ahead down that road.
[00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:40.020]   I'd like to get prepared for all of that."
[00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:44.100]   This would be like God saying to me one morning, "Andrew, I want you to walk down one chai
[00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:45.620]   road.
[00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:49.860]   I want you to walk from the Causeway Bay end towards central, and I just want you to walk."
[00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:51.060]   And me going, "I'm going to walk."
[00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:54.540]   And you guys going, "What is Andrew doing?"
[00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:56.460]   Philip just has no idea.
[00:34:56.460 --> 00:35:02.420]   But notice, he's obedient to the Holy Spirit, even though it might be uncomfortable, even
[00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:05.140]   though he doesn't have all the answers, even though he doesn't know how things are going
[00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:07.260]   to work out, but he's willing to go.
[00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:08.620]   Notice what happens next.
[00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:13.100]   "So then he stepped out, and on his way he met an Ethiopian eunuch, an important official
[00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:17.220]   in charge of all the treasury of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians.
[00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:22.860]   This man had gone to Jerusalem to worship, and on his way home was sitting in his chariot
[00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:25.700]   reading the book of the Isaiah, the prophet.
[00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:30.220]   The Spirit told Philip, 'Go to that chariot and stay near it.'"
[00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:31.580]   Isn't this great?
[00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:34.480]   So here's Philip, no idea what's about to happen.
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:36.860]   No idea, but he's being faithful to what the Spirit's told him to do.
[00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:41.340]   He's walking randomly down this road, but in the side, the story is God is brewing up
[00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:43.540]   something that only God can brew up.
[00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:49.420]   And here's this Ethiopian eunuch, this man of standing in the upper Nile region of Africa,
[00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:52.820]   one that God has been working on his heart already, one who's actually gone to Jerusalem
[00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:57.260]   to learn what it might be to worship this Yahweh, to worship this God, and to wonder
[00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:59.080]   what the Messiah might be all about.
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:03.660]   So God's at work with the Ethiopian, and he's at work with Philip, who's willing to live
[00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:04.660]   in a certain way.
[00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:07.060]   And it's almost like God is bringing these two things together, and you can see God's
[00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:09.380]   excitement as they come closer and closer together.
[00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:10.600]   You following this?
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:11.600]   So here's Philip.
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:12.600]   Now notice this.
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:14.940]   Then the Holy Spirit says, "Go and stand alongside of that chariot."
[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:18.220]   Now the chariot was walking at the time, so he's having to run alongside this chariot.
[00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:21.980]   I mean, he's looking like an idiot at this moment.
[00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:25.780]   But he's willing to be uncomfortable in obedience to the Holy Spirit.
[00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:27.500]   He's running alongside the chariot.
[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:30.840]   He has no idea why he's running alongside the chariot.
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:35.960]   But as he's running alongside of it, he hears the person inside reading from the scroll,
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:38.480]   the book of Isaiah.
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:41.280]   Now here's the fascinating thing.
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:46.560]   At this point, notice what happens, because what we think is going to happen doesn't.
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:50.640]   It says here, "Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading from Isaiah the
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:51.640]   prophet.
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:53.360]   'Do you understand what you are reading?'
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:54.360]   Philip asked.
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:55.360]   'How can I?' he said.
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.880]   'Unless someone explains it to me.'
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:00.680]   So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him."
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:04.760]   I love this moment because the Holy Spirit has said, "Go down this road."
[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:05.760]   He had gone.
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.520]   The Holy Spirit said, "Go alongside this chariot."
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:09.040]   He had gone alongside this chariot.
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:11.000]   Now the Holy Spirit said, "Talk to the guy."
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.240]   No, the Holy Spirit didn't say that.
[00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:18.000]   The Holy Spirit led him to the very place where then Philip, because he's got a character
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.640]   over competency, because he knows he's uncharted waters, because the Holy Spirit has been forming
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:25.040]   and shaping him when he gets alongside the chariot.
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:28.240]   The Holy Spirit doesn't have to tell him to begin to witness to the gospel.
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:34.240]   No, he hears someone reading Isaiah and his immediate response, the immediacy to God suddenly
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:37.200]   is to say, "Do you understand what you're reading?
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:39.800]   Because if not, I'd love to explain it to you."
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:41.600]   And the Ethiopian's like, "Dude, come on up.
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:42.600]   Sit with me."
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:44.680]   And they sit together and he shares the gospel with him.
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:49.560]   The Ethiopian believes the gospel, repents of his sin, gets baptized, and for all we
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:53.520]   know, he's the very first African convert to Christianity.
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:58.960]   And then he's going to return back to Africa and a whole continent gets evangelized because
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:04.440]   of this one moment, because Philip was obedient to the Spirit, was looking for the Spirit,
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:08.600]   walked with the Spirit, but then was willing to respond with an immediate lead to God suddenly.
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.480]   Are you with me?
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:16.520]   A whole nation comes to faith through somebody with that kind of faith.
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:19.600]   Let me close with a story.
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:26.000]   Last week, I shared the story about my mobile phone dying on me in the Camino and I shared
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.800]   about how bad that was, but I actually only shared half the story with you.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:32.400]   Let me now share the other half of the story as we close.
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:37.920]   My phone had completely died, broken, gone, and four days into it being busted, I was
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:38.920]   getting more and more frustrated.
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:42.560]   Frustrated I couldn't speak to my wife and daughter, frustrated I couldn't navigate well
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:46.000]   every day, frustrated I had to rely on everybody else.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.480]   But my frustrations that day were even more because I'd realized the night before, borrowing
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:54.400]   somebody else's mobile phone, that the next mobile phone store was in a city seven days
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.160]   walk away.
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:58.560]   And so I realized that not only am I facing these first four days, but I'm going to have
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:02.640]   another seven days before I can actually get a phone up and running and be able to touch
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:04.400]   base with the people I needed to touch base with.
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.200]   So I was feeling this huge amount of frustration.
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:08.280]   I was walking really angry at God.
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:10.840]   Anyone been angry at God here?
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:12.480]   Just your pastor.
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:16.440]   So I'm walking angry at God and I'd just gone through a village.
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:17.920]   I'd had a rest stop at this village.
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:20.520]   I'd filled up my water and everything and I was good to go.
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:24.560]   And so I came to this another village and I was expecting to walk through this village,
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:27.760]   which happened a lot on the Camino, because I'd just stopped so I didn't need to stop.
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:29.200]   So I was going to walk through this village.
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:32.840]   And as I'm walking through the village, out of this cafe, this lady goes, "Andrew, come
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:34.640]   and sit with me."
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:37.880]   That's how her voice exactly sounded, by the way, just exactly like that.
[00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:40.760]   Anyway, it was this lady, Jane, that I'd met a couple of nights before.
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:43.840]   Didn't know super well at that time, met her a couple of nights before, but she wanted
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:44.840]   me to go sit with her.
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:47.920]   And the last thing I wanted to do was to stop and sit with her because I'd just stopped
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.040]   in the previous village.
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:52.720]   And in the Camino, there's this unwritten code that if you wave and smile and keep walking,
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:54.160]   then that just means you want to keep going.
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:55.480]   And it's not seen as rude.
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:57.720]   So I'm prepared to just wave at her.
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:59.120]   And I feel like the Holy Spirit speaks to me.
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:04.360]   And the Holy Spirit speaks really strongly and says, "You need to go sit with her."
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:08.280]   And I'm like, "Okay."
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:12.560]   So rather than walk on, I turn around and I sit down with Jane at this cafe.
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:14.400]   And she asked me this question as soon as I sit down.
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.400]   It's a really interesting question.
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:18.360]   She said, "If you could change anything about the Camino, what would you change?"
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:23.840]   And I said, "Well, right now, I would like to get in a bus, go seven days down the road
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:27.520]   on this bus, get to this place and buy a mobile phone."
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:29.280]   And I told her about my story about the mobile phone.
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:32.200]   As I'm talking to her, she's listening to me very gently.
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:36.160]   She gets her backpack out and she opens up her backpack and she fishes inside the backpack
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:38.620]   and she pulls out a mobile phone.
[00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:42.680]   And she says, "Andrew, a couple of months ago when I was preparing for the Camino, I
[00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:47.240]   felt God tell me to bring a spare mobile phone with me."
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:51.440]   And she said, "I pushed back on it because it's carrying extra weight in the bag and
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:53.960]   you know that nobody wants to carry any extra weight.
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:58.200]   But I've been carrying this spare mobile phone for two weeks in the Camino for no reason
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:40:59.240]   why I was carrying it.
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:00.440]   Now you've just shared your story with me."
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:04.100]   She goes, "I think God wants me to give you this phone."
[00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:05.960]   And I said, "You are right.
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:11.840]   He does want you to."
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:12.840]   Faithful woman.
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:13.840]   Faithful woman.
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:14.840]   Thank you.
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:19.800]   So, as I'm taking this phone from her, this other pilgrim walks in.
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:20.800]   He's a German.
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:21.800]   He's like, "Hello."
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:22.800]   I don't know how to do Germans.
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:23.800]   I'm not going to do a German accent.
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:26.440]   But he says, "Can I join you at your table?"
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:27.440]   And we're like, "Yeah, sure."
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:31.280]   He's a young German guy and he comes and sits down and he's like, "What are you doing?"
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:34.040]   You know, like he sees us like handing phones back and forth.
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.120]   It's the worst German accent ever.
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:40.040]   But he sees us like handing phones back and forth and I say, "Oh, well, you know."
[00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:43.400]   And I share the story about everything that happened and his eyes lit up and he goes,
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:44.400]   "Oh, back in Germany."
[00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:47.400]   He's like, "Back in Germany, I work in a mobile phone store.
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:51.720]   And every day, all day long, I take people's old phones and I get them up and working on
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:52.720]   a new phone.
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:55.480]   If you give me your phone and if you take the SIM card out of your old phone, I will
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:57.440]   get your phone working in 15 minutes.
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:01.440]   And 15 minutes later, I suddenly have a brand spanking new mobile phone.
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:02.440]   Isn't that awesome?"
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:03.440]   So, here they are.
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:04.440]   Let me show you a photo of them.
[00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:05.440]   There they are.
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:12.240]   Now, I will admit to you.
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:16.320]   I will admit to you that Philip's story is way better than mine because Philip evangelized
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:21.520]   a whole nation and I just got a mobile phone.
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:26.200]   But maybe it demonstrates that God works in this way in big and small ways and that we
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:30.560]   never know what it is that God is going to do but he is orchestrating it all.
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:36.960]   And in times of unchartedness, we can't predict the suddenlies but we can be prepared to react
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:37.960]   with the immediatelies.
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:42.480]   And the way we do that is we have to let go of those plans and strategies of what we want
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:45.000]   or think Jesus should do for us.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.800]   We have to strip ourselves of the when of God and we have to place ourselves open to
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:56.680]   receive the power of the Spirit that changes us within us and prepares us that when the
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:43:02.440]   Holy Spirit says, "Go," we go.
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:03.440]   Let me pray for us.
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:04.440]   Let's pray.
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:08.960]   Father, I thank you for each person here in this room.
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:12.800]   I thank you for what it is that you're doing in their hearts and in their lives.
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:17.440]   And I thank you that you have moved them into a season that is uncharted.
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:21.680]   And Lord, we have no idea what it is that you're about to do.
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:27.960]   Lord, on that day I had no idea I was going to get a new phone.
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:31.120]   And Lord, the people in this room have no idea what tomorrow is going to hold in the
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:35.160]   adventure and the excitement of an uncharted season.
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:39.640]   But Lord, I want to pray that we can prepare ourselves for the immediatelies.
[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:45.520]   And I want to pray for each person here in this moment that you would strip away, that
[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:52.380]   you would release, Lord, the things that we are relying on that are not of you.
[00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:57.800]   Whether that's our own plans, whether that's our desire for the timing and the when of
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:02.880]   God, whether that's the frustrations because it feels like you're not answering us on the
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:04.960]   ways and the time where you thought.
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:09.260]   Lord, I believe you want to strip from people in this room right now just an over-reliance
[00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:13.640]   on the things that are only going to create more frustration in the season ahead.
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:18.240]   And instead, you want to pour out the power of your Holy Spirit.
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:22.440]   So Lord, I want to pray for each person here as they release what it is that you're calling
[00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:28.700]   them to release here this morning, that they would be filled with the power of God.
[00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:33.460]   With the power of God so that they could become your witnesses.
[00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:41.120]   That they would become public manifestations of the mercy and the grace and the love of
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:43.000]   Jesus.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:48.960]   That they would be like Philip, able to react and respond as the Holy Spirit leads without
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:51.400]   fear.
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:54.000]   So Lord, we come against fear.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.480]   We come against the things that hold us rooted to the known.
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:01.820]   We come against the things that would want to root us to where things are comfortable
[00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:02.820]   for us.
[00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:09.860]   And Lord, we pray that you would fill us with such power that we wouldn't just see the dramatic
[00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:14.320]   things that we would see in these 90 minutes on a Sunday together as great as they are.
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:19.960]   But it would be the fuel that would drive us outwards to the people of this city that
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:20.960]   you love so much.
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:27.440]   There are so many Ethiopian eunuchs just outside the doors of this community.
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:32.180]   Lord, I pray that you would send your church.
[00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:34.120]   I pray you would send us, Lord.
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:39.080]   And that over this sermon series, we would get the values inside of us, the character
[00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:46.640]   over competency that we will need for the incredible, amazing things you are about to
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:47.640]   do.
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:49.200]   We thank you for this in Jesus' name.
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:50.920]   Everyone says, "Hey, would you stand with me?
[00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:54.760]   I know we've gone a bit late today, but I want to just finish our time with some time
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:57.040]   in worship as we just allow the Spirit to move.
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:58.720]   So let's take some time to do that now."
