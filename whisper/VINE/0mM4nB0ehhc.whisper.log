[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440]   What do you see when you worship? What do you focus on when you step into the space?
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.560]   Do you see the band sometimes and just admire them? Do you see others and think about the
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.800]   relationship you have with them? Maybe you have friends here and you step into the space and you
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.240]   really wanted to connect with your friends. Do you see yourself out of place maybe trying to fit in
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.640]   or do what everyone every other one is doing and try to worship as other worship? My worship wasn't
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:34.560]   the songs that I sing. My worship was not the way that I posture myself. My worship is the way I
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.720]   broke down and I told God that I can't sing anymore. My heart is not ready yet but my tears
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.400]   are coming out because I know your love for me is real. And I just want to tell you when you come
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.200]   into the space today, when you come in and you see friends and you see the team and you see
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.760]   everything happening so wonderfully, also take a moment to see what God is talking to you. What is
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.600]   he showing you and revealing to you? When we say that true worship is not about saying the right
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:12.560]   thing, when we say true worship is the response we make, when our hearts are moved by his revelation,
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.440]   what is he revealing to you today? Is he telling you about his holiness?
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:27.760]   Is he telling you about his greatness? How is your heart moved today?
