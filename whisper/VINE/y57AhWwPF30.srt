1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
 Hey, it's so good to see you all.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,800
 I think for once I actually feel healthy.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,040
 So I've been having a lot of colds.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,440
 It's just good to feel good.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:18,000
 This is the second time actually that I lived in Hong Kong.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,320
 So I've lived in Germany.

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,440
 I lived in the US.

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,280
 I lived in Germany.

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,160
 I lived in Hong Kong.

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:23,920
 I lived in the US.

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,120
 I lived in Germany--

12
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:25,800
 Hong Kong.

13
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,200
 So anyhow, it's back and forth.

14
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,560
 So these three countries I'm circling.

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,400
 And when I was in my 30s here in Hong Kong, I had this--

16
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,080
 I don't know.

17
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,900
 I don't even know exactly what I was doing.

18
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,520
 I was reflecting, praying.

19
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,360
 And I just suddenly was overcome with this just sense

20
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,040
 of gratitude just for God's goodness.

21
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,480
 And specifically for the people that God

22
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,560
 had placed in my life to just come around me, to support me,

23
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,920
 to encourage me, to love me, to help me in very practical ways.

24
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,520
 So one of those people was Ryan.

25
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,760
 When I was my first year in university, I was in the US.

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,560
 My English was not good.

27
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,320
 And I really struggled with writing papers.

28
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,680
 So Ryan, he came alongside me.

29
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,480
 And he helped me with editing my papers.

30
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,840
 There was no AI.

31
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,760
 He helped me with editing my papers

32
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,560
 and teaching me how to write better.

33
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,800
 And I really needed it.

34
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,280
 And I saw, wow, God loved me through Ryan

35
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,560
 and provided for me through Ryan.

36
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,160
 Then I thought of Deborah, I should say,

37
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,960
 Professor Deborah Worden.

38
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,920
 And she encouraged me in my studies

39
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,120
 and saw something in me that I didn't see myself.

40
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:46,280
 She opened up an internship opportunity, not something

41
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,480
 that was already a professional internship.

42
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,840
 And it really helped me.

43
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,800
 So again, God had placed a person around me

44
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,080
 that helped me in a very practical way.

45
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,640
 And that encouraged me.

46
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,400
 Then there was Stephen.

47
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,720
 Now Stephen was an incredible Christian leader.

48
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,480
 But he was also a vulnerable person.

49
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,040
 So he shared vulnerably about some of the challenges

50
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,000
 he was facing.

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,440
 And when I was facing challenges, guess who I went to?

52
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,360
 I went to Stephen.

53
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,820
 And I didn't even know what to say.

54
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,320
 I couldn't even put into words what was going on with me.

55
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,120
 And then he invited me into a men's group.

56
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,120
 And this men's group encouraged me and helped

57
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,160
 me journey through some difficulties

58
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,160
 that I was facing.

59
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,240
 So these are all these ways, and more, of course,

60
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,960
 but just some examples of how God loved

61
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,520
 and how he cared for me through people.

62
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,280
 So as I was sitting there in this realization

63
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,400
 of God's goodness and his grace and his provision,

64
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:55,240
 I suddenly had the Holy Spirit nudge me and saying,

65
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,520
 it's your turn.

66
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,240
 So I was like, ooh, what does that mean?

67
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,480
 It's your turn.

68
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,120
 And so it was not like--

69
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,160
 I was actually a pastor at this time.

70
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,280
 So it's not like I wasn't helping people or serving

71
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,440
 people.

72
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,080
 But I knew that the Holy Spirit was asking

73
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,840
 me to go deeper in letting God's love, his grace, his mercy

74
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,680
 flow through me to other people.

75
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,480
 That too long had I been, to use the image of a river,

76
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,000
 I had this river of God's love, care, provision

77
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,120
 flow through me to me from other people.

78
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,680
 But then on the other end, there was just

79
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,000
 a little trickle that came out.

80
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,960
 And God wanted me not only to receive all these blessings.

81
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,040
 We sang earlier, I am blessed.

82
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,400
 And I'm anointed.

83
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,760
 And I'm loved.

84
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,680
 And that's all true.

85
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,800
 And that's amazing.

86
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,240
 But he didn't want his blessings, his mercy, his love,

87
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,880
 his grace to stop with me.

88
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,960
 He wanted that to flow through me

89
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:10,600
 in a fuller and in a deeper way.

90
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,720
 And so I don't know where you are on this journey.

91
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,200
 I really believe this is a journey.

92
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,200
 This is not a one-time thing in terms

93
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:24,760
 of letting God's love and grace and mercy flow through us.

94
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,360
 Maybe for you, the starting point

95
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,840
 is even coming to know Jesus and coming to know his love.

96
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,200
 Maybe that's you.

97
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:36,160
 Maybe you're here and you're just figuring out,

98
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,640
 is this Christian thing?

99
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,640
 Is this something that makes sense, something

100
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,920
 that I believe?

101
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,460
 But wherever you are on this journey,

102
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,720
 whether you're not a Christian or you are a Christian,

103
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,560
 you know God's love.

104
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:56,480
 He is inviting us today to allow the Holy Spirit to do work in us

105
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:02,560
 and to love and serve the people that he has placed around us,

106
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,720
 and maybe even some people we don't even know yet,

107
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,560
 and just to uplift them, to build them up,

108
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:15,320
 and to be tangible expressions of the love of God.

109
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,940
 And so what I want to do with you today

110
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,280
 is I want to explore this question.

111
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,760
 It's how can we become people and communities

112
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:29,040
 through whom God's love, grace, and peace increasingly

113
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,280
 flows to those around us?

114
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,320
 How do we do that?

115
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,160
 How do we even get started on this journey?

116
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,720
 So that's what we're going to explore through this message.

117
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,200
 Now we are in our final message of Forward Together,

118
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,840
 where we've been taking some time to really align

119
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,800
 our hearts with each other, to talk about unity,

120
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,360
 and keeping the unity, and maintaining the unity

121
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,640
 that the Spirit of God has brought about

122
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,440
 when he has made us brothers and sisters in Christ.

123
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,280
 That's our job to work through things, and to be humble,

124
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,320
 and to be gentle, and to be patient, and to be loving,

125
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,040
 and to work through our differences.

126
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,640
 And instead of walking away, we've

127
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,360
 been looking at that we come from different backgrounds, who

128
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,600
 have different values, and different perspectives,

129
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,500
 and different experiences.

130
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,280
 And we come from different generations,

131
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,640
 but yet God has brought us together.

132
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,360
 And he doesn't want to diminish our diversity.

133
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,080
 He actually wants to use it.

134
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,200
 So everybody has something to contribute.

135
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,200
 Everybody has something to offer.

136
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:42,400
 Everybody has something unique to image from who God is.

137
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,920
 And so through you, with you being here,

138
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,880
 God reveals part of who he is, and will do something unique

139
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,640
 because you are there.

140
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,400
 And that's equally true for every single person.

141
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,600
 And so then we also looked at children.

142
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,440
 You don't know how hard children-- they're not

143
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,800
 the future of the church, not some nuance--

144
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,160
 not nuance, whatever that English word is.

145
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,600
 You can choose your own English word.

146
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,120
 Still learning the language, right?

147
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:17,840
 But that they are already part of God's family,

148
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,720
 that they are already contributing,

149
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,320
 that we can learn from them, that they are examples of how

150
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:29,240
 we receive God's love, and how we can depend on him,

151
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,440
 and trust him.

152
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,000
 So Pastor June talked about this.

153
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,320
 And so we wanted to take this time

154
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,800
 because we want to move forward together

155
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,640
 into uncharted territories, which is

156
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,080
 part of our vision this year, and to do the work that God has

157
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,680
 for us, the good work, so we can do them together.

158
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,440
 And we're not one group's rushing ahead,

159
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,120
 and others are staying behind.

160
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,600
 But that we are aligned, that we are unified,

161
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,320
 and that we are together moving into that direction.

162
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:03,360
 And so today, let me set the background for the text

163
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,760
 that we're going to look at.

164
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,440
 We're in Paul's letter to the Ephesians.

165
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,440
 Now, the Ephesians or Ephesus, or the letter to Ephesians

166
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,280
 was written to new Christians.

167
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,080
 It was people who had just come to faith.

168
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,080
 They came from different religious backgrounds,

169
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,080
 most of them.

170
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,620
 And Paul really wanted them to understand

171
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,200
 their identity in Christ.

172
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,720
 Because just because we're Christian

173
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,440
 doesn't mean that we have clarity about who Jesus is,

174
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,600
 the significance of his death for us,

175
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,160
 about our own Christian identity,

176
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,520
 and about our identity as a church, as a people of God,

177
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,520
 as a body of Christ.

178
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,080
 And so in the first three chapters,

179
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,840
 Paul unpacks the significance of the salvation

180
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,080
 in a beautiful way.

181
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,760
 So if you've never done this, read--

182
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,280
 actually, read all of Ephesians, but especially

183
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,320
 first three chapters, he really just

184
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:05,880
 unpacks the implications of Jesus's death and resurrection

185
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,400
 and his love.

186
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,000
 And so-- and we're going to be in that section today.

187
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,760
 But we're going to pick things up right

188
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:19,120
 after Paul has been talking about individual salvation,

189
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,720
 where he has talked about that you were dead in your sins,

190
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,760
 but now you have been made alive with Christ,

191
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,680
 that you're not saved out of your own strength

192
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:32,080
 or your works, but you're saved by grace through faith alone.

193
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,760
 And so right after that, that's where we pick up.

194
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,360
 And that's where we focus on the corporate aspect of salvation.

195
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,440
 And so here we are, Ephesians 2, verse 11.

196
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,480
 Let me start there.

197
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,080
 "Therefore remember that formerly you,

198
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:51,160
 who are Gentiles by birth and called uncircumcised by those

199
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,380
 who call themselves the circumcision which

200
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:56,240
 is done in the body by human hands,

201
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,960
 remember that at that time you were separated from Christ,

202
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,920
 excluded from citizenship in Israel,

203
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,400
 and foreigners to the covenant of the promise without hope

204
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,640
 and without God in the world.

205
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,460
 But now in Christ Jesus, you who once were far away

206
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,240
 have been brought near by the blood of Christ.

207
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,800
 For he himself is our peace, who has made the two groups one

208
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,860
 and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility

209
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:27,500
 by setting aside in his flesh the law with the commands

210
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,020
 and the regulations.

211
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:33,900
 His purpose was to create in himself one new humanity out

212
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:38,020
 of the two, thus making peace, and in one body

213
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:42,500
 to reconcile both them to God through the cross by which he

214
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,720
 put to death their hostility."

215
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,540
 So Paul here, he starts off by reminding

216
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:55,140
 the Ephesian Christians of their former division

217
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,060
 between Jews and Gentiles.

218
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,360
 Now Gentiles is basically everyone who's not a Jew.

219
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:06,020
 So Ephesus had people from all over the world,

220
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,260
 similar to Hong Kong.

221
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,100
 So there was Greeks, there was Romans,

222
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,140
 there was Egyptians and Persians.

223
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:17,180
 It was a multicultural city.

224
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:21,140
 But there was division between people.

225
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,700
 There was hatred and hostility between people.

226
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:28,920
 And one way we can see that is where

227
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,920
 it says that the Jewish people called

228
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,900
 the Gentiles uncircumcised.

229
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,460
 Now for us, that probably doesn't mean much.

230
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,700
 But basically, that was an insult.

231
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,620
 I was saying, you're not part of the covenant of God.

232
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,100
 You're not part of God's promises.

233
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:49,180
 And the Gentiles, we know from the historian Josephus,

234
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,820
 they returned the favor.

235
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,980
 They called them the circumcised one,

236
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,300
 and they made fun of them.

237
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,020
 So there's a name calling.

238
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:56,940
 And I think we--

239
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,740
 I don't want to get into names today,

240
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,400
 but we all know names that one group of people

241
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,540
 call another group of people, and that

242
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:08,140
 are there to put people down.

243
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,500
 And so that's what's going on here.

244
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,620
 But there is a second way that we can see this division.

245
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:18,380
 And it's in verse 14, a little phrase.

246
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:21,660
 In the text through Jesus, this is already being resolved.

247
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,020
 But I want to look at that a little bit.

248
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:28,780
 It talks about the dividing wall of hostility.

249
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:33,020
 That there was-- before they became a family,

250
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:36,780
 there was a dividing wall of hostility between them.

251
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:40,900
 Now, there is a chance or a good likelihood

252
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:45,780
 that this actually referred to a literal dividing wall

253
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,220
 in the Jerusalem temple, where there was

254
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,300
 an inner court and an outer court.

255
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:56,860
 So in the outer court, women and Gentiles were allowed to be in.

256
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,300
 But there was a wall that divided the outer court

257
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,200
 from the inner court.

258
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,820
 And in the inner court, Gentiles were not allowed to go into.

259
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,320
 And there was actually warning signs in multiple languages

260
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,920
 that if you're Gentile and you go in,

261
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,720
 it is punishable by death.

262
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,760
 And you can actually see those signs in a museum in Jerusalem.

263
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,440
 So those things, the signs are there.

264
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,680
 And this wall, whether Paul is exactly referring to that

265
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,200
 or if he's referring simply to the division,

266
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,760
 so metaphorically, between Jews and Gentiles

267
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,640
 through the Mosaic law and the promises of God.

268
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,000
 And it doesn't matter.

269
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,920
 But Paul is talking about that there was a division

270
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,600
 and there was a hostility.

271
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,160
 But I think one thing that's important is to remember,

272
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:50,360
 God called Israel and brought as his chosen people

273
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,720
 to be a light to the nations, not

274
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,040
 to create hostility between them and other people.

275
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,240
 And so something had gone wrong.

276
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,760
 And we can see this also in the name calling.

277
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,000
 And so basically, what happened is--

278
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,840
 and this happens all over the world.

279
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,640
 This happens today.

280
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,040
 We do it to one degree or another.

281
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,560
 It's where we declare one group of people

282
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,160
 and one thing they do as good.

283
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,000
 And we declare another group of people as bad.

284
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,320
 We elevate one practice that one group does over a practice

285
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,360
 that another group does.

286
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,460
 When Pastor Chapman talked about generations,

287
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,120
 he talked about generational differences

288
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,680
 to just illustrate this a little bit more.

289
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,320
 Now, I'm part of Gen X, barely.

290
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,760
 Actually, some research says that I'm part of no generation.

291
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,240
 I'm like, it's in between.

292
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,200
 And my generation, they gripe and they

293
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:47,040
 complain about millennials.

294
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,000
 Even though I might--

295
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 according to some, I'm also part of millennials.

296
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,840
 I'm like in between.

297
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,440
 So I'm safe.

298
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,800
 I can talk from--

299
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,240
 stand with one foot in one and one foot in the other.

300
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,920
 And so one of the things that people say,

301
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,640
 they're like, oh, this generation

302
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,960
 doesn't have resilience.

303
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,080
 They don't know how to work hard.

304
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,240
 They just always want things according to exactly how

305
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,520
 they want it, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

306
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:11,520
 And that is a way of elevating things that are good.

307
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,320
 Working hard, being resilient, those are good things.

308
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,480
 But it's like elevating and creating this virtue.

309
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,320
 But it's elevating in order to put down.

310
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,200
 And when we do that, when we consistently do that,

311
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,400
 it creates division.

312
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,560
 It creates hostility.

313
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,640
 It creates brokenness.

314
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:34,400
 And so when we elevate ourselves and dismiss others,

315
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,560
 we actively construct walls of division

316
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,480
 that's hostilely between us.

317
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,840
 Now, this was not something that just Jewish people did

318
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,720
 or Gentiles did.

319
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,720
 It's something we all do today.

320
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,840
 We take what is good about ourselves

321
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,400
 and elevate it so that we can feel superior to others.

322
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,000
 This might be about our math.

323
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,160
 I'm great at math.

324
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,960
 This is something superior.

325
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,160
 This person is not great at math.

326
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,440
 So I am somehow better than this other person.

327
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,360
 Or maybe I'm really into fitness and this other person's not fit.

328
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,360
 Or maybe-- whatever it is, you understand what I'm saying.

329
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,800
 So we all do that.

330
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,840
 And we have these judgments in our hearts.

331
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,120
 And if we keep carrying them, then they bring division.

332
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,360
 They bring brokenness.

333
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,080
 And we can see this.

334
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,960
 We can see this division and this hostility in the world.

335
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:26,040
 We can see this in wars between countries.

336
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,920
 We can see this in racism.

337
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,240
 We can see this in ageism.

338
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,440
 We can see this in generational disputes.

339
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,080
 We can see this down political lines.

340
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,360
 I mean, this is just rampant everywhere.

341
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:42,960
 And it's part of our sinfulness and pride.

342
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,520
 And that is-- we take something that's good from God,

343
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,960
 and we turn it into something ugly,

344
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,060
 and something that divides, and something destroys,

345
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,400
 and something that is hurtful.

346
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,680
 And so Paul is saying to the Ephesians--

347
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,120
 I know this was long--

348
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,800
 but Paul is saying to the Ephesians,

349
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,280
 that's where you were.

350
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,720
 That's how you were relating to each other,

351
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,520
 in hostility and hatred.

352
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,440
 You were putting each other down.

353
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,800
 But then something changed.

354
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,480
 Something powerful happened.

355
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,080
 And so let's continue here in verse 13.

356
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,680
 Or we've already read it, but I want to reread it.

357
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,240
 "But now in Christ Jesus, you who were once far away

358
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,040
 have been brought near by the blood of Christ.

359
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:29,120
 For he himself is our peace, who has made the two groups one,

360
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,400
 and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility,

361
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,000
 by setting aside in his flesh the law with its commands

362
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 and regulations.

363
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,960
 His purpose was to create in himself one new humanity out

364
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,440
 of the two, thus making peace, and in one body

365
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,040
 to reconcile both of them to God through the cross

366
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:55,160
 by which he put to death their hostility."

367
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:00,280
 And so through Jesus' death and resurrection,

368
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,880
 he has made peace between groups who

369
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,120
 were at odds with each other.

370
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,680
 He has removed the sin, the brokenness, the offense,

371
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,040
 and has brought these two groups together.

372
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:17,360
 And actually, this is new creative work.

373
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,440
 This is by the power of God.

374
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,160
 Just when he created creation, he

375
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,480
 has done something new by the power of God

376
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,600
 through the spirit of God.

377
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:32,120
 And he has made these two groups of people one.

378
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,680
 And that is part of the gospel message.

379
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,920
 We are sinful and broken people.

380
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,880
 We all carry these things where we put others down

381
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,040
 and we elevate ourselves.

382
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:46,080
 But Jesus died for our sins in our place

383
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:51,040
 so we can be forgiven for the offenses

384
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:56,160
 that we carry in our hearts, for the words that we've spoken,

385
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,000
 for the actions that we've done, and that we

386
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:06,800
 can receive his forgiveness, be reconciled to God, whom

387
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:12,560
 we offended, but then also be reconciled to each other

388
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,840
 and be brought into the family of God.

389
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,640
 God's new creation.

390
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,920
 And this is amazing.

391
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,880
 And this is beautiful.

392
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,320
 And actually, even just us sitting here,

393
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,160
 it's so powerful that we are people

394
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,240
 from such different walks of life.

395
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:34,720
 But the power of Jesus has brought us here together

396
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,560
 as brothers and sisters.

397
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:42,800
 And he has made us one body, one family, one new humanity.

398
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,640
 It describes it in different ways.

399
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,840
 And that's amazing.

400
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,800
 And that's a powerful display of the power of God

401
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,720
 when we receive his forgiveness, when we experience his love,

402
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,640
 that transformation happens.

403
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,000
 Something changes.

404
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,760
 And that's God's heart.

405
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,480
 Jesus came because we needed him to come,

406
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,920
 because he came to redeem, to reconcile, to renew.

407
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,000
 All that is broken.

408
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,600
 And guess what?

409
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,840
 Our relationships were broken.

410
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,640
 And we've experienced the pain and the hurt.

411
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,160
 And we still do even now.

412
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,920
 The pain and the hurt and the brokenness between hostility

413
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,560
 between people.

414
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,240
 But Jesus came to make all things new,

415
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,040
 to set all things right, to heal what is broken.

416
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:38,800
 That's God's heart.

417
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,480
 And so that's what he has done.

418
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,120
 And now it's up to us.

419
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,360
 In the first week of the series, I

420
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,280
 preach about keeping the unity.

421
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,920
 So Jesus has brought the unity.

422
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,360
 He has brought the reconciliation.

423
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,880
 But it's our job to maintain it, to keep the unity of the spirit.

424
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,200
 And we talked about that we do that by focusing on the gospel.

425
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:08,520
 And we talked about that we do that instead of being prideful.

426
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:13,160
 We want to embrace humbleness instead of being harsh.

427
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,840
 We want to be gentle instead of being impatient.

428
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,920
 We want to be patient.

429
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,480
 And we are that, not out of our own strength,

430
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,800
 but by the work of the spirit of God in us.

431
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,440
 As we learn to rely on him, as we

432
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,400
 learn to be filled with the spirit and filled with his love,

433
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,240
 where we're able to relate to each other in a different way

434
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,080
 and to live out this reconciliation

435
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,800
 that Jesus Christ has won for us.

436
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:44,720
 And when we do that, it is a powerful display.

437
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,360
 Us gathering here is a powerful display and declaration

438
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:55,560
 of the power of God to take what is divided, what is broken,

439
00:21:55,560 --> 00:22:00,000
 and to make it one, to bring healing.

440
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,560
 Now, I heard one time one theologian

441
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,440
 talk about that the church is a movie trailer.

442
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,720
 Has anyone here recently seen a movie, a movie theater?

443
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:16,640
 OK, we have a few moviegoers or are also a little hesitant.

444
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,560
 When you watch a trailer in a movie

445
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,400
 and you're with a friend, what do you do?

446
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,480
 Hey, that looked amazing.

447
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,040
 I want to see this.

448
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:32,280
 Or it's like, oh my gosh, who'd want to go and see this movie?

449
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,960
 That's like a whole-- there was like nothing even interesting

450
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,760
 in this trailer and they're already selecting what's best.

451
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:45,560
 Well, the church is meant to be a trailer of the kingdom of God,

452
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,880
 of the gospel message.

453
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,560
 And it's on display for the world to see.

454
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:55,680
 And so when we live in love and reconciliation

455
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:00,960
 with each other, others can see what's going on.

456
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,120
 We can see that the spirit of God

457
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,520
 is at work in the community, that he

458
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,880
 has brought love and grace flowing

459
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,560
 through the community to each other and doing healing,

460
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,640
 has done healing work.

461
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,960
 And that powerfully testifies to the gospel message.

462
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,480
 And also it supports-- when we declare the gospel

463
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,800
 and we live reconciled lives with each other,

464
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,480
 it makes that declaration powerful

465
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,160
 because we're actually living out what we're talking about.

466
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,840
 And so God broadcasts that through us as a community.

467
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:42,720
 But he also has brought us together for a unique purpose.

468
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,920
 Now, there are many churches in Yulong,

469
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,000
 and every church has a unique purpose.

470
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,200
 Remember, we're not comparison, trying to elevate one,

471
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,240
 put one down.

472
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,760
 Every church has a unique purpose.

473
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,600
 Well, we have a unique purpose.

474
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,320
 We're English speaking, Cantonese speaking,

475
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,480
 so we have different languages.

476
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,520
 We're multicultural.

477
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,920
 And we're able, because of who we

478
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:09,720
 are, to do work in this community

479
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,120
 that other churches maybe are not able to do.

480
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:16,760
 And we're able to receive people that maybe other churches are

481
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,640
 not situated.

482
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,400
 And that is God's purpose.

483
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,920
 This is part of the mission of God that he has entrusted us.

484
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,240
 And he wants his grace, his love.

485
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,840
 He wants that to flow through us as a community, among us,

486
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,560
 but also out into the community.

487
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,160
 And I've heard from multiple organizations

488
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,600
 that we partner with that we are the right organization

489
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:45,120
 to partner with, that they have been praying for a place

490
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,120
 like the Vine in Yulong.

491
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,960
 Because we're able to--

492
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,080
 this is just God's heart.

493
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,320
 This is what God wanted in Yulong.

494
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,760
 And again, it's not about comparing to other churches.

495
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,840
 Other churches, God's calling them to reach people

496
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,320
 that we cannot reach.

497
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,160
 But we're called, because of who we are,

498
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:11,000
 to love, to serve a unique population group of people

499
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,680
 here in this area.

500
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,080
 And that is amazing.

501
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,000
 And it is beautiful.

502
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,800
 And God wants to work through all of us.

503
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,760
 So it's significant that we come together.

504
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:22,720
 It's significant, the work that Christ has done.

505
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,280
 Because he wants to have his love flow out through us

506
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,560
 into the community and make his name known.

507
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:34,560
 He wants to bring more people into the family of God

508
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,520
 so that they can also experience his healing

509
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,960
 in their relationship with the Father, the Son,

510
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,560
 and the Holy Spirit, but also in relationship with other people.

511
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,720
 He wants to bring wholeness.

512
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,880
 He wants to bring peace.

513
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,600
 Which even-- so the New Testament's concept

514
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,040
 of peace is the Hebrew concept of shalom,

515
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,520
 which means wholeness, where God wants

516
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,760
 to make whole what is not whole.

517
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,360
 And so we are a community of people

518
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,000
 that has part of their purpose.

519
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,640
 This is to bring wholeness and let wholeness flow through us

520
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,400
 to those around us where there's brokenness, where there's tears,

521
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,040
 where there's pain, where there's hurt.

522
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,080
 God wants to use us to bring his wholeness, his goodness,

523
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,440
 his love to bear on other people's lives

524
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,160
 so their lives can be changed.

525
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,920
 They can know the love of God.

526
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,720
 Their life can be transformed.

527
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,960
 And so that's what he wants to do through us as a community.

528
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,160
 And I'm totally in a completely different place in my script,

529
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,560
 so let me figure out where we're going here.

530
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:42,800
 All right, let's go to Ephesians 2, 17 through 18.

531
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:48,680
 So there it says, "He came and he preached peace to you.

532
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,120
 Who are far away and peace to those who are near.

533
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,120
 For through him we both have access

534
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,240
 to the Father by one spirit."

535
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,400
 Now this is interesting because he preached peace.

536
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,600
 So he's talking about Jesus.

537
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,320
 Preached peace to those who were far and those who were near.

538
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,600
 So far, the Gentiles, but also those who are near,

539
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,520
 they also needed Jesus to preach peace.

540
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:15,640
 Because everybody needs to respond

541
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:20,280
 to the saving work of Jesus, the peace-bringing work of Jesus.

542
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:24,320
 And it's only through him that we have access

543
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,760
 to the Father by one spirit.

544
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,680
 And that's humbling because there's

545
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,880
 nobody who stands on a different place.

546
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,240
 We all stand on the same ground.

547
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:40,160
 We're all sinful, broken people in need of the grace of God.

548
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,320
 And so we come empty-handed.

549
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,600
 Every single one of us comes empty-handed

550
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,960
 and can only, by God's grace, receive

551
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,760
 his forgiveness and his new life in Jesus.

552
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,960
 And he brings us into his family.

553
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,760
 But let's continue.

554
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:05,080
 So Paul then summarizes things.

555
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,880
 And he's saying, God has done this incredible work

556
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,200
 and has brought you together, reconciled you with another.

557
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,880
 And so he kind of summarized that.

558
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:20,480
 Let's look at that in verse 19.

559
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,200
 "Consequently," which is like, therefore,

560
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,840
 so based on what has happened before,

561
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,760
 "you are no longer foreigners and strangers,

562
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,760
 but fellow citizens with God's people

563
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,920
 and also a member of his household,

564
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,400
 built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets

565
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,640
 with Christ Jesus himself as a chief cornerstone.

566
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,760
 In him, the whole building is joined together

567
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,720
 and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord.

568
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,520
 And in him, you too are being built together

569
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,800
 to become a dwelling in which God lives by his spirit."

570
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:55,440
 And so this is highlighting to the Ephesians

571
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,080
 and also to us here today that Jesus' saving work was not just

572
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,920
 so we can have a personal relationship with Jesus, which

573
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,280
 he also did that for that reason,

574
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:12,160
 but he also has done a saving work to form a new community.

575
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,760
 And he uses several words.

576
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:18,600
 Before verse 19, he talks about new humanity, body of Christ.

577
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,720
 Now he talks about fellow citizens with God's people,

578
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:26,240
 members of the household of God, a holy temple

579
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,560
 that's being built together in whom God's spirit lives.

580
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:36,680
 And so we, you and me, we are the church.

581
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:41,840
 We are people indwelled by the Holy Spirit.

582
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,960
 The presence of God is moving among us.

583
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,280
 When we worship, when we come together, the love of God

584
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,480
 is being poured out into us.

585
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,040
 And God is building us up through this community.

586
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:01,360
 He's using our gifts, our talents, our spiritual gifts

587
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,480
 to encourage each other, to lift each other up,

588
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:08,880
 to give us grace so that we mature and image

589
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,600
 Jesus in a fuller and a more beautiful way,

590
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,800
 because that's what God is doing in our character.

591
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,760
 He's making us more like Jesus, but he uses each other.

592
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,360
 So when we get here, it's like you

593
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,560
 can think of a gas station.

594
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,000
 We're coming here, and we're being filled up.

595
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,320
 We're being built up.

596
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,680
 We're being recharged.

597
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:32,000
 But we're not filled up so that it just stays with us.

598
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,560
 We're filled up.

599
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,400
 We're showing love.

600
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,600
 We're showing grace so that it can flow through us

601
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:45,000
 into the world, into Yuen Long, into Hong Kong and beyond.

602
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,120
 And there is a false narrative in the church.

603
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,760
 And I feel very strongly about it.

604
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,400
 There's a lie.

605
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,920
 And that's whenever-- and I can feel this even myself.

606
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,720
 Whenever I talk about us doing evangelism,

607
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:03,160
 whenever I talk about us going out and serving,

608
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,840
 that right away, there's this idea,

609
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:11,840
 oh, I first need to be filled before I can do anything.

610
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,920
 And yes, we need to be filled, but you're

611
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,960
 filled to be poured out.

612
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:24,280
 And so don't be sidelined in what God wants to do.

613
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:24,960
 You're broken.

614
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,880
 You're a mess.

615
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,480
 You know what?

616
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,120
 Maybe you're exactly the right person

617
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,480
 through whom God wants his grace to shine

618
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,200
 into somebody else's life.

619
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,480
 You don't have it all together.

620
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,640
 That's OK.

621
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,200
 Again, maybe you're exactly the right person that somebody--

622
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,200
 because how you authentically are sharing,

623
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,920
 how Jesus is doing work in your life,

624
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,440
 that he can work through you.

625
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,280
 So this is not about us somehow needing

626
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,240
 to sit there and reach a place of perfection.

627
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,800
 And only then can we serve God.

628
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,440
 Only then can we let God's love flow through us

629
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,960
 as a community, as individuals.

630
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,800
 But he wants to do that now.

631
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:05,920
 So don't let Satan sideline you in the mission of Jesus,

632
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:10,840
 of renewing all things and making things whole.

633
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,200
 Can I get an amen?

634
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:12,700
 Amen.

635
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,760
 Come on.

636
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:20,280
 So at the beginning of Ephesians, Paul,

637
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,320
 he talks about that we've been blessed

638
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,840
 with every spiritual blessing, Ephesians 1, verse 3.

639
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,280
 And then he actually unpacks these blessings.

640
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:32,240
 And in that, he also talks that it's

641
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,720
 God's will to bring unity to all things in heaven

642
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,880
 and on earth under Christ.

643
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,280
 So God wants to-- in other words,

644
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,200
 God wants to set everything right.

645
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,840
 He wants to make everything whole.

646
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:48,440
 He wants to make everything new.

647
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,800
 And he wants us, his church, to be

648
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:59,840
 part of bringing renewal, love, hope, peace,

649
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,720
 peace where there's brokenness, where there's anxiety,

650
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,720
 love where people don't know that they are loved,

651
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,320
 there is somebody who infinitely loves them,

652
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,320
 whose heart breaks for them when they are not doing good,

653
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:15,600
 and who just wants them to know that they are desired,

654
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,280
 they are wanted.

655
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:22,400
 And so much desire that-- and we know, if you ever wonder,

656
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,560
 how does Jesus feel about you?

657
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,760
 How does God feel about you?

658
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,920
 We look at Jesus and him dying on the cross.

659
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,040
 That answers that question.

660
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,200
 He loves you so much that you were

661
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,040
 worth dying for on the cross.

662
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,000
 He laid down his life.

663
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,320
 And he wants people to know that.

664
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,480
 He wants people to know that.

665
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,920
 People who are not loved, who are not in their families

666
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,960
 and their environments.

667
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:57,400
 And so church, people of God, people filled with the Holy

668
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,080
 Spirit right here, let's not just

669
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,560
 have a little water trickle through us of God's love

670
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,280
 and his blessing.

671
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:11,840
 Let's have his grace, his mercy just flow fully through us

672
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,880
 to those around us.

673
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:17,160
 So this brings me back to the opening question.

674
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:20,280
 How can we become people and communities

675
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,360
 to whom God's love and grace and peace increasingly

676
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,320
 flows to those around us?

677
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,160
 How do you do that?

678
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,400
 What do you do?

679
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,320
 Well, first, of course, it starts actually with us

680
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,160
 knowing Jesus and knowing his love,

681
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:36,160
 knowing our identity in him.

682
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,320
 And we always have to be reminded of that.

683
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,880
 It's like a never-ending thing.

684
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,480
 Like we forget it, we lose track of it.

685
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,960
 And we're reminded through that when

686
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:51,720
 we meditate on the cross, on what Jesus has done,

687
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,680
 when we spend time in intimacy with God and his word

688
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:59,600
 and in prayer, where he just speaks to us about who he is

689
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:04,640
 and reveals to us in a deeper way who he is.

690
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:11,240
 And so he just wants us to be secure in our love,

691
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:15,600
 that we don't have to put others down,

692
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:19,000
 that we are free to focus on other people

693
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,280
 and not just on ourselves.

694
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:27,520
 Because we are loved by the creator of the universe who

695
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,200
 makes that known to us.

696
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,800
 We are deeply loved.

697
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,840
 And so it starts with that.

698
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:43,680
 We need to know God's love personally.

699
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,280
 And then as a community, we're meant to make God's love

700
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:53,240
 visible, where it's not visible, where it's not seen,

701
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,840
 where it's not tangible.

702
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,280
 Now, this is not rocket science.

703
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,600
 We make it complicated.

704
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,200
 And of course, we want to have strategies and blah, blah, blah

705
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,240
 and all that stuff.

706
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,600
 But this is literally in your workplace,

707
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,960
 in the place where you live, when

708
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,400
 you go outside and walk out here and see someone,

709
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:18,080
 just paying attention and being available to God

710
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,600
 to be used by him.

711
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,280
 And then maybe it's just taking time to listen to someone.

712
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,160
 And by listening, that's an act of love.

713
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,480
 It's one of the greatest gifts you can give to someone

714
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,920
 is to listen to them, to seek to understand them.

715
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,520
 And then when you listen to them,

716
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,440
 you find out stuff out about their lives,

717
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,200
 maybe what challenges that they're facing.

718
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,720
 And then maybe you pray for them.

719
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,800
 Maybe you practically help them with their need.

720
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:51,760
 I want to share a story, and it's a little bit weird.

721
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,600
 I actually was struggling with whether or not

722
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,360
 I shared this or not.

723
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,800
 And I want to use that a little bit as a metaphor for us

724
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:04,040
 to think about how we make the love of Jesus visible.

725
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,560
 So when I first came to the Vine,

726
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:12,480
 I had gone through a loss of relationship.

727
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,520
 And I was grieving.

728
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,760
 And I was a mess.

729
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,080
 And I was not functioning right.

730
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,640
 It was the hardest thing in my life.

731
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,960
 I've had my father pass away, had other things happen.

732
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,120
 But this one hit differently.

733
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:31,320
 And so I come-- I'm actually amazed the Vine hired me.

734
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,040
 I was a mess, not functioning right.

735
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,520
 Every Sunday service, I'm crying.

736
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,080
 I have tears in my eyes.

737
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,800
 But it's healing tears.

738
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,960
 Because as I came here, in the worship, through the messages,

739
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,680
 the Holy Spirit was doing some renewing and some healing work

740
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,720
 in my heart and life.

741
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,880
 But then at that time, the Vine had a tradition.

742
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:57,040
 If you knew pastor in a pastoral prayer time,

743
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,520
 they hot seat you.

744
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,360
 Now, you're like, if you have no idea what a hot seat is,

745
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,040
 I didn't know what a hot seat was.

746
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,200
 It's like basically you sit down in a chair.

747
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,240
 And then everyone comes around you from that team

748
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,000
 and they start praying for you.

749
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,400
 They start sharing scripture.

750
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,280
 They start sharing prophetic words.

751
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,960
 So I was sitting there.

752
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,880
 And they don't know my story.

753
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,560
 So they don't know details about my life at this time.

754
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,200
 And I mean, what they're saying, it's just wrecking me.

755
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,040
 I mean, it's God just speaking through them.

756
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,680
 Like, you know, weeping and snot and tears.

757
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,280
 And then you have to imagine there's like 20 hands like on me

758
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,120
 and I'm sitting there like this.

759
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:35,880
 And I want to kind of blow my nose and wipe my tears,

760
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:41,040
 but I can't do it unless I want to say, you know, get off me.

761
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,000
 And so I'm sitting there and I'm literally have this dilemma

762
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,680
 in my mind.

763
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:48,560
 And then suddenly somebody puts a Kleenex in my hand.

764
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,480
 And I was like, I still can't do anything with this.

765
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:57,600
 And so he realizes it and he actually wipes my face.

766
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,960
 Now, I have to say, generally speaking,

767
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:03,720
 I wouldn't want another man wiping my face.

768
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,120
 Just putting that out there.

769
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:11,120
 But for me, it was such a powerful moment, you know,

770
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,800
 because it really wasn't -- it was not just him.

771
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,280
 It was an expression of the love of God

772
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,520
 who had seen my tears.

773
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:27,400
 You know, the ones that when I'm on my own, crying in my room,

774
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,520
 maybe even when I didn't have tears anymore to cry.

775
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,120
 And then here, you know, it was like as if God

776
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,920
 was wiping away my tears.

777
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:40,280
 And interestingly enough, I can't ever remember

778
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,720
 somebody wiping my tears.

779
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,520
 I'm sure my parents did.

780
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,920
 I just don't remember.

781
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,480
 You know, but it was such a powerful

782
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,800
 and such a prominent moment.

783
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,760
 So as we think about God's love, God's grace

784
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:56,520
 flowing through us, you know, what are some of these

785
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:03,160
 metaphorical tears that you see around you

786
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:07,320
 that God wants you to go and wipe

787
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,600
 and bring comfort to?

788
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,880
 You know, where do you see heartache?

789
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:18,240
 Where do you see practical needs?

790
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,280
 You know, God will use you.

791
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,920
 He will show you what to do.

792
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:26,920
 When I had this experience as a 30-year-old man,

793
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,680
 I didn't know what to do.

794
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,240
 So I prayed, "God, what do you want to do?

795
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,280
 Show me."

796
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,680
 Well, he showed me two very specific things.

797
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,320
 I'm just going to share one briefly,

798
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:40,000
 and then I'll wrap things up.

799
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,960
 I was an associate pastor at the time,

800
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,640
 and there was a former youth of mine

801
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,040
 who was just graduating high school.

802
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:51,680
 She came from a low-income family.

803
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,880
 She didn't get into university in Hong Kong.

804
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,560
 Excuse me.

805
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,000
 But she got into university in the U.S.,

806
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,240
 but she didn't have any money.

807
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:06,040
 And I realized I knew people who probably

808
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,560
 would be willing to help her.

809
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:13,160
 And so then I shared this with somebody who also knew her,

810
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,960
 and he was like, "Let me get some of the people

811
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,840
 who have these resources together

812
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,600
 to help her go to university in the U.S."

813
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,640
 But they didn't want her to know who was helping her,

814
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,760
 so they asked me to sort of administrate

815
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,000
 these funds and things,

816
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,040
 which, if you know me, I don't like administration,

817
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,600
 but God was calling me to do it.

818
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,320
 And so then for four years, I administrated these funds

819
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,080
 and sent it to her,

820
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,400
 and she went to university, graduated,

821
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,120
 lives in the U.S., has a beautiful family,

822
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:46,840
 but God had placed so many people around me to bless me,

823
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:50,040
 and now he was using me to bless others

824
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,640
 in super tangible and practical ways,

825
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,720
 and he wants to use you, too.

826
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:58,840
 Now, I have an image here for us.

827
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:02,320
 If you know, this is our river vision

828
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:05,120
 as a Vine Church, Wan Chai Yun Long.

829
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:08,160
 And so part of the vision is that God wants his river

830
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,880
 to flow all over Hong Kong.

831
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,880
 He wants to bring his living water into a parched land.

832
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,440
 He wants to make his peace known.

833
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,400
 He wants to bring wholeness.

834
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,000
 He wants to bring salvation,

835
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,160
 and he wants to use us, his church, his people,

836
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,360
 who are his chosen instrument to do that,

837
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,840
 for his river to flow.

838
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:33,560
 And so I use that image of a river flowing into me.

839
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,040
 Don't be a dead end.

840
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,840
 Let God's river flow through you.

841
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,560
 So right now, what I wanna invite you to do

842
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:45,000
 is to turn to each other and to pray for each other

843
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,080
 that we will let God's love, God's grace

844
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:51,120
 flow through us to the people around us,

845
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:54,880
 and that God will bring healing, hope, comfort,

846
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,520
 practical help, transformation to those

847
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,360
 who are disadvantaged, those who are lonely,

848
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,000
 those who are hurt.

849
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,520
 And so let's do this right now.

850
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,840
 I wanna also invite the worship team to come up.

851
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,400
 Let's turn to each other.

852
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,640
 Let's take some time and pray for each other

853
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:16,200
 that the river of God, that the living water

854
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,560
 flows through us and doesn't get stuck in us.

855
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,360
 All right, sounds good?

856
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,480
 Let's do it, church.
