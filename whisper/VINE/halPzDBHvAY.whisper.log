[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   God, and in Jesus' name we pray.
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.600]   Amen.
[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.420]   >> Amen, thank you Jess.
[00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.120]   I think once a year I kick a football around,
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.800]   so considering that it was a really good day actually.
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.580]   No injuries, it was really fun.
[00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.400]   Well, you know, a lot of times people ask you,
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.040]   how did you first become a pastor?
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.360]   When did you start your journey?
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.960]   And so let me tell you a little bit about that.
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.200]   I started my journey into full-time ministry
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.720]   as a youth pastor.
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.000]   And back then I was serving the church I grew up in
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.080]   over in Kowloon Tong.
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.840]   I see Paco right there actually.
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.080]   You was in my youth group.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.200]   Okay, well I'm talking about you, okay Paco.
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.320]   Anyway, so I was the youth pastor for a little while.
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.440]   And youth work is a great way to get to know
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.920]   how to do ministry.
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.440]   And one of the things I got to do was to take
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.320]   youth groups on mission trips.
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.960]   And so this was about 17 years ago.
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.660]   I was just a kid back then.
[00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.680]   So I was like a big kid taking some little kids
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.580]   to a foreign country, a place I didn't know the language,
[00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.960]   I didn't know the people to serve a group.
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.240]   I didn't even really know who I was connecting with.
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.480]   It's amazing that the parents allowed this all to happen
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.520]   in the first place, right?
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.600]   But it was a really good trip actually overall.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.400]   But on the first night when we got there,
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.760]   we were looking for a place to have dinner.
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.240]   Okay, actually we were in Hainan Island.
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.520]   This is when I discovered that Hainanese chicken rice
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.920]   is not really from Hainan Island, okay.
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.320]   Amongst many other things.
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.960]   So we were looking for a place to have dinner.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.560]   I was walking around with me and a bunch of about
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.920]   12 other kids, teenagers, preteens.
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.380]   And so we found this place, right.
[00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.120]   It was a cheap hot pot place.
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.020]   So I thought, perfect, you know.
[00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.760]   Hong Kong kids, cheap hot pot, perfect place for dinner.
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.240]   Right, and so we decided to have dinner there.
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.860]   And when we walked in, we discovered actually
[00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.500]   it's a all you can eat place.
[00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.640]   So yeah, right, we love that, right.
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.520]   But how it worked was you get one visit to the buffet table,
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.840]   you get as much food as you want,
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.560]   and you can bring it back to the table,
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.800]   and that was your dinner.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.120]   Okay, so we were all there having good time
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.120]   and eating away, and there was one kid though
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.920]   who got way too much food.
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.240]   Like it was just like a ridiculous amount of food.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.160]   Do you remember back in the day,
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.160]   or back when I was growing up, Pizza Hut, right,
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.320]   had the salad bar, right.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.680]   Oh, Pizza Hut salad bar, right.
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.960]   Me going out for Pizza Hut was like, yes, you know,
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.720]   Saitan, you know, white people food, right.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.880]   This is amazing, okay.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.780]   But that salad bar, right, you got that really flimsy,
[00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.760]   brown, like bamboo-ish sort of bowl, do you remember that?
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.280]   Right, and there was whole art to like
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.880]   building up the salad, right.
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.800]   So you put like the potatoes at the bottom
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.360]   to get like a foundation, right.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.960]   Stick some cucumbers on the side
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.920]   so you could like widen the bowl a little bit, right.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.120]   And people would come back,
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.180]   and it was like this huge tower of salad, right.
[00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.120]   But in the end, like, it just got wasted
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.040]   'cause it was disgusting.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.320]   It was like Thousand Island sauce
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.280]   over like pineapples and raisins,
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.200]   and like all this random stuff mashed together.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.400]   It was disgusting.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.760]   No one actually liked the salad,
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.600]   and I think they just like seeing how tall
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.000]   they could make that tower, right,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.760]   and bringing it back to the table.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.140]   Well, that's kind of what happened, right.
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.940]   This kid got all this food, right.
[00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.100]   There was so much, so much food that he got.
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.020]   He couldn't finish it all.
[00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.200]   And so I got really upset.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.000]   I was like, what are we gonna do, right?
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.280]   You've wasted all this food.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.520]   But then I also thought to myself,
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.440]   okay, there's a teachable moment here, all right.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.400]   How am I gonna make this into a life lesson, right?
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.240]   So it's a true story.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.080]   This is what I did.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.080]   I told the young guy, he's like,
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.600]   dude, like what happened?
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.840]   You just wasted all this food.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.880]   And he said to me, yeah, I thought
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.320]   it was all you can eat, Allison.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.680]   So well, yeah, all you can eat
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.680]   doesn't mean all you can waste, okay.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.000]   So like, what are we gonna do about this?
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.200]   You know, you didn't eat the food.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.240]   You're gonna have to pay for it now.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.480]   And he starts to panic.
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.220]   He's like, well, I didn't do anything wrong, right.
[00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.280]   You said it was all you can eat.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.520]   I'm just gonna put the food back.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.240]   He's like, dude, that's disgusting, okay.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.140]   Do not put the food back, okay.
[00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.960]   It's at the table now, all right.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.360]   Something's gotta happen.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.640]   And he said, what's gonna happen?
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.240]   So I told him, okay, well, the manager's gonna come.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.140]   He's gonna weigh all the food.
[00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.540]   And according to how much it weighs,
[00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.240]   you're gonna have to pay the penalty
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.560]   for wasting all this food.
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.060]   And then he really starts to panic.
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.960]   So how much money are you gonna have to pay?
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.000]   Like, my mom didn't give me that much pocket money.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.800]   You know, I've been planning to spend on some souvenirs.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.800]   Like, I don't have it.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.840]   Like, what am I gonna do?
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.020]   So I told him, okay, the only way you can get out of this
[00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.760]   is if you go to the manager
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.280]   and you beg him for forgiveness, okay.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.640]   Beg him for forgiveness.
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.960]   Maybe he'll just let you go.
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.800]   He's panicking, okay, where is he?
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.160]   So I point to a gentleman
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.560]   sitting on the other side of the restaurant, okay.
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.320]   That's the manager sitting right there, right.
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.040]   Now, I've just pointed to a random guy
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.440]   minding his business, okay.
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.660]   He's there having dinner with his family, right.
[00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.360]   Because the truth was, there was no manager, okay.
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.640]   It was mad at him.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.540]   I, just like I said, teachable moment.
[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.740]   I wanted to teach him a lesson to not to waste food.
[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.360]   Right, so this boy, he stands there for a minute, right.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.600]   And he's like sweating bullets.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.680]   He's like rehearsing what he's gonna say.
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.800]   You know, practicing his Mandarin.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.680]   He's like, (mimics Mandarin)
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.360]   Right, and so, and then he really like, you know,
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.080]   coyly walks up to this man, taps him on the shoulder,
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.280]   and he just starts going for it.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.580]   I'm really sorry, I've ate all this food, you know.
[00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.840]   I don't have money to pay, please forgive me, right.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.200]   And this man's just staring blankly at him like,
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.040]   why is this kid like confessing
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.240]   all his sins to me right now, you know.
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.200]   And then anyway, I was standing in the corner
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.400]   also crying, but with laughter, right.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.340]   Like, I'm not saying it was a good thing or a bad thing,
[00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.220]   I don't know, but no more food was wasted that trip.
[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.300]   We'll say it like that, okay.
[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.300]   So, now of course, you know, that's a bit of a funny story.
[00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.900]   But in a way, we sort of, we've all been there, right,
[00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.700]   in that moment.
[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.140]   Like that moment when we realize we've done something wrong
[00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.220]   and the guilt and the shame and the fear
[00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.880]   that comes with that.
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:43.980]   And then you have this reaction
[00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.420]   of trying to make things right.
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.140]   Realizing then, actually, there is nothing I can do
[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.980]   to make it right.
[00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:53.900]   The only thing left for me to do is to ask for forgiveness
[00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.220]   and hope that forgiveness is offered to us.
[00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.400]   You know, we're at the tail end of the year already,
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.720]   believe it or not.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.560]   And we have Advent starting soon.
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.520]   But before Advent, this is our last sermon series
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.760]   of the year.
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.640]   And actually, this sermon series was born
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.720]   out of a heart cry of the community, I believe.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.840]   And you may remember a few months ago,
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.280]   we did an event called Converse.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.240]   And at Converse, we set up prayer stations
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.200]   up at a high school, you know, just up the hill.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.240]   And there was a big hall and there was all these different,
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.720]   amazing prayer stations, different ways for us
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.400]   to interact with prayer.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.440]   And one of the stations was to do with forgiveness, right.
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.960]   It was either asking, you know, prayer requests
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.760]   to give forgiveness or to receive forgiveness.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.920]   And as we looked through the prayer requests
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.480]   that were written out, we realized, right,
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:51.680]   this is a theme that so many of us are struggling with
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.820]   in our community.
[00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.680]   Many of these had to do with relationships, right.
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.460]   People asking for the strength to be able to forgive people
[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.120]   that have hurt them in different ways.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.760]   There were also many voices asking for forgiveness
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.280]   because they have been the ones who have caused harm
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.720]   and hurt to other people.
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.560]   A lot of written on there was to, you know,
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.640]   about forgiving ourselves, right.
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.560]   The different things that we struggle with,
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.720]   asking God for forgiveness.
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.600]   And in some ways, there was also a lot of requests
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.120]   asking for, you know, to be able to forgive God, right.
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.320]   Because people have felt like God has let them down.
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.880]   They put their faith in God and they felt like God
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:29.720]   had let them down.
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.480]   And I feel like I need to forgive God in some way.
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.040]   And so since this was a topic that so many of us
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.520]   were wrestling with, we figured it was time
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.080]   to address this together as a church.
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.880]   Because the truth is, we all need, everyone needs
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.800]   to come to a good understanding of what forgiveness is,
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.680]   of what forgiveness is and what it's supposed to look like
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.800]   because forgiveness sits at the center of God's heart.
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:00.520]   And forgiveness is essential for our relationship with God.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.200]   In fact, without forgiveness, there would be no relationship
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.600]   with God possible, right.
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.320]   At the same time, forgiveness is also essential
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.240]   for us to be in relationship and in community
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.280]   with each other.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.200]   Without forgiveness, not even this church, right,
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.040]   society itself would totally break down
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.800]   and we would never be able to do life
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.720]   and to connect with each other.
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:27.080]   But at the same time, as we've experienced,
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:30.080]   it's not that simple.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.480]   Right, because forgiveness is nuanced
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:35.160]   with so many different questions and feelings and emotions.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.440]   And over these next few weeks, we're gonna face
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.120]   some of these questions head on.
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.880]   We're gonna be talking about some theological framework
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.880]   about what forgiveness is from the biblical perspective.
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.400]   We're gonna be looking at some very practical ways
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.560]   of how we can forgive, what forgiveness is
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.480]   and what forgiveness isn't.
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.040]   We're gonna hear testimonies from our community groups
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.880]   about how forgiveness has been such an enriching part
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.640]   of their relationship with each other.
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.320]   We're gonna talk about what it means
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.400]   for us to forgive ourselves.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.960]   And in the end, the hope is we're gonna be equipped
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.800]   to be live out, to be walking out,
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.320]   to live a life that is defined by forgiveness.
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.120]   And so to start us on our journey today,
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.840]   I want to look at a passage that teaches us,
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.720]   you know, that I think really Jesus uses this passage
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:26.280]   to highlight just how important forgiveness is
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.440]   from his perspective and how he hopes
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.400]   his followers will respond to it.
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.960]   Okay, we're looking at Matthew chapter 18, verses 21 to 35.
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.160]   I'm gonna read it and you can follow along.
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.160]   Then Peter came to Jesus and asked,
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.280]   "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.880]   "who sins against me?
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.440]   "Up to seven times?"
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:54.440]   Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but 77 times.
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:57.160]   "Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.920]   "who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.780]   "As he began the settlement, a man who owed him
[00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:06.260]   "10,000 bags of gold was brought to him.
[00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.900]   "Since he was not able to pay, the master ordered
[00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.420]   "that he and his wife and his children
[00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:13.500]   "and all that he had to be sold to repay the debt."
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.680]   Excuse me.
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.800]   "At this, the servant fell on his knees before him.
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.440]   "Be patient with me, he begged,
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.740]   "and I will pay back everything.
[00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.900]   "The servant's master took pity on him,
[00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:26.600]   "canceled the debt, and let him go.
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.780]   "But when that servant went out,
[00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:29.460]   "he found one of his fellow servants
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.140]   "who owed him 100 silver coins.
[00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:33.480]   "He grabbed him and began to choke him.
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.180]   "'Pay back what you owe me,' he demanded.
[00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:38.740]   "His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him,
[00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:41.940]   "'Be patient with me, and I will pay it back.'
[00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:43.200]   "But he refused.
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.720]   "Instead, he went off and had the man thrown into prison
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.200]   "until he could pay the debt.
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.480]   "When the other servants saw what had happened,
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.880]   "they were outraged and went to tell the master
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.760]   "everything that had happened.
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.980]   "The master then called the servant in.
[00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:59.520]   "'You wicked servant,' he said.
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.300]   "'I canceled all that debt of yours
[00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:02.760]   "'because you begged me to.
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.040]   "'Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.560]   "'just as I had on you?'
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.660]   "In his anger, the master handed him over to the jailers
[00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:15.020]   "to be tortured until he should pay back all that he owed.
[00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:18.540]   "This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you
[00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:23.540]   "unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart."
[00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:27.220]   Challenging words.
[00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.340]   I think one of the reasons why it's challenging
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:31.360]   is because when we talk about forgiveness,
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:35.060]   initially, it's sort of like a counterproductive thing
[00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:35.960]   to do, we feel like.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.820]   It feels foreign to our natural inclinations.
[00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:39.900]   It's unnatural.
[00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.140]   Maybe that's just me.
[00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.520]   But when we're hurt, when we're wronged,
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.540]   we don't want to forgive.
[00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:49.100]   What we want is revenge.
[00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:51.820]   What we want is revenge because we think revenge,
[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:55.020]   getting this person back, is gonna make us feel better.
[00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:57.540]   On a micro level, this happens all the time,
[00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:58.700]   especially in Hong Kong.
[00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:00.820]   We Hong Kongers, super good at passive,
[00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.540]   aggressive forms of revenge.
[00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:05.220]   You go into MTR, someone steps on the back of your shoe.
[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.580]   So in the end, you find them down in the MTR
[00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.300]   and then you bump them with your bag
[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.260]   just so you can get them back from stepping on your shoes.
[00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.180]   Yes, feels so good to do that.
[00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:15.820]   Don't ride the MTR with me.
[00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:22.300]   But what happens, that's just a silly, trivial thing.
[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:25.060]   What happens, though, when the stakes are a bit higher?
[00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:29.020]   What kind of revenge goes through your mind
[00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.840]   when you think about maybe the person
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.460]   who's caused you really hurtful wounds?
[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:37.080]   They've hurt you in almost a devastating kind of way.
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:40.960]   How do you pay back the friend who stabbed you in the back,
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:41.940]   who betrayed you?
[00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:46.160]   What about the spouse or the partner that cheats on you?
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:50.060]   The business partner who runs off with all your money?
[00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:53.120]   A parent who abused you?
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.020]   A person who assaulted you?
[00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.820]   A boss or a coworker who humiliates you?
[00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:04.140]   How do we react in those kind of situations?
[00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:07.200]   I think revenge is the sort of mentality
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:10.200]   that Peter is bringing here before Jesus.
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.620]   When he asked the question, "Lord, how many times
[00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:15.820]   "shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me?"
[00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:18.300]   Up to seven times.
[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:21.540]   Right, it's such typical Peter behavior in the Bible
[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:25.860]   and I love how accurate and how honest the Bible is
[00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.220]   when it comes to the flaws of the disciples.
[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.260]   So close yet so far.
[00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:32.740]   He seems to understand, yes, okay,
[00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:35.620]   maybe forgiveness is kind of necessary,
[00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:38.220]   but maybe it should also have a limit.
[00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:41.480]   And so when Peter says up to seven times,
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.620]   from his perspective, this is going above and beyond
[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.860]   what he was supposed to do.
[00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:50.140]   In Jewish culture, seven is the perfect number.
[00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:53.340]   So by Peter saying seven, Peter is saying,
[00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:58.100]   yes, seven, if seven is surely more than enough.
[00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:00.940]   After I've done, I'm forgiven seven times,
[00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:03.100]   after I've done God's will, I should be able
[00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.460]   to take the situation into my own hands, right?
[00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.580]   Or maybe you can look at it like this.
[00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:09.540]   I had an uncle who told me one time that,
[00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:11.980]   you know what, Ellison, Jesus only says
[00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:14.260]   you have to turn the cheek one time.
[00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.540]   If you turn the cheek and he hits you again,
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:19.340]   you have permission to slap the snot out of that person.
[00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:20.780]   [congregation laughing]
[00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:22.580]   That's not true, by the way.
[00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:24.180]   But that's sort of like the vibe,
[00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:27.820]   the energy that Peter is bringing into his question.
[00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:29.980]   Right, and honestly, if we were honest with ourselves
[00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:31.580]   or when I'm honest with myself,
[00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:35.540]   I wish sometimes that's the answer that Jesus gave, right?
[00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:37.580]   Permission to fight back.
[00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:39.100]   He would have said something like, yes, you know what,
[00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:41.300]   seven times, that's more than enough, Peter.
[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.460]   Right, on the eighth time, you know, throw hands,
[00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:45.100]   you know, do what you want to do.
[00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:47.980]   But he doesn't.
[00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:51.540]   Instead, his response is a deep challenge to his followers
[00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:53.620]   on how we are supposed to forgive.
[00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:59.460]   Jesus answered, I tell you not seven times, but 77 times.
[00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:02.700]   Now again, it's not a formula, right?
[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:04.860]   Jesus is not saying on the 78th time,
[00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:07.220]   you can do something about it yourself.
[00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:11.740]   What Jesus means here is that there is no limit.
[00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:13.420]   There is not supposed to be a limit
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:17.540]   to the number of times you should offer forgiveness.
[00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:20.960]   In other words, if you really want to do God's will,
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:25.220]   don't even think about counting, just forgive.
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:30.140]   Now that, my friends, is a hard pill to swallow
[00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:36.340]   because it sounds like we're just supposed to be helpless.
[00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:38.860]   Right, it almost sounds like forgiveness is cheapened,
[00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:41.220]   right, it sounds as though Jesus is giving permission
[00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:43.260]   for people just to walk all over us,
[00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:44.940]   do whatever they want to hurt us,
[00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:46.980]   and there's not a single thing we can do about it.
[00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.540]   All we have to do is just keep forgiving
[00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:49.900]   and forgiving and forgiving.
[00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:54.600]   But what if, and I'm sure many of this people room have
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.080]   and many people listening have,
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:59.640]   what if we've been hurt in the most horrible of ways?
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:04.500]   Does God just expect me to let it go and to forget about it?
[00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.980]   Is this what it means to forgive?
[00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:08.940]   Because if so, it doesn't sound like
[00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:10.860]   it's very healthy for us, right?
[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:13.820]   It doesn't sound healthy for us to live life that way,
[00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.440]   for the community to practice forgiveness that way.
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:20.260]   This is not what Jesus means.
[00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.060]   And so he tries to explain this with a parable a little bit
[00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.500]   to illustrate the point.
[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.300]   And he says it like this.
[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:28.620]   This is the story.
[00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:31.540]   Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king
[00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.340]   who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
[00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.620]   As he began the settlement, a man who owed him
[00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:40.960]   10,000 bags of gold was brought to him.
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:43.620]   Since he was not able to pay, the master ordered
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:45.660]   that he and his wife and his children
[00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:49.400]   and all that he had be sold to repay the debt.
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.600]   Now this is that word debt.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.240]   Debt is such a scary word.
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.400]   The word itself almost sounds heavy, right?
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.320]   You know what I mean?
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:01.640]   It's a sort of word that can fill with dread
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:03.460]   and panic and anxiety.
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:06.200]   In my context, it's kind of sad.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.200]   The only letters and phone calls I have these days
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.800]   is either people telling them, I owe the money,
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.400]   so the credit card bill comes in
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.120]   or the electricity bill comes in,
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:17.220]   school fees, taxes, overdue living charges,
[00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:18.200]   all that kind of stuff, right?
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.640]   So it's, I owe you money, you're in debt to me,
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:21.960]   I'll listen in this, right?
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:25.320]   Or it's invitations to get into even more debt, right?
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:26.920]   Say, hi, you know, it's like,
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.680]   you know, you're in trauma and typhoon, blah, blah, blah,
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.320]   all that kind of stuff, all those phone calls
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.440]   that you get, okay?
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.280]   Do you need to borrow money?
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.120]   Do you speak Chinese?
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:33.940]   Do you speak English?
[00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:35.580]   Okay, those kind of calls.
[00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:38.960]   So debt is scary.
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.080]   The scary thing about debt is because it carries
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:43.360]   with it consequences.
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.200]   When you don't pay back your debt,
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.760]   there are consequences to your actions.
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:49.760]   And this is what we see happening
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.520]   in this opening scene of this story.
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:52.960]   We're told that this man, right,
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:56.440]   is in an unbelievable amount of debt.
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:59.280]   10,000 bags of gold, right?
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:03.080]   This is a crazy, ridiculous amount of money, right?
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.600]   Some of the research I was doing, some of the commentaries,
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.580]   this would be the equivalent of billions
[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.160]   or maybe even like a made up number,
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:14.320]   like gazillions, okay, about of dollars.
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:17.160]   But Jesus was doing this on purpose, right?
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:21.520]   He purposely uses an exaggeration to make a point.
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:25.440]   A massive amount of money, there is no way in heaven
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.560]   or on earth that this guy will ever able
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.800]   to pay back this amount.
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.320]   Not even if he lives a million lifetimes
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.600]   would he be able to pay back this amount of money.
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.480]   And so it spells out the consequence.
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:40.620]   The consequence would be that he would have to sell himself,
[00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.480]   his wife, and his children, and everything that he owed
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:45.320]   to repay the debt.
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:50.000]   Now, I think in order for us to truly understand
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.480]   forgiveness from God's heart, we have to imagine ourselves
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.040]   in this situation a little bit.
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:59.220]   Because the truth is, like this man who was caught up
[00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:04.220]   in debt to the king, to his master, we are also in debt.
[00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:09.800]   But our debt is owed to the king of kings, to God himself.
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:13.320]   And we are in debt to God because of our sin.
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.840]   Every single person is.
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:20.560]   Scripture tells us all have sinned and fallen short
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:22.720]   of the glory of God.
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:26.800]   And scripture also tells us the reality is,
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:31.800]   the wages, the debt, the consequences of sin is death.
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.640]   Now, this is an idea we're gonna unpack
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.480]   a bit more clarity next week.
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:39.660]   But essentially, it means that every one of us,
[00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:43.760]   no matter who we are, we have all sinned against God.
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.440]   And because we have sinned against God,
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:48.620]   we owe him an insurmountable amount of debt
[00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:52.480]   that we will never, ever, ever be able to pay back.
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:56.240]   And because of this debt, God indeed has the right
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.560]   to demand everything from us, including our lives.
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:05.480]   Now, if the story ended here, it would be a bit sad,
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.120]   but justifiable, right?
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:10.360]   We owe this, this is the situation without fail,
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:13.260]   every single person is in.
[00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:16.500]   But the good news, the gospel is that this isn't
[00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:19.260]   where the story ends, right?
[00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.420]   And so Jesus tries to illustrate this in the way
[00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.500]   the master responds to his servant.
[00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:26.260]   At this, the servant fell on his knees before him.
[00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:27.940]   "Be patient with me," he begged,
[00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:30.500]   "and I will pay everything back."
[00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.580]   The servant's master took pity on him,
[00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:35.940]   "Cancel the debt and let him go."
[00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:40.700]   This man realizes, right, his inevitable doom.
[00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:43.500]   And he tries to do everything in his own power.
[00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:46.140]   He falls to his knees, he begs for surrender,
[00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.640]   he asks for patience and mercy, he literally begs,
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:49.940]   "I'm gonna pay you back."
[00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:52.300]   He makes promises that he cannot keep.
[00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.840]   It's almost like a pathetic and hopeless pleading.
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:59.140]   But remember, right, there is no way, this man knows
[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:01.700]   there's no way he can pay back the gazillion dollars
[00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:03.780]   he owes his master.
[00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:07.740]   And I found that sometimes that's the kind of situation
[00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:09.200]   we find ourselves in too.
[00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:13.180]   But when we realize our sin, when we realize
[00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:16.540]   how much in debt we are to God because of our sin,
[00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:19.900]   we end up promising God this and that, right?
[00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:22.180]   "I'm gonna be better, I'm gonna fix myself,
[00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:23.480]   "I'm gonna try and be better.
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:24.860]   "I'm never gonna do that again,
[00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:27.300]   "I'm never gonna do this again."
[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:30.300]   But what I found in my life is that the more I try,
[00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:32.180]   even though I try and I try and I try,
[00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:35.720]   the harder I try, it's almost like the harder we fail.
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:38.540]   And I've slowly come to the realization
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:42.620]   that through our own power, through our own will,
[00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:44.940]   we will never, ever, ever, ever be able
[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:47.540]   to pay back the debt of sin.
[00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:54.140]   And the master realizes this and God realizes this.
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:55.900]   And even though he has the right and authority
[00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:58.900]   to divine some sort of payment,
[00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.560]   something really beautiful happens.
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:06.380]   This phrase, "The servant's master took pity on him."
[00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:08.460]   The word pity here means like love actually
[00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.120]   and compassion.
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:13.580]   Not because the servant has done anything
[00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:17.560]   to deserve a pardon, but because of the master's heart
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:21.380]   of love and compassion, the debt is canceled
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:23.020]   and he is set free.
[00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:26.300]   And considering the amount of debt he was owed,
[00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:28.180]   this was unimaginable, right?
[00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.540]   The listeners of Jesus's time listening to this,
[00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:32.560]   were like, "This guy must be crazy
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.460]   "to just let all that money go."
[00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:37.420]   But this is the master saying,
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:39.620]   "What matters to me is not the amount of money
[00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:43.720]   "that he owes, I'm trying to demonstrate my heart
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:47.900]   "of grace, of mercy, of compassion, and of love."
[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:52.220]   And the servant walks away in freedom.
[00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:56.100]   And this is Jesus reminding us, right?
[00:22:56.100 --> 00:23:00.320]   This is an echo of God's message of forgiveness of sin.
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.100]   Actually, this is a message that God has said
[00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:04.660]   time and time and time again.
[00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:06.620]   We see God's heart to forgive.
[00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:09.540]   Throughout the Old Testament even, Isaiah 43, 25,
[00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:12.840]   "I will blot out your transgressions."
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:16.140]   Jeremiah 31, 34, "I will forgive their wickedness
[00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:18.500]   "and remember their sins no more."
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:21.620]   Psalm 103, 12, one of my favorite passages,
[00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:24.140]   "As far the east is from the west,
[00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:29.140]   "so far has he removed our transgressions from us."
[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:32.140]   This is our starting point, church.
[00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:33.600]   Never forget this.
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:39.600]   God's heart is one that is inclined towards forgiveness.
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:43.120]   His heart is one of compassion and of love.
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:45.200]   This is what we were singing over and over
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.120]   and over again this morning, right?
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:50.400]   His heart is that despite the fact that we have wronged him,
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.920]   we have disappointed him, we have sinned in our lives,
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:56.040]   we have missed the mark, we have gone against his will,
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:59.040]   despite that many times we make a mess of things,
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:03.000]   God still looks on us with love and compassion, amen?
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   And God loved us so much,
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.120]   he gave us his most precious gift, his son,
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:13.160]   as the only way to repay the debt of sin,
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:16.720]   God gave us his son, paying the debt of our sins
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:19.400]   so that we can have relationship with him.
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.600]   Again, this is something we're gonna talk more about
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.420]   next week and in the weeks to come.
[00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:27.360]   But what we need to understand for today is this,
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:30.800]   is we who worship the true God are a people
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:34.480]   who have had all their debt forgiven
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:37.360]   because our master loves us.
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:39.920]   Forgiveness, therefore, is important
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:43.640]   because it's the key not just to this life,
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:47.080]   but to eternal life as well.
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.760]   This is what I mean when I say forgiveness
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:50.440]   sits at the very heart of God
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:53.800]   and encapsulates all that he came to do,
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:58.640]   was to offer forgiveness for you, for me,
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.920]   for anyone who asks of it.
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:05.000]   If you are a follower of Jesus in this room today,
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.880]   you are free because you have received God's forgiveness.
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:14.080]   Now, as a people who've understood
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:17.440]   and experienced this wonderful gift of forgiveness,
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:20.760]   you would think that we would now want to share
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:22.720]   this gift with others as well,
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.520]   like last week when we were talking about the gospel.
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:27.960]   But again, it's hard and it's complicated.
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:31.280]   It doesn't always work this way.
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:32.760]   And for the servant on this story,
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:35.040]   we find that though, even though he is the one
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:38.440]   who has experienced the forgiveness of a great debt,
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:40.780]   his own heart remains unchanged.
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:44.760]   It tells us this, but when that servant went out,
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:46.580]   he found one of his fellow servants
[00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:48.800]   who owed him 100 silver coins.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.880]   He grabbed him and began to choke him.
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:53.760]   "Pay back what you owe me," he demanded.
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:56.860]   His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him,
[00:25:56.860 --> 00:26:00.680]   "Be patient with me and I will pay it back."
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:02.200]   But he refused.
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:05.480]   Instead, he went off and had that man thrown in prison
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.160]   until he could pay the debt.
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:12.080]   You see, when this man encounters someone who owes him money,
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.480]   his heart is not full of compassion.
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:18.580]   He remains tight-fisted and stingy about what he's owed.
[00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:22.440]   100 silver coins, okay, I said just now,
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:25.640]   you know that 10,000 bags of gold was like a gazillion
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:28.900]   dollars, 100 silver coins would have been about maybe
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:31.140]   the equivalent of four months' wages,
[00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:32.560]   the Bible scholars say.
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:34.580]   Not a small sum in and of itself,
[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:37.520]   but not insurmountable as well.
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:42.520]   But compared to what he owed, completely insignificant.
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:45.580]   And this dialogue that he has, it's almost an exact replica
[00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:49.140]   of what just happened with him and his master.
[00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:51.340]   There's a debt, there's a falling to the knees,
[00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:54.000]   begging for patience and mercy.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.760]   But like I said, the difference is that there's no mention
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:00.120]   of compassion from this servant's heart.
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:02.420]   Instead, it's the opposite.
[00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:06.320]   Listen to this term, he said he refused.
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:09.420]   When it says refused, this word means to sort of like
[00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:11.100]   harden his heart, right?
[00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.760]   He made a conscious decision in his mind,
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:16.680]   I am not willing, I'm going to make a choice
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.480]   not to forgive this person.
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.540]   And actually, it gets even worse.
[00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:25.360]   Not only does he refuse, but he tries to take actions
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:27.140]   into his own hands.
[00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:28.700]   He escalates.
[00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:30.660]   He purposely, first of all, goes out of his way
[00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:32.700]   to seek out this person who owes him.
[00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:36.540]   And when he finds him, it says he physically abuses him.
[00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:39.460]   He grabs him and he chokes him.
[00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:41.640]   He takes matters into his own hands.
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:46.140]   As you read this story, you probably, as I was,
[00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:47.780]   judging this guy right now.
[00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:51.800]   Well, how evil, how wicked is this man
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:54.340]   that he would do something like this?
[00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:59.520]   Now, before we get too judgmental of the servant,
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:02.640]   and as uncomfortable as this might make us,
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.860]   maybe we need to lean into this part of the story
[00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:06.220]   a little bit.
[00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:08.140]   And I found it helpful, instead of judging it
[00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:12.800]   from the outside, to use this scenario more like a mirror
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:15.700]   to check my own attitude toward forgiveness.
[00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:18.060]   Maybe it's a bit more like this servant
[00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:19.100]   than we think it is.
[00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:23.340]   Because like I said just now, when we've been sinned against
[00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:27.940]   our first reaction is more likely inclined towards revenge.
[00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:33.140]   We want to see people suffer and get what they deserve
[00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:34.520]   when they sin against us.
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:39.020]   I admit to you, in my own heart, this is often what I feel.
[00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:41.380]   I want to be able to enjoy all of God's forgiveness.
[00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:43.060]   Yes, I want to be able to come to God,
[00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:45.440]   ask for his forgiveness, and receive his compassion
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.420]   and mercy and grace.
[00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:49.580]   But sometimes when people sin against me,
[00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:52.140]   my first reaction is not, "Father, forgive them."
[00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:54.300]   My reaction is, "I hope they suffer.
[00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:59.120]   "I hope God punished them for what they did to me.
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.020]   "In fact, I hope they first, you know,
[00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:04.040]   "they experience 10 times worse than what they did to me.
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:05.640]   "That's what they deserve."
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:09.240]   I know I'm not alone in this.
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:12.720]   But this is precisely why this whole series
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:16.180]   and this conversation on forgiveness is important
[00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:18.220]   for us to have together.
[00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:22.580]   Because now Jesus starts to talk about the consequences,
[00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:24.860]   about debt, when we don't forgive.
[00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:29.300]   Jesus seems to be saying, "Unless you learn to forgive
[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:31.440]   "that you have been forgiven,
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:34.100]   "there are gonna be consequences.
[00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:38.460]   "And these consequences affect both the wider community,
[00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:42.240]   "but also your own relationship with God as well."
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:46.020]   Let me tell you how it leaves a strain
[00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:47.880]   on the community, first of all.
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.980]   When the other servants saw what had happened,
[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:52.960]   they were outraged and went and told their master
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:56.460]   everything that has happened, that had happened.
[00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:58.600]   All right, this is why I said
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.680]   this is a heart cry of the church.
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:03.060]   This is why I said we're gonna take this journey together
[00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:05.040]   as a community, as a body of Christ,
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:07.500]   as a family of brothers and sisters.
[00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:10.240]   Because often when we talk about forgiveness,
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:14.080]   we tend to look at it individualistically.
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.160]   That's just between two people.
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:20.320]   It doesn't concern the rest of the community.
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.480]   So let's say me and Derek here had beef.
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:24.240]   We had a problem with each other.
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:28.680]   If people find out, just leave the Eric and,
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.600]   Ellison and Derek can figure that out by themselves,
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.160]   it doesn't concern us.
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:34.500]   But actually it does.
[00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:38.660]   I think as a body of Christ, we all need to agree
[00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:41.600]   that forgiveness is a poison.
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:43.720]   And that if we don't deal with it,
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:46.560]   there is no way we can ever be the body of Christ
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:48.120]   that he has called us to be.
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:51.020]   How are we supposed to walk alongside each other
[00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:52.880]   if we're not willing to forgive?
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:55.100]   How are we supposed to grow in intimacy
[00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:58.080]   if we hold grudges against each other?
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:59.820]   How are we gonna encourage each other
[00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:02.840]   if we keep account of what's right and what's wrong?
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:04.120]   Every time we've wronged and right,
[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:07.000]   we keep an account of the rights and wrongs.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.820]   Therefore, as a community, we need to be aware of this.
[00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:14.980]   And as a community, if we see unforgiveness taking place,
[00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:17.260]   we need to do something about it
[00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:20.860]   so it doesn't corrupt the rest of the body of Christ.
[00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:22.360]   We need to call it out.
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:25.220]   What also points out is the community then,
[00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:27.300]   it's supposed to be a place of safety
[00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:28.900]   and of accountability.
[00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:31.460]   You see, if no one else had got involved,
[00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:34.140]   the servant would have got away with his actions.
[00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:36.260]   He would have got away with abusing his debtor,
[00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:37.840]   having him thrown in jail,
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:40.280]   punished for something like that.
[00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:42.760]   But notice, it was the other servants
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:44.520]   who called him out of his sin.
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:47.560]   It was the other servants, the community around him
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:48.800]   that flagged to the master,
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:51.480]   hey, something isn't quite right here.
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:55.160]   And we need to do and say something about it.
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:32:01.200]   So when it comes to forgiveness,
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.480]   we see forgiveness and justice
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:07.060]   is something that actually go hand in hand with each other.
[00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:10.620]   Forgiveness doesn't mean that one's causing harm
[00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:13.080]   can just get away with it.
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:15.980]   But forgiveness is what happens when a community,
[00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:18.860]   when somebody is wrong and the community around you
[00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:20.580]   comes around you to support you,
[00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:24.500]   to give you strength and power to confront the wrong
[00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:26.500]   and it's voiced out.
[00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:28.380]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:30.900]   Community, I mean, forgiveness doesn't mean saying
[00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:32.180]   it really didn't happen, right?
[00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:35.260]   It really doesn't matter, just let it go, right?
[00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:36.980]   In either of those cases, if it didn't matter,
[00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:40.020]   you just let it go, you don't need forgiveness, right?
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:41.380]   Maybe it's just a misunderstanding
[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:43.500]   that needs to be cleared up.
[00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:46.220]   But forgiveness is the process when we admit,
[00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:48.900]   yes, something did happen.
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:51.660]   It did matter, something has gone wrong
[00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:54.100]   and we need to deal with it.
[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:57.620]   And we deal with it together as a body of Christ.
[00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:00.100]   But the way we deal with it is to hand it over to God,
[00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:01.900]   to say we're not God.
[00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:05.540]   We don't get to set the standard of who is worthy
[00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:07.580]   of forgiveness or who is not.
[00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:11.820]   We simply offer forgiveness first
[00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:15.340]   because without that, we will never be able to move on
[00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:17.900]   as individuals and as a community.
[00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:23.500]   So that's how it affects us together as a body of Christ.
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:27.500]   On the same time though, it has an individual impact
[00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:29.460]   on us as well.
[00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:31.100]   And God spells out very clearly
[00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:33.540]   the results of withholding forgiveness.
[00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:37.220]   Then the master called the servant in.
[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:39.540]   You wicked servant, he said.
[00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:44.500]   I canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to.
[00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:47.200]   Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.540]   just as I had on you?
[00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:52.020]   In his anger, the master handed him over to the jailers
[00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:56.300]   to be tortured until he should pay back all that he owed.
[00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:59.260]   This is how my heavenly father will treat each of you
[00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:04.140]   unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.
[00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:07.640]   Again, this sounds harsh.
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:10.820]   But I think the point Scripture is trying to make is this.
[00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:14.060]   It might seem like when we don't offer forgiveness
[00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:18.180]   that we hold onto the power, that we hold onto the control.
[00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:20.100]   But when in reality, what Jesus is saying
[00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:22.680]   is when we withhold forgiveness,
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:25.440]   it's actually a great detriment to us.
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:28.700]   It seems like the other person
[00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:30.660]   is getting what they deserve.
[00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:34.300]   But in reality, what we're doing is condemning ourselves.
[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:37.100]   You might know the old saying,
[00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:39.340]   unforgiveness is like drinking a poison
[00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:41.300]   and expecting the other person to die.
[00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:46.980]   Right, so it has really, really serious consequences
[00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:50.340]   for ourselves if we withhold forgiveness.
[00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:52.940]   Maybe you could think about it this way.
[00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:55.820]   All right, we're gonna do a little exercise together.
[00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:57.120]   Okay, on the count of three,
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:59.340]   I want everybody to take a deep breath.
[00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:00.820]   When you take a deep breath,
[00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:03.260]   hold it in for as long as you can.
[00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:05.340]   Try and hold your breath.
[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:08.100]   One, two, three.
[00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:25.780]   Some of us might be able to do this for longer.
[00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:28.280]   But you're probably feeling a struggle to breathe now,
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:31.680]   right, to breathe out that breath.
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:33.880]   Right, none of us, nobody in this room
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:36.320]   is able to hold their breath forever.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.360]   You would either pass out,
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:39.920]   or if you really did just stop breathing altogether,
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:40.760]   you would die.
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:45.220]   In order for you to take your next breath,
[00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:48.240]   you have to release the breath you're holding.
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:51.800]   And so it is with forgiveness.
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:56.260]   If we want to receive forgiveness,
[00:35:56.260 --> 00:36:00.040]   we need to be able to release forgiveness to others as well.
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:07.620]   Like I said, though, this is the starting point.
[00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:10.700]   Right, this is just the introduction to this journey.
[00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:13.500]   And there's no way we can unpack and discover
[00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:16.740]   all the things that forgiveness means for us
[00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:19.860]   in one short sermon on a Sunday morning.
[00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:23.760]   So I want to encourage everybody here.
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.600]   Please try to come along, right,
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:28.040]   to the next few messages that we have,
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.700]   to the next few Sundays that we have
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:32.520]   in this journey of forgiveness.
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:33.560]   And this is not about, you know,
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:35.160]   like maintaining numbers at the Vine
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:38.180]   or anything like that, right, it's not about that.
[00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:40.600]   But what this is, is it's for your wholeness.
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:42.280]   It's for your understanding.
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:44.520]   It's for you to really be able to embrace
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:46.100]   what forgiveness means,
[00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:49.940]   so you can walk in the freedom of forgiveness.
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:53.240]   After all, Jesus taught us to pray.
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:58.060]   Forgive our sins as we forgive those
[00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:00.260]   who have sinned against us.
[00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:07.380]   And my heart is, as individuals, but also as a community,
[00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:10.820]   we will embrace this journey of forgiveness together.
[00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:13.460]   To step by step, learn what it means
[00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:16.900]   to receive and to give out
[00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:19.460]   what forgiveness really means in God's heart.
[00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:23.380]   This is how we build, continue the kingdom of God
[00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:24.620]   here on this earth.
[00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:29.420]   So would you pray with me as we start this journey together?
[00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:47.260]   Jesus, we know that this is an issue
[00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:49.020]   that many of us are wrestling with.
[00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:53.500]   And even if we're not wrestling with it right at this moment
[00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:56.820]   there is gonna come a time where we've been wronged
[00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:58.780]   and we need to offer forgiveness.
[00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:02.540]   Or someone wrongs us, or we wrong someone else
[00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:05.760]   and we need to be forgiven.
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:11.860]   And so Lord, I thank you that.
[00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:14.980]   Our starting point, Lord, is that you have already
[00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:17.680]   poured forgiveness out for us.
[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:20.620]   That you have offered forgiveness to us despite our sin,
[00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:23.580]   despite the ways that we've missed the mark
[00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:26.420]   when it comes to being in relationship with you, Lord.
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:31.200]   You've given us everything we need.
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:35.260]   Your most precious gift so that we can have forgiveness.
[00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:39.240]   Lord, as we receive this gift, Lord,
[00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:45.380]   we hear that you've also asked us to pour it out
[00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:47.000]   to those who have wronged us.
[00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:52.580]   And I know this is a hard journey for some of us to take.
[00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:58.620]   You know, you might be thinking right now,
[00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:02.440]   if you only knew the pain that I've been through,
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:06.760]   what this person did to me, how that person hurt me.
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:14.420]   And Father, we know that you meet us
[00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:15.820]   in those areas of pain.
[00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:19.680]   (soft music)
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:23.480]   And so Jesus, I pray that through your gentle guidance
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:26.280]   in the way that only you know how you would teach us
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:30.100]   how to forgive.
[00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:34.960]   That as we embrace forgiveness in our own hearts,
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:36.560]   it would soften our hearts.
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:47.160]   And as we learn to live a life defined by forgiveness,
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:49.280]   we will reflect your gospel, your grace,
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:50.820]   your mercy to everybody.
[00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:55.220]   And that even together as a community,
[00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:58.860]   we can keep encouraging each other in this journey.
[00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:02.980]   Keep encouraging each other to not keep things hidden,
[00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:06.440]   but to bring it out into the light when there's been sin,
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:08.040]   when there's been wrong in the community.
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:13.040]   We will not let that just be swept under the carpet.
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:15.040]   But Lord, because we know the proper way
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:19.400]   to deal with these things, we can walk with it together.
[00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:25.400]   And that this forgiveness that we offer to each other
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:29.120]   reflects, truly reflects the heart that you have for us.
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:33.780]   So Lord, be with us in these next few weeks
[00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:35.520]   as we walk through this.
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:37.580]   Encourage us, strengthen us, guide us.
[00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:40.940]   We pray this in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:43.520]   (gentle music)
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:46.100]   (gentle music)
