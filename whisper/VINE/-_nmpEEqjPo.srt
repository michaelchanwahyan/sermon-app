1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
 Amen.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Thank you, church.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 And thank you, worship team.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 You can have a seat and welcome the people around you.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Ah.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Well, welcome to the Vine.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Welcome, if you're joining us online, a big welcome to you as well.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 We are in week two of our sermon series in James.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 And if you haven't caught up with last week, because we had the typhoon,

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 the messages up online,

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Pastor Philip gave a wonderful, beautiful message to start us off in this series.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 And so if you haven't checked that out yet, I highly encourage you to do so.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 And so we can continue on our journey today.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 So James, chapter two, if you have a Bible, you can keep that open.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 We're going to be reading through the passage together.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 So one thing I figured about out about myself is that people have a hard time sort of placing where I'm from.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 So, for example, and I just got back from visiting my wife's family in northeast Texas, small town there.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 But every time I'm there, inevitably people mistake me for being Mexican.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Right. Because there's not very many Asian people there.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Right. And because my complexion, I tan very, very easily.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 In fact, let me show you a picture right now.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 OK, so take a look at this picture.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 OK, can you tell me what that is?

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Right. So that is my arm next to my wife's arm.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 OK, this is after. Yeah. Right.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 This is a Stevie Wonder song and a picture. OK, like this.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 It's incredible. OK, I just tan very, very easily.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 And my wife is very white. OK, but this is that's just you know, that's what happens to me when I spend some time in the sun.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 OK, I get dark and people have a hard time placing where I am.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Right. So in Texas, right in Brittany's hometown, I am Mexican.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 OK, look like Jorge, sound like George.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 OK, so it's like my accent throws people off completely.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 They don't have a clue where I'm from.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 But often here in Hong Kong, too, I get mistaken for different ethnicities, nationalities.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Right. People never think I'm Chinese.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 And I know this because when they come and talk to me, they always start a conversation in English.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 And so, you know, people think I'm Filipino.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 They think I'm Nepalese or Thai, Indonesian, Malaysian, anything else.

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 And so it's sort of like a superpower for me, I guess.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 So I can be all things to all people. Right. Amen. Yes.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 So actually, this comes in super handy, especially when I'm in holiday in Southeast Asia.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 So this one time I was in Thailand on holiday in Hua Hin, and I decided to go and check out some local kickboxing matches,

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 you know, UFC and kickboxing, wrestling. I love all that kind of stuff.

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 So I go downtown to Hua Hin. I'm dressed like a local.

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Flip flops, faded jeans, faded T-shirt. And everyone thinks I sit down.

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 You know, people talk to me in Thai. I try to order the food in Thai.

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 You know, just very minimal conversation and trying to get by as a local.

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 And so when I get down to the kickboxing stadium, you notice this.

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 I notice there's two lines, one for foreigners and one for locals.

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 If you go to the foreigner line, first of all, it's more expensive and the seats are like up in the bleachers.

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 You know, you're away from all the action. But if you go to the locals line, it's cheaper to get in.

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 And plus, like you're like right there in the pit around the ring, like ringside seats.

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 And so I look, people up there seem very conservative and boring, just sitting there down at the pit.

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 People were like shouting and like, you know, the fighters were hanging out there.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 It just seemed like a more fun place to be. So I thought, OK, I'm going to try.

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 OK, I'm going to go into the local line and see what happens.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 So, you know, I just stand back, observe what people are doing. And then that's what I do.

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 I get my money ready, you know, go. Don't say much. Just give them the exact money.

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 And I let get it let into the local line. Nobody questions me about who I am.

60
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Right. And it was amazing. Right. The atmosphere there was so loud, people shouting all sorts of things, you know.

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 So every time someone would shout something, I would just shout the same thing. Right.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Probably curse words or whatever it was I was shouting. People taking bets. I was throwing money around.

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 I had no idea what was going on, but I had the best time of my life. Right.

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 So exciting being there. But then the fights were over.

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 And I left the stadium and I was just back to being normal Ellison again. Right.

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 I was never a Thai local. I just looked the part for a moment.

67
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 And so this made me wonder, right, does this happen with our relationship, with our dedication and our faith in Jesus?

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Most of us in this room today, most of us watching online would probably profess with our mouth that Jesus is our Lord and Savior.

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Most of us would say we have a faith in Jesus. If you remember what Philip talked about last week, he was talking about people asking him and his child what religion they are.

70
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 If people ask you what religion are you, you would probably say, well, yes, I'm a Christian.

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 Right. And we gather together and we all know how to look the part, especially in an environment like this.

72
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Right. Where we're singing and praising, we can lift our hands, we can kneel down on the floor.

73
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 Right. If you're in if you've been in church for a while, you probably know how to speak Christianese.

74
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 Right. All these things on the outside we can present as a person who looks like they have a dedicated faith to Jesus.

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 But throughout the book of James, one of the key things we're going to try to be figuring out is how pure our religion is.

76
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 In other words, how do I know if we really have a faith in Jesus?

77
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 How do you know your faith is genuine? And even if I was to ask this more directly, does the faith you profess match up with the way we live our life?

78
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 Do we have the kind of faith that God is looking for? And if so, what are some of the hallmarks that genuine faith in Jesus looks like?

79
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 As we walk through the book of James, you're going to figure out this is the kind of faith that doesn't get tossed and turned around with the trials of life.

80
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 It's a faith that's completely countercultural to the ways of this world.

81
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 It's a kind of faith that is accompanied with action.

82
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 So, like I said, James, chapter two, we're going to open it up.

83
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 This is what it says.

84
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 My brothers and sisters, believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ must not show favoritism.

85
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes and a poor man in filthy old clothes also comes in.

86
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes, say, "Here's a good seat for you."

87
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 But say to the poor man, "You stand there or sit on the floor by my feet."

88
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?

89
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 So one of the first things James is trying to address in this part of his letter is something called favoritism.

90
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 Now, this isn't saying that as people of faith, you can't have certain preferences at all.

91
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 Like, for example, if you like strawberry ice cream instead of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream, I'd say you're a crazy person.

92
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 But go ahead, right? Get strawberry if you think that's better.

93
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 This is not what it's talking about.

94
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 What James is talking about is a toxic, evil kind of favoritism.

95
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Favoritism that is rooted in injustice and discrimination.

96
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 Favoritism that judges people by worldly standards and values.

97
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 And unfortunately, the scenario James is talking about happens all the time in this city, in Hong Kong.

98
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 I'm talking about people being judged by their economic status.

99
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 There is a disparity in this city between the rich and the poor, and it's very clearly seen as we go about everyday life.

100
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 We have in Hong Kong the largest wealth inequality in the world.

101
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 Consistently, this is something we shouldn't be proud about, right?

102
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 This is one of the top three most expensive places to live, right?

103
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney, places like that.

104
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 In Hong Kong, it's 有錢大哂, right?

105
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 If you're rich, you can have it all.

106
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 It's often the rich that get the honor and the privileges.

107
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 It's often the rich get special treatment and recognition.

108
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 And meanwhile, the poor are overlooked.

109
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 The poor have to eke out a living in the world's most expensive city,

110
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 cram their families into these tiny, subdivided flats,

111
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 not being able to afford the many things that we might take for granted.

112
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 But the truth is, and this is not a small part of our population,

113
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 1.4 million people in Hong Kong live below the poverty line.

114
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 How's this for a statistic?

115
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 Oxfam in 2024 found that the median monthly income for the poorest 10% of households

116
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 was only $1,600 per month, and this was a drop from before the pandemic.

117
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 In contrast, the wealthiest 10% of households have a median income of $131,000.

118
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 This is a rise in 10% from 2019.

119
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 The rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer,

120
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 a disparity of almost 90 times between these two groups.

121
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 Now, I felt the sting of this firsthand somewhat.

122
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 When I was a teenager, my mom would make me do all sorts of jobs.

123
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 So I've worked at all kinds of--I've delivered food on the street in Central.

124
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 I've worked at a carnival.

125
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 I've worked at a doctor's office, as a receptionist, all these kind of jobs.

126
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Her idea was to expose me to the different ways that people live

127
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 from my relatively sheltered and comfortable life that I had,

128
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 so all kinds of summer jobs.

129
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 And one of the summers, I found myself working at a warehouse in Kwun Tong.

130
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 Now, I got the job there because my uncle was the manager of the warehouse,

131
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 my dad's older brother, right?

132
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 And so--and this is the kind of place where, you know, all your sort of dry goods

133
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 at the supermarket sort of sit there before they get shipped off

134
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 to the park and shops and welcomes and all that stuff.

135
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 So I'm talking about, like, toothpaste, toilet paper, bleach, cleaning products,

136
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 all that kind of stuff is put in these warehouses,

137
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 and my job was to pull them off these shelves, put them into boxes ready

138
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 for them to be shipped to the different locations, right?

139
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 And it was dusty, it was dirty, it was hot.

140
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 My salary was HK$25 an hour, okay, HK$25 an hour.

141
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 This is about the year 2000, something like that.

142
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Now, for me, I was just doing it as some sort of an experience.

143
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 But I worked with two lovely old ladies who would sit there with me,

144
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 and I was climbing up, and they were packing the stuff.

145
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 But they were doing this for a living, all right?

146
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 HK$25 to survive in Hong Kong.

147
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 And yet, they were some of the most generous people I've ever met.

148
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 Every now and then, they would take me out for lunch, right?

149
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 This meant going down to the canteen downstairs where a meal was, like, HK$25 to, like, HK$40.

150
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 So they were spending 40--as much as I insisted I don't need this--

151
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 40% of their daily income to buy me lunch,

152
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 living on HK$25 an hour.

153
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 They had no idea that my uncle was their boss, right?

154
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 They were just doing it because they loved and they cared,

155
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 because that was their heart.

156
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 Now, in the same building, there were the corporate offices in the upper floors, right?

157
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 This space was cool and air-conditioned, right?

158
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 People wore suits and leather shoes, making much more than HK$25 an hour.

159
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 So I remember, true story, one time I needed to go up to the office floor to collect something.

160
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 I was all dirty and stinky from working in the warehouse.

161
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 I needed a drink of water, so there's a water cooler right there.

162
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 So I went to get a drink of water, only to be stopped by a member of staff there

163
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 and said, "Hey, don't do that. Warehouse workers aren't allowed here.

164
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 If you need a drink, you need to go back downstairs, right?

165
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 You're getting everything all dirty up here. Don't stay up here."

166
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 The way I wanted to say, "Do you know who my uncle is?"

167
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 Okay, like I didn't, okay, so don't do that either.

168
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 But stuff like that happens all the time in this city, right?

169
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 I'm sure I'm not the only one who has encountered this.

170
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 If there ever was a city where the poor and the rich live right next to each other,

171
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 yet are treated very differently, it's right here in Hong Kong.

172
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 Being rich gets you preferential treatment,

173
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 and it so happens that back then, in the time of James, it was the same thing.

174
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 2,000 years, not much has changed.

175
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 Now the question for us is, would we let this happen in our church?

176
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 On a more personal level, would you react this way yourself?

177
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 James tells us in this letter that if we find ourselves being inclined

178
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 to treat the rich with special attention, but look down on the poor,

179
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 this is discriminatory, it's judgmental, and it's evil

180
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 because it goes against the very heart of God.

181
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 Now of course it's tempting to act in this way.

182
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 We like to cozy up to the rich and the powerful

183
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 because of the benefits that it might have upon us.

184
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 We honor them in hopes that they will give us some of their money and wealth.

185
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 We do it out of the way for them because maybe one day,

186
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 they're going to help us back.

187
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 You scratch my back, I scratch yours, that sort of mentality.

188
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 But what can a poor person offer us?

189
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 They're just going to drain our resources, drain our time.

190
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 There is no benefit when we pay special attention to them.

191
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Now listen, church, this might be the way the world works,

192
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 but it is ungodly and incompatible with our faith

193
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 as Christians for us to act this way.

194
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 It's evil because it goes against God's heart.

195
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 And as we look through Scripture, God's heart has always been

196
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 to side himself with the poor and the needy.

197
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Think about the way Jesus entered into this world.

198
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 He didn't come in might, in pomp, in splendor.

199
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 He could have, but instead he came humbly, meek, with nothing,

200
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 nothing that we look upon that we could desire, physically speaking.

201
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 He chose to identify with the poor as he came into this world.

202
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 2 Corinthians 2.9 tells us that though Jesus was rich,

203
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 yet for your sake he became poor.

204
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 And so how God calls us as a people of faith to work is opposite

205
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 of how the world works.

206
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 He tells us that it is the poor that we should pay attention to.

207
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 It is the poor that we should open our hands wide to,

208
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 Deuteronomy 15.11.

209
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 It is the poor that we should be inviting to our dinners

210
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 and our banquets, that's in the book of Luke.

211
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 It is the poor that the weak that we must work hard to help,

212
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 or the poor and the weak that we must work hard to help, Acts 20.

213
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 It is the poor that we are called to sell everything

214
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 and give it to them, Matthew 19.

215
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 And this beautifully is summarized in what James calls

216
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 in his letter, the royal law.

217
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 It is the royal law because he got this from his brother,

218
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 Jesus himself, who is the King of kings.

219
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 It's what Jesus calls as part of the greatest commandment.

220
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 You are to love your neighbor as yourself.

221
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 And our neighbor's church are the needy, the widows,

222
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 the orphans, the poor.

223
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 A genuine faith in Jesus will never show favoritism

224
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 to the rich in expense of the poor.

225
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 A genuine faith in Jesus will always take action

226
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 and be the hands and feet that he has called us to be.

227
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 And by the way, favoritism and discrimination

228
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 isn't just about rich and poor.

229
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 Any form of discrimination and favoritism

230
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 that dishonors people is a dishonor and an insult to God

231
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 because we have been made in his image.

232
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 But James is using the rich and the poor here as an example.

233
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 And to really drive this point home,

234
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 he goes on to deliver one of the hardest hitting,

235
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 maybe one of the most controversial

236
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 and challenging passages in the whole of scripture.

237
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 He tells us this.

238
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 "What good is it, my brothers and sisters,

239
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 "if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds?

240
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 "Can such faith save them?

241
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 "Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes

242
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 "and daily food, if one of you says to them,

243
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 "'Go in peace, keep warm and well fed,'

244
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 "but does nothing about their physical needs,

245
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 "what good is it?

246
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 "In the same way, faith by itself,

247
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 "if it's not accompanied by action, is dead."

248
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 Now I say this is controversial

249
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 because it seems to contradict what we love about our faith.

250
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 Our faith tells us that Jesus loves us no matter what

251
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 and that there's nothing more that we can do

252
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 to make him love us.

253
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 We say that salvation is a free gift, right?

254
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 It's salvation, grace and forgiveness.

255
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 It's a free gift of God.

256
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 There is nothing we can do to earn that kind of love

257
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 that God has for us.

258
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 And I would say yes and amen to these statements.

259
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 But it seems as though right now James is saying

260
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 that there are certain things actually you do have to do

261
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 for our faith.

262
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 That faith alone is not enough.

263
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 And I would say the answer to that question is also yes.

264
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 Because remember the point we're trying to answer

265
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 with the point we made at the beginning,

266
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 the point Philip pointed us towards last week.

267
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 We are trying to determine whether our faith is real.

268
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 We are trying to figure out what this pure religion is.

269
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 And pure religion, real faith has to be backed up by action.

270
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 Now don't get me wrong, okay?

271
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 I'm not saying that your actions are going to save you.

272
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 That's not the point.

273
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 That's bad theology.

274
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 This isn't what James is trying to say either.

275
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 But what we're trying to say is that those who truly follow Jesus

276
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 will always be able to show you in some way

277
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 that the faith is real.

278
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 Genuine faith has real deeds behind it.

279
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 This is how, when I was doing some research,

280
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 this is how one of the commentaries put it.

281
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 James is not arguing that works must be added to faith.

282
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 His point rather is that genuine biblical faith

283
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 will inevitably be characterized by works.

284
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 These are hard-hitting questions,

285
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 but we need to get to the bottom of it

286
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 because our entire relationship with Jesus is on the line.

287
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 James asks us, "What good is it, my brothers,

288
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 "if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds?

289
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 "Can such faith save them?"

290
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 Let's answer these questions.

291
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 Notice first that James says "claims."

292
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 Now look, just because we claim something,

293
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 it doesn't always mean it's true.

294
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 People make all sorts of wild claims.

295
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 But if we believed everything that everyone said,

296
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 we would be fools.

297
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 I could tell you that LeBron James and I,

298
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 we have the same basketball skills.

299
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 What he can do on the court, I can do too.

300
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 I can do a slam dunk and shoot threes.

301
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 I can do all that kind of stuff.

302
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 You would rightly say, "Okay, prove it."

303
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 There's a court right down there next to the MTR station.

304
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 Bring a basketball, show me your skills.

305
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 And it's the same thing when it comes to our faith.

306
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 If someone claims to have a faith in Jesus,

307
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 they should be able to show you evidence of their faith.

308
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 Otherwise, how will we know that what they're saying is true?

309
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 We can't unless we see their faith in action.

310
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 And the second part of that question is even a bit scarier.

311
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 Like I said, these things have eternal consequences.

312
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 One of the main motivations that people have in the journey of faith

313
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 in becoming a Christian is because they want some sort of assurance of salvation.

314
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 They want to know that after they die,

315
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 they're not going to end up in some horrible place called hell,

316
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 but rather live out all of eternity in heaven where there's joy and bliss

317
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 and all the nice, wonderful things you can think of.

318
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 Now, going to heaven, being in the kingdom of God for all eternity after we die,

319
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 salvation, eternal life is a promise and a reward from Jesus.

320
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 But only for those who have a real and genuine faith

321
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 that demonstrates real acts of service and love to those around us.

322
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 So the answer to the question is no.

323
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 A faith that does not live itself out with deeds

324
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 is not the kind of faith that leads to salvation.

325
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 James makes it even clearer for us.

326
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 He gives another scenario for us to imagine.

327
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 He says, "Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes or daily food.

328
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 If one of you says to them, 'Go in peace, keep warm and well fed,'

329
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 and does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it?"

330
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 It's not a complicated question.

331
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 The answer is simple.

332
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 The Cantonese translation for this type of situation is "見死不救."

333
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 It's kind of like an insult we use in Cantonese.

334
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 If you see someone in need but you don't help them,

335
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 it's like a pitiful, shameful thing to do.

336
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 So what good is it, asks James.

337
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 The answer is it's no good.

338
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 Faith that is not accompanied by action is a dead kind of faith.

339
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 It's no good just to give people your words and well wishes

340
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 when the needs that they have are right in front of you.

341
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 It's interesting because this kind of behavior sort of makes sense.

342
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 If you follow on from what James is talking about before,

343
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 well if we're only showing favoritism to the rich and the powerful and the wealthy,

344
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 well they don't really need anything.

345
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 And so there's nothing really we can do for them.

346
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 And so when the needs of the poor are presented to us,

347
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 we too are inclined to do nothing because it doesn't benefit us.

348
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 There's nothing in it for us.

349
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 But at the same time, of course, we're not monsters.

350
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 And so let's give them a prayer.

351
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 We don't want to totally ignore them.

352
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Let's scratch that itch on our conscience and give them our well wishes

353
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 and send them on their way.

354
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 At least we did something, right?

355
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 I've been asking myself and I ask you, church, is that what Jesus would do?

356
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 Does that reflect God's heart for his children?

357
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 And in preparing the message series in James and in working with our team,

358
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 I went through and I'm currently going through a lot of wrestling

359
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 when it comes to this message.

360
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 Because if I'm honest, quite often when it comes to a situation like this,

361
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 I feel like my reaction doesn't always reflect the faith that I claim.

362
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 When there's physical needs in front of me that are to be met,

363
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 sometimes I panic, I shrink back, I don't want to do anything about it.

364
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 And I make excuses.

365
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 Oh, well, you know, if I help them now, I'm going to be stuck helping them forever.

366
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 I don't have the time and the resources for that.

367
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 Or you say, is it really going to help that much if I just do this right now?

368
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 You know, it doesn't really help them in the long run.

369
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 So maybe it's better for me not to get involved.

370
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 Or maybe, you know, like you say, I've already prayed for them.

371
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 Right? God can do immeasurably more than I can do.

372
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 So, you know, I've already prayed for them.

373
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 I leave it in God's powerful hands and he'll take care of it.

374
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 And then I start to feel guilty and ashamed, right?

375
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 Because I knew I was supposed to do and I didn't do anything about it.

376
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 And it all gets super overwhelming and anxiety starts to set in

377
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 and all this kind of stuff.

378
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Maybe you can relate to this too.

379
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 And I'm working on it.

380
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 Okay.

381
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 And this is how I try to resolve it and figure it out.

382
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 And I'm just being honest and real with you here.

383
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 I don't have the answer to really haven't got it all figured out yet.

384
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 But this is what I feel like God is leading me to in situations like this.

385
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 So, like I said, as people who possess faith in Jesus,

386
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 if we ever come across a situation where we can meet an obvious physical need

387
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 like if we're taking the words of James literally here,

388
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 something immediate that we tangible that we can do,

389
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 then we have to respond.

390
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 We must respond.

391
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 So, for example, one thing that I personally try to practice as much as possible,

392
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 when I see someone on the street that's homeless or sleeping rough,

393
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 someone asking for money, I will stop and ask,

394
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 "Can I get you something to eat?

395
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 Are you hungry?"

396
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 And if the answer is yes, then I go and get them something to eat, right?

397
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 Go and get a fine hut from down the road, go to 7-Eleven, get some snacks, whatever.

398
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 If I see an elderly lady, often it is a lady, right, pushing those heavy carts down the street,

399
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 I will stop her and say, "Hey, where are you going?"

400
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 Down to the collection point, let me push it the rest of the way.

401
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 You take a rest and I'll push it for you.

402
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 Take a break.

403
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 It's hot.

404
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 It's sweaty.

405
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 I can do this much easier.

406
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 All right?

407
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 10-15 minutes out of my day, but that should be okay, right?

408
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 It's always the right time to do the right thing.

409
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 At the same time, I've also had to learn to let go of the idea that I have to solve all their problems.

410
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 I don't think that's the point either.

411
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 Also, that's impossible.

412
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 I'm just a man.

413
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 I'm nobody.

414
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 I'm just a man.

415
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 I'm not the savior.

416
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 Jesus is their savior, and ultimately, of course, we want to point people towards them,

417
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 but I don't want to do nothing.

418
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 I'm not content with just to leave them with my thoughts and my prayers.

419
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 In that moment, in that space, I've done as much as I could.

420
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 I've tried my best to show them Jesus' love.

421
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 I've responded in obedience with some sort of action, and I try to be at peace with that.

422
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 And I think this is what Jesus is expecting of his followers.

423
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 He knows we can't do everything.

424
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 He is the savior, and his call ultimately is for us to bring people to him,

425
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 and he is indeed able to do more than we ask or imagine,

426
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 but he's also looking for people who are willing to take action.

427
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 If you want to be very clear about this, Matthew 25 lays it down so clearly.

428
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 He says this, "For when I was hungry, you gave me something to eat.

429
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 I was thirsty, you gave me something to drink.

430
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 I was a stranger, and you invited me in.

431
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 I needed clothes, and you clothed me.

432
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 I was sick, and you looked after me.

433
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 I was in prison, and you came to visit me."

434
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 Jesus tells us that whenever we care for the least of our brothers and sisters

435
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 in these sort of situations, we are doing it for him.

436
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 These are the people who get to enjoy the inheritance and the kingdom of eternal life.

437
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 But he also gives us a sobering warning for those who ignore these needs.

438
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 When he was hungry, and we gave him nothing to eat.

439
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 We were thirsty, and we gave him nothing to drink.

440
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 He was a stranger, and we don't invite them in.

441
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 They needed clothes, and you did not clothe me.

442
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 I was sick and in prison, and you did not look after me.

443
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 Jesus tells us that those who fail to respond in love and compassion,

444
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 but yet claim to know him, are not just ignoring people, they're ignoring him.

445
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 Whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me,

446
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 and the consequences are eternal fire and punishment.

447
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 Now, let's remember the main point of what Jesus is trying to say.

448
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 How do we know that our faith is genuine?

449
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 A faith that leads to salvation.

450
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 A faith that matches up with what we profess with our mouth.

451
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 Because both these groups of people claim to know Jesus,

452
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 but only one is accepted and welcomed into his kingdom.

453
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 It's not just believing in Jesus that counts as faith.

454
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 James goes on to say, "You believe that there is one God? Good.

455
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 Even the demons believe that and shudder."

456
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 Just let that sink in for a moment, church.

457
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 It is a brutally honest reflection that we're looking at today.

458
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 I get it.

459
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 But if a faith is just words, James is telling us that your faith

460
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 is no different from the faith that demons have.

461
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 We see this all the time in Scripture as Jesus is casting out demons.

462
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 The demons are declaring, "Yes, this is the Savior. This is the Messiah."

463
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 Jesus has to actually say, "Don't tell anyone about this."

464
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 Because they even know who he is.

465
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 Now, wouldn't it be a shame if a group of Christians that profess faith in Jesus

466
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 to have the same kind of faith that demons have?

467
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 Demons that are actively trying to do everything they can to distract people from the Lord.

468
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 Demons who are losers, who have already lost the battle.

469
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 We don't want to be on that side, right, church?

470
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 This is a call to embrace genuine faith.

471
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 A faith of active, working obedience to Jesus.

472
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 And yes, part of this is our concern for the poor and the needy,

473
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 but it applies to every single part of how we live our lives.

474
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 It's a life that's going to take action and risk and sacrifice.

475
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 And for example, James finishes with two contrasting characters, Abraham and Rahab,

476
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 to let us know what God is expecting for those who follow him.

477
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 Let's look at Abraham first. James writes,

478
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 "Was not our father Abraham considered righteous for what he did

479
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?"

480
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 You see that his faith and his actions were working together

481
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 and his faith was made complete by what he did.

482
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 And the scripture was fulfilled that says, "Abraham believed God

483
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 and it was credited to him as righteousness and he was called God's friend."

484
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 You see that a person is considered righteous by what they do and not by faith alone.

485
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 If you recall the story of Abraham, right, what he called to do was absolutely wild.

486
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 It was insane, right?

487
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 Imagine you having to wait till you're 100 years old, right,

488
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 before finally God gives you the thing that you've been hoping for.

489
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 A son that's going to finally, your true son,

490
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 that finally is going to pass down your bloodline, that through this son,

491
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 you're going to have generations and generations, as many as stars in the sky.

492
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 Only for then God to say, "Here he is, give him back to me.

493
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 Sacrifice him on the altar."

494
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 Now, what would you do?

495
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 Now, honestly, for me, I don't know.

496
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 But Abraham had a faith that even if God asked him to do something

497
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 that made no sense to him whatsoever, he would respond in obedience and do it anyway.

498
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 I was trying to put myself in Abraham's shoes as I was preparing this, right?

499
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 I have sons, two boys, right, and as ungentle as my parenting is sometimes, okay?

500
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 I can't imagine the fear, the guilt, the gut-wrenching torture it must have been

501
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 to take Isaac, bind him up, put him on the altar, to raise the knife.

502
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 It was only at the final second before he plunged that knife into his son's heart

503
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 that God said, "Stop, do not harm the child."

504
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 Abraham put action behind his faith.

505
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 And Rahab is the same.

506
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 She translates her faith into action, even though it was super risky for her.

507
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 She had no idea, if you know the story, if the spies would honor their word.

508
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 But what she had heard about was this God that was able to part the Red Sea,

509
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 that people were able to walk across dry land, right, to be saved from slavery,

510
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 that these people had a God behind them that was destroying all their enemies.

511
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 She had only heard about these stories and she decided,

512
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 "I'm going to put my faith in a God like that, not in these pagan gods

513
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 that my family and my people have been worshipping.

514
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 I'm going to put my faith in this most high, living, powerful God."

515
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 And she puts her faith in God and she hides the spies.

516
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 And she and her family are saved because she put her faith into action.

517
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 Now on the surface, these two people couldn't be more different.

518
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 We have a male and a female.

519
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 We have the founding father of the Judeo-Christian faith

520
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 and a Canaanite prostitute.

521
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 And James does this on purpose.

522
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 He does this because he's saying, "It doesn't matter who you are,

523
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 but these are the people that God is looking for,

524
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 those who have an obedient, action-filled faith,

525
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 faith expressing itself through love of God."

526
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 So how about us?

527
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 Are we willing to take risks for Jesus?

528
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 Are we willing to put our faith into action?

529
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 Are we willing to face danger to demonstrate our faith in Him?

530
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 What has God been calling you to respond in obedience to?

531
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 What has God been calling you into action?

532
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 Translating belief into action,

533
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 even when it seems impossible or downright dangerous,

534
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 that is the faith that matters.

535
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 Faith without deeds is dead.

536
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 So having heard all of this, let me ask you one more time today.

537
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 Is your faith genuine?

538
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 Because let me tell you, if you're banking on the fact that you went to a rally one time

539
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 or at youth camp, you said a little prayer,

540
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 and maybe even you were baptized, and since then, your life hasn't changed,

541
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 you haven't done anything to put your faith in Jesus,

542
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 your actions haven't shown that you live a life that is obedient to Christ,

543
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 your heart does not break for the things that break His heart,

544
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 you're not engaged in looking after the poor and the marginalized,

545
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 I'm sorry to tell you that's a dead kind of faith, church.

546
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 But if we serve a risen and living God, a God that has come to give us life,

547
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 Jesus loves you too much to let you keep going down that road.

548
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 He loves you so much that He gave His life for you.

549
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 Think about that for a moment.

550
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 How did Jesus show His love for us?

551
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 Not just by telling us with His words, as comforting and as beautiful as they are,

552
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 but they're only comforting and beautiful because He put action behind His words.

553
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 Jesus stepped out of His throne in heaven.

554
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 He lived among us.

555
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 He healed us.

556
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 He fed us.

557
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 He served us.

558
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 He washed our feet.

559
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 He embraced us.

560
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 He invites us.

561
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 He spoke up for us.

562
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 And ultimately, He went to the cross to die for you, to show you His love.

563
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 He put His love into action.

564
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 And He loves you so much that He perfectly lived on this earth

565
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 to tell us what an active faith looks like.

566
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 He knows you too well to be content just to watch you waste your life

567
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 by not putting your faith into action.

568
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 And when Jesus comes back, He's looking for those who are truly faithful.

569
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 Is this what He's going to find when He comes back for this church?

570
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 Is this what He's going to find when He looks at your life?

571
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 So I'm going to ask you to close your eyes for a moment, church,

572
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 and just think about those things for a minute.

573
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 I know it's been hard.

574
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 We've been wrestling a lot with the book of James as we prepared this.

575
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 And in this beautiful gathering of God's children who make up this community,

576
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 and as God has called us into the uncharted, He's calling us into action.

577
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 And like I said, all this is rooted.

578
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 This is not a guilt trip.

579
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 This is not a bashing over your head.

580
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 At least I hope not.

581
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 But this is a reminder of the love that God had for you.

582
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 This is a reminder of the potential that lives in you.

583
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 The plans that God had in mind when He created you,

584
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 when He knitted you together in your mother's womb,

585
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 that He had a plan and a purpose for you to live out.

586
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 And for sure that's one that includes obedience to Him,

587
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 of doing things in the sake of His name that you never thought you'd be able to experience or see.

588
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 But because you allowed God's love and power to work through you,

589
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 you bring honor and praise to Him and life to others by doing that.

590
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 And like I said just now, Jesus loves us too much to let us just be content with this comfy, cozy Christianity that is so easy to embrace.

591
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 But rather it's this life-changing, radical obedience to God

592
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 that will bring salvation to you and those around us,

593
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 that declares God's kingdom on earth as it is in heaven.

594
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 And so Jesus, we pray, if I could be so bold in praying on behalf of my brothers and sisters,

595
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 that we would not be content just to have a faith that's based upon lip service,

596
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 that's based upon a few songs that we might sing every now and then.

597
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 But it's a life of obedience.

598
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 It's a life that's constantly looking out for ways that we can show your love to others, no matter who they are.

599
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 Knowing, as we saw in the video earlier, that your grace is sufficient for us,

600
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 that even if it's the most challenging, mind-boggling, not-makes-sense thing to this world that you've called us to do,

601
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 that we will have the faith to put that into action and do it anyway, knowing you'll meet us where we are,

602
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 that you'll never leave us abandoned, that you'll never leave us or forsake us,

603
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 that we have a helper in the Holy Spirit,

604
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 and we have the Most High God who fights every battle on our behalf.

605
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 So Jesus, make this our heart, our lives.

606
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 May we be your good and faithful servants, sons and daughters, as we live out our life in this world,

607
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 truly worshipping you with everything we have.

608
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 We put our faith in you, Jesus. In your name we pray. Amen.
