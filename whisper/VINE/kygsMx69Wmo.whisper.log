[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200]   Well, I'm so glad you're here.
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.200]   Welcome to the Vine.
[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.200]   My name's Andrew.
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.040]   I'm one of the pastors here, and we're really grateful that you're here on the first Sunday
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.320]   of 2025.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.320]   Can you believe 2025?
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.160]   Pastor Ellison said to us this morning that there are people that are just being born
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.000]   recently who will see the year 3000.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.440]   Get your head around that.
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.200]   Okay, only that blew me away.
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.200]   Okay, whatever.
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.600]   I just thought that was cool.
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.840]   My daughter might see the year 3000.
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.080]   Anyway, I really believe, as we're stepping into 2025, I really believe this.
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.200]   We're about to begin what I believe is going to be the most significant year in the Vine's
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.200]   history.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.400]   I have so much excitement in my heart, so much longing for what I sense that God wants
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.400]   to do amongst us.
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.560]   I believe that this will be our most significant year in the history of this church.
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.800]   And I want to say this, I think it's going to be your most significant year too, because
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.420]   the church isn't an institution.
[00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.840]   It's not an organization, although we sometimes need those things in the fabric and structures
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.840]   of churches.
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.360]   But the church, if it's anything, is the people.
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.040]   And I believe that this can be, will be, and I'll say it in a prophetic way over you, your
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.960]   most significant year ever.
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.960]   And I don't know how you feel as you step into 2025.
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.440]   Perhaps some of you in here, you feel excited and expectant.
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.320]   Maybe some of you feel cautious.
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.260]   Maybe you're a bit careful as you step in.
[00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.680]   Maybe 2024 was a difficult, challenging year, and you're not sure how 2025 is going to go.
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.840]   And you're sort of tentatively stepping into the year.
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.320]   Whether you're stepping into this year with excitement or whether you're a little bit
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.000]   cautious, here's what I do know.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.980]   That the God that we worship and we serve is a God whose primary purpose is the movement
[00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:52.000]   of God's people forward into a deeper relationship with Jesus Christ.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.240]   The primary focus that we have from God is to move his people forward to become more
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.840]   and more like Christ Jesus.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.120]   And if that is true, then surely this year has every chance to be your most significant
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.120]   year ever.
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.160]   Because we don't serve a God who's going backwards.
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.400]   Come on church.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.560]   We don't serve a God who's heading back somewhere.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.860]   We serve a God who always moves forward, and therefore the church is always moving forward.
[00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.120]   And actually the work of the Spirit is always to come and transform and change us.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.280]   Yes, so that we are transformed, but almost more than that, so that we would become an
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.920]   influence in our city, in our workplaces, in the places that we have an influence for
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.240]   his kingdom, for the gospel, for the hope that is in Christ Jesus.
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:49.840]   In other words, God changes you so that you can partner with him in changing the world.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.720]   And I want you to hear this not in some sort of puffed up kind of, "Oh, it's the new year.
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.240]   We're going to change the world."
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.600]   Only Jesus changes the world.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.080]   You don't change the world.
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.920]   Jesus changes the world.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.600]   But here's the most profound thing.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.280]   It is Jesus that changes the world, but he's decided to do it through the church, through
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.280]   us, through broken vessels, through the ones that don't always have the answers, through
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.460]   the ones that don't always get it right, through the ones that have sin and are wrestling
[00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.460]   with sin.
[00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.180]   God has decided in his infinite wisdom to choose the broken vessels of this world to
[00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.840]   bring his spirit and his hope and his gospel into the world.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.400]   And if God is moving forward, oh, how we should be moving forward.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.940]   We should be a church with momentum, a church on the go.
[00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.480]   And so however you feel as you step into this year, and let's be honest, 2025, there's going
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.720]   to be some challenges.
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.400]   We know that there are challenges in the world right now, geopolitically, and perhaps there
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.520]   are going to get worse as we go forward.
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.280]   And maybe you recognize that there are some challenges and some struggles in your own
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.560]   life right now.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.600]   This is personal for you.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.320]   You also feel personal challenges.
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.320]   Whatever challenges you might be facing, we cannot start this year in retreat.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.480]   We cannot start this year defeated.
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.880]   Because if our God is a God of momentum, moving his people forward to become more like Christ
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.200]   Jesus, then surely we have to start this year saying, "I'm ready to go."
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.200]   Okay.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.200]   Try that again.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.200]   No, I won't.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.200]   I'm not even going to try it again.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.200]   Okay.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.200]   We're just going to carry on.
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.200]   Now, listen to this.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:33.840]   If we're going to be a church in Hong Kong that takes the gospel seriously in 2025, we
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.040]   have to take Jesus's word seriously.
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.920]   And Jesus, right at the end of his life, gathers his disciples up on that mountain, doesn't
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.920]   he?
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.800]   And before his ascension, he's resurrected.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.320]   So he's in his resurrection power, but it's before he ascends and he gathers his most
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.400]   faithful disciples around him.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.760]   There were 11 of them at that time.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.160]   And he speaks into them and he says these words.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.080]   He says, "All authority on heaven and earth has been given to me.
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.560]   So now stay here."
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.560]   No, he didn't say that.
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.640]   He did say that in a minute because he says, "Stay and wait for the Holy Spirit."
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.520]   But in this moment, he says, "Now go.
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.520]   Go.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.520]   I'm sending you," he says.
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.440]   And you want to know what I'm sending you to do?
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.000]   He says, "I want you to make disciples of all the nations.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.920]   I want you to baptize them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.200]   And then I want you to teach them to obey everything that I've commanded you.
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.200]   And here's the kicker.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.740]   I will be with you.
[00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.960]   Every step of the way, I will be with you."
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.080]   So Jesus says, one of his last words to his disciples is, "I have all authority and power.
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.160]   So here's what I'm saying to you as the church.
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.840]   I want you to go.
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.440]   I want you to go forward in that authority and power that is invested into you through
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.960]   the work of the Holy Spirit."
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.560]   That's why he says, "Wait and do this until you receive the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.760]   Once you have that Holy Spirit, you are to go."
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.240]   And so we must be a church on the move.
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.240]   Does that make sense?
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.540]   A church with mission.
[00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:58.640]   So if 2025 is anything for the vine, it should be a year of action.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.820]   Now I want to just say that this is not some new calling for us.
[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.820]   This is not like some new vision or some fresh idea at the start of the year.
[00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.680]   This has actually been birthed by the Holy Spirit in our community over multiple years
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.880]   of what the Lord's been doing amongst us.
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.840]   In fact, I want to actually pull the threads together a little bit this morning and help
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.360]   you to see what the Holy Spirit has been doing in us as a community.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.620]   In 2022, we felt called to heal.
[00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.760]   It was right off the back of COVID.
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.400]   And we felt like the Holy Spirit said to us, 2022 is going to be a year of healing.
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.800]   A year of gathering back together for the first time after all that pandemic, after
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.600]   all the social distancing, even after the social movement that had happened in 2019
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.600]   and 2020.
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.520]   As we gathered back together physically for the first time in 2022, we knew that we were
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.000]   being called to heal.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   That all of us were carrying some baggage.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.320]   In fact, one of the things that we said to us that year is that we need to shake the
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.320]   dust off.
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.520]   We all had gotten a little bit dusty and it was great to get back together again in 2022.
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.760]   Then in 2023, we felt God call us to Exodus.
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.640]   We actually spent a whole year pretty much studying the book of Exodus in Scripture.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.880]   And in that book, we saw so many profound, important things for us as Christians.
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:14.200]   How God wants to bring us on a journey out of our slavery to sin into newness and freedom,
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.760]   into a promised land that he has given to us.
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.520]   And we taught that year that Hong Kong is that promised land for us.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.040]   And that we need to be an Exodus people.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:27.840]   People that have been called out of slavery of sin into new life in Christ so that we
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.320]   can enter our promised land and do the things that God has on his heart for us to do.
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.320]   That was 2023.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.680]   But then in 2024, we said, God is calling us to intimacy.
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.120]   That was the word we had for us as a church that whole year.
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.520]   Now that made sense because you know what happened in Exodus.
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.840]   God calls his people out of their slavery into sin and he calls them out in order to
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.720]   call them in to his presence on Mount Sinai.
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:55.760]   Remember that if you're around here in 2023, we were called out of our slavery in to his
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.240]   presence around Mount Sinai.
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:03.640]   And so it followed that a year of Exodus would follow in 2024 to a year of intimacy.
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:08.760]   And we invited you to connect deeply with God, to have time with Jesus, to make it a
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.920]   priority to fall more in love with Christ.
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.700]   I had the blessing of having a sabbatical last year.
[00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.480]   And so that was a great way for me to do that.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.240]   And I know that many of us did that in lots of different ways.
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.840]   It was a year of intimacy.
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.600]   But here's the important thing.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.960]   As a leadership, even though we discern that God was calling us into intimacy, we knew
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.660]   that that intimacy was actually on behalf of a bigger purpose.
[00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:35.960]   And while it was important that we would connect with Jesus, fall more in love with him, spend
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:41.080]   more time with him last year, it was always on behalf of something else.
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:46.640]   What you have to understand in scripture is that intimacy is a platform, not a destination.
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.880]   Come on church.
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.720]   Intimacy is a platform, not a destination.
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:54.520]   Jesus actually said in John 15, where we get the name of the vine from, the very passage
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.520]   that we get it from, he says, "If you abide in me, you will bear much fruit."
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:03.360]   Now there's this stuff that will happen out of the intimacy you have with me.
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:09.520]   So intimacy is this platform through which and from which we are able to serve.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.480]   If we serve without the intimacy, we will burn out.
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:19.240]   But if we abide in him, we are able to do more in our city, more in the world around
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.200]   us out of that abiding in him.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.000]   So intimacy is a platform, not a destination.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.520]   Does that make sense to you?
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:31.720]   So that is why as we head into 2025, we knew that intimacy was not always going to be there.
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:35.680]   We knew that actually this year is a call to action.
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:40.360]   This is to take that fruit that hopefully every single one of us has received last year
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:46.200]   and begin to sow that fruit into our workplaces, into the places of influence that we have,
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.600]   into the city that we love so much.
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:52.720]   We are called this year out of intimacy into action.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.280]   That doesn't mean that we let go of intimacy.
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.200]   It doesn't mean that that was a 2024 thing.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.160]   You don't need to be intimate with Jesus anymore.
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:04.280]   We have to abide in him, remain in him, but we have to shift our mentality from just being
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:10.480]   with him to being with him for a purpose, being with him so that we can partner with
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.880]   him to change the world.
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.800]   Does that make sense to you?
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.480]   Okay, now that flow is where our challenge lies.
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.120]   Here's the challenge.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:26.420]   It's not easy to go from intimacy to action because intimacy is good.
[00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.960]   Intimacy is comfortable.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.520]   Intimacy is awesome.
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.800]   It was great to stand up last year and say, "Hey, be more intimate with Jesus."
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.480]   You were all like, "Yes!"
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.480]   Now I'm standing up and saying, "Hey, take the gospel to your workplace."
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:43.160]   And you're like, "Hmm, that's a little bit different, right?"
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.280]   It's easier to remain in a place of intimacy because intimacy is awesome.
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.280]   It's comfortable.
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.280]   It's good.
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:52.880]   But then stepping out of intimacy into action, that requires a shift.
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.700]   That requires something new.
[00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:57.600]   That's not a straightforward transition.
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.400]   And so here's what we want to do at the start of 2025.
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:06.280]   If God is calling us to a year of action, then how do we go from intimacy to action
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.280]   well?
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.680]   And over the next four Sundays, we're going to actually explore that with you.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.000]   And we're going to look at Samuel and David.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.040]   The reason why we're looking at Samuel and David in the Old Testament is because they
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:19.840]   both went through times of intimacy into action in their lives.
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:24.180]   And so we're going to see how they do that transition to help us understand ours.
[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:30.760]   But also they go through what I would say are mindset changes in order to do the things
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.720]   that God has called them to do.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:38.720]   They had old mindsets that they needed to let go of in order to embrace a new mindset
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.160]   to be able to do what it is that God had for them to do.
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.000]   And I think it's the same also for us.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:49.760]   I think we need some mindset changes as we step into 2025 for the things that God has
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.600]   for the vine to do in its future.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:56.200]   And again, by that, has for you to do in your spirit of influence.
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.840]   And so we're going to talk about four things.
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.080]   Next week we're going to talk about having the right choices.
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.080]   We talk about choices.
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:04.840]   A week after that, we're going to talk about having the right kind of resources in our
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.160]   lives and how we're using those resources.
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.080]   We're going to talk about after that, the right community and the people that we have
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:13.400]   around us and are they the right people that we have around us.
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:17.500]   And then finally, or actually today, we're going to talk about having the right start.
[00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.280]   How do we actually begin?
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.840]   How do we get our starting point right?
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.140]   Because here's the thing.
[00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:29.120]   If you don't start from the right place, you're going to easily drift.
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:33.200]   How do we make sure we're all starting in exactly the place that we should start?
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.320]   The question is, how do we begin?
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:40.800]   Well, let me tell you something that I think is really important as we begin to think about
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.920]   a mindset shift.
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:50.400]   Psychologists, counselors, therapists, they will tell you that there are five emotional
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:55.280]   barriers that all of us have, or all of us struggle with at some point.
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:02.760]   Five emotional barriers that actually block us, inhibit us, stop us from moving forward
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.360]   in whatever it might be in our human life.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:09.640]   Whether that might be moving forward into a new job, moving forward into a new relationship,
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:12.480]   moving forward into a goal or a dream we have.
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:18.880]   There are five emotional barriers that will stop you, inhibit you, slow you down from
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:19.880]   your forward momentum.
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:20.880]   Does that make sense?
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.440]   You want to know what those five are?
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:27.800]   Hurt, disappointment, regret, shame, and failure.
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:33.600]   Say it again, hurt, disappointment, regret, shame, failure.
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:40.480]   Those five things are the emotional barriers that will inhibit you from moving forward
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:44.160]   with excitement into a new thing in your life.
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:49.160]   When hurt, disappointment, regret, shame, and failure are upon us, are a part of us,
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.920]   they become barriers to our growth.
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.720]   Does that make sense to you?
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:53.720]   Now here's the thing.
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:57.440]   They're not just barriers to our general human movement.
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.640]   They're also barriers spiritually as well.
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:04.800]   In fact, you can go to the Bible and you can see many examples of God's people struggling
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.840]   with hurt, disappointment, regret, shame, and failure.
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:12.680]   And that in the struggle, they find themselves held back from what it is that God wants to
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:13.680]   do with them.
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:20.780]   And they find it difficult to shift out of the old and into the new.
[00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:27.640]   And the burden that I felt sitting on me as I was preparing this message today is that
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:32.960]   I feel like for me, but I also feel like for many of us here, many of us watching online
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.420]   right now, here's the reality.
[00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:39.640]   Because hurt, disappointment, shame, regret, and failure has had such an impact on us at
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:44.840]   times, we actually think that we're kind of on plan B now for our lives.
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.720]   It's like, that was really hard.
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:51.660]   I went through a really traumatic time, or I had a really bad breakdown in a relationship,
[00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:56.060]   or I tried a job and I got fired and it was really, really hard for me.
[00:14:56.060 --> 00:15:01.620]   And we have these situations where we're sitting heavy with the weight of our brokenness from
[00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:03.700]   something that's happened in our past.
[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:08.060]   That hurt and that disappointment, that shame and that regret, that kind of tethers us,
[00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:09.240]   anchors us to that.
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:15.060]   And we begin to think, well, I guess I'll just live a plan B kind of life then.
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:20.140]   I guess the only life that's really available for me now is not the life that I hoped for,
[00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:23.020]   not the life that I believe that God had put in my heart.
[00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:24.420]   I guess that's kind of failed.
[00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:25.420]   That hasn't worked out.
[00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:27.740]   So I guess I'm going to live a half life.
[00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:32.100]   It's still a pretty decent one, but it's not quite the one that I was hoping it would be.
[00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:35.420]   And particularly when we're dealing out of hurt, disappointment, regret, shame, and failure
[00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:41.220]   because of sin, we then get the mentality of, I'm not worthy of the life that Christ
[00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:42.700]   wants me to have.
[00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:46.900]   I'm not worthy to be used by him in the way that he wants to use me.
[00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.940]   I hear Pastor Andrew on a Sunday and the other pastors speak.
[00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:54.100]   I read the Bible and I see what God does in other people, but that's everybody else's
[00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:55.100]   story.
[00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:58.660]   If they knew the sin that was in my life, they would know that that's not my story and
[00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:00.460]   that shouldn't be my story.
[00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:01.820]   Are you with me?
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:06.180]   And so because of that, we think we're on plan B or maybe some of us plan C, D, E, and
[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:08.060]   F.
[00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:13.700]   And you have no anticipation as you step into 2025 that actually maybe you're still
[00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:19.500]   on plan A. That actually the hurt, disappointment, shame, regret, and failure does not have to
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:23.140]   determine your future.
[00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:31.020]   See, when the hurt, disappointment, shame, and failure of our past speaks louder to us
[00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:37.180]   than the hope of our future, we are always in danger of missing out on the most significant
[00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:42.060]   moments of influence and impact we can have in this world.
[00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:48.740]   Always in danger of missing out on the most significant moments of impact and influence
[00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:50.180]   that we could have in the world around us.
[00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:56.380]   And I don't want a church, and I don't think you do either, that is so tethered to its
[00:16:56.380 --> 00:17:03.580]   brokenness of its past that it isn't impacting and influencing the world in the way that
[00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:07.860]   the cross of Calvary says it should.
[00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:10.940]   Jesus said, "I have built this church.
[00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:15.860]   I will build this church, and the gates of hell will not pervade against it."
[00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:18.420]   And as we step into this new year, I wonder whether we could step in actually believing
[00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:19.420]   that.
[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:20.420]   Amen?
[00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:23.020]   So if you struggle with hurt, disappointment, shame, regret, and failure, you're human,
[00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:24.340]   number one.
[00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:26.060]   Number two, you're just like me.
[00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:30.740]   And number three, the scripture has something important to say to you.
[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:33.940]   I want to frame that by sharing with you about the story of Samuel.
[00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:38.140]   I don't know if you know much about Samuel in the Old Testament.
[00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:39.140]   Samuel lived this incredible life.
[00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.980]   I'm going to pick up the story right at the end of Samuel's life though, because I want
[00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:44.940]   to show you the transition that takes place here.
[00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:50.380]   Right at the end of Samuel's life, he's so old that the leaders of Israel come to him
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:53.220]   and they say these very words, "You are very old."
[00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.380]   Can you imagine that?
[00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:59.300]   Imagine your boss coming up to you saying, "You are very old."
[00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:02.620]   So basically, he's at the end of his life.
[00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:04.140]   And here's the thing you need to know about Samuel.
[00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.180]   He's lived an amazing life.
[00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:07.860]   This guy has lived an incredible life.
[00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:11.220]   He's been a judge of Israel for the majority of his life.
[00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:14.980]   And as a judge, he was the leader of the nation at that time.
[00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:18.780]   Now you can see in the book of Judges, the book of 1 and 2 Kings and all this, you can
[00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:23.220]   see that actually the judges really struggled, many of them, with sin and brokenness, and
[00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:25.060]   they didn't lead God's people very well.
[00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:26.740]   Samuel, however, did.
[00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:31.260]   He's one of the few judges that was actually upright, who actually had moral integrity,
[00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:35.580]   who actually loved God, who actually served Him and obeyed His Word.
[00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:38.100]   And he did an incredible job with Israel.
[00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:41.420]   And at the end of his life, success becomes a problem for him.
[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.220]   Anybody else in this room, has that ever been in your case?
[00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.220]   Just me?
[00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:46.220]   No, it's okay.
[00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:47.820]   Success can become a problem, right?
[00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:51.120]   And so for him, he's done this amazing job, but he's done it so well that the leaders
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:55.980]   of Israel come to him and say, "You're very old," which means you're going to die soon,
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:01.020]   which means your sons will become judges, but your sons are not like you.
[00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:03.420]   Your sons don't have the same character you do.
[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:06.300]   Your sons are not the same upright integrity that you have.
[00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:08.580]   We don't want your sons to lead us.
[00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:11.540]   And because we don't want your sons to lead us, here's what we want you to do.
[00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.320]   We want you to anoint a king.
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.180]   We want to start a monarchy now.
[00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:18.380]   We want to be like the other nations that we see, who have kings and queens.
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:19.860]   We want that for ourselves too.
[00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:21.900]   We do not want your son, Samuel.
[00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:27.900]   Oh, you've been a great judge, but you've been a terrible father.
[00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:28.900]   Imagine how...
[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:29.900]   They didn't actually say that.
[00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:33.060]   I added that to scripture, but I think that's kind of what they were saying.
[00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:36.980]   Could you imagine how hurt Samuel would be?
[00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:40.180]   I mean, he's given his life to these people.
[00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.540]   He served them as best as he can.
[00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:47.240]   And right at the end of his life, the people have come and said, "We don't want your family
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.420]   anymore."
[00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:52.700]   The hurt, the disappointment.
[00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:57.260]   I think he was hurt because he wanted to defend his sons, I'm sure.
[00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:01.620]   But I think he was hurt more than that because he felt like he had been rejected by his people,
[00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:02.620]   him personally.
[00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:06.060]   In fact, we know that because he comes to God and it's recorded for us in scripture.
[00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:07.220]   He comes to God and he prays a prayer.
[00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:12.620]   He says this, he says, "Lord, I'm distraught because they have rejected me."
[00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:16.540]   And God, in only the way that God can, comes to him and says, "No, no, no, no, Samuel,
[00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:17.740]   they've not rejected you.
[00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:20.060]   They've rejected me as king over them."
[00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:25.380]   In other words, God always saw himself as their king, as the ultimate ruler.
[00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:29.500]   And when they came and asked for a king, God was like, "They're trying to assert my power
[00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:30.500]   and my authority.
[00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.020]   They haven't rejected you, Samuel.
[00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:34.980]   They've actually rejected me."
[00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:38.660]   And God, because he's compassionate and loving and faithful and committed, he says these
[00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:39.660]   words to Samuel.
[00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:43.780]   He said, "Look, if they want a monarchy, we can work through a monarchy."
[00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:47.620]   He's basically like, "My redemptive purposes are not going to be thwarted by some human
[00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:48.620]   idea.
[00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.700]   If it's a monarchy they want, a monarchy can happen.
[00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:55.300]   I can still bring my redemptive purposes to the world through that."
[00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:56.420]   And so he says this thing to Samuel.
[00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:59.020]   He says, "Samuel, I want you to pick up your horn.
[00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:01.180]   I want you to fill it with oil.
[00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:04.580]   And then I want you to pour it over the one I'm about to anoint as king."
[00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:09.620]   Now, for Samuel, he, as a prophet and judge, he would have a horn, not too dissimilar to
[00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:11.380]   something like this.
[00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:16.300]   And in the horn, what he would do is he would pour anointing oil, perfumed oil into it.
[00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:19.440]   And then he would choose an amazingly good-looking man like this man right here.
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:22.740]   And he would come up to him and he would say, "Okay, the Lord's going to use this man for
[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:23.740]   leadership."
[00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:26.220]   And he would pour that anointing oil over his head.
[00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:30.380]   And that was a prophetic symbol to say that this person has now been anointed to lead
[00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:32.360]   or to be a prophet or whatever it is.
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:36.260]   So when God says to Samuel, "Grab your horn, fill it with oil because I'm about to use
[00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:39.460]   it," it's saying to Samuel, "There's one more thing I want you to do.
[00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:40.860]   You're very old, but there's one more thing.
[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:41.860]   You can hold your horn.
[00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:43.860]   You can do what I'm asking you to do."
[00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:47.220]   And so he goes, "I want you to go and anoint this guy called Saul."
[00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:49.260]   And so he goes to Saul and he anoints Saul.
[00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:52.140]   Now, Saul says these beautiful words when he's anointed.
[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:56.300]   He says, "Who am I that I would be chosen out of all of Israel to be the one?
[00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:59.500]   Like my clan is the smallest, my tribe is the smallest.
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.940]   I can't believe I've been chosen."
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:02.960]   There's this beautiful humility in Saul.
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:06.840]   And everything in the story at this point seems to be going quite well.
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.260]   And then Saul begins to lead.
[00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:14.540]   Now, I don't know if you've ever tried to lead, but leadership is not easy.
[00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:19.980]   And he gets seduced by power, not the only or first leader in the world to have been
[00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:21.500]   seduced by power.
[00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.420]   He gets seduced so much by power.
[00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:27.940]   He gets a taste of it so much that within a short period of time begins to erect statues
[00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:32.620]   of himself around all of the cities of the land because he wanted his people to begin
[00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:35.580]   to look to him for authority rather than to look to God.
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:37.300]   "They've not rejected you, Samuel.
[00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:39.420]   They rejected me as king."
[00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:43.060]   And Saul begins to live a life where he actually begins to disobey the things that God is asking
[00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:44.060]   him to do.
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:48.220]   Erect statues for people to basically essentially worship him, to look to him.
[00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:53.980]   And this so grieves heart of God, so grieves God's heart that he comes to Samuel and he
[00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:59.260]   says, "Samuel, I'm so grieved that I have made Saul king over Israel.
[00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:03.500]   I'm lifting my anointing from him."
[00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:06.860]   This throws Samuel into another cycle.
[00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:11.580]   And this cycle is regret, shame, and failure.
[00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:17.660]   Because suddenly Samuel's feeling like this, "I'm at the end of my life and I've just anointed
[00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:21.700]   the last, the last act that I've done in my life is to anoint this one to be king.
[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:22.900]   I've then stood aside.
[00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:24.660]   My family has stood aside.
[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:26.340]   We've made space for this to happen.
[00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:28.660]   And this guy has been seduced by power.
[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:30.620]   And now God has lifted his anointing."
[00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:37.140]   Samuel's feeling like, "My last act of life has been a failure.
[00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:39.820]   The last thing I've done has failed.
[00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:41.100]   It hasn't worked out.
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:45.620]   What kind of prophet, what kind of judge, what kind of leader, what kind of legacy am
[00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:49.860]   I leaving behind when the last thing I did didn't work out well?"
[00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:56.940]   The shame, the shame of being the one that actually anointed the wrong person, if you
[00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:59.660]   will, the one who grieves the heart of the Lord.
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:00.860]   How did that all happen?
[00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:08.300]   And Samuel is so wallowing deeply in his brokenness, in the hurt, disappointment, shame, regret,
[00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:16.620]   and failure of what's just happened to him that he is completely at a loss.
[00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:19.500]   I wonder if you've ever felt that way.
[00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:23.140]   I wonder if you've ever had a moment in your life where maybe something you've done in
[00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:31.060]   your past has so filled you with regret, so filled you with hurt that you're filled with
[00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:33.820]   shame just thinking about it.
[00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:39.180]   And that whole thing, you've either tried to ignore it, tried to bury it, tried to avoid
[00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:44.940]   it, or it's so consumed you that it's been difficult for you to get out of bed the next
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:45.940]   day.
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:48.420]   I wonder if it's just me who's felt that way.
[00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:49.980]   I'm sure all of us, right?
[00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:55.180]   To some degree can connect to where Samuel is in this moment.
[00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:58.060]   Perhaps for you, it's a relationship.
[00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:02.100]   Perhaps you've got a failed relationship in your life, maybe a failed marriage.
[00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:06.140]   And the hurt of that, the disappointment in that, the shame of that's holding you back.
[00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:07.140]   Perhaps it's a work thing.
[00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:12.060]   Maybe you tried for a job and you didn't get the job, or maybe you had a job and you got
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:16.700]   fired or you lost your job or you were made redundant or something, and that's sitting
[00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:18.600]   heavy on you.
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:19.880]   Perhaps it's a financial decision.
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:22.500]   You made an investment in something and that investment didn't work out.
[00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:25.460]   You put it all in and it didn't come through.
[00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:28.740]   And that still stings and you're still embarrassed about that.
[00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:32.380]   And you feel like you hurt your loved ones because you made a choice that didn't work
[00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:33.380]   out, that it failed.
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:38.800]   I think we all can connect with Samuel in some way, can't we?
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:43.300]   God shows up to Samuel in this place of hurt, disappointment, regret, shame, and failure.
[00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:48.100]   And he speaks to him some words that if you're feeling anything like what Samuel was feeling
[00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:52.800]   in that moment, I think God's saying these words over you today, because these words
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:54.880]   change everything for Samuel.
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:59.540]   And as I unpack them for you now, I pray that they will change everything for you and that
[00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:03.380]   you will be able to start 2025 walking forward.
[00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:08.660]   Let me read this to you from 1 Samuel, starting in verse, chapter 15, starting in verse 34.
[00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:11.260]   And I'm just going to read a few verses.
[00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:16.620]   Then Samuel left for Ramah, but Saul went up to his home in Gebeah of Saul.
[00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:22.260]   For the day Samuel died, he did not go to see Saul again, though Samuel mourned for
[00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:23.260]   him.
[00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:27.180]   And the Lord was grieved that he had made Saul king over Israel.
[00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:31.880]   The Lord said to Samuel, "How long will you mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:33.780]   as king over Israel?
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:38.820]   Fill your horn with oil and be on your way, for I'm sending you now to Jesse of Bethlehem,
[00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:40.980]   for I have chosen one of his sons to be king."
[00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:44.180]   So I want you to picture this.
[00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:47.340]   Samuel was in a place of hurt, disappointment, reject, shame, and failure.
[00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:50.180]   He's right at the end of his life and he thinks his life is done.
[00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:51.340]   Everything's done.
[00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:56.220]   And he's mourning, grieving, hurting for all the things that have just happened at the
[00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:57.220]   end of his life.
[00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:58.620]   And God shows up and says these words.
[00:26:58.620 --> 00:26:59.620]   Let me read this again.
[00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:03.700]   "How long will you mourn for Saul?"
[00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:06.200]   I want you to see a couple of things here.
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:08.500]   Notice what God doesn't say.
[00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:11.580]   God does not say, "Why are you mourning for Saul?"
[00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:15.380]   He says, "How long will you mourn for Saul?"
[00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:18.060]   It's a subtle but very important difference.
[00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:21.260]   Could you imagine if you were Samuel and you're feeling the worst that you've ever felt in
[00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:22.340]   your life?
[00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:25.060]   You're feeling a failure, you're burnt out, you're feeling like what you've just done
[00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:26.140]   just didn't work out.
[00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:28.140]   And God shows up and says, "Why?
[00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:29.140]   Why are you feeling that way?"
[00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:31.500]   Can you imagine how that would feel?
[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.220]   I mean, that would be a bit weird, wouldn't it?
[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:34.460]   God was saying, "Why are you doing that?
[00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:35.460]   Why would you do that?
[00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:36.460]   You shouldn't do that.
[00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:37.460]   I've given up on that one.
[00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:38.460]   I gave up on him way ago.
[00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:39.460]   I've rejected him.
[00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:40.460]   Come on.
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:41.460]   Why are you feeling this way?"
[00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:44.540]   It's so beautiful to me that God doesn't show up to Samuel and say, "Why are you feeling
[00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:45.540]   this way?"
[00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:50.260]   Instead, he shows up to him and goes, "I understand why you're feeling this way.
[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:52.700]   Like I totally get it.
[00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:53.700]   You're in a place of mourning.
[00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:58.820]   I'm not asking you why you're in a place of mourning because I know you're human and you've
[00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:02.820]   just gone through something that was really hard and you feel the shame and you feel the
[00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:07.900]   embarrassment and you feel the brokenness and I get it, you're mourning."
[00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:11.620]   And I think it's beautiful because in God saying, "How long will you mourn?"
[00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:15.020]   Notice God is giving him space to mourn.
[00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:18.020]   He's giving him space to wrestle with that feeling.
[00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:21.620]   He's giving him a space to process what has happened to him.
[00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:24.460]   He's not expecting him to get immediately better.
[00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:28.580]   How long will you mourn saying, basically, "There's a place for mourning."
[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:29.580]   Hear this, church.
[00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:31.300]   "There's a place for mourning.
[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:35.460]   There's a place to wrestle with the brokenness, to wrestle with the things that we've done
[00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:36.460]   that we're not proud of.
[00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:41.740]   There's a place to bring our sin before the Lord and not to have to walk in the brokenness
[00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:42.740]   anymore.
[00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:45.660]   There's a place to receive the forgiveness and the healing and the restoration.
[00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:47.020]   There's a place for mourning."
[00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:51.860]   This is why we have the Psalms in the Scriptures because the Psalms are the beautiful poetic
[00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:54.980]   voice of Israel saying, "Hey, it's okay.
[00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:56.140]   We feel this way, God.
[00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:58.540]   We feel this way, but we're going to trust.
[00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:01.740]   We know that you're still for us even though it feels like you're a long, long way away
[00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:05.460]   from us, even though you've kind of forsaken us."
[00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:11.740]   The Psalms are this beautiful, honest reflection of God's people crying out and saying, "We're
[00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:12.740]   hurting.
[00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:13.980]   This is not easy.
[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:16.820]   This is a painful experience."
[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:19.060]   And God is saying, "There's space for that."
[00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:23.020]   Jesus himself in Matthew 5, 4, in the Sermon on the Mount, he says these beautiful words.
[00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:27.140]   He says, "Blessed are those who are mourned for they will be comforted."
[00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:29.700]   Blessed are those who mourn.
[00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:33.420]   Blessed are those that process the hurt and the feelings in them.
[00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:37.700]   For I, here's my promise to them, I promise I will comfort them.
[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:39.700]   I promise my spirit will be there for them.
[00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:43.460]   I promise they will not go through it alone.
[00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:45.380]   That's the wonderful heart of God.
[00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:47.300]   And so I want to say this to some of you in this room.
[00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:50.380]   Some of you here are in a season of mourning.
[00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:52.740]   And I want to say that's absolutely good.
[00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:53.740]   That's fine.
[00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:58.260]   In fact, your season of mourning is your greatest opportunity to receive the comfort of the
[00:29:58.260 --> 00:29:59.940]   presence of Jesus.
[00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:03.100]   And so if you're in a season of mourning in this room, our prayer for you is that we will
[00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:04.100]   be with you.
[00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:05.100]   We'll stand with you.
[00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:06.420]   We'll be the support to you.
[00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:09.780]   We will pray for you and we will hope that the comfort of Christ will be known in your
[00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:10.780]   life.
[00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:13.780]   We'll journey with you forever, however long it takes.
[00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:17.180]   If you're mourning here, we love you and we're here for you.
[00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:18.660]   Are you with me?
[00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:21.860]   I don't want you to hear anything else if that's your season right now.
[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:25.820]   The only thing I want you to take away from today is that God will comfort you.
[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.260]   Jesus will comfort you.
[00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:30.860]   And we as a church, we're here for you.
[00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:33.460]   But I want you to see this.
[00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:37.420]   By God coming to Samuel and saying, "How long are you going to mourn?"
[00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:41.120]   God understands something that Samuel needed to understand.
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:47.700]   And it's really important that at some point, mourning has to finish for new life to begin.
[00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:48.820]   Come on church.
[00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:54.100]   At some point, mourning has to stop for new life to begin.
[00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:55.540]   I don't know how you sleep at night.
[00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:56.540]   Let me explain.
[00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:57.540]   We're going to get intimate now.
[00:30:57.540 --> 00:30:59.220]   I'm going to explain to you how I sleep at night.
[00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:02.340]   When I sleep at night, I sleep with my arms under the pillow.
[00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:03.340]   Anyone ever do that?
[00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:05.780]   Like you put your arms under your pillow, whether two arms or one arm.
[00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:08.660]   I like to sleep with one arm under my pillow.
[00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:12.140]   Now the problem with that is about twice a night, I will wake up in the middle of the
[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:15.580]   night and I've been leaning my whole body weight on one arm.
[00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:17.380]   And that means that arm is now dead.
[00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:20.340]   Like all the blood has been pushed out of that arm.
[00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:21.900]   You ever had like a dead arm, right?
[00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:25.460]   And if you're leaning on it and your arm is dead, the funny thing is you can't kind of
[00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:27.180]   move because you can't push off.
[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:29.860]   So you have to get your other hand and sort of push off the mattress.
[00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:32.780]   And then your hand just sort of stays there and then you've got to grab it and it sort
[00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:35.140]   of flops like this because there's no blood in it.
[00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:38.060]   And then you move on to your other side and about two hours later you wake up and that
[00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:39.580]   arm's dead, right?
[00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:42.380]   This is like a repetitive thing in my life.
[00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:44.580]   When God comes to Samuel and says, "How long are you going to mourn?"
[00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:48.500]   He's basically saying we do this with ourselves spiritually.
[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:51.580]   We do this with ourselves emotionally.
[00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:57.340]   When we hold on to the mourning of something for too long, it's like that thing remains
[00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:58.340]   dead.
[00:31:58.340 --> 00:31:59.340]   You remain dead.
[00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:04.740]   And for new life to come, you have to let go at some point.
[00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:08.860]   You have to move forward at some point.
[00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:12.220]   And he comes to Samuel and says, "How long are you going to mourn?"
[00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:18.060]   Which is actually an invitation for Samuel to both mourn, yes, but also to realize that
[00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:22.380]   at some point that's going to have to stop and that God will be there for him.
[00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:25.740]   And when God is there for him, things will begin to change.
[00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:28.900]   Some of you in this room, you're struggling to find a new relationship in your life because
[00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:33.660]   you're still holding on to the old one that's long been dead.
[00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:37.180]   Some of you are struggling to find that job that's your career job that you'd love to
[00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:42.060]   do because you're hanging on to the old job out of fear of a lack of security for the
[00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:43.060]   future.
[00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:46.660]   And you're holding on to the job you hate and that's keeping you from the job you really
[00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:50.700]   want to receive or what it might be in any area of our lives.
[00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:53.300]   But we can all go through this.
[00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:55.060]   And I want you to see something that's happening here.
[00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:56.940]   When God says to Samuel, "How long are you going to mourn?"
[00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:59.300]   Here's essentially what's happening for Samuel.
[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:03.720]   Samuel is so consumed to the mourning of his past that he is ignorant.
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:06.420]   He's blind to the importance of his future.
[00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:09.340]   I want you to see this because this is what happens for all of us in these five emotional
[00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:10.340]   barriers.
[00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:16.300]   He's so consumed by the past that he's blind to the importance of his future.
[00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:18.900]   He thinks he has no future.
[00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:21.220]   He thinks his story is done.
[00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:24.180]   I anointed one and he failed.
[00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:25.320]   That's my postscript.
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:26.980]   I'm leaving this world with that.
[00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:28.820]   I am done.
[00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:33.700]   And God says, "You don't understand Samuel, but you are standing in this moment right
[00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:37.220]   in the most significant moment of human history."
[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:43.120]   Samuel has no idea the importance of what's ahead of him, but God knows.
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:47.520]   And because God sees what is just ahead of Samuel, he says, "How long are you going to
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:48.520]   mourn?"
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.420]   Samuel's thinking, "Hang on a sec.
[00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:52.420]   Everything's done for me."
[00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:56.880]   And God's saying, "You can't see what it is that I'm about to do for you."
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:57.880]   Think about this.
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:03.080]   Samuel, and we're going to see this next week, Samuel is about to go and anoint, he's about
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:06.440]   to pour oil over David.
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:13.340]   David, who would become the starting point of the Davidic dynasty that Jewish people
[00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:17.900]   and Christians believe, or Jewish people believe will come eventually for a Messiah, Christians
[00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:21.460]   believe came in Jesus.
[00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:25.340]   Samuel is about to pour oil over the very one who will start the bloodline that will
[00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:26.660]   bring Jesus Christ.
[00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:28.940]   Get your head around that.
[00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:32.420]   Samuel is about to start the process for Jesus.
[00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:34.420]   He has no idea.
[00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:39.820]   He has no idea that he's standing at the most critical moment of human history because he's
[00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:44.340]   so blinded by the hurt, disappointment, shame, regret, and failure.
[00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:45.340]   But God sees.
[00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:47.800]   I want you to see this church.
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.400]   God sees.
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.180]   God sees David.
[00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:53.080]   God sees the bloodline.
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:55.400]   God sees Jesus.
[00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:59.940]   And God sees Jesus' life and ministry and miracles and teaching.
[00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:03.140]   He sees his death on the cross and the horror of that.
[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:06.140]   And the importance of that for liberation for sin.
[00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:09.860]   He sees his resurrection and the filling of the Holy Spirit upon him.
[00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:13.220]   He sees him gathering disciples and giving them the great commission.
[00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:15.960]   He sees them receiving the Holy Spirit in the upper room.
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:19.300]   He sees them begin the church with their own sweat and blood.
[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:21.060]   Some of them martyred for their faith.
[00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:24.960]   He sees over 2000 years, the church grow in history.
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:30.780]   He even sees the first Sunday of 2025 and you sitting at the vine, hearing the message
[00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:31.780]   right now.
[00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:33.460]   He sees all of that.
[00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:39.380]   And because of the worth and the value of all of that, he comes to Samuel and he says,
[00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:41.620]   "How long?
[00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:43.780]   How long?
[00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:50.820]   How long are you going to mourn because Jesus is coming?"
[00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:54.340]   It's really important.
[00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:56.620]   I think that we all hear this.
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:36:02.420]   Some of us have Davids right up and ahead of us in our future, but we're in danger of
[00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:07.580]   failing to receive them because we're still holding onto our souls.
[00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:15.220]   Which soul as you start 2025, are you holding onto that is blinding you to the wonder of
[00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:18.060]   what the Lord wants to do in you?
[00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:25.260]   The David that's there, your dream job, a new relationship, maybe a goal that you've
[00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:27.620]   longed had for.
[00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:31.820]   Maybe that moment of life that you've been dreaming and praying for, that budding of
[00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:33.900]   the bamboo shoot that's going to come out of the ground.
[00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:35.700]   It's right there in front of you.
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:38.340]   He sees it.
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:44.260]   And he says, "How long are you going to mourn?"
[00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:46.420]   How do we then respond to this?
[00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:50.180]   Well, notice what he says to Samuel chapter 16, verse one.
[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:54.020]   He says, "The Lord said to Samuel, 'How long will you mourn for Saul since I've rejected
[00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:55.940]   him as king over Israel?
[00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:58.300]   Fill your horn with oil and be on your way.'"
[00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:00.460]   Isn't that a beautiful thing?
[00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:03.960]   See Samuel thought it was all over.
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:07.540]   My last act as a judge was to pour oil over Saul.
[00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:08.580]   What a mistake that was.
[00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:10.380]   I'm never doing that again.
[00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:12.860]   Oh, I don't want to take the risk of that again.
[00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:15.860]   Oh, if I step out and try that again, oh man, that's going to fail.
[00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:18.860]   I did that once and it sucked.
[00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:20.940]   It sucked so hard because God's heart was grieved.
[00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:21.940]   My heart was grieved.
[00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:24.420]   I hurt, shame, disappointment, failure.
[00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:27.540]   Why would I ever bother to do that again?
[00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:29.260]   You could imagine Samuel thinking.
[00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:37.140]   And God says, "Have the courage, Samuel, to pick up your horn, fill it with oil and be
[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:38.140]   on your way."
[00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:41.780]   In other words, here's what Samuel hears.
[00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:42.780]   I love this.
[00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:47.100]   Samuel hears God say to him, "I am not done with you yet."
[00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:48.100]   Come on, church.
[00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:49.980]   "I'm not done with you yet.
[00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:52.140]   Who told you I was finished with you?
[00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:53.700]   You told yourself that.
[00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:57.060]   You let the hurt, shame, disappointment, regret, frame, failure all tell you that.
[00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:58.700]   I never told you that.
[00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:00.060]   I never said your life was over.
[00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:01.860]   I never said you were too old.
[00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:03.700]   That was Israel who said that to you.
[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:05.540]   I never said that you were a failure.
[00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:07.080]   None of those words ever came from me.
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:08.160]   Here's what I'm saying to you.
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:10.660]   Pick up your horn because I'm not done with you yet.
[00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:14.620]   Because there's something you're about to do that will be a legacy for the whole of
[00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:17.020]   the human race.
[00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:19.200]   Grab your horn, he says.
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:21.020]   And here's what I want to say to some of you this morning.
[00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:23.660]   Pick up your horn.
[00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:25.500]   Pick up your horn.
[00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:26.700]   For Samuel, it was a literal horn.
[00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:27.700]   For you, it's not a literal horn.
[00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:30.300]   That would be weird.
[00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:34.820]   But the horn was a symbol for Samuel of what he had been called to do.
[00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:36.220]   What's that tool for you?
[00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:37.220]   What have you been called to do?
[00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:39.100]   For some of you, that's your work.
[00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:40.100]   That's your business.
[00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:42.220]   Grab a hold of it like never before.
[00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:44.060]   Some of you, that's the ability to pray.
[00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:46.140]   Pray like never before.
[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:48.820]   Some of you, that's a gift or a talent to communicate.
[00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:50.100]   Pray like you've never done before.
[00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:53.020]   For some of you, it might be whatever it is.
[00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:56.420]   Whatever God has put on your heart, whatever talent or gift, whatever tool he has given
[00:38:56.420 --> 00:39:00.900]   you to be able to share the gospel, and he's given it to every single person, grab your
[00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:03.260]   horn.
[00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:07.820]   Don't allow shame, regret, failure, disappointment, and hurt define your future.
[00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:11.420]   He is not done with you yet.
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:12.420]   Come on, church.
[00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:14.660]   He's not done with you yet.
[00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:16.540]   There's so much more ahead for you.
[00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:17.740]   So much more ahead for me.
[00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:18.740]   I'm turning 50.
[00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:21.660]   Oh, I feel like he's done with me.
[00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:23.820]   I'm turning 50 in a month.
[00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:27.340]   Oh, Lord Jesus.
[00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:29.980]   Yeah.
[00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:31.300]   The eldest came to me the other day.
[00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:35.180]   "Andrew, you are very old," they said.
[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:36.180]   Just kidding.
[00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:37.180]   The eldest didn't say that.
[00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:38.180]   He's not done with me yet.
[00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:39.180]   Honestly, I'm preaching to myself.
[00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:43.100]   I feel a bit emotional right now.
[00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:44.260]   I'm preaching to myself.
[00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:45.940]   He's not done with me yet.
[00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:46.940]   He's not done with you.
[00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:47.940]   How old you are in this room?
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:49.980]   50 is not old.
[00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:55.100]   There might be some older people here watching online.
[00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:56.100]   I see you, John.
[00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:59.740]   I love you.
[00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:01.180]   He's not done with you yet.
[00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:02.180]   Amen?
[00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:03.180]   Now, notice this.
[00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:04.980]   He says, sorry, I'm going to finish soon.
[00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:07.820]   He says here, he says, "Fill your horn with oil."
[00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:08.820]   I love this.
[00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:12.300]   He doesn't say, "Fill your horn with your own strength.
[00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:15.780]   Fill your horn with just your good news or your good works."
[00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:18.100]   He doesn't say, "Fill the horn with your talent."
[00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:20.740]   He said, "Fill it with my oil.
[00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:22.420]   Fill it with the oil of the Holy Spirit."
[00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:26.580]   It's only Jesus that brings our dead tools to life.
[00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:31.220]   It's only Jesus that takes those talents and uses them to do something in the kingdom.
[00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:34.140]   Remember, it's him who changes the world.
[00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:36.100]   We're just empty, broken vessels.
[00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:40.700]   But when the oil of the Holy Spirit comes on us, we are able to do like the disciples
[00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:45.020]   did in that upper room, things that they never thought they would ever be able to do.
[00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:49.220]   Think changes and transforms when you're filled with Jesus.
[00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:50.620]   Notice this.
[00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:55.460]   When sin happened in Genesis 3, all of humanity was brought into a place of brokenness and
[00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:57.140]   the whole of creation was.
[00:40:57.140 --> 00:41:02.900]   And the Bible describes it like this, that all of creation has been mourning.
[00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:07.540]   And Jesus is described to us through the Old Testament as the horn of our salvation.
[00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:15.340]   In other words, Jesus is the vessel that God decided to choose to pour out on humanity.
[00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:21.020]   The one who has decided to bring hope and freedom and life to broken, sinful humanity.
[00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:23.300]   Jesus is the horn of our salvation.
[00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:28.260]   And so if there's anyone that we come to, to receive the oil from, to receive the Spirit
[00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:29.980]   of God from, surely it's Christ.
[00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:30.980]   It has to be Christ.
[00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:31.980]   It's only Christ.
[00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:36.140]   He is the horn that God has provided that is poured out over you.
[00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:40.540]   So when he says, "Pick up your horn," he's like, "I've already picked up mine.
[00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:46.960]   My horn went to the cross for you, rose from the dead for you, forgives your sins for you.
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:47.960]   You are forgiven."
[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:51.580]   That doesn't mean you're going to have this perfect, sunny, shiny life all the time, but
[00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:54.380]   it means that even in mourning, you are comforted.
[00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:55.380]   Amen?
[00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:59.860]   Even in the hurt, disappointment, shame, regret, and failure, that is not the end of your story.
[00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:04.660]   I am there with you and I will walk you into the new thing that I have for you.
[00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:09.980]   2025 will be your most significant year yet.
[00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:13.500]   Because he would say over to you, "I am not done with you.
[00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:17.660]   Do not allow the soul to stop you from the David.
[00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:19.940]   How long will you mourn?"
[00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:26.340]   I wonder whether you close your eyes with me and I want to just pray and we're going
[00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:27.340]   to make some space.
[00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:28.340]   We've got plenty of time.
[00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:32.980]   So we've designed the service today specifically to give us more time.
[00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:37.360]   And as your eyes are closed, I want to just explain in a moment, we're going to invite
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:39.420]   you to come forward for communion.
[00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:43.780]   Now just keep your eyes closed, but let me explain.
[00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:45.900]   In a moment, we're going to invite you to come forward for communion.
[00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:50.900]   Normally here at the Vine, we pass communion out to you and you receive it that way.
[00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:52.460]   But today we want you to be active.
[00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:54.700]   We want you to take action.
[00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:58.820]   Want you to be in the prophetic side of this word.
[00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:01.140]   And so we want you to come forward.
[00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:04.140]   So there's going to be four stations in the front here.
[00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:07.180]   There's two on either sides in the lower house as well.
[00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:09.860]   Upstairs is two at the front and two at the back.
[00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:14.740]   And in a moment, you'll be invited in your own time when you're ready to come and receive
[00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:18.040]   communion from one of our leaders or elders here.
[00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:19.780]   And we will bless you as you receive the communion.
[00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:24.580]   Then you can take it back and you can take communion in your chair with your friends,
[00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:29.940]   family, whoever you're here with, or if you're on your own, you can take it on your own.
[00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:33.780]   But before you come forward for communion, we want to give you space to receive what
[00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:36.340]   the Holy Spirit has for you.
[00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:42.620]   In some ways today, the communion is the coming forward after we felt like the Lord has ministered
[00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:43.620]   to us.
[00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:46.220]   And so we're going to create some space for you now to receive the ministry of the Holy
[00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:47.220]   Spirit.
[00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:49.500]   It's the most important part of our service.
[00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:54.140]   And I want to encourage that in a couple of ways.
[00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:57.220]   Maybe something I've shared today.
[00:43:57.220 --> 00:44:01.740]   Maybe you recognize that hurt, disappointment, shame, regret, and failure has dominated your
[00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:04.540]   thinking too much.
[00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:09.800]   Maybe you recognize that you're holding onto a soul.
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:12.740]   Maybe you feel like you're not worthy of a David.
[00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:20.860]   And maybe you're entering 2025 locked and anchored and tethered into the past when the
[00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:28.820]   Lord says, "This is going to be your most significant year yet."
[00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:33.180]   But if you're anything like me, hurt, disappointment, regret, shame, failure, those are powerful
[00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:34.980]   things.
[00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:42.500]   And when the Lord said to Samuel, "Fill your home with oil," what he's basically saying
[00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:45.860]   to you is, "How long will you go before you invite my Holy Spirit into that part of your
[00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:49.860]   life?
[00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:56.420]   How long will you go until you invite my Spirit into the hurt, into the disappointment, into
[00:44:56.420 --> 00:45:00.860]   the regret and the shame and the failure?
[00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:06.700]   For I'm here and I will comfort those who mourn."
[00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:10.860]   Maybe for some of you, you've been carrying around those five things so much because you
[00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:14.340]   haven't had the courage to invite the Spirit in.
[00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:16.380]   Maybe it's been too painful to invite the Spirit in.
[00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:23.260]   I want to encourage you to be brave at the start of this year.
[00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:27.780]   And so in this ministry time before you come for communion, you can just take your time
[00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:32.620]   to invite Him into those areas.
[00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:36.100]   Ask Him to help you to let go of your soul.
[00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:41.740]   Ask Him to show you what He sees about your future, how much He loves you, how much He's
[00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:48.100]   prepared that's just ahead of you, how He doesn't want the hurt and the shame and the
[00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:52.740]   regret and failure to dominate your thinking and your vision.
[00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:55.820]   If you're here with family and friends and you want someone to pray for you, just invite
[00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:58.460]   them to pray for you in a moment.
[00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:00.060]   Just reach out and say, "Hey, would you pray for me?
[00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:01.860]   That's an important word for me today.
[00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:03.940]   I need to respond.
[00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:08.100]   Would you just help me and pray?"
[00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:13.100]   And so whilst we're all being ministered to and prayed for in your own time when you're
[00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:18.020]   ready, you can then come forward to receive communion as a way of culminating perhaps
[00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:20.500]   what it is that the Spirit of God is doing in you.
[00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:25.260]   We have about 15 minutes for this, so there's no need to rush.
[00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:28.760]   So Lord Jesus, I pray for each person here.
[00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:32.380]   If you'd like to receive this prayer, just open your hands as I pray.
[00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:37.060]   Holy Spirit, Father, we're grateful.
[00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:40.340]   We're grateful that we're standing on the precipice of 2025, the most significant year
[00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:42.260]   of our lives.
[00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:46.840]   We're thankful that you are a forward-moving God.
[00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:54.700]   But Father, we recognize that we carry hurt and disappointment, that regret and shame
[00:46:54.700 --> 00:47:01.420]   and failure are part of our story and sometimes are too much a part of our story.
[00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:05.820]   Father, would you come?
[00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:09.460]   Would you minister to me right now in this place?
[00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:14.060]   Would you enable my spirit to say to you, "You are not done with me?
[00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:16.340]   Thank you, Lord, that you're not done with me.
[00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:18.700]   Thank you that I have not disqualified myself.
[00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:24.100]   Thank you, Lord, that I'm still on plan A. I may not have all the answers.
[00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:28.140]   I may still struggle with the trauma of what it is I've been going through, but Lord, thank
[00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:37.900]   you that you forgive, redeem, renew, restore, that this will be my most significant year."
[00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:41.900]   So I'm just going to invite the elders and pastors to come and just be at the stations
[00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:42.900]   now.
[00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:45.980]   But I want to invite you to take your time.
[00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:48.420]   Pray with the person next to you if you want to pray.
[00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:51.860]   Just receive more of the Holy Spirit if that's what you want.
[00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:55.060]   Weep if you want to weep.
[00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:57.180]   This is a safe place.

[00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:09.180]   Amen.
[00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:19.060]   Amen.
