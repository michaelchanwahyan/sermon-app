1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Thank you, Pastor Chapman. And good morning, everybody. It is such an honor and I'm so

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,200
 blessed to be able to preach today, this morning. And first of all, I want to ask you a question.

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:23,480
 I don't know how many of you can understand about buying fresh fruit. All these housewife

4
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:31,200
 mothers, do you know? Yes? Wow, wonderful. I have to learn from you. I'm a person who

5
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:38,040
 doesn't really understand very well. And many times when I buy fruit, I just look at the

6
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:46,760
 outside appearance, if it is smooth or is shiny. And then especially when I buy avocados,

7
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:52,680
 because I like to eat that very much. And unfortunately, after I bring them home, and

8
00:00:52,680 --> 00:01:01,840
 most of the time, the inside of the avocado is black and rotten. One of the common mistakes

9
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:12,800
 when choosing fruit is to pick the outside, the appearance alone. Many people judge by

10
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:22,240
 a fruit quality, mainly in its color, size, and the outward appearance. However, the good

11
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:30,800
 looking fruit is not always the best. And being able to properly to select a high quality

12
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:37,360
 fruit require a certain level of knowledge and skill, like this lady. I've learned from

13
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:44,440
 you. And otherwise, it will lead us to poor selection. In the last two months, we have

14
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:51,480
 been looking at the book of Galatians. In this sermon series, we look at Paul's letter

15
00:01:51,480 --> 00:02:00,640
 as he is astonished that Galatian believers are turning away from the truth of the gospel.

16
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:10,120
 They actually cannot discern the good and the bad. They are being deceived and tricked

17
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:19,880
 by a counterfeit gospel. So Paul defends and unpacks the true gospel to the churches so

18
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:30,120
 that God's visions can be lived out by these new Christians.

19
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:38,240
 Today we come to the final section of the Galatian letter, chapter 6, verses 12 to 17.

20
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:46,300
 In this last section, towards the end of Paul's letter, he's given a final warning and benediction.

21
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:54,760
 Now let's look at what he tried to deliver in verses 12. "Those who want to impress people

22
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:02,800
 by means of the flesh are trying to compel you to be circumcised. The only reason they

23
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:11,560
 do this is to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ." Verses 13. "Not even those

24
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:18,720
 who are circumcised keep the law, yet they want you to be circumcised that they may boast

25
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:26,920
 about your circumcision in the flesh." In verse 12, there are some people who are claiming

26
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:33,640
 to be following Jesus, and they're trying to convince the Gentile Christians to have

27
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:44,160
 a cut in their flesh, that is circumcision. And they also, this false teacher, want these

28
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:52,020
 Gentiles to follow the law of Moses. And the reason behind that is that they do not want

29
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:58,520
 a life to be difficult, and they want to avoid being persecuted.

30
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:08,160
 You see, these false teachers, they were looking at these uncircumcised Gentiles as deficient

31
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:16,520
 and unworthy, unless they circumcised. They definitely have brought a division to the

32
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:26,920
 church instead of unity. And of course, discipleship of these false teachers is just a show, is

33
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:35,200
 a hypocritical faith. I don't know if sometimes we may do that too in the church. We may see

34
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:44,400
 other believers who look or act differently than us. We have a tendency to judge, to judge

35
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:54,320
 them based on the external factors, when in reality, Jesus is enough, and there's no favoritism

36
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,440
 with God. You see, this new movement of Christians,

37
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:09,200
 claiming that Jesus is the long-awaited Christ, the Messiah, is troubling these Jewish leaders.

38
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:16,600
 And now the movement is spreading to the Gentiles. Non-Christian Jews want to stop it, to snuff

39
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:28,560
 it out. They begin persecuting Christians, and in order to avoid this persecution, these

40
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:37,720
 prideful false teachers, they are putting a show to appease non-Christian Jews by boasting

41
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:45,040
 to them that, "Hey, look, these Gentile converts to Christ, they are coming under the Jewish

42
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:57,000
 law." And the motive is winning more converts to their cause to make themselves look good,

43
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:05,920
 feel important, and look righteousness. And unfortunately, they themselves cannot keep

44
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:15,200
 the law of Moses, which consists of a lot of rituals, restrictions, and prohibitions.

45
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:22,920
 And just kind of like the Pharisees, Jesus said, "They preach, but they do not practice."

46
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:29,920
 But also, these false teachers, they cannot keep the law of Christ, which is full of grace

47
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:38,200
 and the love of God. Paul here is trying to say, "Let's no boast in the flesh or in the

48
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:47,280
 outward appearance." When we stand before God, nothing apart from Jesus matters. Jesus

49
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:58,040
 is the one who turns our boasting upside down. Our rank, our status, our money, our achievements

50
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:09,240
 don't do anything for us. So Paul does boast, and he boasts in the cross. In verses 14,

51
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:17,200
 he said, "May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which

52
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:26,440
 the world has been crucified to me, and not I to the world." Paul has repeatedly emphasized

53
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:35,240
 the work of Christ upon the cross, and the grace of God is sufficient. Circumstances,

54
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:42,520
 crucial diets, feasts, rituals, et cetera, et cetera, they don't have the power to transform

55
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:53,200
 lives. And the ground of acceptance is Jesus, and depend on anything else is deadly. Honestly,

56
00:07:53,200 --> 00:08:00,840
 the cross is a real challenge for those who want to maintain their pride. It's a problem

57
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:08,800
 for those who have a desire for others to praise them and to see them successful. I

58
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:16,840
 know in that in some churches, many believers often know the amount of time and offerings

59
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:24,040
 of other believers, and the donation information will always be printed out weekly to show

60
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:32,100
 everybody. And as a result, some believers may show extra respect and care for those

61
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:41,320
 who donate more, and while others who donate less are often neglected. A pastor friend

62
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:49,480
 told me before in his church, he must reach a certain number of people in his group in

63
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:57,200
 order to receive a year-end bonus, and depending on how well he reaches the target, the bonus

64
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:07,160
 he received very likely is higher than his monthly pay. I can go on and on and tell you

65
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:16,520
 all kinds of stories, but there's no great mystery about the motives behind all this

66
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:23,320
 is to look good and show off. They actually do not understand the meaning of the true

67
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:34,200
 gospel. Actually, the cross is pretty embarrassing. It wasn't the religious symbol as it is today.

68
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:41,720
 Remember, the cross was the method of execution for serious crimes committed and for those

69
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:49,640
 against the Roman Empire. But how is Paul boasting in something so shameful like the

70
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:59,840
 cross of Jesus? As for Paul, and for all of us, the cross is not something to be ashamed

71
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:08,280
 of, for as he wrote to the church at Rome, it is the power of God for salvation. Our

72
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:18,080
 boasting, our identity, our trust should ultimately come from one place and one place only, and

73
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:26,000
 that is the cross of our Jesus. Here Paul says that the world is dead to him, and that

74
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:34,440
 he is dead to the world. What does it mean for the world to be crucified to him? If the

75
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:44,480
 world is dead to you, then it does not have the power over you. The world is care, desires,

76
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:52,280
 and values have no sway in your life. The world is dead to you. The world does not influence

77
00:10:52,280 --> 00:11:01,080
 you. It does not move you. And Paul is saying that all those things are dead to him, and

78
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:11,160
 the world is crucified to him, and that this is what he's proud of. You see, the cross

79
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:20,120
 is the very heart of our faith. For our endless sinful rebellion in our flesh, we are the

80
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:30,440
 ones who deserve to spill our own blood. But God loves us so much, took on the human flesh

81
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:39,960
 and blood to die for us. God's will is that the cross be always be magnified, and that

82
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:49,560
 Jesus Christ, his crucifixion, is always be our praise and our boast. And Jesus get the

83
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:58,960
 glory and the honor for every good thing in our lives, and every bad thing that God causes

84
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:07,800
 to turn for good. Amen. So now if Gentiles don't need to put an effort to do the circumcision,

85
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:19,960
 wow, they should be able to win God's favor, right? No. Let's read verses 15. "Neither

86
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:27,280
 circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything. What counts is the new creation." Now that's

87
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:34,480
 the contrast between circumcision and new creation. It doesn't matter if they're circumcised

88
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:43,280
 or not. And it doesn't matter if take that step or not. For they cannot win God's love

89
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:54,720
 and acceptance. So church, what counts? What is the most important then? What matters is

90
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:01,360
 that as Christians, we have been transformed on the inside and the circumcision of the

91
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:11,080
 heart. And that is by God's divine power that launches us to be a new creation. Just as

92
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:20,920
 Christ was crucified and raised. So Paul's old self, your old self, and my old self was

93
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:29,800
 crucified with Christ by faith. And we too have been raised to a new life. We now live

94
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:39,040
 a new heart. We are new creatures indwelled by the Holy Spirit. And even as we continue

95
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:49,840
 to battle and make headway against our remaining sin, the cross is the source of transformation

96
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:59,440
 that Paul calls a new creation. But what is a new creation anyway? As Christians, we are

97
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:08,520
 born again. The world is no longer our treasure or source of satisfaction. This new birth

98
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:15,720
 is not physical, but spiritual. Being born again to Jesus, the power of the world has

99
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:24,280
 been broken over us. We have been translated from darkness into the light. Jesus becomes

100
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:33,200
 our Lord. His grace is the undeserved favor of God that gives us the new life. And it

101
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:46,120
 also provides us a new desire and power to live in a way that we can please God. Our

102
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:57,160
 Lord, he concerns with our motives, our attitudes, our desires, behind our actions, not just

103
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:07,200
 our outward behavior. This new, lifelong, ongoing spiritual transformation journey

104
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:17,200
 requires cooperation on our part with what the Holy Spirit means to do in us. It shifts

105
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:25,760
 us from gratifying desires of the flesh to being led by the Spirit and bearing the fruit

106
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:35,920
 of the Spirit. And this is our calling, church. This is our purpose, to live a genuine, Spirit-empowered,

107
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:44,640
 obedience life in Jesus. We represent him everywhere and every time. And that we need

108
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:52,200
 to show gentleness, grace, mercy, and love to others. And in this journey, it is not

109
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:59,600
 a one-time experience. This is a lifelong journey, leads to a greater intimacy with

110
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:11,920
 God and Christ-likeness. And there's a blessing of peace and mercy, as Galatians 6, 16 said,

111
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:21,360
 all who follow this rule. What rule? This rule of being justified by faith in Christ

112
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:31,680
 and not works of law. And all who own God's work and power in making them new creatures.

113
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:39,720
 We are God's true people. And Paul calls them the Israel of God. And this is the church,

114
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:49,080
 the true Israel. And the reality of being new creation in Jesus is personal and individual,

115
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:58,360
 as well as corporate. Not only did Jesus very personally love you and die for you and give

116
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:08,320
 himself for you and at the cross, but he love us. He love you and he love me. And this is

117
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:17,880
 his church. And he make us a people together as family in him. And the new creation is

118
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:27,040
 a wondrous thing, formed in the mind of God and created in his power and for his glory.

119
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:36,360
 This is in line of our church, divine's vision for growing big people. Growing big people

120
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:42,840
 means to become more like Jesus. Growing big people is not something just for only the

121
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:55,600
 high status or mature Christians. It's God's heart for every single us. Every single us.

122
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:03,880
 No matter you are mature or you're new to the Christ. This is for all of us. And this

123
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:10,280
 is what we discover and see in the letter of Galatians. That is God's heart to mature

124
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:19,640
 us and be a blessings to many others and to build them up and to speak life to them.

125
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:27,160
 And finally, we come to the end of Galatians. And one of the last things Paul writes to

126
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:37,960
 is in his own hand, he said, "I bear on my body the marks of Jesus." In verses 17. These

127
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:48,400
 marks in Greek means stigmata. It means the signs of ownership, especially were branded

128
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:56,240
 on slaves and cattle. Paul referred to the scars on his body, which were caused by the

129
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:06,560
 persecution for Jesus. And because they demonstrate that he was a slave of Jesus and not people

130
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:19,160
 pleaser. Like Jesus, Paul also had the scars. The scars which point not to his own work,

131
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:28,440
 but to Jesus' work. The marks of Jesus that he carries in his own body. As in 2 Corinthians

132
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:38,200
 chapter 11, verses 23 to 27, Paul has mentioned some of what he suffered for the sake of Christ

133
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:49,280
 in prison, in shipwreck, in danger of many, many situations and kindness, near death beatings

134
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:58,840
 and also being stoned by many others. He put a final period in place with his own life,

135
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:08,120
 with what he has been willing to suffer in order to live for Jesus and preach the gospel.

136
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:19,640
 And amazingly, he lived what he preached at a great cost. I personally have a story to

137
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:28,840
 tell you about the cost. About 23 years ago, I was called by God and came back to Hong

138
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:38,960
 Kong from America as missionary. That was 2001. Our family of four, my husband and I

139
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:47,520
 and my two children at that time is six and two years old. We respond to God's call. We

140
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:54,920
 sold everything. The only thing we have is four suitcases and flew back to Hong Kong

141
00:20:54,920 --> 00:21:06,120
 to commit ourselves to serve the law. As the funds we brought back to Hong Kong were reducing,

142
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:12,840
 my husband gave up the ministry and found a job teaching at a kindergarten. I continue

143
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:20,580
 to take care of the family and volunteer regularly at the local Christian drug rehab center and

144
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:27,360
 also minister in different house churches in the mainland China.

145
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:36,280
 Unfortunately, in 2003, my husband was dissatisfied with the life in Hong Kong and have an affair

146
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:44,600
 with a lady. He refused to turn around. He took advantage when I spent two nights at

147
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:53,160
 the Macau Women's Drug Rehab Center and without saying a word, he stole everything from me.

148
00:21:53,160 --> 00:22:00,800
 My passport, my credit cards and all my money. And he took our two children who were only

149
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:08,520
 eight and four years old at that time. He left, they left Hong Kong and flew back to

150
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:20,380
 the United States. When I returned home from Macau, I saw the empty house and I was devastated.

151
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:30,700
 My whole world was collapsed and I shattered into pieces.

152
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:41,220
 Feeling extremely sad, lost and confused, I continue to sought the law with fasting

153
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:49,800
 and prayers. And finally, I decide to stay in Hong Kong to continue fulfilling the calling

154
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:58,860
 of God. With much God's grace and strength, he sustains me. Though my ex-husband lied

155
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:06,140
 and twist the fact when he returned to America, I agreed to his request for a divorce and

156
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:14,860
 gave up the custody of our children. God spoke and gave me the promise that my two children

157
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:22,420
 would return to Hong Kong in the future. And he asked me to stick to his call without fear

158
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:30,340
 or doubt. And afterwards, I enrolled and studied in a theological seminary. And I also

159
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:38,340
 continued the ministry in China and opened my residence to help people in need.

160
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:48,740
 Yes, God has promised. But when? I'm sure many of you will have the same experience

161
00:23:48,740 --> 00:24:00,380
 that waiting for God is not an easy task. I missed my children so much I cried every

162
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:09,380
 day until all tears dried. God has promised, but it didn't mean it would happen right

163
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:22,700
 away. Then suddenly, one day, God's promise and mercy came true in the summer of 2006.

164
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:30,140
 My ex-husband gave up the children. And at that time, the children aged seven and eleven,

165
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:38,980
 who had been separated from their mother for three years, returned to my arms. It felt

166
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:46,340
 like I had been waiting for a lifetime. And now they are grown-up adults staying in Australia.

167
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:59,020
 Church, yes, there's a price to pay when you follow Jesus. The cross and the cost.

168
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:09,060
 In these 23 years of ministry, I can tell you, battles are never-ending. However, the

169
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:15,740
 Christ in me always helped me to embrace the process and overcome. I have fought the good

170
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:25,900
 fight, yet the race is not finished. And there's always glory in suffering. We will find spiritual

171
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:34,060
 growth, hope, and deeper experience of God's presence, even in the midst of difficulties

172
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:43,500
 and pains in our life. These false teachers, under pressure, they make marks on other people's

173
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:53,780
 flesh and boast in a headcount of circumcision. Marks have been made in Paul's flesh as he

174
00:25:53,780 --> 00:26:03,060
 has defended the truth of the gospel. Embraced by faith alone, we are a new creation, and

175
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:13,260
 it is enough to keep us right with God. Our precious brothers and sisters, what really

176
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:26,340
 counts in your life? We're going to have personal prayer at your

177
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:42,820
 seats. I invite you to pray and talk to Jesus, and he is here to listen. What are you looking

178
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:55,060
 for in this world? The temporary happiness that quickly vanishes as soon as it is experienced,

179
00:26:55,060 --> 00:27:09,340
 leaving us empty and looking for more to keep us alive. What is the world given to you?

180
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:24,740
 Is it the confusion, the anxiety, the suffering, grief, or even hatred that keep us hooked?

181
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:33,800
 It is the cross that free us from all the worries of this world, and it is supposed

182
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:45,380
 to be a new life where this world no longer has its hooks in us.

183
00:27:45,380 --> 00:28:03,700
 Church, does your life look like Jesus? Are you willing to live a life which is guided

184
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:16,740
 and obeyed the Holy Spirit to bear fruit? God is here to transform you and help you

185
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:34,940
 through the process. He sustains your life, and you can trust him. He is the one true

186
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:39,020
 God. This is a very precious moment you have for

187
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:51,580
 Jesus, and he is waiting here to listen to you and talk to you. And when you finish your

188
00:28:51,580 --> 00:29:00,260
 prayer, and when you are ready, please come to the front and receive your bread and cup

189
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:05,580
 and to have communion with our precious God Almighty.
