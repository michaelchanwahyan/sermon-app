1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 God is so faithful.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,900
 I was adopted, and when I met my birth mum,

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,640
 she said to me that when she gave me up,

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,080
 she didn't even know if God existed,

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,440
 but she prayed over me that I would go to a Christian family.

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:25,540
 I'm standing here today as a testament to God's faithfulness.

7
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,440
 And some of you are here today and you don't know God yet,

8
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:35,000
 but he wrote the pages of your life before you were born,

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,840
 and he knew that you'd be here today.

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,120
 His goodness is chasing you.

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,240
 You need to know that today.

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,840
 His goodness is chasing you home.

13
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,560
 Bonfires, I don't know about you,

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,560
 but I feel like this series has come at the perfect time.

15
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,920
 If you're noticing what is going on around you,

16
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,120
 if you're noticing what is happening

17
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,720
 to the people that surround your life,

18
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,620
 and if you're noticing what is happening within you,

19
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:09,400
 then you will have realized that we are all on journeys

20
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,920
 that at differing times and in differing ways

21
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,540
 have become too much.

22
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,720
 In my early 20s, I can remember a friend saying,

23
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,860
 "Susanna, you are someone who never gets stressed."

24
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,040
 She said, "You're always laughing

25
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,040
 "and you never let anything get to you."

26
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,080
 Another 30 years down the track,

27
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:38,120
 I recently caught myself saying to my youngest daughter

28
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,960
 when we were needing to fill out some paperwork,

29
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,880
 "I'm feeling overwhelmed.

30
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,600
 "I feel so stressed."

31
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,960
 And if you're in any doubt that our mental health

32
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,280
 is connected to our physical health,

33
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,840
 I then found myself in a clinic talking to a dermatologist

34
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,680
 and I said, "Why have I got eczema on my hands?

35
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,600
 "I've never had skin problems in my entire life."

36
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,840
 And his first question was,

37
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,400
 "Have you been experiencing more stress lately?"

38
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,480
 By the way, this was in the middle of COVID.

39
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,760
 I was thinking, you're asking that question?

40
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,480
 I think we've all been experiencing lots of stress.

41
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,480
 In preparing for this sermon, I felt God say to me,

42
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,240
 "I chose you for this.

43
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,040
 "What you've been experiencing in these last few years

44
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,320
 "mirrors what many have been experiencing in Hong Kong.

45
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,680
 "The disorientation, the sense of loss,

46
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,260
 "the increase in stress and the reaction to it,

47
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,680
 "the numbness, the lethargy,

48
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,880
 "the loneliness, the retreating back."

49
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,720
 So here I am speaking to you today as one on the journey,

50
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,240
 as one who is still processing her emotions

51
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,480
 and still learning to be still

52
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,240
 and listen for his gentle whispers.

53
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:01,600
 Today we end this series by finishing the story of Elijah,

54
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,720
 ending it with his calling of Elisha.

55
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,640
 We've already learned that Elijah has experienced

56
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,880
 a journey that has been too much for him,

57
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,880
 a journey that led him to a place of physical exhaustion,

58
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,200
 a place of emotional despair,

59
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,160
 a place where he literally called on God to let him die.

60
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,760
 God has met him in this place.

61
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,160
 He's touched him and created space for him

62
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,660
 to process his emotions.

63
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,980
 And as we heard last week,

64
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,920
 God meets him tenderly in the midst

65
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,840
 of this complete breakdown.

66
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,080
 God shows him mercy and speaks gently to him

67
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,020
 in ways that he can receive it.

68
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:53,400
 And then God tells him that it's time to annoy Elisha

69
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,720
 to succeed him as a prophet.

70
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,280
 So let's take a look at this last part of Elijah's journey.

71
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,840
 1 Kings 19 verses 19 to 21.

72
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,760
 So Elijah went from there and found Elisha, son of Shaphat.

73
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,960
 He was plowing with 12 yoke of oxen

74
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,280
 and he himself was driving the 12th pair.

75
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,520
 Elijah went up to him and threw his cloak around him.

76
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,600
 Elisha then left his oxen and ran after Elijah.

77
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,120
 "Let me kiss my father and mother goodbye," he said.

78
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,760
 "And then I will come with you."

79
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,960
 "Go back," Elijah replied.

80
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,960
 "What have I done to you?"

81
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,920
 So Elisha left him and went back.

82
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,640
 He took his yoke of oxen and slaughtered them.

83
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,320
 He burned the plowing equipment to cook the meat

84
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,840
 and gave it to the people and they ate.

85
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,680
 Then he set out to follow Elijah

86
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,320
 and become his servant.

87
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,040
 Now you might be asking,

88
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,400
 how does this end of Elijah's journey,

89
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,040
 the calling of Elisha forth as his successor,

90
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,120
 how is this connected to our mental health journey?

91
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,560
 I think there are a number of things

92
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,460
 that we can learn from this passage.

93
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:09,240
 When God says, Elijah, so earlier in the story,

94
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,680
 when God says, Elijah, what are you doing here?

95
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,080
 Part of his answer is, I am the only one left

96
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,460
 and now they are trying to kill me too.

97
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:23,960
 He's saying, I'm on my own, I'm all alone.

98
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,320
 An article that's titled,

99
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,120
 The Relationship Between Loneliness,

100
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,360
 Psychiatric Disorders and Physical Health says this,

101
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,080
 human beings are social and require safe

102
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,560
 and secure social surroundings to survive.

103
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,760
 Loneliness can lead to various disorders

104
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,200
 like depression, alcohol abuse, child abuse,

105
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,360
 sleep problems, personality disorders

106
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,480
 and even Alzheimer's disease.

107
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,640
 It also leads to various physical disorders.

108
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:00,240
 Left untended, loneliness can have serious consequences

109
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,280
 for the mental and physical health of people.

110
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:09,080
 Like Elijah, a deep sense of loneliness and isolation

111
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,440
 often contributes to

112
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,440
 and accompanies mental health issues.

113
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,520
 God understands this.

114
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,040
 And in helping Elijah to move forward and stay healthy,

115
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,880
 he gives him a partner, Elisha.

116
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,160
 He leads him back to connection.

117
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,400
 He leads him back to community.

118
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,120
 Let's pause for a minute.

119
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,400
 I think there is something here

120
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,100
 that's really important for us to grasp.

121
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,800
 Elijah told God not once, but twice,

122
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,000
 that he was the only one left.

123
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,240
 Was this true?

124
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,360
 No.

125
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,800
 God gently reminds him that there were 7,000 others

126
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,880
 who had not bowed their knee to Baal.

127
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,320
 See, when you are severely stressed

128
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,000
 or you've been traumatised,

129
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,480
 you can feel completely alone and isolated.

130
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,200
 Elijah completely believed

131
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,800
 that he was all alone in his journey.

132
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,000
 But his emotions and feelings

133
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,840
 were not feeding him the truth.

134
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,040
 After Andrew's sermon, Emotional Exhaustion,

135
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,520
 he prayed and he said,

136
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,560
 some of you feel alone all the time.

137
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,000
 But he said, that is not fact.

138
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,840
 He then encouraged us to see a life

139
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,360
 with a fresh perspective.

140
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,760
 I opened up my hands and I heard God say to me,

141
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,760
 you are not alone, not family-wise and not friends-wise.

142
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,760
 God spoke the truth into my heart.

143
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,640
 He changed my perspective.

144
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,280
 Our mental health journey

145
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,400
 is not meant to be travelled alone.

146
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,560
 Connection and community is meant to be a part

147
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,640
 of our healing and our ongoing health.

148
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,560
 But it doesn't just happen.

149
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,360
 It takes intentionality.

150
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,800
 A regular rhythm needs to be created in our lives.

151
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,040
 At least once a week,

152
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,040
 deliberately connect with a friend or a family member.

153
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,720
 Work it into your life,

154
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,160
 set aside time and journey with someone.

155
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:30,000
 I've set an alarm on my calendar

156
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,800
 on my phone so that it pops up once a week

157
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,080
 and says, Susanna, connect with someone.

158
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,600
 Now, you might not need this,

159
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,160
 but it certainly has helped me,

160
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,840
 to remind me that I'm not to journey alone

161
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,920
 and neither are you.

162
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:51,840
 And then there's connection to professionals.

163
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,720
 In our first week of this series,

164
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,280
 Andrew gave some pretty raw statistics

165
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,960
 about mental health in Hong Kong,

166
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,040
 one in seven people.

167
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,720
 But I think what was more frightening

168
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,400
 was the fact that out of the people surveyed,

169
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,760
 the majority said they would not seek

170
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,160
 any professional help.

171
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:19,920
 When I worked as a member care director for an NGO,

172
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,880
 we worked to provide counselling for our members

173
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,200
 before they thought they needed it.

174
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,680
 We encouraged them to debrief with trained people

175
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,840
 who knew the questions to ask them.

176
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:36,160
 We encouraged them to do this while they were healthy,

177
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,760
 to develop a rhythm of regular connection

178
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,000
 so that they could remain healthy.

179
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,600
 Counselling is often seen as the very last resort,

180
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,120
 but it doesn't have to be.

181
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,480
 Counselling can become a part of our lives

182
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,280
 that helps us regularly debrief,

183
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,960
 giving us opportunities to process our emotions

184
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,600
 and the journey that we are on.

185
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,680
 You can reach out to any of the counselling agencies

186
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,480
 in Hong Kong, but we also have one ourselves

187
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,720
 right here as part of our church.

188
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,520
 It's called Oasis, and it's filled

189
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,280
 with professionally trained counsellors.

190
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,480
 So I would encourage you,

191
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,480
 if you've never gone to a counselling session,

192
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,880
 take a risk, you won't regret it.

193
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,240
 Sign up and debrief with someone who's trained

194
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,360
 to kind of unravel you with the right questions

195
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,840
 so that you can see what's going on in your journey.

196
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,160
 Let's read the second thing that happens in this passage

197
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,760
 after Elijah calls Elisha to walk with him,

198
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,800
 to partner with him in his journey.

199
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,080
 Verse 21 says, "Elisha took his yoke of oxen

200
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,840
 "and he slaughtered them.

201
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,400
 "He burned the ploughing equipment to cook the meat

202
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,720
 "and gave it to the people and they ate.

203
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,440
 "Then he set out to follow Elijah and became his servant."

204
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,280
 Elisha gathers up all his tools for farming,

205
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,680
 all the things he's used to make his livelihood,

206
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,880
 and he burns them.

207
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,160
 He creates a great big bonfire.

208
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,360
 It's Elisha's way of demonstrating that he's all in.

209
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,240
 He's showing that he's not leaving any avenue

210
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,760
 for him to return to his previous life.

211
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,160
 He's 100% committed to pursuing the new.

212
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,600
 How does this connect to mental health, you might be asking?

213
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,600
 Well, when you are struggling with a mental health issue,

214
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,560
 our minds have this way of dragging us back

215
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,640
 and causing us to relive the trauma

216
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,000
 or relive the painful emotions we are struggling with.

217
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,200
 When we are anxious or fearful, we can feel stuck there.

218
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,960
 It's like ruts in our minds.

219
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:00,480
 Well-worn paths, we rewalk the same painful memories

220
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,680
 and we re-feel the same weighty feelings

221
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,960
 over and over and over again.

222
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,000
 Elisha creates a bonfire

223
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 because he doesn't want a way back to his old life.

224
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,680
 And in the same way,

225
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,640
 if we wanna create healthy rhythms in our life,

226
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,040
 we need to find a way to escape the well-worn ruts

227
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,320
 in our minds that keep returning us to the past.

228
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,880
 Everybody is different,

229
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,720
 but I would like to share today how God did this for me.

230
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,560
 On October the 21st, 2005,

231
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:42,160
 a dear friend, a mentor, was taken suddenly from my life.

232
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,280
 He called me his little sister.

233
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,800
 And one day he was walking with me around my backyard,

234
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,400
 chatting with me about the future and encouraging me.

235
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,120
 And the next day he was killed in a car crash.

236
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:02,720
 Some months later, another trauma impacted my life.

237
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,360
 I'm not gonna go into the details

238
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,520
 because it's not just my story to tell.

239
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:11,280
 These two traumas brought me to moments

240
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,840
 like sitting fully clothed under the shower.

241
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,160
 Weeping in distress, in agony of heart,

242
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,360
 feeling like my heart was being ripped out of my chest,

243
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,720
 longing for the water to just wash everything away,

244
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,320
 the memories, the pain.

245
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:33,560
 I started my healing journey by receiving some counselling

246
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,840
 from somebody I knew and I trusted.

247
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:41,760
 But I still remember flying into China soon after.

248
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,760
 My job at the time, ironically,

249
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,160
 was to look after the mental health of the staff

250
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,120
 of the NGO I was working for.

251
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,800
 While I was there, I was lying on my bed at night

252
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,200
 and my mind was sending me back to the days of the traumas,

253
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,840
 causing me to see and feel afresh all the pain and agony

254
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,920
 like it was happening all over again.

255
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,280
 I was crying out to God to help me

256
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,120
 and I picked up a book I'd brought with me

257
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,640
 and it began to speak to me.

258
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,760
 The author was sharing about traumas and brokenness

259
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,960
 and how we often go back in our minds and relive them.

260
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:24,960
 The author spoke of creating an off-ramp in our minds.

261
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:30,400
 When our minds try to steer us down those well-worn ruts,

262
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:35,240
 back to pain, back to our despair, back to our anxiety,

263
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,960
 we say, "No, I'm not going back there."

264
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,520
 And we force our minds to think

265
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,440
 of the good things in our life.

266
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,880
 For me, it was things like the beautiful sunset we saw

267
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,400
 while sitting on the beach at Darwin,

268
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,640
 the cuddles and warmth of my doggies,

269
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,840
 the scuba diving trip to the Philippines

270
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,120
 that my husband and I did for our 20th anniversary,

271
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,320
 that friend that I have, I won't mention her name,

272
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,040
 who snorts when she laughs.

273
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,760
 You mentally force your mind

274
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,520
 from the well-worn ruts onto the off-ramp.

275
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,560
 Now, when I first tried this,

276
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,680
 I wasn't always completely successful,

277
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,640
 but the more I practiced it,

278
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,880
 I found it easier and easier to say,

279
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,160
 "No, I'm not going back there."

280
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,120
 And finally, today, I can hold both the memories

281
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,800
 of those two traumas in my mind.

282
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,280
 I can think on them and put them away.

283
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,680
 They no longer tear me apart as they once did.

284
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,640
 Maintaining our mental health and healing

285
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,840
 as we continue our journeys

286
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,440
 requires us cutting off the avenues

287
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,440
 that lead us back to relive our pain, despair,

288
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,120
 anxious thoughts, and our loneliness.

289
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:03,840
 To move forward, we'll need to create some bonfires.

290
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,560
 Let me share my experiences with bonfires.

291
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,240
 In Australia, we love a good bonfire.

292
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,720
 In fact, on my last trip back,

293
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,000
 I was able to go to a friend's farm.

294
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,760
 We built a huge bonfire in one of their fields,

295
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,160
 and we sat around it.

296
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,480
 The mist sort of came in and covered all around us,

297
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,480
 and there we were around the fire,

298
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,280
 chatting and sharing life.

299
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,360
 Yes, bonfires are great for burning things,

300
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,920
 but every time I've gathered around a bonfire,

301
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,600
 I've enjoyed warmth, community,

302
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,680
 space under a huge sky,

303
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,680
 slowing down to rediscover the simple things.

304
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,280
 So today I'm gonna use the idea of a bonfire as imagery

305
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,720
 to help us remember the rhythms we need to create

306
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,440
 to strengthen our mental health.

307
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,440
 So the first thing you do

308
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,200
 is you actively build the bonfire.

309
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,760
 You collect the wood and you stack it in a heap.

310
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,200
 God did not neglect Elijah's physical wellbeing,

311
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,280
 and neither should we neglect ours.

312
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,840
 In the first week of this series,

313
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,240
 Andrew showed how our mind, our heart, and our body

314
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,760
 are all interconnected.

315
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,840
 If we want to be well in our mental health,

316
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,560
 we cannot neglect our physical health.

317
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:32,000
 We need a rhythm of regular exercise,

318
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,360
 and we need to pay attention

319
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,800
 to what we are putting into our bodies.

320
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,000
 If you're like me,

321
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,880
 get some people to hold you accountable.

322
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,040
 At the moment, I have people around the world

323
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:49,240
 holding me accountable to 30 minutes of exercise a day.

324
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,880
 I started, I got very techie,

325
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,320
 and I started a hashtag called #EncourageAndExercise,

326
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,800
 and there's people around the world who join me every day

327
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,440
 to remind each other that we can do it together.

328
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,640
 And that's probably the next point I want to make.

329
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,880
 Don't try and do it by yourself.

330
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,160
 Do this with a team.

331
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,880
 Get someone, grab a friend,

332
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,000
 join a group of hikers or tennis players,

333
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,400
 or whatever it is that you really love to do.

334
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,080
 Create a rhythm.

335
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,360
 An article called "Exercise for Mental Health" states,

336
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,480
 "Exercise improves mental health

337
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:34,040
 by reducing anxiety, depression, and negative mood.

338
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,880
 It also improves your self-esteem

339
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,960
 and your cognitive function."

340
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,200
 So after you've actively built the bonfire,

341
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,840
 you gather around it with people you love

342
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,240
 and want to connect to.

343
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,400
 The bonfire is a place of community.

344
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,160
 To stay healthy,

345
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,200
 we need to create regular rhythms of connection,

346
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,040
 ensuring that feelings of isolation

347
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,920
 and loneliness are burnt up on the bonfire.

348
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,000
 Elijah needed to be directed

349
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,520
 and encouraged to connect again.

350
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,760
 God said, and I'm paraphrasing here,

351
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,840
 "Go back, meet with and anoint Haziel.

352
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,000
 Connect with Jehu, son of Nimshi,

353
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,920
 and anoint him king over Israel,

354
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:25,440
 and then call Elijah or Elisha to walk with you

355
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,240
 and succeed you as prophet."

356
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,920
 Like Elijah, some of us here today

357
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:35,920
 need to be reminded to rediscover and create connections.

358
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,120
 In regards to our mental health,

359
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,680
 community is not an add-on that we choose if we want to.

360
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:47,400
 Community is a God-designed necessity.

361
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:54,200
 Number three, around the bonfire you stop.

362
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,400
 You're still and you gaze at the fire,

363
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,520
 you listen to the crackle of the flames.

364
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:05,240
 Last week, Andrew said that in Hong Kong,

365
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,000
 it's always the wind, it's always the earthquake,

366
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,400
 it's always the fire.

367
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:14,200
 Is it any wonder that we feel windblown,

368
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,080
 that we feel shaken, that some of us feel burnt?

369
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:24,200
 We need stillness in our lives.

370
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,280
 For the sake of our mental health,

371
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,640
 we need to hear the still, small voice of God.

372
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,960
 There was a reason God sent Elijah on a 40-day

373
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,680
 and a 40-night hike to Mount Horeb.

374
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,440
 On that trek, it was just him and God.

375
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,480
 At night, I'm sure he sat around a fire

376
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,520
 and looked at the stars and was still.

377
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:52,200
 God created the Sabbath for a reason, it was rest.

378
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,880
 God rested and we're created in His image.

379
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,400
 We need rest.

380
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,120
 Sabbath is a rhythm God created to ensure

381
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,840
 we stay healthy and we stay balanced.

382
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,240
 Many of us here today are out of balance.

383
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,160
 Many of us need to reestablish a Sabbath in our lives

384
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:19,240
 where we stop, where we listen for God's gentle whispers

385
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,120
 and respond to His touch and His leading.

386
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:29,920
 Lastly, you use the time around the bonfire

387
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,320
 to burn things that shouldn't be carried anymore.

388
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:39,760
 You release burdens, baggage, anxious thoughts,

389
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:45,280
 all the weight of the week or maybe the weight of years

390
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,320
 into the flames of God's love.

391
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,400
 Knowing that when you walk away into a new week,

392
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:56,400
 you walk in newness, you walk with a renewed mind and heart.

393
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,840
 When Elisha burnt all his farming tools,

394
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,480
 he decluttered his life, he made space for the new.

395
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:10,400
 We need to create a rhythm of decluttering in our lives.

396
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,760
 There are things we are carrying

397
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,120
 that we need to place into the fire.

398
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,880
 This releasing happens through prayer.

399
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,320
 In regards to mental health, prayer is your biggest weapon.

400
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:29,400
 The Bible puts it like this, be anxious for nothing,

401
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,840
 but in everything by prayer and supplication

402
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:37,000
 and thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.

403
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,400
 And the peace of God which surpasses all understanding

404
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,400
 will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.

405
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 We release our past and our future anxieties

406
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,040
 by making them known to God.

407
00:22:55,040 --> 00:23:00,720
 He already knows them, but in us choosing to share them

408
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,520
 with him, to offer them to him,

409
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,240
 we are relinquishing our control and inviting God

410
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,680
 to join us in our journey.

411
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,560
 And when we use this incredible gift of prayer,

412
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,400
 God sends his peace.

413
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,440
 Not just any peace,

414
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,720
 but one that goes past all of our understanding.

415
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,960
 It doesn't make sense to us in the circumstances

416
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,520
 we're in that we could be feeling so peaceful.

417
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,320
 That's what it means, a peace that passes all understanding,

418
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:36,320
 one that guards and protects your mind and your heart.

419
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,560
 I'm gonna invite the worship team to come.

420
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,200
 Would you stand with me?

421
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,800
 Stand with me.

422
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:51,640
 We're gonna have a practical time now

423
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,280
 of prayer and thanksgiving.

424
00:23:53,280 --> 00:24:00,720
 Just close your eyes with me.

425
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:06,880
 What needs to be burnt up in your life?

426
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:14,440
 What needs to be decluttered from you?

427
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,040
 (gentle music)

428
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:22,520
 Do you need to create some space

429
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,720
 for the new things God has for you?

430
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:35,160
 Andrew had this picture while we were praying earlier

431
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:40,680
 of someone with darts in their back,

432
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,080
 thrown by the enemy.

433
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,400
 And he saw Jesus just come and place himself

434
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,760
 between the enemy and the person

435
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,200
 with the darts in their back, protecting them.

436
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,880
 And there was this sense of great vulnerability

437
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,560
 in this person that they didn't have

438
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,120
 the strength to defend themselves.

439
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:09,920
 And so I wanna start by speaking to those

440
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:14,920
 who feel vulnerable, who feel like they have darts

441
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:18,640
 in their back and they cannot defend themselves.

442
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:27,760
 God would remind you that he stands in the gap for you.

443
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:33,480
 And Pastor John took the picture further

444
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:37,120
 by saying that it's not meant to just be Jesus

445
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,960
 who stands in the gap.

446
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,120
 It's meant to be this body, this community

447
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,880
 that we're meant to stretch out our arms as well

448
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,320
 and stand in the gap.

449
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:54,040
 And during worship, I had this strong sense

450
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,640
 to speak to parents,

451
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:00,040
 parents who are standing in the gap for their kids.

452
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:04,200
 And some of you are feeling so overwhelmed.

453
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,760
 You love your kids so much.

454
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,080
 But there's such a fear in you of where their life is going

455
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,880
 and where their life is taking them.

456
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,680
 And you wonder whether it's worth standing in the gap

457
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,040
 for them anymore.

458
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,400
 And God would encourage you today, don't stop.

459
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,400
 Keep standing in the gap.

460
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,520
 It matters.

461
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,560
 It's making a difference.

462
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,400
 Don't give up.

463
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,000
 (gentle music)

464
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,200
 If you're feeling vulnerable without the strength

465
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,640
 even to pray for yourself,

466
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,640
 would you put your hands out in front of you as a sign

467
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,120
 to the people around you and to God

468
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:59,280
 that you need God and us to stand in the gap for you?

469
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,320
 Would you do that for me?

470
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,240
 Would you just reach out your hands in front of you

471
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:08,240
 so that we can see, so that we can come and stand alongside?

472
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,040
 Maybe just look around you.

473
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,960
 If you see somebody with their hands open,

474
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,400
 maybe just stand with them.

475
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,240
 Don't have to say anything, just stand with them.

476
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:26,440
 Father, I lift up those who've come today.

477
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:31,080
 Bow down heavy with burdens.

478
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,640
 (gentle music)

479
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,080
 With very little strength

480
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:40,400
 and no capacity to even raise their voice for help.

481
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:46,360
 Father, you see, you understand,

482
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,280
 and you brought them here for this moment.

483
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,760
 So Father, we surround them.

484
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:57,120
 We choose as a community to stand in the gap for them.

485
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,400
 To say that we will protect you.

486
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,000
 We will stand between you and the dart thrower.

487
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,440
 We will pray protection over you

488
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,160
 and walk with you until you're strong enough

489
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,480
 to pray for yourself and to walk your journey again.

490
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:22,120
 And for the rest of us,

491
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,800
 we're just gonna take some time.

492
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:30,560
 The worship team is gonna just sing over us.

493
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,760
 We're just gonna take some time to be still.

494
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,360
 We're gonna create some space

495
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,720
 and you're gonna picture yourself walking up

496
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,720
 to that bonfire and throwing in the things

497
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,440
 that you know you shouldn't be carrying anymore.

498
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:54,560
 Putting in all the anxious thoughts, the future fears,

499
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,640
 putting them into God's hands, throwing them into the flames.

500
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:04,160
 Let's just take some time

501
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,120
 and let's do that together right now.

502
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,700
 (gentle music)
