[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   [music]
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.600]   Imagine with me for a moment a church.
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.560]   This is not a church in the singular, on its own and distinct,
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.440]   but a church in the plural, united across a nation, joined in purpose,
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:37.400]   focused on building up God's kingdom one life at a time.
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.760]   It is a church that has at the heart of its DNA
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.360]   the grand narrative of the redemptive story of Jesus Christ,
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.840]   and that celebrates in the freedom and grace that such a story brings.
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.680]   This church is not constricted by the walls of a building,
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.480]   but actively engaged in the community it is planted in,
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:05.480]   desiring for God's kingdom to take root and bear fruit in local soil.
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.080]   A church that sees salvation as holistic,
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.880]   transforming God's people for God's work,
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.920]   and equipping a generation to represent God's heart
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.680]   to the poor, the weak, the oppressed, and the persecuted.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.600]   Imagine this church committed to seeing the family
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.880]   as integral to all that it's called to be and do,
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.760]   involving intentional, committed, and authentic relationships
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.000]   across all levels.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.680]   It is the sort of place where both the young and the old
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.480]   feel cared for, supported, and equipped.
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.760]   A church where people of all backgrounds and traditions
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.560]   come to feel at home, a cultural mosaic that honors and embraces
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.040]   the richness and diversity that marks us as the body of Christ.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.920]   It is a church that is willing to innovate and express faith creatively,
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.800]   reflecting the boundless limits of God's creativity as glory to Him.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.800]   A place where people gather, hungry for the presence of God,
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.520]   and passionate to see this invade all aspects of their lives,
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.360]   where they seek to develop an intelligent, spiritual faith,
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.240]   rooted in God's word and driven with prayer.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.880]   A church that does not make its Sunday services the exclamation
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.360]   mark of its existence, but instead the comma in its ongoing sentence,
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.040]   a time of service, love, and engagement that inspires and emboldens
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.320]   all equally for the conversation that lies ahead.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:49.480]   A church that cares, disciples, rebuilds, renews.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.760]   This is our city.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.000]   This is our church.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.480]   This is our home.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.440]   And good morning, everyone.
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.240]   You guys OK?
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.160]   I know it's pouring outside, so I'm so glad you could all made it here safe.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.440]   Can we put our hands together just to welcome those around you?
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.520]   I know how hard it is to come in here today.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.880]   I know.
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:21.360]   I was just tapping on Tim's shoulder, and I'm like, oh, it's all wet.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.320]   So I understand the effort you have to put in in order to make it here today.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.080]   I really, really appreciate that, and we're so happy to see you all.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.880]   And we'll be praying for those who are still on their way.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.240]   We can see today, like, the weather, the rain is definitely
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.240]   one of the things that are trying to stop us from coming here.
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.200]   But anyway, we're here.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.920]   You know, we've been talking about healing in our church
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.520]   in the last couple of weeks.
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.320]   And I just want to see if anybody, like, you've
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.560]   been prayed for in the last couple of weeks,
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.240]   and you felt, wow, like, God really touched me.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.120]   He really, like, spoke to me.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.600]   Or even He really healed me.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.760]   Is there anyone, like, you feel that?
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.000]   OK, one or two.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.120]   Yeah, great.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.800]   And has any one of you said, hey, I want more of that.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.680]   Like, I really want to experience that kind of healing.
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.040]   Can I invite you to stand?
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.400]   This is really between, like--
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.680]   first of all, this is really between, like, you and God.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.560]   But last week, Pastor Ivan in the Cantonese service,
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.960]   he mentioned something.
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.040]   He said that healing is not just about the individual.
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.920]   When one of us experience that healing,
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.120]   God actually wants the whole community,
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.920]   the whole spiritual family to experience that together.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.760]   And this is why we're here.
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.680]   Maybe you are the one who needs that healing.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.960]   Maybe it's the person right next to you.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.600]   But as their neighbors, as a spiritual family, a community,
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.360]   this is something that God calls us into together.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.320]   So we're here to welcome the presence of God.
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.040]   Maybe you're only-- maybe you said,
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.880]   I'm really doing OK, Chapman.
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.320]   I'm happy for you.
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.360]   But your posture, your attitude to welcome the Spirit of God
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.840]   into this room, that helps the person next to you
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.600]   to experience God as well.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.480]   Can we do that for ourselves or for the neighbors?
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.920]   Is that all right?
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.600]   Shall we pray together?
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.920]   Let's close our eyes.
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.480]   And why don't you, in your own words, in your own language,
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.960]   why don't you welcome God's Spirit?
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.320]   You welcome His presence into this room.
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.880]   Why don't you do it, church?
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.440]   Let's just spend 30 seconds.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.680]   Let's just lift up our voice and say, God,
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.560]   we welcome you in this place in your own way.
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.480]   Let's do that, church.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:06:03.280]   God, we want to make room for you.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.800]   We want to encounter you in this place.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.600]   We're not here to rush through a program.
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.960]   We're not here to go through the motions.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:17.200]   We're here just to make sure we're making time for you,
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.200]   we're making room for you.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.080]   And so come, Holy Spirit.
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:31.560]   I pray you would usher in that healing, that joy, that love
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.440]   that we already have, that we already
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.280]   seen on the cross of Jesus.
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.240]   We just pray that you would make that our reality today
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.840]   in our worship, in our service, in our hearing of your word
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.520]   here today, Lord.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.440]   We pray that every heart be open in this room to you today,
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.480]   Lord.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.800]   Let us lift up a shout to you.
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.760]   We rejoice with heaven that we have a Savior that
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.160]   cares about us, that loves us, that is right here,
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.160]   right now with us.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.120]   We love you, Jesus.
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.760]   We thank you for being here by your Holy Spirit.
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:12.680]   Let's sing, church.
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.560]   Let's worship him.
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:26.560]   Sing with Jesus.
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:40.360]   My Jesus, my Savior, Lord, there is none like you.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:51.760]   All of my days I want to praise the wonders of your mighty love.
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.760]   My comfort.
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.760]   My comfort.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.240]   My shelter.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:06.240]   Tower of refuge and strength.
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:17.760]   Let every breath, all that I am, never cease to worship you.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:26.720]   Shout to the Lord on the earth, let us sing.
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:33.720]   Power and majesty praise to the King.
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:38.720]   Mountains bow down and the seas will roll
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:45.720]   at the sound of your name.
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:51.720]   I sing for joy at the work of your hands.
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:58.720]   Forever I love you, forever I'll stand.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:04.720]   Nothing compares to the promise I have in you.
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:21.720]   My Jesus, my Savior, Lord, there is none like you.
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:32.720]   All of my days I want to praise the wonders of your mighty love.
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:39.720]   My comfort.
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.720]   My shelter.
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:46.720]   Tower of refuge and strength.
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:57.720]   Let every breath, all that I am, never cease to worship you.
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.720]   Let's sing it out.
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:06.720]   Shout to the Lord on the earth, let us sing.
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:12.720]   Power and majesty praise to the King.
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:17.720]   Mountains bow down and the seas will roll
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:24.720]   at the sound of your name.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:30.720]   I sing for joy at the work of your hands.
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:36.720]   Forever I love you, forever I'll stand.
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:42.720]   Nothing compares to the promise I have in you.
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:48.720]   Shout to the Lord on the earth, let us sing.
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:54.720]   Power and majesty praise to the King.
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:59.720]   Mountains bow down and the seas will roll
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:05.720]   at the sound of your name.
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:11.720]   I sing for joy at the work of your hands.
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:17.720]   Forever I love you, forever I'll stand.
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:23.720]   Nothing compares to the promise I have in you.
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:28.720]   Nothing compares to the promise I have in you.
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:38.720]   Nothing compares to the promise I have in you.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:48.720]   [music]
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:58.720]   [music]
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:08.720]   [music]
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.720]   [music]
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.720]   You give life.
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:18.720]   You are love.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:23.720]   You bring light to the darkness.
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.720]   You give hope.
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:36.720]   You restore every heart that is broken.
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:41.720]   Great are you, Lord.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.720]   Sing again.
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.720]   You give life.
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.720]   You give life.
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.720]   You are love.
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:55.720]   You bring light to the darkness.
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.720]   You give hope.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:08.720]   You restore every heart that is broken.
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:14.720]   Great are you, Lord.
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:15.720]   It's your breath.
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:20.720]   It's your breath in our lungs.
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.720]   So we pour out our praise.
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.720]   We pour out our praise.
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:30.720]   It's your breath in our lungs.
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.720]   So we pour out our praise.
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.720]   Pour out our praise.
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:39.720]   It's your breath in our lungs.
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.720]   So we pour out our praise.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.720]   Pour out our praise.
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:49.720]   It's your breath in our lungs.
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:57.720]   So we pour out our praise to you only.
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:06.720]   Great are you, Lord.
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:16.720]   Great are you, Lord.
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:21.720]   Great are you, Lord.
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.720]   You give life.
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.720]   You give life.
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.720]   You are love.
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:32.720]   You bring light to the darkness.
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.720]   You give hope.
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:45.720]   You restore every heart that is broken.
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:50.720]   Great are you, Lord.
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.720]   It's your breath.
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:56.720]   It's your breath in our lungs.
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.720]   So we pour out our praise.
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.720]   Pour out our praise.
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:05.720]   It's your breath in our lungs.
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.720]   So we pour out our praise.
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.720]   Pour out our praise.

[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:31.720]   So we pour out our praise to you only.
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:40.720]   Great are you, Lord.
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:16:06.720]   Great are you, Lord.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:11.720]   All the earth will shout your praise.
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.720]   Our hearts will cry.
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:25.720]   These bones will say, great are you, Lord.
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:29.720]   All the earth will shout your praise.
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:32.720]   Our hearts will cry.
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:41.720]   These bones will say, great are you, Lord.
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.720]   All the earth.

[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:46.720]   Singing great are you, Lord.
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:55.720]   Singing great are you, Lord.
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:18:04.720]   Singing great are you, Lord.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:12.720]   Singing great are you, Lord.
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:13.720]   It's your breath.
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:17.720]   It's your breath in our lungs.
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:20.720]   So we pour out our praise.
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.720]   We pour out our praise.

[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:35.720]   So we pour out our praise to you only.
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:39.720]   >> Let's just remain in this spirit of worship.
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:43.720]   Remain in this place.
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:48.720]   As we were worshiping, I just had this sense that God's telling us, hey, no rush.
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.720]   It's okay.
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.720]   I know it's raining heavily outside.
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:56.720]   I know it feels like a bad day today.
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:01.720]   I know things don't work according to what you have planned.
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.720]   That's okay.
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:06.720]   No rush.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:12.720]   We don't have to rush through the songs or, you know, go through the program.
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:16.720]   Come enjoy his presence.
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:23.720]   >> Church, I just want to invite you as we were singing just now, it's your breath in our lungs.
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:29.720]   Right now I just want to invite us to take a deep breath together.
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:35.720]   And you sense that it's God's breath in our lungs.
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:40.720]   You sense his presence even inside your own body.
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:46.720]   It's his presence, it's his breath, it's his Holy Spirit.
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:51.720]   In Genesis it says God breathed his holy breath.
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:20:01.720]   God breathed his holy breath into a powder of mud and that became a person, a living being.
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:10.720]   It's his breath inside of us that gives us life, that made us really, really alive.
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:13.720]   And maybe some of us we need that today.
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:19.720]   Maybe you are going through this thing called life but you don't really feel alive inside.
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:29.720]   Maybe you're going through like you have your job, you have your duties, you are just trying to drag yourself through the week and you don't really feel alive.
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:36.720]   But today God says I want to breathe inside of you so you will be truly alive here in this place.
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:48.720]   If that's you church, let's just take a deep breath right now and allow the Holy Spirit to come fill you up once again.
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:57.720]   When we were singing just now I heard God is saying, you know what Chapman, I want to encounter you guys more than you guys want to encounter me here today.
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:03.720]   I want to encounter you guys. I want to breathe my breath into every one of you here today.
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:08.720]   I want every one of you to be truly alive today.
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:14.720]   It's no rush. My sons, my daughters, you don't have to rush.
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:23.720]   I'm here. I want to spend this time with you.
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:28.720]   God is your breath in our lungs.
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:39.720]   Worship it's not work. Worship it's not the thing we do, the songs we sing because it's a Sunday morning.
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:46.720]   Worship it's just us realizing God is you.
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:57.720]   It's your breath in my lungs. I'm going to use that breath to bring worship to you, to sing to you, to bring praise to you today here.
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:09.720]   Let's do that church. Let's worship Him.
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.720]   You give life.
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:16.720]   You are love.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:20.720]   You bring light to the darkness.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.720]   You give hope.
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:32.720]   You restore every heart that is broken.
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:38.720]   Great are you Lord.
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:43.720]   It's your breath in our lungs.
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:46.720]   So we pour out our praise.
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.720]   Pour out our praise.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:52.720]   It's your breath in our lungs.
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:55.720]   So we pour out our praise.
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.720]   Pour out our praise.
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:01.720]   It's your breath in our lungs.
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.720]   So we pour out our praise.
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.720]   Pour out our praise.
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:10.720]   It's your breath in our lungs.
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:18.720]   So we pour out our praise to you only.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:27.720]   Great are you Lord.
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:34.720]   Great are you Lord.
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:44.720]   Great are you Lord.
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:54.720]   Great are you Lord.

[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:34.720]   Great are you Lord.
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:44.720]   Great are you Lord.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:54.720]   Great are you Lord.
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:26:04.720]   Great are you Lord.
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:14.720]   Great are you Lord.

[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:24.720]   Great are you Lord.

[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:44.720]   Great are you Lord.
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:54.720]   He that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you.
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:36:00.720]   It's this word that quicken that's really kind of catching in my spirit.
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:07.720]   We need God's spirit that lives in Tim, in this man, in this man of God.
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:15.720]   We need that spirit to quicken, to speed up his work of healing in his mortal body at this time.
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:37.720]   Lord it has been long enough, months now, where this affliction has really caught him and laid him low and has really hampered his ability to really perform and to give his most and his utmost and his best to this church.
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:46.720]   Father I wanted to stand alongside this church and pray for our pastor Tim, for his complete and total healing.
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:52.720]   That the spirit that lives in him will quicken his mortal body in Jesus name.
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:55.720]   Thank you Father. Amen.
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:56.720]   Thank you.
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:57.720]   Bless you man.
[00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:00.720]   Appreciate it.
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:01.720]   Love you Tim.
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:05.720]   Thank you Nigel.
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:07.720]   That's the end of our worship.
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:08.720]   Thank you.
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.720]   We put our hands together to thank our worship team.
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:16.720]   Thank you for putting in the hard work to come and practice and come in early in the morning.
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:19.720]   Please grab a seat everyone.
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:21.720]   So good to see you all.
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:23.720]   Storm is really bad outside right?
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:28.720]   That means we're at the beginning of the spring or the summer season.
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:30.720]   I guess we're going to get more of that.
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:33.720]   So everybody just you know get ready for more storms.
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:35.720]   And that's why we need Jesus right?
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:39.720]   We need Jesus so he's with us when we're in the storms.
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:44.720]   And I also really want to extend a warm welcome to all of us.
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:51.720]   Welcome back once again for all of you who call the Vine like your home, your spiritual family.
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:58.720]   But I would also love to extend a warm welcome to those if you're visiting for the very first time or just want to come and check us out.
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:02.720]   I wonder if there's anyone you're new here in this community.
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:04.720]   We just want to say hello.
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:05.720]   Okay hello.
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:06.720]   I saw someone pointing at the other.
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:07.720]   Hi.
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:09.720]   Can we put our hands together to our friends?
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:10.720]   Hi.
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:12.720]   Good to see you.
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:14.720]   My name is Chapman by the way.
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:16.720]   I am one of the pastors here.
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:18.720]   I'm so happy to see you all.
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:20.720]   And you see this light behind me.
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:22.720]   It's been up there for a while.
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:23.720]   And there's a QR code.
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:29.720]   So we actually as a church we do have a WhatsApp channel that we normally like.
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:32.720]   It's kind of like a one-way kind of communication.
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:39.720]   We would update you all with information about the church here regularly.
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:43.720]   So you can scan this QR code if you would like to stay in touch with us.
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:46.720]   Your phone number will not be exposed.
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:48.720]   So we totally respect your privacy.
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:55.720]   And if you have previously, if you've been here maybe a couple months ago, sign up to the link.
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:57.720]   Just want to remind you that there's a new channel.
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:59.720]   There's some technical issues.
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:00.720]   So we started a new channel.
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:04.720]   If you haven't signed up to the new one, here's your chance.
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:09.720]   And yeah, we're just so happy to see you all here on a rainy day.
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:14.720]   I know like our kids, they're very excited to go to K4C right now.
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:19.720]   So without further ado, before we send them off, I also want to pray for them.
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:23.720]   So if you see any children around you, could you lay hands on them?
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:26.720]   Like just bless them or just stretch out your hands towards them.
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:29.720]   Father, we want to bless the children here.
[00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:33.720]   Father, we know that they're full of joy.
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:34.720]   They're full of energy.
[00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:37.720]   And Father, we know they're a very important part of this church.
[00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:39.720]   And so Father, we pray for them today.
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:42.720]   We pray that Lord, they will receive your Holy Spirit.
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:44.720]   They will receive your truth.
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:47.720]   And they will have so much fun in K4C today.
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:48.720]   We pray for our teachers, Father.
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:51.720]   We pray you anoint them with your wisdom, with your love.
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:53.720]   In Jesus' name we all pray.
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:55.720]   Everybody say, "Amen."
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:57.720]   All right, kids, see you.
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:00.720]   All right, K4C, who's leading K4C today?
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:03.720]   Teacher June and Jason, they're standing there.
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:04.720]   So, yes, go ahead.
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:07.720]   Have fun today.
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:10.720]   Yeah.
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:11.720]   Cool.
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:13.720]   And so for the rest of us, we're here.
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:16.720]   Why don't we just turn around, say hi to your neighbors.
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:20.720]   If they need a little bit of encouragement on a rainy day, just give them a bit of encouragement.
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:23.720]   Or just tell them how your week has been.
[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:24.720]   All right.
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:25.720]   How was your week?
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:26.720]   Let them know.
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:27.720]   Or introduce yourself.
[00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:29.720]   I'll come back in a moment.
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:33.720]   [music]
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:36.720]   [music]
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:39.720]   [music]
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:42.720]   [music]
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:45.720]   [music]
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:48.720]   [music]
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:51.720]   [music]
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:54.720]   [music]
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:57.720]   [music]
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:00.720]   [music]
[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:03.720]   [music]
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:06.720]   [music]
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:09.720]   [music]
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:12.720]   [music]
[00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:15.720]   [music]
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:18.720]   [music]
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:21.720]   [music]
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:24.720]   [music]
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:32.720]   Yeah, you know, some smiles, it will help brighten up the day, although it's still raining outside.
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:38.720]   Or if you need a cup of coffee, if that makes you better, remember now we have a coffee team.
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:45.720]   I think they're very happy to serve you coffee or they're very happy to give you a cup of happiness after service.
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:47.720]   Of course, you can always receive the Holy Spirit.
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:49.720]   That works as well.
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:50.720]   All right.
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:52.720]   A couple of announcements for us.
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:59.720]   First of all, we have a youth group volunteer session this afternoon at 2.30.
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:00.720]   We'll be meeting in the library.
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:05.720]   So if you have signed up already, just go grab lunch and come back at 2.30.
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:09.720]   If you haven't signed up but you're still interested, you're very welcome to join us as well.
[00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:11.720]   2.30, we'll see you there.
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:15.720]   And next week, we have a bring your own lunch.
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:20.720]   If you're here for the first couple of times, we do this every month towards the end of the month,
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:23.720]   or perhaps normally last week of the month.
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:27.720]   We gather as a church across the English and the Cantonese service.
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:29.720]   People would join together.
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:31.720]   We will have lunch here in this building.
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:37.720]   So bring your own food means, yes, you have to go and either pack your food or you cook and bring it back,
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:39.720]   and we'll enjoy lunch here together.
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:42.720]   It's a great opportunity to meet people you don't normally see.
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:47.720]   Or sometimes you sit in the service, you're on this side, but you never get to meet people on that side.
[00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:50.720]   So that's a great chance for you to meet different people in the church.
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:55.720]   Because we're a community, because church is not about coming to hear somebody speak for 30 minutes,
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:57.720]   it's about the community of God.
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:58.720]   Amen?
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:42:59.720]   Okay.
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:00.720]   There's one more thing.
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:01.720]   Any parents here?
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:02.720]   Any parents?
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:03.720]   Any parents?
[00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:04.720]   Any parents?
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:05.720]   No parents here?
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:06.720]   All the parents are gone?
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:07.720]   Oh, wow.
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:08.720]   Okay.
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:09.720]   That's okay.
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:10.720]   No parents here.
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:11.720]   Okay.
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:14.720]   If the parents are not here, it's even more important for you to hear this,
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:18.720]   because you have to pass this on to all those parents who are missing right now.
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:19.720]   Okay.
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:24.720]   Another parenting workshop, and this time it's in English.
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:25.720]   Can we get an amen?
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:26.720]   All right.
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:29.720]   Three months ago, I mean, in March, we did a Cantonese one.
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:32.720]   I know some of you are like, "Oh, I can't really understand the language."
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:33.720]   Okay.
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:34.720]   It's for you right now.
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:38.720]   It's for you and your friends, those who have kids, or you have kids around you.
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:40.720]   It's for their parents as well.
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:42.720]   So please save the date.
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:44.720]   It's happening on the 1st of June.
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:45.720]   It's a Saturday.
[00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:50.720]   We don't have a lot of Saturday activities or events, but it's coming up,
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:55.720]   and you will get a chance to come in on a Saturday if you're a parent, or you can bring friends as well.
[00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:59.720]   So just let me give you a bit of a heads up what that is.
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:06.720]   The topic of this parenting workshop would be cultivating self-awareness for effective parenting.
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:10.720]   So we're not telling you how to make the kids to be a little bit more self-aware.
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:12.720]   It's more about us as parents.
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:15.720]   We have to be first self-aware.
[00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:22.720]   So we want to encourage everyone who comes to reflect on their personal values and beliefs about parenting.
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:28.720]   We want to discuss different parenting styles and the impact on the relationship with their kids.
[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:32.720]   We do want to explore some common emotions experienced by parents.
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:34.720]   I can't -- yeah, I know, I know.
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:39.720]   That's -- yeah, frustrations, and okay, I'm not going to just give you the list, but I experience that on a regular basis.
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:44.720]   So if you experience a lot of different types of emotions as parents, yes, this is for you.
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:45.720]   This is for you.
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:54.720]   And we also share strategies, you know, how we can do better as parents, how we can cope with our kids.
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:56.720]   Cope with our kids, yes, that's the right word.
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:45:03.720]   And how do you have empathy and compassion as parents.
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:04.720]   This is very important.
[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:05.720]   So I'm going to sign up.
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:06.720]   I'm going to sign up.
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:07.720]   I'll see you there, all right?
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:14.720]   So even better this time, we heard you guys, or we heard whoever came last time, there's going to be childcare during the session.
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:18.720]   So if you're wondering, I'm the one, like, looking after my kids on a Saturday.
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:25.720]   Don't worry, bring them in, just dump them inside somewhere, and then just sit here and enjoy your time.
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:29.720]   And, you know, for, I don't know, one and a half hours, just forget about your kids.
[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:31.720]   I'm telling myself, basically.
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:34.720]   So anyway, so more details coming.
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:38.720]   We'll give you a sign-up link later, but we just really want you to save the date.
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:48.720]   Or if you have people in mind, you know, when we talk about those emotions, like, oh, yes, my sister needs that, my brother needs that, you know, that's the time you can tell them, hey, save the date.
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:52.720]   There's a parenting workshop at my church in a couple of weeks' time.
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:55.720]   So, yeah, is that helpful for parents?
[00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:59.720]   Is it helpful for you guys who have friends who are parents?
[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:05.720]   Yeah, all right, yeah, I'm sure parents, they all face those things I mentioned before.
[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:11.720]   But, yeah, we're going to continue to worship God with tithes and offerings right now.
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:17.720]   And this is for those people who call this place your home church or you call yourselves a follower of Jesus.
[00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:21.720]   This is a way for us to express our gratitude to God.
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:30.720]   And, yeah, just as this scripture here says, like, each of us, we should give what you have decided in your heart to give.
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:32.720]   There's no pressure.
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:38.720]   As a church, we did share, like, what are the needs, how we would invite you all to partner with us.
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:53.720]   But we're equally, we're very grateful for the generosity of many of you in how you've been walking with this community and really giving, sowing seeds into responding to the needs that God shows us.
[00:46:53.720 --> 00:47:00.720]   And, yeah, so as we're coming together as a church, as we are sowing seeds into these parts.
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:05.720]   You know, there is a particular reason why we use flower pots for our offering.
[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:07.720]   Of course, now we all do it digitally.
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:08.720]   Our QR codes are on the screen.
[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:13.720]   But we use flower pots because it's an act of sowing seeds into God's kingdom.
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:15.720]   And we will continue to do that.
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:20.720]   We know it's not just for the running of the church.
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:21.720]   We thank you for that.
[00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:24.720]   But God has been bringing us into this community.
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:28.720]   He has work for us to do here, needs that we have to respond to.
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:36.720]   And your time and your offering, it's part of how we can making those kingdom initiatives possible.
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:41.720]   So can I invite you all to pray with me in light of that?
[00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:44.720]   Father, we thank you that you love Hong Kong.
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:45.720]   You love Yuen Long.
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:48.720]   And you brought this church here, this community here.
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:51.720]   You gather us, your people, your children.
[00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:58.720]   Father, we thank you that you first bless us so that we could be a blessing to those around us, to the community.
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:05.720]   And so, yeah, God, we just want to thank you for your generosity, your faithfulness in our lives, in our families, in our work.
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:15.720]   Father, we do want to come as a faithful community, a generous community to respond to those around us as well.
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:18.720]   So, Father, we just pray you would bless this offering.
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:19.720]   You would multiply.
[00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:26.720]   You would use it to meet the needs of many around us.
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:31.720]   Those who are parents, those who are single, those who are working, those who are in need of a job.
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:34.720]   Father, we just pray you know all of them.
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:39.720]   We just pray you would bring us to these people and serve them in their need.
[00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:41.720]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:43.720]   Amen.
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:47.720]   Okay, right now I'm going to invite Pastor Tim back to the stage again.
[00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:51.720]   He is bringing the word to us again.
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:54.720]   We'll continue in a healing series, Longing for Healing.
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:58.720]   And Pastor Tim is going to bring us another message from his heart.
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:00.720]   Can we stretch our hands one more time?
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:04.720]   And we're going to pray for Tim as he's preparing to speak.
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:10.720]   Jesus, we just pray you would fill Pastor Tim with your Holy Spirit.
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:13.720]   I know you have put this entire series on his heart.
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:18.720]   You have put the healing of our people, healing of Yuen Long on his heart.
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:22.720]   So God, I just pray that today you would allow him to speak freely from his heart.
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:25.720]   You would fill him, Lord God.
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:30.720]   I know as he speaks from his heart, he's actually drawing from your heart as well.
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:35.720]   Father, I know how he has been spending time so that his heart is connected to yours.
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:39.720]   And so Father, today we open our ears to receive the message he's about to bring.
[00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:41.720]   In your name we pray.
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:43.720]   Amen.
[00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:46.720]   Well, thank you so much for your prayers.
[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:48.720]   I really appreciate it.
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:51.720]   And yeah, we're talking about healing, right?
[00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:53.720]   So we want to pray for healing and ask for healing.
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:50:03.720]   And I think it's quite interesting that I'm experiencing my own trials in the middle of talking and preaching about healing.
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:10.720]   But I think that also reminds me and it gives me a good insider perspective again of that as well.
[00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:14.720]   But yeah, thank you for your prayers.
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:21.720]   Well, somebody close to me was rubbing me consistently the wrong way.
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:23.720]   Now, I don't know if you've experienced this.
[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:25.720]   Maybe just a little bit, a tiny little bit.
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:32.720]   But over a period of time, it drives you crazy.
[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:38.720]   And so inside of myself, frustration was starting to build up.
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:40.720]   Anyone with me on this?
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:41.720]   Yes?
[00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:43.720]   Okay, thank you.
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:47.720]   All right, I see you.
[00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:50.720]   And so I got to the point, I was like, I have to say something.
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:53.720]   I cannot just let this continue.
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:58.720]   So in my mind, I thought objectively, of course objectively, right?
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:00.720]   What I was going to share.
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:02.720]   So I made a plan.
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:07.720]   And then I stepped into the workspace and said, hey, there's something that we need to talk about.
[00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:10.720]   I want to talk about this.
[00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:13.720]   Let me know when it's a good time to talk about this.
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:16.720]   So I thought I've done my part.
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:19.720]   So I start walking out of the workspace.
[00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:22.720]   And he says, hey, you can't do this.
[00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:26.720]   You cannot bring up a problem and walk away.
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:31.720]   So obviously, there's a lot of like already intensity in that response.
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:36.720]   And let's say I reacted to that.
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:43.720]   And words were spoken that were meant to injure, to harm.
[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:45.720]   There was anger.
[00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:47.720]   There was hostility.
[00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:54.720]   And even the threat of cutting off relationship was brought up in this conversation.
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:52:00.720]   And so everything ugly inside of me and inside the other person came out.
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:03.720]   I mean, it was just not pretty.
[00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:07.720]   I'm glad you didn't see it.
[00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:12.720]   And I don't know if you've ever had this in a fight where you cross a certain line.
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:15.720]   And you know you crossed the line.
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:24.720]   And then in your mind you think, well, now that we're at it, let me tell you everything I always wanted to say.
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:26.720]   Has anyone done that?
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:28.720]   All right.
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:30.720]   Yes.
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:31.720]   Don't do it.
[00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:32.720]   It's stupid.
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:35.720]   Nothing good comes out of it.
[00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:38.720]   But that's exactly, of course, what I did.
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:40.720]   I went for it.
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:50.720]   And honestly, in this conflict, I left this conflict shaking, trembling.
[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:53.720]   I stepped out of the place.
[00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:55.720]   I went for a walk.
[00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:58.720]   And I was processing what had happened.
[00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:00.720]   And I was feeling hurt.
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:01.720]   I was upset.
[00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:04.720]   I was disappointed.
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:14.720]   And I've never, up until this point in my life, had ever experienced a rupture in a relationship like I did at that point in time.
[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:16.720]   I mean, it was extreme.
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:19.720]   And there was a lot of pain.
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:32.720]   Now, C.S. Lewis, a well-known Christian author, he once said, "Forgiveness is lovely until you have something to forgive."
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:34.720]   Isn't that so true?
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:45.720]   It's easy to talk about forgiveness when there's nothing to forgive, but when someone really hurts you, then suddenly it's not that easy.
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:48.720]   Well, that's what I was experiencing in this moment.
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:50.720]   It was not easy.
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:54:00.720]   And I have to be honest, even things that I had learned in seminary, things that I had picked up in church about forgiveness, they were not helpful.
[00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:06.720]   I just could not, for whatever reason, I really struggled to move towards forgiveness.
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:14.720]   So it was not one of those things where 15 minutes later, you're like, "Okay, let's reconcile. I forgive you."
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:18.720]   I'm a harmony person. I don't like conflict.
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:20.720]   So I want to resolve things.
[00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:25.720]   But in this case, I just was not able to let go of what happened.
[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:28.720]   And I really wrestled with it.
[00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:32.720]   I mean, it was so difficult.
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:35.720]   And I just couldn't move forward.
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:38.720]   So what we're going to do, or I should share what happened, right?
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:40.720]   You're wondering.
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:46.720]   So after several months, this was a long period of time for me.
[00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:50.720]   I was able to forgive the person who hurt me.
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:54.720]   I also had to own, so it was not one of those things where I was just hurt.
[00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:56.720]   I also did some hurting.
[00:54:56.720 --> 00:55:01.720]   So I actually wrote the person and also asked for their forgiveness as well, trying to do my part.
[00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:04.720]   And so that's what happened there.
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:12.720]   Today, we are going to continue to talk about our Longing for Healing message series.
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:14.720]   And our topic is forgiveness.
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:21.720]   Now, we have been looking at that healing is found in no other name but the name of Jesus.
[00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:29.720]   That whether we are looking for physical, emotional, spiritual healing, mental healing, it is found in Jesus.
[00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:38.720]   Because He is powerful and He is able to help us when nobody else is able to help us and to bring healing into our lives.
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:46.720]   Then last week, we looked at how a lot of times we come to Jesus for healing with a lot of shame.
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:52.720]   And so we asked Jesus for one thing, maybe the obvious thing.
[00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:56.720]   But then Jesus challenges us and calls us to actually go deeper.
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:59.720]   Because He wants to bring a deeper healing in our lives.
[00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:01.720]   So you looked at the woman that was bleeding.
[00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:04.720]   And you saw that Jesus called her to step forward.
[00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:07.720]   And when she did, He restored her relationally.
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:09.720]   He removed her shame.
[00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:16.720]   And He just powerfully, in His loving presence, brought healing into her life.
[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:20.720]   And today, the focus is on unforgiveness.
[00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:27.720]   A lot of times when you talk about forgiveness, we talk about us needing to forgive.
[00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:31.720]   And if the Holy Spirit convicts you of that, please by all means do that.
[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:38.720]   But I want to focus on how we forgive those who have wronged us.
[00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:41.720]   Oh, that's not easy.
[00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:53.720]   But I believe that when we do that, that Jesus brings healing and relief to pain and feelings that we have been carrying around.
[00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:55.720]   And He wants to just set us free from that.
[00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:59.720]   He wants to get rid of that cloud that is hanging over you.
[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:01.720]   So that's what we're going to explore today.
[00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:03.720]   Does that sound good?
[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:05.720]   Yes.
[00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:06.720]   Yes?
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:07.720]   Okay.
[00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:09.720]   Alright, just checking.
[00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:15.720]   It didn't sound that convincing, but I think that's what we need to talk about.
[00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:20.720]   So we're in a famous, one of the most famous parts of the gospel.
[00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:21.720]   So I'm not going to give context.
[00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:25.720]   We're at the point where Jesus is about to be crucified.
[00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:30.720]   So I'm going to read Luke 23, starting in verse 33, it says this.
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:36.720]   "When they came to the place called Skull, they crucified Him there along with the criminals.
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:39.720]   One on His right and the other on His left.
[00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:48.720]   Jesus said, 'Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.'"
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:50.720]   Now just think about this.
[00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:57.720]   Jesus is just being nailed to the cross, and the first thing that He says is,
[00:57:57.720 --> 00:58:02.720]   "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing."
[00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:05.720]   I mean, this is unexpected.
[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:07.720]   Jesus had a horrible week.
[00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:10.720]   He was betrayed by His closest friends.
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:12.720]   He was abandoned by His closest friends.
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:19.720]   He was put on an unjust trial, where there was an unjust ruling.
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:21.720]   Then He was mocked.
[00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:23.720]   He was beaten.
[00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:25.720]   He had to carry His cross as far as He could.
[00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:27.720]   Then He was nailed to the cross.
[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:36.720]   And so here, He is speaking forgiveness to all who had brought Him to this place in the first place.
[00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:42.720]   Now that is sobering and profound.
[00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:52.720]   Jesus was modeling something to us that was meant to characterize us as Christians,
[00:58:52.720 --> 00:59:02.720]   a radical forgiveness for when we are wronged and when we are hurt.
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:05.720]   What a call this is to us.
[00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:10.720]   We already acknowledge that forgiveness is easy to talk about when you have nothing to forgive,
[00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:15.720]   but when we actually struggle with forgiveness, when somebody actually has wronged us and hurt us,
[00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:17.720]   this is not easy.
[00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:20.720]   But Jesus modeled it to us.
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:26.720]   And He calls us to be a people who forgive.
[00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:28.720]   So how do we move forward in forgiveness?
[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:30.720]   Like I shared, I struggled.
[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:38.720]   I, for the life of me, could not forgive for a very long time.
[00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:44.720]   So how do we move from this place of being hurt, of being wronged, to actually forgiving someone?
[00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:46.720]   How do we do that?
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:47.720]   What does that look like?
[00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:52.720]   What does forgiving others look like in the midst of our own suffering?
[00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:59.720]   So I don't know about you, but in my darkest and most painful conflicts and moments,
[00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:02.720]   the first thing off my lips are not, "Father, forgive them."
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:10.720]   I have other things come to mind, other words that shall not be repeated here.
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:15.720]   But here we see Jesus doing that.
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:22.720]   Now it's interesting when you look at the ancient records of crucifixions
[01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:25.720]   and what people said that were actually being crucified.
[01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:30.720]   They were calling for vengeance against those who had brought them to the cross.
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:34.720]   They were threatening the people who were executing them.
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:43.720]   Now that was the response of people being crucified, but not Jesus.
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:49.720]   And what I love about this is that Jesus practiced what he preached
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:53.720]   because he talked about forgiveness in his ministry.
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:59.720]   We're not able to look at all these passages where Jesus teaches about forgiveness,
[01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:01.720]   but he didn't just talk about it.
[01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:10.720]   He was practicing it in the darkest, most stark moment of his human life.
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:16.720]   And his light shined brightly in this dark moment where he says,
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:21.720]   "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing."
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:29.720]   His love and mercy shines brightly, and it is love, it is mercy, it is grace
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:35.720]   that overcomes hurt, that overcomes evil.
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:38.720]   This is how Jesus brings victory.
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:42.720]   This is how he defeats Satan on the cross.
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:47.720]   He overcomes death, he overcomes sin, and he brings victory,
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:49.720]   but it's not through his force or use of power.
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:55.720]   It's through laying down his life and loving us.
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:02:05.720]   Now what's also important to say is that Jesus did not ignore that he was wronged.
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:07.720]   He didn't pretend that everything was okay.
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:09.720]   He didn't say, "No biggie."
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:11.720]   "Oh, it's not a big deal."
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:15.720]   He said, "Father, forgive them."
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:19.720]   They needed to be forgiven for what they had done.
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:24.720]   He named what they were doing as an offense needing forgiveness.
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:26.720]   A lot of times when we think about forgiving, it's like,
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:30.720]   "What, Jesus asked me to forgive that person?"
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:35.720]   Like we're like, feel like we're letting somebody off the hook.
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:36.720]   But that's not the case.
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:39.720]   We're actually saying, "What you have done, you have wronged me,
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:41.720]   but I'm choosing to forgive you."
[01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:43.720]   But it needs forgiveness because it's such a big deal.
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:48.720]   If it's not a big deal, we call it forbearance and we can just let it go.
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:56.720]   So Jesus acknowledged that what was done to him was wrong, but he does forgive.
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:00.720]   So Jesus is modeling from us from the cross how he wants us to treat one another.
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:04.720]   He wants us to be people who forgive those who hurt us.
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:12.720]   He wants us to reflect his character, to be Jesus' people in all of our spheres of life.
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:17.720]   Now this, of course, what he said on the cross is not the only place where Jesus,
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:20.720]   where we can learn something about forgiveness.
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:25.720]   There's too much to cover, but I want to look at one teaching from Jesus,
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:28.720]   which is in the Lord's Prayer and actually also the context around there.
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:34.720]   So we're in Matthew 6, starting verse 9, it says this,
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:38.720]   "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:43.720]   Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:49.720]   Give us today our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors.
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:54.720]   And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:04:00.720]   For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:06.720]   But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins."
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:13.720]   What? We never get to that part, right? But it's there.
[01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:21.720]   It's because Jesus wants us to be people who have received his love and his forgiveness and mercy
[01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:24.720]   and who can extend that to others.
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:30.720]   He wants us to show the same mercy that he has shown us to other people.
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:35.720]   So we see in the Lord's Prayer that unforgiveness is not an option for followers of Jesus.
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:41.720]   If you're a follower of Jesus, living and just remaining in unforgiveness is not an option for us.
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:47.720]   We're called to be people who reflect his mercy and his grace.
[01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:52.720]   We also see this in the early Jesus movement, in the early church.
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:55.720]   Paul writes in Ephesians 4, verse 30, he says this,
[01:04:55.720 --> 01:05:03.720]   "Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other just as in Christ God forgave you."
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:08.720]   So again, there's this call to be people who are forgiving,
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:13.720]   but this call is rooted in what Christ has done for us.
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:20.720]   It's rooted in his love, his mercy, his forgiveness towards us.
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:24.720]   So it's clear that we're called as Jesus follows, to be people who forgive.
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:27.720]   Now before we continue, I want to give a definition,
[01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:31.720]   actually it even goes beyond a definition about forgiveness,
[01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:34.720]   but I want to read this to you just to clarify what we're talking about.
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:37.720]   "Forgiveness is not to ignore a wrong.
[01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:41.720]   It is to make a decision to give up your right to get even with
[01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:44.720]   or hold in debt the person who has wronged you.
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:50.720]   When we forgive, we release emotional power another person has over us,
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:55.720]   and we often experience the Holy Spirit healing our emotional pain
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:06:02.720]   and releasing us to a brand new future."
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:05.720]   But why do we struggle so much to forgive?
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:07.720]   What's the reason for that?
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:09.720]   Why is that so hard?
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:14.720]   Why did I struggle so much to forgive this person and couldn't just do it?
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:17.720]   Well, let's look at three reasons for that.
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:24.720]   First, we struggle to forgive because emotional pain is so overwhelming.
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:28.720]   When somebody gets under your skin and says hurtful words to you,
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:30.720]   that's all we see, right?
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:33.720]   It's like we lose sight, we just focus on that.
[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:36.720]   And that's what we hear, and that's what our brain starts processing
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:38.720]   and replaying in our minds.
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:40.720]   And so we cannot see anything else.
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:44.720]   We just focus on what this person did and how they hurt us.
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:48.720]   And so we cannot see in the middle of that that this person,
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:53.720]   regardless of how they're acting, is created in God's image.
[01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:57.720]   We cannot see that this is a person that Jesus died for,
[01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:03.720]   that Jesus loved so much that he laid his life down for them on the cross.
[01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:06.720]   But we cannot have this perspective.
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:08.720]   We struggle.
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:12.720]   Mary Kate Morris, someone I know, a professor, she says this,
[01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:16.720]   "Forgiveness is not easy to accept or extend to others
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:18.720]   because it's more than a rational act.
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:22.720]   It's an emotional act."
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:26.720]   Because what has happened to us maybe is so grievous and so painful
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:31.720]   that we just can't see beyond that.
[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:35.720]   And we might literally not have it in our own strength to see beyond that.
[01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:40.720]   We need the Holy Spirit to do work in our hearts.
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:45.720]   So that's the first reason why we struggle to forgive.
[01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:50.720]   The second one is we struggle to forgive because we approach forgiveness
[01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:55.720]   from a modern-day perspective, or we could say from our cultural perspective.
[01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:57.720]   But what do I mean by that?
[01:07:57.720 --> 01:08:03.720]   Well, the way our culture approaches forgiveness is usually
[01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:07.720]   you need to say you're sorry, and you need to do this,
[01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:09.720]   and we might even add multiple things.
[01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:15.720]   And only then, when all these things have happened, then I might forgive you.
[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:18.720]   And even if somebody says they're sorry and they apologize,
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:21.720]   we might say, "Too little, too late."
[01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:26.720]   So we also have a timing thing in that, right?
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:29.720]   Too little, too late, talk to the hand, you know.
[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:32.720]   See you later.
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:37.720]   Well, that's what we could call conditional forgiveness.
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:42.720]   But there's a problem when we approach things in a conditional way.
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:44.720]   And you know what the problem is?
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:49.720]   Because the reality is that people usually don't ask for forgiveness.
[01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:53.720]   They usually don't say that they're sorry, and they usually don't--
[01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:56.720]   And so what that means is that if we're waiting and expecting that,
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:59.720]   if that's our condition to move towards forgiveness,
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:03.720]   then we're actually stuck in unforgiveness.
[01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:07.720]   And we're just going to live in that place with all the hurt,
[01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:15.720]   replaying those tapes, just experiencing all the pain from that.
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:20.720]   And we're not able to move towards forgiveness.
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:23.720]   That's not a good place to be.
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:25.720]   My three months, or however long that stretch was,
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:28.720]   were not good three months.
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:30.720]   I can't tell you how much my mind was replaying this,
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:35.720]   how I started physically breathing differently,
[01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:39.720]   maybe even shaking a bit from what happened.
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:43.720]   You don't want to live in that place, but that's conditional forgiveness.
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:44.720]   That's what our culture tells us.
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:47.720]   And the truth of the matter is we actually don't even define it clearly.
[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:49.720]   So we don't even know what our standards are.
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:53.720]   We just have some standards that are there.
[01:09:53.720 --> 01:10:02.720]   But in contrast, Jesus, he calls us to unconditional forgiveness.
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:07.720]   So it doesn't matter whether or not the person asks for forgiveness or not.
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:10.720]   We're just asked to forgive.
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:14.720]   We're asked to let go of the debt that this person holds,
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:21.720]   to let go of the right to get even.
[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:24.720]   And when we practice this unconditional forgiveness,
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:28.720]   it is much more likely that a hurt that we've struggled with,
[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:30.720]   that's been hanging over us,
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:32.720]   even though that's what makes it hard for us to forgive,
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:38.720]   but it's much more likely that we experience the Holy Spirit healing from that pain.
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:44.720]   It's counterintuitive, but it's the work of God.
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:49.720]   Now, I just wonder, what is your approach to forgiveness?
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:52.720]   Is it conditional?
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:56.720]   Are you practicing conditional forgiveness where people need to do the dit, dit, dit, dit, dit,
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:11:01.720]   and I don't even know what, and you're just living in unforgiveness?
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:07.720]   Or do you practice unconditional forgiveness like Jesus has modeled to us?
[01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:09.720]   Or is it a mixture? It does depend on who it is.
[01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:16.720]   I'm happy to forgive the other people, but not this person.
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:19.720]   Probably conditional, huh?
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:21.720]   So it's like the mixture in between.
[01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:25.720]   There are some people where we don't want to apply the love of Jesus to.
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:29.720]   Well, what is the third reason why we struggle with forgiveness?
[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:39.720]   Well, it's because we confuse the concept of forgiveness and reconciliation.
[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:40.720]   So that is the third reason.
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:45.720]   Actually, this is for me where I see the most confusion in the church.
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:55.720]   This is where I had confusion growing up because there is a lot of confusion around this.
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:12:00.720]   Forgiveness does not equal a reconciled relationship.
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:04.720]   Or true forgiveness does not mean that we're reconciled.
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:06.720]   That is not true.
[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:09.720]   Forgiveness and reconciliation are different things.
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:12.720]   But a lot of times in the church, you conflate it into one thing.
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:15.720]   And so people are pushed, "You need to forgive."
[01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:18.720]   And what they're really saying is, "You need to reconcile."
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:21.720]   But that's not true.
[01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:23.720]   Let me explain.
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:27.720]   Reconciliation takes two people.
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:34.720]   Now, if somebody hurts me, I can choose to forgive them.
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:35.720]   I have control over that.
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:41.720]   I can make that decision to let go of this offense and the hurt that's been caused against me.
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:44.720]   I cannot choose what the other person does.
[01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:51.720]   I don't have control over the other person, that they acknowledge the hurt that they have caused me,
[01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:54.720]   that they understand the hurt that they have caused me,
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:57.720]   and that they're going to discontinue the hurtful behavior.
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:00.720]   I don't have control over that.
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:06.720]   And so reconciliation always takes two people doing their part.
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:12.720]   Another way of saying this is forgiveness is a command, but reconciliation is a ministry.
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:17.720]   Jesus commands us to be people who forgive.
[01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:22.720]   We can do that.
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:28.720]   But he doesn't command us to reconcile because we don't have control over that.
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:33.720]   Because that's a ministry where we--a lot of times because we forgive, people can--
[01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:37.720]   because we're showing grace and mercy, maybe that's why they're able to--
[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:41.720]   God's love is flowing in that, and they're able to have the courage to come forward and say,
[01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:45.720]   "I am sorry. I have messed up. I'm wrong."
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:51.720]   And show that whatever hurtful behavior we've done can end.
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:53.720]   But that's a ministry. That's different.
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:58.720]   And I actually want to illustrate that to you from the cross.
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:04.720]   Because Jesus--so if you read on in Luke, later on this afternoon you can read on in chapter 23,
[01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:08.720]   there's multiple people, multiple characters there.
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:13.720]   There is leaders, and they sneer at Jesus.
[01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:17.720]   So Jesus says, of course, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing."
[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:21.720]   So Jesus extends forgiveness to all who are involved in bringing him to this point,
[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:24.720]   and of course through his death also to all of us.
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:28.720]   But that does not mean that everybody is reconciled with Jesus,
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:32.720]   just because Jesus offers this forgiveness.
[01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:34.720]   There is the leaders who sneer at him.
[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:37.720]   There's Roman soldiers who mock him and make fun of him.
[01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:40.720]   There's a thief who belittles him.
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:50.720]   But then there's also the other thief who actually acknowledges that what he has done is wrong.
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:52.720]   And Jesus tells them these incredible words.
[01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:56.720]   He says, "Truly I tell you today, you will be with me in paradise."
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:58.720]   So that person is reconciled with Jesus.
[01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:01.720]   That person receives Jesus' forgiveness.
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:04.720]   But it takes the two people.
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:11.720]   Jesus extends the forgiveness, but he doesn't force the reconciliation on all the people there.
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:15.720]   That's something where they have to respond, and there's things that the other people are responsible for.
[01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:21.720]   So that's a very important distinction that we so often have gotten wrong,
[01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:30.720]   where we push people into relationships and circumstances where they expose themselves to continued hurt.
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:36.720]   Because we say you need to forgive, and really what we're thinking is you need to reconcile.
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:40.720]   But that's not how it should be.
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:45.720]   It actually takes the other person, especially--I mean it depends on what happens,
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:48.720]   but especially if somebody is doing harmful, hurtful behavior.
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:54.720]   No, they need to show that they understand the harm that they cause.
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:55.720]   You need to ask forgiveness.
[01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:58.720]   They need to change the way they're living.
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:03.720]   And then, and only then, is reconciliation possible.
[01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:07.720]   So like I said, and even pastors get this wrong.
[01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:13.720]   So this is a big thing, just having clarity and reconciliation and forgiveness and what it is.
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:18.720]   But because we don't have the clarity, I think we really also struggle there with forgiveness
[01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:26.720]   because we think it means to reconcile when the other person actually doesn't show any sign of caring about what they've done to us and just continues.
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:32.720]   Yes, we're meant to forgive, but we cannot do reconciliation without them also doing their part.
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:34.720]   So super important.
[01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:40.720]   Now that we've covered all these reasons why we struggle to practice forgiveness,
[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:44.720]   I want to talk about the good news of forgiveness.
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:49.720]   The first thing is the good news is that Jesus has forgiven us.
[01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:51.720]   "Father, forgive them for they do not know what they're doing."
[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:56.720]   Yes, that was directed to the people historically there, but through what Jesus did on the cross,
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:00.720]   he's also saying that to every single one of us.
[01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:03.720]   "I forgive you for all that you have done.
[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:06.720]   I forgive you."
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:13.720]   And when we receive that, when we repent of our sins, we say, "Lord, I'm sorry," and we come to Jesus.
[01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:18.720]   We experience this reconciled relationship, and we're made whole.
[01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:25.720]   We're part of God's family, and we experience this grace and mercy just poured over our lives.
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:33.720]   And it is so humbling and so moving and so touching when we experience this God's goodness and love
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:39.720]   because his mercy is so astronomically huge towards us.
[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:45.720]   And that's the foundation, really, even for us to practice forgiveness is because we've been forgiven,
[01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:50.720]   because we experience this astronomical love and mercy of Jesus,
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:54.720]   and have received the gift of the Holy Spirit.
[01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:58.720]   We can now turn around and be people who reflect Christ's character and relationships,
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:02.720]   and we can be people who can work towards forgiveness.
[01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:06.720]   Yes, sometimes it takes work, and the Bible is very realistic about this.
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:10.720]   Otherwise, it wouldn't need to encourage us so much to be people who forgive.
[01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:15.720]   But we can do it because God first loved us, we can love other people.
[01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:20.720]   Because God first showed mercy to us, we can be merciful to other people.
[01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:27.720]   We didn't deserve mercy and grace, and he wants us to do the same with other people.
[01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:31.720]   So that's good news. It's God's power working in you.
[01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:35.720]   You don't have to somehow conjure this up on your own.
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:38.720]   So we come to Jesus to help us with that.
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:45.720]   And secondly, when we forgive, God brings forgiveness and grace and healing to others.
[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:48.720]   Like a lot of times that opens the pathway. We see it on the cross.
[01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:56.720]   Jesus speaks forgiveness, and because of that, the one thief who knew he was not a good person,
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:00.720]   God's grace and mercy flows towards him, and he responds to that,
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:06.720]   and he can receive it, and he can experience forgiveness and reconciliation with God.
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:12.720]   The same is true for us. When we forgive, it makes it possible for God's grace, mercy,
[01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:22.720]   to flow towards other people, and to lead them into repentance and into God's love and God's goodness.
[01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:26.720]   So that is also good news.
[01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:31.720]   And then finally, when we forgive, God begins to heal our hurt.
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:35.720]   So we're talking about longing for healing, right?
[01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:39.720]   And some of us have been carrying unforgiveness in our hearts.
[01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:46.720]   We've been holding on to these very painful and difficult things that have happened to us.
[01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:52.720]   And it's like a cloud that's following you around.
[01:19:52.720 --> 01:20:04.720]   And Jesus is inviting you to let it go, to forgive, and to experience healing from this emotional bondage
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:08.720]   or influence that other people have had over you.
[01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:12.720]   To just let it go.
[01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:15.720]   I don't know how to pronounce this person's name. I'm going to try.
[01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:18.720]   Celestron. I think it's French, so somebody can...
[01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:25.720]   Moussé Koura, president and founder of African Leadership and Reconciliation Ministries, he says this.
[01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:31.720]   "A troubled heart makes unforgiving people double victims."
[01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:36.720]   Victims of both their offenders and of their own hatred.
[01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:39.720]   It's like, don't do it.
[01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:44.720]   Let's not be double victims. Let's not live in that space.
[01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:47.720]   I know it's not easy.
[01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:50.720]   I know this is very difficult.
[01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:56.720]   And people do horrible things. They do.
[01:20:56.720 --> 01:21:08.720]   But Jesus is wanting us to lead us out of that place and bring healing into our lives through forgiveness.
[01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:12.720]   So if you're struggling with unforgiveness, because it's a struggle.
[01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:21.720]   I was struggling with it. I had very long conversations with God on a regular basis over that three-month period.
[01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:27.720]   In Luke, it says, the Gospel of Luke, 6 verse 28, it talks about how we should pray for those who ill-treat us.
[01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:30.720]   When we start praying for people that have hurt us.
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:37.720]   A lot of times the Holy Spirit, we give the Holy Spirit space to do something new in our heart.
[01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:41.720]   To give us a different perspective that we do not have out of our own strength.
[01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:44.720]   Where he can give us a grace and strength to let go.
[01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:48.720]   Now when I prayed for the person that had hurt me, and I hurt him as well.
[01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:52.720]   But when I prayed, the Holy Spirit gave me a different perspective.
[01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:57.720]   I was not in tunnel vision, locking in on the hurtful things they had said to me.
[01:21:57.720 --> 01:22:00.720]   I was able to see the bigger picture.
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:04.720]   And part of that was that this person had experienced severe hurt in their lives.
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:09.720]   And that part of them hurting me was acting out of that previous hurt.
[01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:13.720]   Now it still doesn't excuse our behaviors when we do that.
[01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:18.720]   But it sure makes it a lot easier to have compassion and to forgive.
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:21.720]   And so that was something that the Holy Spirit revealed to me when I was praying.
[01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:32.720]   And I was able to move towards forgiveness and to let go of the fence that had been, that was caused against me.
[01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:40.720]   And when we forgive, Jesus liberates us from a painful past to a brand new future.
[01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:42.720]   You know, before we're not able to move forward.
[01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:46.720]   We're stuck. It's like walking in the same spot.
[01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:53.720]   But when we forgive, it feels so good.
[01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:57.720]   It really does.
[01:22:57.720 --> 01:23:00.720]   And so Jesus is inviting us.
[01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:04.720]   Don't be living in unforgiveness.
[01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:10.720]   So I want to invite the worship team to come up.
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:12.720]   Jesus has something better for us.
[01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:16.720]   Now I do want to extend this invitation.
[01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:25.720]   Like we saw, just because you hear about Jesus' forgiveness, doesn't mean that we're reconciled with Jesus.
[01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:33.720]   Now if you never have responded to Jesus and you say, "You know, I'm sorry, Jesus.
[01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:36.720]   I know the way that I'm living is wrong.
[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:42.720]   Now please forgive me. I want to be in a relationship with you."
[01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:47.720]   I want to invite you just to give me a little wave.
[01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:55.720]   You know that's not easy.
[01:23:55.720 --> 01:24:02.720]   And I would love to lead you in a prayer of just responding to this.
[01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:04.720]   And then afterwards I have something else as well.
[01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:10.720]   But let me--you can follow along in your heartless prayer.
[01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:12.720]   So what I'll do is I'll pray and I'll pause.
[01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:14.720]   And then you can repeat in your heart.
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:17.720]   And I'll pray and I'll pause so you can follow along that way.
[01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:28.720]   Jesus, I'm sorry for all the wrongs that I have committed against you and against others.
[01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:33.720]   Please forgive me my sins.
[01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:43.720]   Thank you for dying on the cross for me so that I can be in a relationship with you.
[01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:55.720]   Lord, now please come and fill me with your Holy Spirit and make me your child.
[01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:59.720]   Make me part of your family.
[01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:04.720]   I pray all this in your name, Jesus.
[01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:09.720]   And everyone says, "Amen."
[01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:14.720]   So if you pray this prayer, you're like the thief who was hanging on the cross,
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:19.720]   but we turn to Jesus and your relationship with God is restored.
[01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:20.720]   You are reconciled.
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:22.720]   You're a child of God.
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:23.720]   Hallelujah.
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:25.720]   Praise the Lord.
[01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:34.720]   You can now be a person that forgives, that can live differently, that can love.
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:41.720]   Because God loved you first.
[01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:49.720]   But I also want to invite others of us here who've been holding on to this unforgiveness.
[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:53.720]   And like I said, there is no judgment in that.
[01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:55.720]   It can be difficult.
[01:25:55.720 --> 01:26:03.720]   But what I want to encourage you is just as an expression that I want to forgive.
[01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:08.720]   Maybe I'm struggling or I am forgiving to stretch out your hands before you.
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:10.720]   And I would just love to pray over you.
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:11.720]   Okay?
[01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:21.720]   So stretch out your hands before you, and I would just love to pray over you right now.
[01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:26.720]   Jesus, you see every hand stretched out before you.
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:30.720]   You know the hurt and the pain that has been caused.
[01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:32.720]   And I know that breaks your heart.
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:33.720]   You care.
[01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:36.720]   You understand.
[01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:41.720]   And Lord, I know it's been difficult to let go of this offense that has been caused.
[01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:47.720]   Let go of the hurt and pain that others have brought.
[01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:52.720]   But Holy Spirit, will you not come?
[01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:54.720]   Will you pour out your grace?
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:57.720]   Will you pour out your strength?
[01:26:57.720 --> 01:27:04.720]   So that we have the strength so that everybody stretching out their hands has the strength to walk in forgiveness, Jesus.
[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:07.720]   In your forgiveness that you have shown us.
[01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:12.720]   Will you give the grace and mercy to do so now?
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:15.720]   And Lord, I pray for these clouds that have been hovering around in the hearts.
[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:17.720]   We replay these things.
[01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:23.720]   I pray for release of this emotional power of other people have held over us.
[01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:26.720]   And that there is freedom.
