[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   Well, thank you so much for your prayers.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Yeah, I really appreciate it.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   And yeah, we're talking about healing, right?
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   So, we want to pray for healing and ask for healing.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   And I think it's quite interesting that I'm experiencing my own trials in the middle of talking and preaching about healing.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   But I think that gives me also â€“ reminds me and it gives me a good insider perspective again of that as well, right?
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   So, but yeah, thank you for your prayers.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   Well, somebody close to me was rubbing me consistently the wrong way.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Now, I don't know if you've experienced this.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Maybe just a little bit, a tiny little bit.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   But over a period of time, it drives you crazy.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   And so, inside of myself, frustration was starting to build up.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   Anyone with me on this? Yes?
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Okay, thank you.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   All right, I see you.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   And so, I got to the point, I was like, I have to say something.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   I cannot just let this continue.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   So, in my mind, I thought objectively, of course objectively, right?
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   What I was going to share, so I made a plan.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   And then I stepped into the workspace and said, hey, there's something that we need to talk about.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   I want to talk about this.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Let me know when it's a good time to talk about this.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   So, I thought I've done my part.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   So, I started walking out of the workspace.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   And he says, hey, you can't do this.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   You cannot bring up a problem and walk away.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   So, obviously, there's a lot of like already intensity in that response.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   And let's say I reacted to that.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   And words were spoken that were meant to injure, to harm.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   There was anger.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   There was hostility.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   And even the threat of cutting off relationship was brought up in this conversation.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   And so, everything ugly inside of me and inside the other person came out.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   I mean, it was just not pretty.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   I'm glad you didn't see it.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   And I don't know if you've ever had this in a fight where you cross a certain line.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   And you know you crossed the line.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   And then in your mind you think, well, now that we're at it, let me tell you everything I always wanted to say.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Has anyone done that?
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   All right.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Yes.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Don't do it.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   It's stupid.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Nothing good comes out of it.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   But that's exactly, of course, what I did.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   I went for it.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   And honestly, in this conflict, I left this conflict shaking, trembling.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   I stepped out of the place.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   I went for a walk.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   And I was processing what had happened.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   And I was feeling hurt.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   I was upset.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   I was disappointed.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   And I've never, up until this point in my life, had ever experienced a rupture in a relationship like I did at that point in time.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   I mean, it was extreme.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   And there was a lot of pain.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Now, C.S. Lewis, a well-known Christian author, he once said, "Forgiveness is lovely until you have something to forgive."
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Isn't that so true?
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   It's easy to talk about forgiveness when there's nothing to forgive, but when someone really hurts you, then suddenly it's not that easy.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Well, that's what I was experiencing in this moment.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   It was not easy.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   And I have to be honest, even things that I had learned in seminary, things that I had picked up in church about forgiveness, they were not helpful.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   I just could not, for whatever reason, I really struggled to move towards forgiveness.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   So it was not one of those things where 15 minutes later, you're like, "Okay, let's reconcile. I forgive you."
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   I'm a harmony person. I don't like conflict.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   So I want to resolve things.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   But in this case, I just was not able to let go of what happened.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   And I really wrestled with it.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   I mean, it was so difficult.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   And I just couldn't move forward.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   So what we're going to do -- oh, I should share what happened, right?
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   You're wondering.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   So after several months, this was a long period of time for me.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   I was able to forgive the person who hurt me.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   I also had to own -- so it was not one of those things where I was just hurt.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   I also did some hurting.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   So I actually wrote the person and also asked for their forgiveness as well, trying to do my part.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   And so that's what happened there.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   And today, we are going to continue to talk about our Longing for Healing message series.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   And our topic is forgiveness.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Now, we have been looking at that healing is found in no other name but the name of Jesus.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   That whether we are looking for physical, emotional, spiritual healing, mental healing, it is found in Jesus.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   He's powerful, and he's able to help us when nobody else is able to help us and to bring healing into our lives.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Then last week, we looked at how a lot of times we come to Jesus for healing with a lot of shame.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   And so we asked Jesus for one thing, maybe the obvious thing.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   But then Jesus challenges us and calls us to actually go deeper because he wants to bring a deeper healing in our lives.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   We looked at the woman that was bleeding.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   We saw that Jesus called her to step forward.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   And when she did, he restored her relationally.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   He removed her shame.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   And he just powerfully, in his loving presence, brought healing into her life.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   And today, the focus is on unforgiveness.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   A lot of times when you talk about forgiveness, we talk about us needing to forgive.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   And if the Holy Spirit convicts you of that, please, by all means, do that.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   But I want to focus on how we forgive those who have wronged us.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Oh, that's not easy.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   But I believe that when we do that, that Jesus brings healing and relief to pain and feelings that we have been carrying around.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   And he wants to just set us free from that.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   He wants to get rid of that cloud that is hanging over you.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   So that's what we're going to explore today.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Does that sound good?
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Yes.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   Yes?
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Okay.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   All right.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Just checking.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   It didn't sound that convincing, but I think that's what we need to talk about.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   So we're in a famous, one of the most famous part of the gospel.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   So I'm not going to give context.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   We're at the point where Jesus is about to be crucified.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   So I'm going to read Luke 23, starting in verse 33, says this.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   "When they came to the place called Skull, they crucified him there along with the criminals, one on his right and the other on his left.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Jesus said, 'Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.'"
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   Now, just think about this.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Jesus is just being nailed to the cross, and the first thing that he says is, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing."
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   I mean, this is unexpected.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Jesus had a horrible week.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   He was betrayed by his closest friends.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   He was abandoned by his closest friends.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   He was put on an unjust trial where there was an unjust ruling.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   Then he was mocked.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   He was beaten.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   He had to carry his cross as far as he could.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Then he was nailed to the cross.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   And so here he is speaking forgiveness to all who had brought him to this place in the first place.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Now, that is sobering and profound.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   Jesus was modeling something to us that was meant to characterize us as Christians, a radical forgiveness for when we are wronged and when we are hurt.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   What a call this is to us.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   We already acknowledge that forgiveness is easy to talk about when you have nothing to forgive.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   But when we actually struggle with forgiveness, when somebody actually has wronged us and hurt us, this is not easy.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   But Jesus modeled it to us, and he calls us to be a people who forgive.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   So how do we move forward in forgiveness?
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   Like I shared, I struggled.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   I, for the life of me, could not forgive for a very long time.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   So how do we move from this place of being hurt, of being wronged, to actually forgiving someone?
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   How do we do that?
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   What does that look like?
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   What does forgiving others look like in the midst of our own suffering?
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   So I don't know about you, but in my darkest and most painful conflicts and moments, the first thing off my lips are not, "Father, forgive them."
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   I have other things come to mind, other words that shall not be repeated here.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   But here we see Jesus doing that.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   Now it's interesting when you look at the ancient records of crucifixions and what people said that were actually being crucified.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   They were calling for vengeance against those who had brought them to the cross.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   They were threatening the people who were executing them.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   Now that was the response of people being crucified, but not Jesus.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   And what I love about this is that Jesus practiced what he preached, because he talked about forgiveness in his ministry.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   We're not able to look at all these passages where Jesus teaches about forgiveness, but he didn't just talk about it.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   He was practicing it in the darkest, most stark moment of his human life.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   And his light shined brightly in this dark moment where he says, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing."
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   His love and mercy shines brightly, and it is love, it is mercy, it is grace that overcomes hurt, that overcomes evil.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   This is how Jesus brings victory.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   This is how he defeats Satan on the cross.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   He overcomes death, he overcomes sin, and he brings victory.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   But it's not through his force or use of power, it's through laying down his life and loving us.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   Now what's also important to say is that Jesus did not ignore that he was wronged.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   He didn't pretend that everything was okay.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   He didn't say, "No biggie. Oh, it's not a big deal."
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   He said, "Father, forgive them."
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   They needed to be forgiven for what they had done.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   He named what they were doing as an offense needing forgiveness.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   A lot of times when we think about forgiving, it's like, "What, Jesus asked me to forgive that person?"
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   Like, we feel like we're letting somebody off the hook.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   But that's not the case.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   We're actually saying, "What you have done, you have wronged me, but I'm choosing to forgive you."
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   But it needs forgiveness because it's such a big deal.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   If it's not a big deal, we call it forbearance, and we can just let it go.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   So Jesus acknowledged that what was done to him was wrong, but he does forgive.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   So Jesus is modeling from us from the cross how he wants us to treat one another.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   He wants us to be people who forgive those who hurt us.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   He wants us to reflect his character, to be Jesus' people in all of our spheres of life.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   Now, this, of course, what he said on the cross is not the only place where Jesus, where we can learn something about forgiveness.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   There's too much to cover, but I want to look at one teaching from Jesus, which is in the Lord's Prayer,
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   and actually also the context around there.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   So we're in Matthew 6, starting verse 9, it says this,
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   Give us today our daily bread, and forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins."
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   What? We never get to that part, right? But it's there.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   It's because Jesus wants us to be people who have received his love and his forgiveness and mercy,
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   and who can extend that to others.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   He wants us to show the same mercy that he has shown us to other people.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   So we see in the Lord's Prayer that unforgiveness is not an option for followers of Jesus.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   If you're a follower of Jesus, living and just remaining in unforgiveness is not an option for us.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   We're called to be people who reflect his mercy and his grace.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   We also see this in the early Jesus movement, in the early church.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   Paul writes in Ephesians, chapter 4, verse 30, he says this,
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   "Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you."
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   So again, there's this call to be people who are forgiving,
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   but this call is rooted in what Christ has done for us.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   It's rooted in his love, his mercy, his forgiveness towards us.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   So it's clear that we're called as Jesus followers to be people who forgive.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Now before we continue, I want to give a definition,
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   actually it even goes beyond a definition about forgiveness,
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   but I want to read this to you just to clarify what we're talking about.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   "Forgiveness is not to ignore a wrong.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   It is to make a decision to give up your right to get even with
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   or hold in debt the person who has wronged you.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   When we forgive, we release emotional power another person has over us,
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   and we often experience the Holy Spirit healing our emotional pain
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   and releasing us to a brand new future."
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   But why do we struggle so much to forgive?
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   What's the reason for that? Why is that so hard?
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   Why did I struggle so much to forgive this person and couldn't just do it?
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   Well, let's look at three reasons for that.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   First, we struggle to forgive because emotional pain is so overwhelming.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   When somebody gets under your skin and says hurtful words to you,
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   that's all we see, right?
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   It's like we lose sight, we just focus on that.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   And that's what we hear and that's what our brain starts processing
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   and replaying in our minds, and so we cannot see anything else.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   We just focus on what this person did and how they hurt us.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   And so we cannot see in the middle of that that this person,
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   regardless of how they're acting, is created in God's image.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   We cannot see that this is a person that Jesus died for,
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   that Jesus loved so much that he laid his life down for them on the cross.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   But we cannot have this perspective. We struggle.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   Mary Kate Morris, someone I know, a professor, she says this,
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   "Forgiveness is not easy to accept or extend to others
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   because it's more than a rational act. It's an emotional act."
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   Because what has happened to us maybe is so grievous and so painful
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   that we just can't see beyond that.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   And we might literally not have it in our own strength to see beyond that.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   That's why we need the Holy Spirit to do work in our hearts.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   That's the first reason why we struggle to forgive.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   The second one is we struggle to forgive because we approach forgiveness
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   from a modern-day perspective, or we could say from our cultural perspective.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   But what do I mean by that?
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   Well, the way our culture approaches forgiveness is usually,
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   "You need to say you're sorry, and you need to do this,"
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   and we might even add multiple things.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   And only then, when all these things have happened,
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   then I might forgive you.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   And even if somebody says they're sorry and they apologize,
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   we might say, "Too little, too late."
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   So we also have a timing thing in that, right?
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   Too little, too late, talk to the hand, you know.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   See you later.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   Well, that's what we could call conditional forgiveness.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   But there's a problem when we approach things in a conditional way.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   And you know what the problem is?
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   Because the reality is that people usually don't ask for forgiveness.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   They usually don't say that they're sorry, and they usually don't--
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   And so what that means is that if we're waiting and expecting that,
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   if that's our condition to move towards forgiveness,
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   we're actually stuck in unforgiveness.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   And we're just going to live in that place with all the hurt,
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   replaying those tapes, just experiencing all the pain from that.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   And we're not able to move towards forgiveness.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   That's not a good place to be.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   My three months, or however long that stretch was,
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   were not good three months.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   I can't tell you how much my mind was replaying this,
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   how I started physically breathing differently,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   maybe even shaking a bit from what happened.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   You don't want to live in that place, but that's conditional forgiveness.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   That's what our culture tells us.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   And the truth of the matter is we actually don't even define it clearly.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   So we don't even know what our standards are.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   We just have some standards that are there.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   But in contrast, Jesus, he calls us to unconditional forgiveness.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   So it doesn't matter whether or not the person asks for forgiveness or not.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   We're just asked to forgive.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   We're asked to let go of the debt that this person holds,
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   to let go of the right to get even.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   And when we practice this unconditional forgiveness,
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   it is much more likely that a hurt that we've struggled with,
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   that's been hanging over us,
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   even though that's what makes it hard for us to forgive,
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   but it's much more likely that we experience the Holy Spirit healing from that pain.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   It's counterintuitive, but it's the work of God.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   Now, I just wonder, what is your approach to forgiveness?
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   Is it conditional?
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   Are you practicing conditional forgiveness where people need to do the dit, dit, dit, dit, dit,
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   and I don't even know what, and you're just living in unforgiveness?
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   Or do you practice unconditional forgiveness like Jesus has modeled to us?
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   Or is it a mixture? It does depend on who it is.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   I'm happy to forgive the other people, but not this person.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   Yeah? Probably conditional, huh?
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   So it's like the mixture in between.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   There's some people where we don't want to apply the love of Jesus to.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   Well, what is the third reason why we struggle with forgiveness?
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   Well, it's because we confuse the concept of forgiveness and reconciliation.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   So that is the third reason.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   Actually, this is for me where I see the most confusion in the church.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   This is where I had confusion growing up because there is a lot of confusion around this.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   Forgiveness does not equal a reconciled relationship.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   Or true forgiveness does not mean that we're reconciled.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   That is not true.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   Forgiveness and reconciliation are different things.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   But a lot of times in the church, you're conflated into one thing.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   And so people are pushed, "You need to forgive."
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   And what they're really saying is, "You need to reconcile."
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   But that's not true.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   Let me explain.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   Reconciliation takes two people.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   Now, if somebody hurts me, I can choose to forgive them.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   I have control over that.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   I can make that decision to let go of this offense and the hurt that's been caused against me.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   But I cannot choose what the other person does.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   I don't have control over the other person, that they acknowledge the hurt that they have caused me,
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   that they understand the hurt that they have caused me,
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   and that they're going to discontinue the hurtful behavior.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   I don't have control over that.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   And so reconciliation always takes two people doing their part.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   Another way of saying this is forgiveness is a command, but reconciliation is a ministry.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   Jesus commands us to be people who forgive.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   We can do that.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   But he doesn't command us to reconcile because we don't have control over that.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   Because that's a ministry where we--a lot of times because we forgive, people can--
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   because we're showing grace and mercy, maybe that's why they're able to--
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   God's love is flowing in that, and they're able to have the courage to come forward and say,
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   "I am sorry. I have messed up. I'm wrong."
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   And show that whatever hurtful behavior we've done can end.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   But that's a ministry. That's different.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   And I actually want to illustrate that to you from the cross.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   Because Jesus--so if you read on in Luke, later on this afternoon you can read on in chapter 23,
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   there's multiple people, multiple characters there.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   There is leaders, and they sneer at Jesus.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   So Jesus says, of course, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing."
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   So Jesus extends forgiveness to all who are involved in bringing him to this point,
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   and of course through his death also to all of us.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   But that does not mean that everybody is reconciled with Jesus,
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   just because Jesus offers this forgiveness.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   There is the leaders who sneer at him.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   There's Roman soldiers who mock him and make fun of him.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   There's a thief who belittles him.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   But then there's also the other thief who actually acknowledges that what he has done is wrong.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   And Jesus tells them these incredible words.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   He says, "Truly I tell you today, you will be with me in paradise."
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   So that person is reconciled with Jesus.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   That person receives Jesus' forgiveness.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   But it takes the two people.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   Jesus extends the forgiveness, but he doesn't force the reconciliation on all the people there.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   That's something where they have to respond, and there's things that the other people are responsible for.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   So that's a very important distinction that we so often have gotten wrong,
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   where we push people into relationships and circumstances where they expose themselves to continued hurt.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   Because we say you need to forgive, and really what we're thinking is you need to reconcile.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   But that's not how it should be.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   It actually takes the other person, especially--I mean it depends on what happens,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   but especially if somebody is doing harmful, hurtful behavior.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   No, they need to show that they understand the harm that they cause.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   You need to ask forgiveness.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   They need to change the way they're living.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   And only then is reconciliation possible.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   So like I said, even pastors get this wrong.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   So this is a big thing, just having clarity and reconciliation and forgiveness and what it is.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   But because we don't have the clarity, I think we really also struggle there with forgiveness,
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   because we think it means to reconcile when the other person actually doesn't show any sign of caring about what they've done to us and just continues.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   Yes, we're meant to forgive, but we cannot do reconciliation without them also doing their part.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   So super important.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   Now that we've covered all these reasons why we struggle to practice forgiveness,
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   I want to talk about the good news of forgiveness.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   The first thing is the good news is that Jesus has forgiven us.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   "Father, forgive them for they do not know what they're doing."
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   Yes, that was directed to the people historically there, but through what Jesus did on the cross,
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   he's also saying that to every single one of us.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   "I forgive you for all that you have done.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   I forgive you."
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   And when we receive that, when we repent of our sins, we say, "Lord, I'm sorry," and we come to Jesus,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   we experience this reconciled relationship, and we're made whole.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   We're part of God's family, and we experience this grace and mercy just poured over our lives.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   And it is so humbling and so moving and so touching when we experience this God's goodness and love,
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   because his mercy is so astronomically huge towards us.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   And that's the foundation, really, even for us to practice forgiveness, is because we've been forgiven,
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   because we experience this astronomical love and mercy of Jesus,
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   and have received the gift of the Holy Spirit.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   We can now turn around and be people who reflect Christ's character and relationships,
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   and we can be people who can work towards forgiveness.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   Yes, sometimes it takes work, and the Bible is very realistic about this.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   Otherwise, it wouldn't need to encourage us so much to be people who forgive.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   But we can do it because God first loved us, we can love other people.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   Because God first showed mercy to us, we can be merciful to other people.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   We didn't deserve mercy and grace, and he wants us to do the same with other people.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   So that's good news. It's God's power working in you.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   You don't have to somehow conjure this up on your own.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   So we come to Jesus to help us with that.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   And secondly, when we forgive, God brings forgiveness and grace and healing to others.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   Like a lot of times that opens the pathway. We see it on the cross.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   Jesus speaks forgiveness.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   And because of that, the one thief who knew he was not a good person,
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   God's grace and mercy flows towards him.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   And he responds to that, and he can receive it.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   And he can experience forgiveness and reconciliation with God.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   The same is true for us. When we forgive, it makes it possible for God's grace, mercy,
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   to flow towards other people.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   And to lead them into repentance and into God's love and God's goodness.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   So that is also good news.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   And then finally, when we forgive, God begins to heal our hurt.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   So we're talking about longing for healing, right?
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   And some of us have been carrying unforgiveness in our hearts.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   We've been holding on to these very painful and difficult things that have happened to us.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   And it's like a cloud that's following you around.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   And Jesus is inviting you to let it go.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   To forgive and to experience healing from this emotional bondage or influence
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   that other people have had over you.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   To just let it go.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   I don't know how to pronounce this person's name. I'm going to try.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   Celestron. I think it's French. So somebody can...
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   Mosekura, president and founder of African Leadership and Reconciliation Ministries, he says this.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   A troubled heart makes unforgiving people double victims.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   Victims of both their offenders and of their own hatred.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   It's like, don't do it.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   Let's not be double victims. Let's not live in that space.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   I know it's not easy.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   I know this is very difficult.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   And people do horrible things. They do.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   But Jesus is wanting us to lead us out of that place
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   and bring healing into our lives through forgiveness.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   So if you're struggling with unforgiveness, because it's a struggle.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   I was struggling with it. I had very long conversations with God on a regular basis
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   over that three-month period.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   In Luke it says, the Gospel of Luke, 6 verse 28, it talks about that we should pray for those who ill-treat us.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   When we start praying for people that have hurt us.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   A lot of times the Holy Spirit, we give the Holy Spirit space to do something new in our heart.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   To give us a different perspective that we do not have out of our own strength.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   Where he can give us a grace and strength to let go.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   Now when I prayed for the person that had hurt me, and I hurt him as well.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   But when I prayed, the Holy Spirit gave me a different perspective.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   I was not in tunnel vision, locking in on the hurtful things they had said to me.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   I was able to see the bigger picture.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   And part of that was that this person had experienced severe hurt in their lives.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   And that part of them hurting me was acting out of that previous hurt.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   Now it still doesn't excuse our behaviors when we do that.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   But it sure makes it a lot easier to have compassion and to forgive.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   And so that was something that the Holy Spirit revealed to me when I was praying.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   And I was able to move towards forgiveness and to let go of the fence that had been, that was caused against me.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   And when we forgive, Jesus liberates us from a painful past to a brand new future.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   You know, before we're not able to move forward.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   We're stuck. It's like walking in the same spot.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   But when we forgive, it feels so good.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   It really does.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   And so Jesus is inviting us.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   Don't be living in unforgiveness.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   So I want to invite the worship team to come up.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   Jesus has something better for us.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   Now I do want to extend this invitation.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   Like we saw, just because you hear about Jesus' forgiveness, doesn't mean that we're reconciled with Jesus.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   Now if you never have responded to Jesus and you say, you know, I actually, I'm sorry, Jesus.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   I know the way that I'm living is wrong.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   Now I want to, please forgive me.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   I want to be in a relationship with you.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   I want to invite you just to give me a little wave.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   I know that's not easy.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   And I would love to lead you in a prayer of just responding to this.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   And then afterwards I have something else as well.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   But let me, you can follow along in your heartless prayer.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   So what I'll do is I'll pray and I'll pause.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   And then you can repeat in your heart.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   And I'll pray and I'll pause so you can follow along that way.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   Jesus, I'm sorry for all the wrongs that I have committed against you and against others.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   Please forgive me my sins.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   Thank you for dying on the cross for me so that I can be in a relationship with you.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   Lord, now please come and fill me with your Holy Spirit.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   And make me your child.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   Make me part of your family.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   I pray all this in your name, Jesus.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   And everyone says, amen.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   So if you pray this prayer, you're like the thief who was hanging on the cross.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   But we turn to Jesus.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   And your relationship with God is restored.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   You are reconciled.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   You're a child of God.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   Hallelujah.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   Praise the Lord.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   You can now be a person that forgives.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   That can live differently.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   That can love.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   Because God loved you first.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   But I also want to invite others of us here who have been holding on to this unforgiveness.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   And like I said, there is no judgment in that.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   It can be difficult.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   But what I want to encourage you is just as an expression that I want to forgive.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   Maybe I'm struggling.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   Or I am forgiving.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   To stretch out your hands before you.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   And I would just love to pray over you.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   Okay?
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   So stretch out your hands before you.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   And I would just love to pray over you right now.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   Jesus, you see every hand stretched out before you.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   You know the hurt and the pain that has been caused.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   And I know that breaks your heart.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   You care.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   You understand.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   And Lord, I know it's been difficult to let go of this offense that has been caused.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   Let go of the hurt and pain that others have brought.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   But Holy Spirit, will you not come?
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   Will you pour out your grace?
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   Will you pour out your strength?
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   So that we have the strength so that everybody stretching out their hands has the strength to walk in forgiveness, Jesus.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   In your forgiveness that you have shown us.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   Will you give the grace and mercy to do so now?
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   And Lord, I pray for these clouds that have been hovering around in the hearts.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   We replay these things.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   I pray for release of this emotional power of other people have held over us.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   And that there is freedom.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   I pray for your freedom, Jesus.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   To release your freedom.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   So that people can -- that everyone here who is praying can step forward in the brand new future you have for them.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   And just experience your healing and joy and just move forward and not be stuck in one place.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   So Jesus, we thank you for this work of forgiveness.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   We thank you for the forgiveness that is flowing in this room.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   We thank you that you are greater than all these things.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   That you help us to walk in your love and your forgiveness.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   And so we bring all these things to you.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   We thank you for the new thing that you are doing now.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   I pray this in your name, Jesus.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   Amen.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   Amen.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   I want to invite everyone to stand.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   Let's sing like people who have been forgiven.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   Amen.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   Amen.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   Come on.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   Let's sing like people who have been forgiven.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   Amen.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   Amen.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   Thank you.
