1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,660
 In Jesus' name, we bless this.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:03,500
 Amen.

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,340
 (congregation applauding)

4
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,540
 Hey, before we do anything, before you sit down,

5
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,340
 before you sit down, I wanna lean into this sense of faith

6
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,380
 a little bit more.

7
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,940
 Today's an exciting day in the history of the Vine.

8
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,580
 We're having our first formal services in Yuen Long

9
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,580
 in the new location that you guys have given

10
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,180
 so faithfully towards.

11
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,620
 Pastor Ivan and Pastor Tim,

12
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,860
 the Cantonese service started at 9.30, that's already done.

13
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,260
 The English service is happening right now.

14
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,900
 They're gathering there for the first time

15
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,060
 in their new building.

16
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,060
 We went in on Wednesday night, a group of us,

17
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,600
 and we prayed and dedicated that space.

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,200
 It's happening right now.

19
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,280
 And let's pray in faith that God will do something

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,580
 that only God can do through that new community,

21
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,940
 that new church that's planted there.

22
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,340
 So would you pray with me?

23
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,180
 Let's pray.

24
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,480
 Father, we thank you so much for what you're doing

25
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,120
 in the life of Yuen Long and all the things

26
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,920
 that are on your heart for the people of Yuen Long.

27
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,920
 And Lord, you've called the Vine to plant a church there.

28
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,720
 To plant a church there, to express something

29
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,160
 of your gospel, of justice, of hope and life there.

30
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,100
 And Father, as they're gathering in Ho Shin Lee building

31
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,140
 for the first time, their permanent home

32
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:11,140
 after all the renovations and all the fundraising

33
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,740
 that we've done, they're literally breaking ground.

34
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,040
 They're there right now.

35
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,880
 Father, we wanna pray that you would release

36
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,640
 a spirit of anointing upon that community.

37
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,920
 Father, we pray that you would bring salvations

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,440
 in the house today.

39
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,140
 Lord, we pray that people that don't know you

40
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,920
 would come into this church and discover a God

41
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,720
 who has set them free.

42
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,020
 Lord, we pray that everything we've been talking about here

43
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,760
 in the Exodus series would overflow, Lord,

44
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,460
 into the life of that community

45
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,760
 and that they would lean forward towards society around them

46
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,200
 with the hope of the gospel.

47
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,040
 Lord, we pray for Tim and Ivan as they lead that community.

48
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,240
 We ask that you would fill them with your power.

49
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,880
 And Lord, we pray you would speak to them

50
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,940
 in ways that they've never experienced before,

51
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,040
 that you would give them an extra anointing, Lord,

52
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,720
 for the new season that they're in.

53
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,440
 And Father, we stand with this community.

54
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,360
 They're a part of us.

55
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,560
 It is our expression here in the city.

56
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,840
 So we fan into flame everything that you're doing

57
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,920
 in that space.

58
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,760
 And we are looking forward to hearing the testimonies

59
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,560
 of the goodness of God in the land of the living.

60
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,960
 And we pray this in Jesus' name.

61
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,800
 Everyone says?

62
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,640
 Amen.

63
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,540
 Can we thank the worship team?

64
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,380
 They're gone.

65
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,620
 (congregation applauding)

66
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,460
 They're gone.

67
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:21,240
 All right, have a seat, have a seat.

68
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,840
 Hey, if I was to ask you this morning,

69
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,880
 what is the most spiritual act

70
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,540
 that a Christian can engage in?

71
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,320
 I wonder what you would say.

72
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,680
 What is the most spiritual act

73
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,000
 that a Christian can engage in?

74
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,960
 I wonder what would be on your heart for that.

75
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,040
 Some of you in here would probably say prayer.

76
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,080
 Prayer is the most Christian thing that we can do.

77
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,320
 When we pray, we're connecting ourselves to God

78
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,240
 and we're allowing God to speak to us.

79
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,300
 Prayer is the most spiritual act a Christian could do.

80
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,000
 Some of you here might say worship.

81
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,920
 I mean, we just had a phenomenal worship experience here

82
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,320
 within our community in this moment.

83
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,680
 Maybe for you, worship is the most spiritual thing

84
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,280
 that you think you can do.

85
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,980
 For some of you here, it might be reading the Bible.

86
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,620
 Maybe it's your daily devotions.

87
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,080
 That's the place where you feel

88
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,440
 like you're most spiritually connected to God.

89
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,720
 For some of you, maybe it's coming to church.

90
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,560
 For a lot of you, I hope it's coming to church

91
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,980
 where you think that that is something that is spiritual.

92
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,040
 The most spiritual thing you could do

93
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,320
 is gather together with people on a Sunday

94
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,000
 in a room like this or in a small community,

95
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,640
 a community group somewhere in the city

96
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,120
 and believe that God is gonna do things.

97
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,720
 Maybe that is the most spiritual thing.

98
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,560
 All of those things are absolutely spiritual

99
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,960
 and all of those things are incredibly valuable,

100
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,080
 but I want you to notice something.

101
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,760
 Every single one of those things

102
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,640
 is dependent on one other thing first.

103
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,960
 All of those things, as spiritual and as great as they are,

104
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,120
 are actually dependent on one other thing

105
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,180
 that not only defines those things,

106
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,020
 but drives those things forward in your life,

107
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,260
 and that is the power of choice.

108
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:58,020
 You have to choose to do those things.

109
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,060
 You have to choose to pray.

110
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,660
 You have to choose to open your Bible and read the Word.

111
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,100
 You have to choose to come to church.

112
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,680
 Hopefully you chose to come to church.

113
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,740
 Hopefully nobody forced you to come to church today.

114
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,580
 Hopefully you chose to be here.

115
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,780
 We have to choose to do those things.

116
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,260
 And here's the thing, if we don't choose them,

117
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,500
 if we're forced to do them,

118
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,740
 then we're in slavery and not in freedom.

119
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,980
 Are you with me?

120
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,400
 In fact, the very definition of slavery

121
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,300
 is that choice is taken away from you.

122
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,180
 The very definition of freedom

123
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,380
 is that you have the freedom to choose.

124
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,900
 And last week, as we unpacked the idea

125
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,400
 that God had finally set Israel free,

126
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,940
 that Pharaoh had finally allowed Israel

127
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,100
 to move into their freedom,

128
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,300
 we saw that the very first thing

129
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:48,080
 that they were challenged with was to make a choice.

130
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,100
 They had to make the choice

131
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,020
 whether they were gonna move into their freedom,

132
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,700
 leaving Pharaoh and Egypt behind them,

133
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,660
 or whether they were gonna move into their freedom,

134
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,060
 carrying the pain and the hurt

135
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,900
 and the travesty of the oppression

136
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,860
 that had happened for them for over 200 years.

137
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,180
 And God challenges them, doesn't He?

138
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,540
 He says, "Will you bless Pharaoh?

139
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,820
 "Will you let go of the very one

140
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,400
 "who has caused you so much pain

141
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,320
 "so that you can walk into your freedom,

142
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,620
 "into your future, facing forwards?"

143
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,740
 I said last week that so often for many of us,

144
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,700
 when we're hold to the hurt and the pain of our past,

145
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,860
 it's like we're walking into our future facing backwards.

146
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,100
 We're allowing the hurt and the pain of our past

147
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,900
 to be the primary thing that defines our present

148
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,300
 and moves us forward into our future.

149
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,920
 And we saw last week that there was a tool

150
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,180
 that God gives us to release the pain of our past

151
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,860
 so that we can move into our future,

152
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,740
 not looking back to the past,

153
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,260
 but embracing the future.

154
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:46,060
 And that is the power of choice,

155
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,300
 the choice to forgive,

156
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,780
 the choice to open our hearts

157
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,020
 and forgive and to bless the ones who have hurt us

158
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,020
 and done these things to us

159
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,620
 so that we might be free,

160
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,180
 free from the pain, free from the hurt,

161
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,100
 free from anything that would try to hold us back

162
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,380
 from the good future that we have.

163
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:11,500
 You see, your ability to choose,

164
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,680
 to choose the future over your past,

165
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,780
 to choose faith over fear

166
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,100
 will be the primary defining ground

167
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,500
 of whether you will experience great freedom in your life

168
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,100
 or whether you will remain in slavery.

169
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:26,780
 The most spiritual thing you can do is to choose God,

170
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:30,740
 to choose to worship, to choose to honor,

171
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,780
 to choose to open your heart,

172
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,340
 to choose to create your future

173
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,380
 rather than be consumed by your past.

174
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,220
 And here's the amazing thing.

175
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,060
 Pretty much every moment,

176
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:47,460
 every story of great faith in the Bible

177
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,060
 is a story and a moment that emerges

178
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,940
 out of the epic intersection in life

179
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,800
 where God has driven his people to a point of decision.

180
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,940
 So many of the great stories in our scriptures of faith

181
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,500
 where men and women show great faith,

182
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,500
 it's because God has put them in a place

183
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,180
 where they have to make a decision.

184
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,420
 Will we go forward?

185
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,340
 Decide for yourself today who you will serve.

186
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,980
 Will you serve God or will you serve something else?

187
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,100
 But you've got to make that decision today.

188
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,380
 Decide to move into your future facing forwards

189
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,300
 or decide to carry on with the hurt

190
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,660
 and the past of your past.

191
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,980
 It's a choice to have faith or to walk in fear.

192
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,900
 And it is exactly,

193
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:30,300
 exactly what the narrative

194
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,140
 of the parting of the Red Sea is all about.

195
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,860
 Your ability to choose

196
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,780
 is the most spiritual activity you will ever do.

197
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:47,180
 And as God has freed Israel from their slavery,

198
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,060
 Israel is now in a new season.

199
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,340
 Israel's now in a season

200
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,340
 where no longer are choices being made for them.

201
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,940
 And they now have to take responsibility

202
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,620
 for their own lives.

203
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,300
 They have the grand responsibility

204
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,900
 to walk out into their freedom with hope and with desire.

205
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:09,540
 The freedom to choose whether they'll serve God or not.

206
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,380
 And in this freedom,

207
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,420
 God realizes that after 200 years of slavery,

208
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,500
 their choice muscles,

209
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,940
 their spiritual activity of choosing is weak.

210
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,180
 They understand that they've had all their choices

211
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,940
 stripped away from them for so long

212
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,860
 that now that they're free,

213
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,700
 it's easy for them to be overwhelmed

214
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,780
 with the reality of the choices that are in front of them.

215
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:33,540
 And God understands that they don't have the strength

216
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,940
 right now to be able to make the choices

217
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,860
 that they need to make

218
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,580
 to walk in the freedom that God has for them.

219
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,140
 And so what God does right in the early part

220
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,260
 of Pharaoh releasing Israel into their new freedom journey,

221
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,220
 what God does is he leads them into a number of places

222
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,900
 where he brings them to a point of decision

223
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,540
 because he wants to strengthen that muscle in them.

224
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,780
 He wants them, it's almost as if he creates a training ground

225
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,420
 like a bootcamp for them every step of the way

226
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,580
 early on in their walk of freedom

227
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,780
 because he wants to strengthen within them their desire

228
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,100
 to say, we are always gonna choose God,

229
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,340
 we're gonna choose faith, we're gonna choose hope,

230
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,660
 no matter how hard something looks,

231
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,580
 that's what we're gonna do.

232
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,500
 And God actually directs his people into places

233
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,620
 where fear is gonna be a reality for them,

234
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:24,820
 where they're going to have to decide

235
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:29,820
 are they going to respond in fear or respond in faith?

236
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:36,020
 And you need to know that in every aspect of freedom

237
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,900
 that God has for you,

238
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:42,620
 there's always going to be the potentiality

239
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,780
 for you to choose fear,

240
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:47,500
 for you to choose to return to slavery,

241
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,380
 for you to choose to hold on to that past.

242
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,580
 And so the most spiritual activity you will ever do

243
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,620
 is choose faith.

244
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:59,060
 And I want to show you how God brings his people

245
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:03,220
 into situations that will strengthen this muscle

246
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,780
 of choosing faith.

247
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,180
 Is this okay so far?

248
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,380
 Everybody all right?

249
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,060
 Exodus 13, verse 17.

250
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,060
 When Pharaoh let the people go,

251
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,340
 God did not lead them, notice this,

252
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,220
 God did not lead them on the road

253
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,660
 through the Philistine country,

254
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,900
 even though that was shorter.

255
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,740
 I love this.

256
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,660
 God was like, okay, you're free now.

257
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,060
 And as the crow flies, you should go on this path

258
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,500
 'cause it'll get you to the fullness

259
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,780
 of your freedom quickest,

260
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,460
 but I'm not gonna lead you down that path.

261
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,460
 He doesn't choose to take them

262
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,020
 to the place that was shorter.

263
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,940
 For God said, if they face war,

264
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:41,220
 they might change their minds and return to Egypt.

265
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,700
 So God led the people around by the desert road

266
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,820
 towards the Red Sea.

267
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,620
 The Israelites went up out of Egypt, armed for the battle.

268
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,380
 I want you to see what God's doing here.

269
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:53,380
 He understands that the Israelites actually need

270
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:56,020
 to strengthen their choice muscles.

271
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,660
 That is very weak right now.

272
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,740
 And so rather than take them in the direct line,

273
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,780
 the shortest route, the easiest route

274
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,620
 that would take them through the Philistine country,

275
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,740
 He actually then leads them on the desert road,

276
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,500
 a circular route that's actually,

277
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,580
 and we'll see this in a moment,

278
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,620
 is gonna lead them to a place where they get trapped.

279
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,580
 Lead them to a place where they're gonna have

280
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,660
 the Red Sea in front of them,

281
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,420
 and behind them there are gonna be mountains

282
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,460
 and a flat plain, and on those mountains,

283
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,820
 they're gonna see the Egyptian armies

284
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,820
 rushing after them to kill them,

285
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,180
 and they're gonna feel trapped,

286
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,020
 and they're gonna feel fear.

287
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,860
 And before any of that happens,

288
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,920
 scriptures tell us that God leads them to that point.

289
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,580
 He leads them to that point 'cause He knows it's there

290
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:39,020
 that they're going to be able to make a choice.

291
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,700
 And that choice is gonna so strengthen them

292
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,660
 for all the journey and all the battle that is ahead.

293
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,780
 He actually says that if they face war,

294
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,500
 there might change their minds.

295
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,660
 Their minds are weak right now.

296
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,860
 And if they face war, they might change their minds

297
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,900
 and go back to Egypt.

298
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,180
 I need to bring them to a place

299
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,460
 where they're gonna be scared,

300
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,140
 a place where they're gonna face fear,

301
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,100
 a place where they think they're going to die

302
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,860
 'cause I'm gonna lay before them a choice,

303
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,860
 and if they can choose faith over fear in that moment,

304
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,860
 it's gonna so strengthen them

305
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,660
 that they're gonna be able to walk strongly

306
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,300
 towards Mount Sinai, strongly to the promised land,

307
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,800
 and they're gonna be able to do all the things

308
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,140
 that I have for them to do in the future.

309
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,860
 Are you following this?

310
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,140
 This is really important.

311
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,500
 Because God is committed to you being free

312
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,980
 more than he's committed to you being comfortable.

313
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,740
 Oh, nobody wants me to preach on that one.

314
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:31,140
 God is committed to you being free

315
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,660
 more than he's committed to you being comfortable.

316
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,420
 And he recognizes that sometimes

317
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,820
 in order to get you fully free,

318
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,860
 he needs to strengthen your decision muscles,

319
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,940
 your choice muscles,

320
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,340
 and that means you're gonna be put into a place

321
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:45,100
 where you're gonna have to make a decision yourself

322
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,620
 whether you're gonna respond in fear or respond in faith.

323
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,860
 And God moves us in life sometimes

324
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,980
 towards things like a Red Sea

325
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,940
 in order to help us to understand

326
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,540
 that before we can get to the promised land,

327
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,420
 we have to actually face this thing right in front of us.

328
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,060
 See, this is the thing I love about God.

329
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:04,060
 God has all of your life in his mind,

330
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,900
 all of your life in his hands.

331
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,780
 He sees your future,

332
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,500
 and he sees the battles that are ahead of you

333
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,300
 on the path that you are yet to walk on.

334
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,820
 He sees all that.

335
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,060
 And so right here and right now,

336
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,500
 he is preparing you, shaping you,

337
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,340
 strengthening you, helping you

338
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,020
 to be prepared as best you can

339
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,340
 for those battles that are ahead.

340
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,060
 And if he doesn't do it now,

341
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,620
 you're not gonna have the fortitude,

342
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,780
 the hope, and the courage, and the bravery

343
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,300
 to really stand before the battle that's ahead.

344
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,340
 And the battle ahead is probably gonna be more challenging

345
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,940
 than the one you're currently facing.

346
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,140
 And if you're anything like me,

347
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,980
 the challenge that's right ahead of you now

348
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,980
 seems totally the biggest thing you're ever gonna face.

349
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,540
 And God's like, "You want to go ahead

350
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,660
 "into the promised land,

351
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,060
 "but you're not even ready to face the Red Sea."

352
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,780
 It's so interesting.

353
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,140
 They want their freedom,

354
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:59,060
 but they're not quite ready for the reality

355
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,300
 of what they need to strengthen.

356
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,860
 They need to strengthen their faith.

357
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,180
 Some of you here right now,

358
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:08,020
 you're facing an obstacle in your life.

359
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,580
 And what you think is the obstacle

360
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,620
 that God is absent from

361
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,940
 is actually the very thing he's brought you to

362
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,460
 so that you would have the strength of resilience,

363
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,720
 and fortitude, and courage, and faith

364
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,900
 to face the other battle down the road

365
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,860
 that you're not even yet aware of.

366
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,780
 'Cause he cares for your freedom

367
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:32,300
 more than whether you're comfortable,

368
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,180
 whether you're right, whether you feel good.

369
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,580
 And he wants all those things for you too,

370
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,060
 don't hear me wrong.

371
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:41,460
 But the primary thing he wants is you to be so strengthened

372
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,780
 that you will be able to experience

373
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,580
 all the freedom he has for you.

374
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,740
 Are you following me?

375
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,180
 Now, notice here what happens with Israel.

376
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,300
 I love this bit.

377
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,260
 It says at the end here,

378
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:55,620
 "The Israelites went up out of Egypt armed for battle."

379
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,460
 I love this.

380
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,600
 You see, Egypt is dressed for war.

381
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,020
 They're dressed for battle,

382
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,300
 but they're not ready for battle.

383
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,300
 God doesn't see them as being ready for battle.

384
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,220
 They might be dressed in all the right things.

385
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,580
 They might have the armor on.

386
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,020
 They might have the sword in their hands,

387
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,340
 but God leads them away from the war

388
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,060
 because he knows that if they go there,

389
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:15,900
 they're gonna get defeated.

390
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,580
 Their minds are not strong enough yet.

391
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,980
 And so although they're dressed for the battle,

392
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,060
 God knows they're not ready for the battle.

393
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,460
 And because they're not ready for the battle,

394
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,060
 he's gonna actually move them into a place

395
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,420
 where they can actually get prepared.

396
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,460
 You see, they think that what they need is the armor

397
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,660
 and the sword for the battle that's ahead of them.

398
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,040
 Actually, the battle that they really need to fight

399
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,980
 is the battle of choice.

400
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,700
 It's actually a battle within them.

401
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,740
 Are they going to choose faith

402
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,440
 or are they gonna choose fear?

403
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,060
 That's the true battle before them.

404
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:52,220
 No amount of armor and no amount of physical sword

405
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,920
 is ever gonna help them to wield the one weapon,

406
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,480
 the one sword that will truly set them free,

407
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,300
 and that's their faith in God.

408
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,900
 Some of you here right now

409
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,420
 are facing some huge battles in your life,

410
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,480
 massive obstacles that you're trying to overcome.

411
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,020
 And I wanna say this.

412
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,220
 You're facing a massive battle,

413
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,400
 but you're dressed for the wrong war.

414
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,960
 You're currently dressed for the wrong battle.

415
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,900
 You're dressed for a battle

416
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,060
 that God doesn't want you to fight

417
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,420
 and not one that he's asking you to be involved in.

418
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,620
 Some of us in here, we're dressed

419
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,940
 with all the right arguments to prove to that colleague

420
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,700
 or that spouse or that friend or that family member

421
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,540
 that they are wrong and you are right.

422
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,660
 Some of you in here are dressed with all the right skills

423
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,500
 to overcome whatever adversity you think it is

424
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,340
 that you're facing.

425
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,380
 You're dressed with all the charm that you think you need

426
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,900
 to convince that person that you're dating

427
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,800
 to marry you for the rest of your life.

428
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,500
 And you're dressed for the wrong battle

429
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,240
 because your battle is not external to you.

430
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,820
 It is not outside of you.

431
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,820
 Your battle ultimately is in your heart.

432
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,620
 Your battle is what's inside here.

433
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:01,360
 It's the decision-making powerhouse that you have.

434
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,460
 Your battle is whether you're gonna respond in faith

435
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,920
 and trust God with your life,

436
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,420
 not whether you have all the right arguments

437
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,060
 to defeat the person that's against you.

438
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,340
 It's whether you really trust that God has you,

439
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,460
 has you in His hands, wants the best for you,

440
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,140
 whether you can trust that no matter how difficult

441
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,060
 that thing is at work, God has got you, He protects you,

442
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,700
 He will help you, He will walk with you,

443
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,940
 and He'll fight battles for you.

444
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,220
 That's the battle for you.

445
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,260
 And the one that He wants you dressed for

446
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,000
 is not the external one with swords,

447
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,980
 but the internal one with humility and courage

448
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,220
 and bravery and faith.

449
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:34,380
 That's the battle.

450
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,940
 That's the battle that was ahead for Israel.

451
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,420
 That's the battle that's ahead for you.

452
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:44,420
 Will you choose Him when everything around you

453
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:48,340
 would tell you you're an idiot if you do it?

454
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:52,040
 This is exactly what the parting of the Red Sea

455
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:52,980
 is all about.

456
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,580
 This is what is on God's heart for His people.

457
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,740
 And I want you to understand the movement

458
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,720
 of the human heart that God is trying to do

459
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,740
 through this incredible miracle.

460
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,600
 And to help you with that, I wanna take you back to Egypt,

461
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,580
 and I wanna take you to the actual place

462
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,700
 where we believe the miracle happened.

463
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,940
 Let's have a look at this.

464
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:22,320
 - Israel's journey had begun.

465
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,000
 Finally released by Pharaoh,

466
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,740
 God leads Israel by the desert road towards the Red Sea.

467
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,640
 You can imagine a mixture of excitement and trepidation

468
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,940
 as they begin those first few steps.

469
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,280
 God has performed a series of miracles

470
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,020
 to get Israel to this point,

471
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,020
 and their faith and expectancy in God

472
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,700
 would have been very high.

473
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,740
 And yet they were also launching out into the unknown

474
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,260
 with many uncertainties facing them.

475
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,740
 Like the mountains that now rose up around them

476
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,340
 and the desert valleys that now surrounded them,

477
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,180
 they're no doubt expected to encounter great highs

478
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,780
 and great lows in their journey with God

479
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:59,500
 as He has released them from their captivity.

480
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,880
 They just didn't know that those highs and lows

481
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,360
 would happen so quickly.

482
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,460
 The Bible tells us that some 600,000 men and women,

483
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,420
 aside from children, set out for the promised land.

484
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,140
 In fact, biblical scholars would say

485
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,060
 that the total number of God's people

486
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:18,100
 at the start of the Exodus was around about a million.

487
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,140
 Could you imagine a million people walking through valleys

488
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,660
 just like the one behind me?

489
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,900
 And they were heading in the direction of a place

490
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,500
 that in the Hebrew was called Yom Suf,

491
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,060
 which literally translates as the Sea of the Reeds.

492
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,920
 And in what is perhaps one of the most famous

493
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,620
 misinterpretations in all of history,

494
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:39,260
 the writers of the first Greek Old Testament in Alexandria

495
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,500
 in about the third century BC

496
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,020
 translated that phrase as the Red Sea,

497
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,780
 the name that we now commonly refer to it.

498
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:52,220
 No one knows exactly where the crossing actually took place,

499
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,300
 but a number of sites have been suggested

500
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,020
 based on the closest biblical analysis of the text

501
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:00,220
 and the corresponding Egyptian geographical landmarks.

502
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,540
 We know from Exodus 14 that the Israelites

503
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,020
 had just come through a system

504
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,100
 of narrow mountains and valleys

505
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,120
 that then had opened up into a large plain on the shore

506
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,980
 just before a big sea.

507
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,180
 We also know that the crossing point itself

508
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,180
 had to be shallow enough for the Israelites

509
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,300
 to be able to walk through once God had parted the waters

510
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,540
 and smooth enough for the Egyptian chariots

511
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,720
 to attempt to follow.

512
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,740
 All of which is why I've come here

513
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,020
 to a place called Neweber Beach on the Sinai Peninsula.

514
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,500
 The mountains and valleys behind me here,

515
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,020
 this massive flat plain all around me,

516
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,100
 and the relatively shallow waters of the sea

517
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:39,220
 just over there all point to this as a possible location

518
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:42,340
 for the greatest miracle in our Exodus story itself,

519
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,680
 the parting of the Red Sea.

520
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,680
 But did it really happen?

521
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,600
 I mean, is the parting of the Red Sea just mythology?

522
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,220
 Or is there any actual archeological evidence

523
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,720
 that it took place?

524
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,820
 Well, as I've been saying throughout this series,

525
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,720
 there's very little archeological evidence in Egypt

526
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,020
 of the actual Exodus events.

527
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,660
 But the parting of the Red Sea

528
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,420
 is one miracle that keeps on giving

529
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,620
 because it is one of the very few things

530
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,700
 in the Exodus story that actually is recorded for us

531
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,720
 in Egyptian history.

532
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,060
 And to show us that,

533
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:17,260
 I now need to take us back across the Sinai Peninsula

534
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:21,140
 to a place called Ismailia on the port of the Suez Canal

535
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,300
 and to an archeological evidence

536
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,020
 that is unlike any other in this land.

537
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,600
 (gentle music)

538
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:45,960
 This is the El Irish stone.

539
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,480
 It's a slab of black granite that weighs about two tons

540
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,840
 and was discovered on a farm in El Irish in 1887.

541
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,640
 Now, when it was actually found,

542
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,880
 it was lying on its side being used

543
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,080
 as a water trough for cattle,

544
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,680
 but it's actually a family shrine.

545
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:06,360
 It dates to about 360 years before Christ.

546
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,460
 But what's really fascinating for us

547
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:12,080
 is that it's covered in thousands of inscriptions.

548
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,800
 And these inscriptions actually tell a story

549
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,680
 that's about 1200 years earlier

550
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,280
 than when the shrine was made.

551
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,380
 Now, let me show you one particular inscription.

552
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,040
 It's found here at the back.

553
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,360
 Right here, what you'll see is three waves

554
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:32,380
 and two daggers or swords, three waves and two swords.

555
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:35,040
 Now, Egyptologists are somewhat confused

556
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,040
 as to the best way to translate this,

557
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,380
 but a literal way seems the smartest.

558
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:42,640
 In other words, it's the cutting of the sea,

559
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,000
 the cutting of the sea.

560
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,520
 Now, also included here is an Egyptian name for a place.

561
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,360
 It's Pehati in the Egyptian,

562
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,040
 but it's actually in the Hebrew, Pi-Ha-Choreath.

563
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,940
 And that's actually the very place

564
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:59,000
 where Israel camped before God parted the Red Sea.

565
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,460
 So what really fascinates me

566
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:04,320
 is that this is so rare in all of antiquities

567
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,020
 because this is the cutting of the sea

568
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,200
 shown from an Egyptian perspective.

569
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,140
 The only thing we have in existence

570
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,480
 where we have a commentary on the Exodus

571
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,680
 from the perspective of Pharaoh,

572
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:20,640
 which actually makes this stone a miracle of a miracle.

573
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,200
 (gentle music)

574
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,980
 It actually fascinates me that we have both Jewish

575
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,240
 and Egyptian sources for the parting of the Red Sea.

576
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,860
 But for me, a question still remains.

577
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,800
 What exactly was God trying to teach his people

578
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,400
 through this miracle?

579
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,240
 Well, to find an answer for that,

580
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,780
 I wanna take us back now to the waters of the Red Sea itself.

581
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:49,520
 (water sloshing)

582
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,100
 (gentle music)

583
00:23:53,100 --> 00:24:03,900
 I haven't actually tried to part these waters just yet,

584
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,700
 but being here and standing in this place

585
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,060
 is actually really emotional for me.

586
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,180
 I mean, this may well be the very place

587
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:14,900
 that Moses stretched out his hands and the waters parted,

588
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,660
 and they crossed to the mountains

589
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:19,220
 that are over here on the other side.

590
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,780
 But there's another emotion

591
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,260
 that was there for Israel on that day.

592
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:26,300
 I mean, prior to Moses stretching out his hands,

593
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,640
 they felt incredibly trapped in this place.

594
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,140
 They had just gathered here

595
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,180
 and they'd come up against the waters

596
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:35,420
 and they knew that the Egyptians were chasing after them.

597
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:38,140
 In fact, as I stand here with the waters behind me,

598
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,700
 I look back to the mountains just over there,

599
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,340
 I can picture what it would have been like

600
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:45,800
 to have 600 Egyptian chariots coming down those mountains,

601
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,260
 coming through the valleys, chasing towards them.

602
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,860
 They would have felt hemmed in

603
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,040
 and that anxiety and fear

604
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,200
 would have been such a critical part of that moment.

605
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,840
 In fact, it was so strong that they come to Moses

606
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,820
 and they complained bitterly to him.

607
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:03,260
 They say, "Why are we gonna come to die on the beach here?

608
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:06,140
 "We should have stayed in Egypt if we were gonna die."

609
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,980
 And so despite the natural beauty of this place,

610
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,620
 actually the geography here

611
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:14,120
 just communicated to them death.

612
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,740
 What we need to remember here

613
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,420
 is that none of this was a surprise to God.

614
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,300
 In fact, in Exodus 14,

615
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,140
 we see that God hardens Pharaoh's heart.

616
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,380
 God hardens his heart so that he would drive

617
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:31,700
 after the Israelites, chase them to this very place.

618
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,500
 I mean, God wanted Israel to be here, to feel trapped,

619
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,100
 to feel that fear inside them,

620
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,940
 to know that it would be impossible for them to go forward

621
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,420
 unless God stepped in and did a miracle.

622
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,780
 And he wanted this because his desire

623
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,660
 was to expose the content of their hearts.

624
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,820
 He was kind of leaning into his people

625
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:53,100
 and saying, "What's really actually inside of you?"

626
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,140
 And this teaches us a critical thing here

627
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,100
 in the Exodus story.

628
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:59,000
 You see, the Exodus is not actually so much

629
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,300
 about a physical movement from one place to the next,

630
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,260
 but a different kind of movement,

631
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:07,300
 the movement that actually happens in the human heart.

632
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,980
 - When I woke up this morning and got dressed,

633
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,540
 I didn't realize I put the same pants on

634
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:15,460
 that I was wearing in the film on that day.

635
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:18,940
 The Lord works in mysterious ways.

636
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:23,260
 I wanna show you this movement of the human heart

637
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,020
 because it's important for you.

638
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,420
 It's important for your own movement

639
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,180
 in your story of Exodus and the freedom

640
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,980
 that God longs for you.

641
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:32,060
 And we see that movement happen in the physical movement

642
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,500
 of God's people in the story.

643
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,320
 So I wanna just unpack that briefly with you.

644
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,220
 Verse 10 of Exodus 14 says this,

645
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,100
 "As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up

646
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:45,100
 and there were the Egyptians marching after them."

647
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,700
 So again, the story is you got the mountains behind them,

648
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,700
 that big flat plain you saw in the film,

649
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,300
 the waters that you saw in the film,

650
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,460
 they're up against the waters,

651
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,620
 they're looking back to the mountains

652
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,380
 and they see the Egyptians marching after them.

653
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,180
 Notice what happens, "They were terrified

654
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,820
 and cried out to the Lord.

655
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,380
 They said to Moses, 'Was it because there were no graves

656
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:05,340
 in Egypt that you brought us to this desert to die?

657
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,500
 What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt?

658
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,140
 Didn't we say to you in Egypt, 'Leave us alone,

659
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,420
 let us serve the Egyptians?'

660
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,780
 It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians

661
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,340
 than to die in the desert."

662
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,860
 This is a classic response

663
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:20,020
 and you can understand why Israel responds this way.

664
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,900
 'Cause they think they've come to a dead end.

665
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,580
 And they've got the sea behind them,

666
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,660
 they've got the mountains in front of them,

667
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,940
 they've got the Egyptian armies,

668
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,020
 could you imagine what it'd be like?

669
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,980
 600 chariots rushing down those valleys,

670
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,460
 rushing towards them and all of God's people

671
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,100
 are crying out to Moses and they're saying,

672
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,720
 "This was not what we had in mind.

673
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,800
 This is not what we thought freedom was like.

674
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,300
 We thought freedom was gonna be perfect,

675
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,200
 freedom was gonna be great.

676
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,320
 Oh, we wanted the promised land,

677
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,040
 but we weren't prepared for this thing right here.

678
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,540
 Why did you bring us out of our slavery

679
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,380
 to bring us to a point where we die in the desert?

680
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,780
 This doesn't make sense."

681
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:57,220
 Which I think is so easy for all of us to say

682
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,340
 when we're in a journey of freedom,

683
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,980
 when we're moving from one thing to the next

684
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,600
 and when we come up against an obstacle

685
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,820
 as big as the Red Sea

686
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,400
 and we come up with something that seems like

687
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,380
 we can't get around it, we can't get through it,

688
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,440
 we don't know what to do with it,

689
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,700
 we think this is the end for us.

690
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,980
 And what they thought Israel was the end for them

691
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,500
 was actually the very thing

692
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,740
 that was gonna provide what they needed

693
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,240
 for the journey ahead, as I've been saying.

694
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,940
 You see, so often in our journeys of freedom,

695
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:25,900
 we want God's outcome, but we don't want his process.

696
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:30,080
 God's about to do this incredible miracle and split the sea

697
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,120
 and they're about to walk into their freedom

698
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,580
 and they have no idea right now

699
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,220
 and instead what they see is an obstacle

700
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,620
 that God sees as the process by which

701
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:42,640
 they're going to strengthen their muscle to decide faith.

702
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,900
 But in this moment, they decide fear.

703
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:49,200
 Notice actually what they say, they say quite clearly.

704
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,740
 They say, "It would have been better for us

705
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:54,280
 "to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert."

706
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,300
 In other words, they've already made a choice.

707
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:00,480
 The first obstacle they come up against in their freedom,

708
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,160
 they make a choice and that choice is to go backwards.

709
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,460
 That choice is to move back towards their slavery.

710
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,680
 They're like, "We would rather have slavery

711
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,520
 "than this situation we're in right now.

712
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,300
 "We're up against this water, we're up against this trap.

713
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,660
 "We feel like we're trapped in here.

714
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,660
 "We don't know what to do."

715
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:19,540
 The choice we're going to make is we're gonna go backwards

716
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:22,440
 because at least there's some comfort in slavery.

717
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,740
 We don't know what's ahead of us.

718
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,880
 This is really important, church,

719
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,380
 'cause when we're moving in the choice of faith,

720
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,580
 faith means you don't have certainty.

721
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,560
 Come on, church, I'm gonna preach on this one.

722
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,040
 Faith means you don't have certainty.

723
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,600
 You don't know what's gonna happen.

724
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,520
 You don't know what's gonna happen with that sea.

725
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,680
 You don't know if it's gonna part.

726
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,920
 You don't know if it's gonna change.

727
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,040
 You have uncertainty.

728
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,440
 That's why you have to choose faith.

729
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,880
 If you want certainty, go back to slavery

730
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,200
 'cause there you know what it's like.

731
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,400
 You know what the oppression is.

732
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,560
 You know how bad it is.

733
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,640
 And that's what Israel's saying.

734
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,200
 They're saying, "I don't want the uncertainty

735
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,840
 "of an unknown future.

736
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,380
 "I would rather take the safety and the comfort

737
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:04,580
 "of a bad situation even if it's terrible for me."

738
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,880
 Let me preach on this for a second.

739
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,440
 Some of you wonder why you're still

740
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,900
 in that really bad relationship you're in.

741
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:16,680
 It's because you're so afraid of being lonely

742
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,060
 in your future that you are happy

743
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,820
 to accept a terrible relationship today.

744
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,760
 Some of you are wondering,

745
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,720
 why am I still in the job that I'm in

746
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,360
 when God for a long time has been calling you

747
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,200
 to something different?

748
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,500
 And perhaps it's because you're so afraid

749
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,220
 of the uncertainty of your future,

750
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,340
 whether you're gonna be able to provide

751
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,080
 for your family or not,

752
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,920
 but you'd rather stay in the comfort

753
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,720
 of a job that's killing you.

754
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,600
 Come on, church.

755
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:49,600
 And so here's Israel, and they're in a place of decision.

756
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,960
 God has put them in that place, ordained it for them,

757
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,080
 and it's not comfortable.

758
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,560
 It's not easy.

759
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:58,540
 And they are deciding out of fear to go backwards.

760
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,920
 That's the choice that they're making.

761
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,720
 They wanna go backwards.

762
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,120
 And so that's what they're saying.

763
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,960
 They're saying, "We'd rather take this than that."

764
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,760
 I love one of my favorite pastors,

765
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,520
 Erwin McManus, a church called Mosaic in LA.

766
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,400
 He said it this way, and I love this.

767
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,560
 He says, "We so often would rather accept the comfort

768
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,160
 "and safety of a past that holds us captive

769
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,400
 "than the mystery and uncertainty

770
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,380
 "of a future that sets us free."

771
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:23,700
 That, my friends, is what the Exodus is all about.

772
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,800
 That's the thing that we have to try to break

773
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,600
 through the muscle that we have to choose faith over fear,

774
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,320
 to choose the uncertain and the unknown,

775
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,920
 the belief that God will be there,

776
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,880
 that He will provide, that we'll lean into that.

777
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,560
 We gotta choose that uncertain future

778
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,200
 over the comfort that comes from the brokenness

779
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,640
 of our past, and whether we will decide that

780
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,880
 will determine our freedom,

781
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,640
 and that's why God's brought them here.

782
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,540
 Now, notice what Moses now responds with.

783
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,320
 I love this in verse 15.

784
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,780
 Moses answers the people, "Do not be afraid.

785
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,900
 "Stand firm, and you will see the deliverance

786
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,480
 "that the Lord will bring you today."

787
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,800
 The Egyptians you see today will never be seen again.

788
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,360
 The Lord will fight for you.

789
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,560
 You only need to be still.

790
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:08,280
 The Hebrew word be still here means literally

791
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,600
 to root yourself in, to dig yourself in.

792
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,960
 Now, this is really interesting

793
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,260
 because when Scripture uses this phrase be still,

794
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,960
 we often think it's because we have too much activity,

795
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,320
 too much desire, too much things going on.

796
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,000
 We use this a lot in Hong Kong.

797
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 One of the great calls for Hong Kong is to be still

798
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,540
 and know that God is God,

799
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,680
 because in Hong Kong we're busy, we're active,

800
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,720
 we're always doing stuff,

801
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,120
 and sometimes God needs to come and say,

802
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,920
 "Just chill out, rest, get to know me more."

803
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,160
 That's not what's going on here,

804
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,760
 because Israel's not all bustling with activity,

805
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,680
 wanting to drive ahead, and God's gotta go,

806
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,480
 "Slow down, otherwise you're gonna get ahead of me."

807
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,860
 That's not what's happening here.

808
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:47,340
 What's happening is that Israel wants to go backwards.

809
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,760
 They wanna go back to the pain of their past

810
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,000
 rather than move into the future,

811
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,960
 and because they're choosing to move backwards,

812
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,000
 Moses says, "Be still.

813
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,500
 "Put your, dip yourself in.

814
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,540
 "Create a resolve in you.

815
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,040
 "Don't go backwards.

816
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,880
 "Don't go back.

817
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,820
 "I know it's scary, I know it's hard,

818
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,940
 "but don't be afraid.

819
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,360
 "God's gonna fight this battle for us.

820
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,720
 "You're gonna see God about to do something

821
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,000
 "that you never experienced.

822
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,260
 "All you have to do right now is choose to not move.

823
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,000
 "Choose to stay where you are,

824
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,440
 "even though you feel trapped,

825
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,840
 "even though you feel fear,

826
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,700
 "even though you think nothing is gonna happen.

827
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,280
 "Some of you just need to be still.

828
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:30,660
 "Every time that you wanna retreat, be still.

829
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:33,960
 "Every time you wanna give up, be still.

830
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,900
 "Every time that you're allowing your slavery

831
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,320
 "to be more comfortable to you than your future,

832
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,660
 "which seems uncertain, be still.

833
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,660
 "Do not move backwards."

834
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,980
 Are you with me?

835
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,560
 You root yourself in, you say,

836
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,800
 "This is where I'm gonna be,

837
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,860
 "even though it's hard, even though it's difficult.

838
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:54,940
 "The first choice I make is I stop my heart

839
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:57,880
 "from wanting to be tempted to go back that way.

840
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,920
 "I will be still.

841
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,080
 "I will be still."

842
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,440
 Some of you are on a trajectory right now

843
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,840
 that God doesn't have for you.

844
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,360
 And he's just saying, "Just stop.

845
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:16,020
 "Just take a moment to be still,

846
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,520
 "and you're gonna make much better

847
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,440
 "spiritual decisions in your life,

848
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,560
 "and practical ones, emotional ones,

849
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,460
 "financial ones, whatever they might be.

850
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,920
 "You're gonna make much better decisions in your life

851
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:31,460
 "if you stop the panic of going backwards.

852
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,240
 "Just be still."

853
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,280
 Are you with me?

854
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,940
 Now, here's the funny thing,

855
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,440
 'cause then God shows up and contradicts

856
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,520
 everything Moses has just done.

857
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,120
 I love this.

858
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,360
 Who knows that God sometimes shows up

859
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,460
 and contradicts everything you've just done?

860
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,320
 Okay, just me, all right.

861
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,660
 Then the Lord said to Moses,

862
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,140
 "Why are you crying out to me?

863
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,740
 "Tell the Israelites to move on.

864
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:53,080
 "Reach out your staff and stretch out your hand

865
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,700
 "over the sea to divide the water

866
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,760
 "so that the Israelites can go through the sea

867
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,160
 "to the other side on dry ground."

868
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,080
 I love this.

869
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,540
 So here's Moses going, "Be still."

870
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:05,200
 And then God shows up and goes, "Move on."

871
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,420
 And Israel's probably like, "What do I do?

872
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,600
 "Do I be still or move on?

873
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,440
 "Be still or move on?

874
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,600
 "What am I supposed to do?"

875
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,340
 And it feels like it's contradictory, but it's not.

876
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,120
 Because it was absolutely right for Moses

877
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,480
 to arrest the backwards movement of the choice

878
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,740
 of the heart of his people by telling them to be still.

879
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,420
 But then God shows up and says,

880
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,860
 "It's right for you to be still for a time,

881
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:28,260
 "but inertia is not your permanent destiny."

882
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:33,160
 Inertia is right for a time,

883
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,460
 but it is not where you are to make camp.

884
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,700
 You are to move on.

885
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,180
 You are to be moving forward.

886
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,260
 You are to be moving into the future that I've got for you.

887
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,260
 So yes, you had to stop.

888
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,740
 Yes, you had to dig in.

889
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,820
 Notice, by the way, the word for move on

890
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:49,200
 here in the Hebrew, it means to uproot your tent pegs.

891
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,760
 It's almost like God is saying to Israel,

892
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,220
 "You gotta be ready.

893
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,680
 "You had to dig in for a while,

894
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,320
 "but now I want you to uproot that

895
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,480
 "because I'm about to move.

896
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,700
 "I'm about to do something and you gotta get ready to go.

897
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,600
 "You gotta be the one who's moving forward.

898
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,240
 "You gotta be the one who's believing

899
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,660
 "that you're gonna take faith over fear.

900
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,580
 "You're gonna be the one who's gonna say no

901
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,000
 "to the consumption of your past

902
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,760
 "and say yes to creating your future.

903
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,800
 "That's gotta be in your heart.

904
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,700
 "So you need to undo those tent pegs

905
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,540
 "and you need to get yourself ready to move on,

906
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,800
 "to move forward."

907
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,700
 It's like God is saying,

908
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,740
 "Take the handbrake off your life

909
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:24,000
 "because there's a green light in front of you."

910
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,920
 Anyone here ever been in a car at a traffic light

911
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,120
 and the traffic light goes from red to green

912
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,880
 and the car in front of you doesn't move?

913
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,080
 Anyone been in that situation?

914
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,080
 (humming)

915
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,340
 Here's the biggest truth I'll preach all day.

916
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:43,560
 The amount of time that it takes you to honk your horn

917
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,000
 shows how Christian you are.

918
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,820
 (audience laughing)

919
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,700
 Preach it, preach it.

920
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,820
 'Cause if you're Jesus, boy, you wait.

921
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:54,020
 Oh man, they must be texting somebody.

922
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,380
 Must be a really important text.

923
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,360
 I'm just gonna wait, I'm gonna be patient,

924
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,620
 I'm gonna let them do their thing.

925
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,740
 They'll move when they're ready.

926
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,160
 Bless them, they must be having a really hard day.

927
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,860
 Just Jesus, just, I get an opportunity to pray for them.

928
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:05,820
 They're right in front of me right now.

929
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:10,820
 Lord Jesus, I wanna bless that car, bless that family.

930
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:14,580
 If you're anything like me, you're not like Jesus.

931
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,120
 If you're anything like me, you're on that horn

932
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,520
 as quickly as you possibly can because it's green

933
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,160
 and the people are not going.

934
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,160
 God in this moment is not very Christian

935
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:27,560
 because it's green but the people are not moving.

936
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:32,440
 And so he shows up and says, honk, courtesy honk.

937
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,600
 I'll give you a real honk later,

938
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,100
 but courtesy honk right now.

939
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,680
 It's time to move on, it's time to get going.

940
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,840
 Don't dig yourself in anymore.

941
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,800
 Uproot your tent pegs, get ready to move.

942
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,320
 I love this because this is so important, church.

943
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:47,720
 God is inviting Israel to move forward into their future

944
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,720
 out of their choice of faith in him,

945
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,560
 not in a response to fear.

946
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,880
 Church, this is so important.

947
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,600
 Fear does not just drive you backwards.

948
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,680
 Fear can also drive you forwards in life.

949
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,560
 Fear can also be a very motivating factor

950
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,480
 for us to move forward in life.

951
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,440
 Fear can even motivate you to do things of God.

952
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,480
 But let me tell you, anytime you do something of God

953
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,760
 out of a place of fear, you are not going to be

954
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,560
 reaping the benefits that God has for you.

955
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,080
 We can't serve God from a place of fear.

956
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,540
 We have to serve God from a place of faith.

957
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:22,200
 So it is not Pharaoh who is chasing them.

958
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,180
 It is God who is inviting them.

959
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:27,260
 God is saying, move forward in faith.

960
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,800
 Don't move forward into that ocean

961
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,880
 because you're afraid of the people behind you.

962
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,280
 Move forward into that ocean

963
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,760
 because you've made a decision,

964
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,280
 a choice in your heart today to follow me.

965
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,360
 You have made a decision to say, you will provide,

966
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,320
 you will split the sea, you'll do something.

967
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,680
 I don't know how you're gonna do it,

968
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,720
 but I'm gonna move forward in faith

969
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,040
 because I'm choosing faith over fear.

970
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,160
 I'm gonna have the thing that moves me forward in life

971
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,840
 to be faith and not fear.

972
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,840
 Notice that God asks Israel to do this

973
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,480
 before he splits the sea.

974
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:59,700
 Oh, it would have been easy to walk forward

975
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,760
 once the sea was split.

976
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,400
 You can imagine, like, God does this amazing miracle, right?

977
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,120
 And they're being chased by these Egyptians,

978
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,240
 and then God says, move on.

979
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,960
 They'll be like, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

980
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,940
 And like, off they would go, like, straight away, right?

981
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:13,780
 They would run away.

982
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,760
 They'd be like, yeah, I'm going, man, I'm going.

983
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,560
 God's like, I haven't even done anything in the ocean yet,

984
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,300
 but you need to move on.

985
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,640
 You need to put your feet,

986
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,080
 get your feet wet before I do anything.

987
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,000
 You need to make a decision in your heart.

988
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,340
 Remember, this is all about God strengthening

989
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:30,640
 the heart muscles, the decision muscles,

990
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,640
 the choice muscles to take faith over fear.

991
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,720
 He's like, go.

992
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,280
 And yes, Moses is gonna stretch out his hand.

993
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,600
 He's gonna stretch out that staff,

994
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,680
 and he's gonna touch that water,

995
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,040
 and it's gonna do this crazy, amazing miracle,

996
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,280
 and they're gonna go through,

997
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,760
 and then the Egyptians are gonna chase,

998
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,280
 and the water's gonna collapse on them.

999
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,480
 All of that is about to happen.

1000
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,800
 And God says to Moses, stretch out your hand

1001
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,940
 and see what's about to happen.

1002
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:54,720
 There's a partnership that God's inviting his people into.

1003
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,240
 First of all, to have the decision in their hearts

1004
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,600
 to move forward in faith,

1005
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,580
 and then to back that decision with action.

1006
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:06,220
 Stretch out your staff and watch the obstacles part.

1007
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:11,220
 Do you wanna know today who Moses' staff is in this world?

1008
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,560
 It's the church.

1009
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:19,360
 The church is God's staff that he stretches out

1010
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,920
 before all of the obstacles

1011
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,240
 that are stopping people from coming to faith.

1012
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,500
 And he's saying, watch the obstacles part.

1013
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:32,640
 You, the greatest expression of your spirituality

1014
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,640
 will always be your choices.

1015
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,820
 And if you're gonna walk into the freedom

1016
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:40,020
 that God has for you, that he's paid the price for,

1017
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,920
 that he's already released you into,

1018
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:48,620
 our decision to choose, to choose that uncertain future

1019
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,800
 when we know what the past has been like,

1020
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,540
 to take that step of faith and really believe

1021
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,780
 that he's gonna come through, to see him.

1022
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,180
 And we're not making blind faith choices.

1023
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,460
 We have the scriptures.

1024
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,140
 We have the spirit of God in us.

1025
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:02,180
 We have all the times that we come together and worship.

1026
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,480
 We have the testimony of God working in people's lives.

1027
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,300
 We have the testimony of God working in our lives.

1028
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,300
 It's not like we're walking forward blindly.

1029
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,440
 We know the character of God.

1030
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,500
 We see the character of God.

1031
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,740
 We understand the character of God.

1032
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:12,660
 He's spoken to us.

1033
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:13,500
 He's filled us.

1034
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,700
 He's done the work of the cross.

1035
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,020
 It's not in our strength that we do this, it's in him.

1036
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:20,340
 But we still choose, choose to move forward

1037
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:23,560
 in all that God is or choose to remain inert

1038
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,160
 or go backwards in the fear that we hold.

1039
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,100
 Some of you in this room, this is a wording season for you

1040
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:32,980
 because you are currently moving backwards and you know it.

1041
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,720
 You're returning to the things that you know

1042
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,080
 you don't want to be doing.

1043
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,120
 Be still today.

1044
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:42,240
 Dig yourself in, give yourself some time

1045
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,240
 before you make a decision

1046
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,000
 that might ruin you or your family.

1047
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,800
 Some of you in this room, you wanna move forward

1048
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,080
 but you are tempted to move forward in fear.

1049
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:54,880
 God would say to you, move forward in faith.

1050
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,720
 Move forward in hope.

1051
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,160
 Take the chance of the uncertainty of your future

1052
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,800
 'cause it is there that I will meet you.

1053
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,100
 I will split the sea.

1054
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,520
 That obstacle that's in front of you, I am gonna move it

1055
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,820
 but you're gonna have to make the choice

1056
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,420
 to partner with me and stretch out your staff

1057
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:13,660
 and believe that the waters will part.

1058
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:16,780
 Greatest thing you'll ever do

1059
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:20,220
 is make the spiritual choice to follow him.

1060
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:23,140
 Have faith, vine, not fear.

1061
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,820
 Amen?

1062
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,740
 All right, could you stand with me?

1063
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:27,780
 I wanna pray for you.

1064
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,780
 I don't wonder whether you just hold your hands open

1065
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:36,420
 before you if you're comfortable to do so.

1066
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:39,300
 I believe that this is an important word for many of us.

1067
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:42,540
 And just at the start of the service,

1068
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,700
 I invited us to think about our obstacles,

1069
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,500
 the things that are in front of us now.

1070
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,180
 As you stand before him with your hands open,

1071
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:50,620
 maybe you can bring to mind once again

1072
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:53,060
 that red sea of yours.

1073
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:56,940
 And for those of you here

1074
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,780
 where the temptation is to move backwards,

1075
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:01,840
 maybe the fear is strong and I understand that.

1076
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,400
 Maybe the obstacle seems insurmountable.

1077
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,600
 You don't know if there's going to be a way.

1078
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:10,880
 And everything inside of you is telling you to go back,

1079
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,120
 that you're at a dead end.

1080
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,400
 What the Israelites thought was a dead end

1081
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,360
 was actually about to become a highway.

1082
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:22,040
 And what you're thinking is a dead end right now

1083
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:22,880
 is a highway.

1084
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:28,040
 And notice that God did not take Israel around the Red Sea.

1085
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,920
 He took them through it.

1086
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,820
 And some of you, what you think is your dead end,

1087
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:34,160
 what you would like God to just remove from you

1088
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,800
 is actually the very thing that he'll walk you through.

1089
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,920
 Though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

1090
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,760
 he is with me.

1091
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:43,520
 For some of you, the call is to be still,

1092
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,000
 to take the courage today to say,

1093
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,920
 "I will stop moving backwards."

1094
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,360
 Help me, Lord.

1095
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,480
 Help me, Lord.

1096
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,960
 Help me to trust you.

1097
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,420
 Help me to just be still.

1098
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:59,360
 Give me the courage to say no.

1099
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:02,720
 Give me the courage to stand against what my heart is

1100
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,660
 trying to tell me to do,

1101
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:06,300
 what the fear in me is trying to tell me to do.

1102
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:10,220
 Lord, I root myself, dig myself into you.

1103
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:11,820
 When all else seems lost,

1104
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:13,700
 when all else seems like it's gonna fail,

1105
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:16,100
 I root and dig myself into you, Lord.

1106
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:19,980
 And then for some of us,

1107
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:23,420
 there's a green light where you think it's red.

1108
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:27,560
 And God is giving you that courtesy honk.

1109
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,340
 And he's saying, "It's time to move."

1110
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,520
 Pull up your tent pegs.

1111
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,560
 It was right for you to be just stable for a while,

1112
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:38,280
 but now it's time to move.

1113
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,280
 Take a step of faith and move forward,

1114
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,760
 not in fear, but in faith,

1115
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:43,720
 knowing that I'm with you,

1116
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:46,360
 that the wind of my spirit is with you.

1117
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,360
 And together, we're gonna do amazing things.

1118
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,000
 There's Mount Sinai ahead of you.

1119
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,820
 There's my presence,

1120
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:54,240
 like you've never experienced it before, ahead of you.

1121
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,680
 There's the promised land that you're gonna go and conquer

1122
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:57,520
 that is ahead of you.

1123
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,300
 You could only see the victories that are ahead of you,

1124
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:04,300
 but it's gonna come through the strengthening of your heart,

1125
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:07,220
 the strengthening of your faith.

1126
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:10,880
 Father, come Holy Spirit.

1127
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,460
 I pray and release faith over these people

1128
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:15,780
 in the name of Jesus.

1129
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,160
 And I pray that faith would rise up in the house,

1130
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,460
 that faith would be what we are moving forward in

1131
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:22,860
 as a community of God.

1132
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,820
 Thank you, Lord, that you taught the Israelites

1133
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:26,100
 a place of great faith.

1134
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:29,600
 Would you teach us and show us and release in us great faith

1135
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,080
 and we pray this in Jesus' name.

1136
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,640
 Everyone says.

1137
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:34,480
 Amen.

1138
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,080
 Let's worship together as we respond in great faith.
