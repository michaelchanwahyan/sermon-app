1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 How's everyone doing?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,800
 (audience murmurs)

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,680
 Uh-oh, is it the weather?

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,640
 (audience murmurs)

5
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,240
 Do we have to pray for the weather?

6
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,320
 Please don't, I love this kind of weather.

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,160
 (audience laughs)

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,800
 I'm gonna spend Christmas in Singapore,

9
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,160
 I'm gonna miss this weather.

10
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,000
 (audience murmurs)

11
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,200
 (laughs)

12
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,000
 Anyway, anybody loves movie here?

13
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,660
 Okay, two of you, three of you, that's not too bad.

14
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:28,760
 I wanna give you a little bit of local culture

15
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,080
 sort of information.

16
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,320
 If you've been around town lately,

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,800
 if you've been walking on the streets

18
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,980
 or scrolling on social media,

19
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,720
 there's actually a local movie

20
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,200
 that's under the spotlight right now.

21
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,480
 It receives so much attention

22
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,720
 because it hit $80 million box office

23
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,040
 in just two weeks time.

24
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,840
 Just to give you a bit of context,

25
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,760
 in Hong Kong cinema history,

26
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,480
 there's only been one movie so far

27
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,280
 that has hit the 100 million mark,

28
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,640
 and this one, it's quite likely to be the second one.

29
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,640
 And so it receives a lot of attention,

30
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,560
 a lot of people are talking about it,

31
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,920
 and yeah, it has a very interesting name,

32
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,480
 interesting title, it's called "The Last Dance,"

33
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,760
 or "The Last Dance," for all my British friends here.

34
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,720
 (audience laughs)

35
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,200
 All right, it's actually about a Taoist priest

36
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,960
 and, or about a wedding planner

37
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,800
 who somehow entered into the funeral industry by chance,

38
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,200
 and he had to partner with this Taoist priest,

39
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,720
 and through this whole process,

40
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,920
 this wedding planner turned into a funeral planner.

41
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,960
 He was learning about life and death

42
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,240
 through this whole funeral experience.

43
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,340
 And while the name, the Chinese name of this movie

44
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,160
 was actually taken from the very rituals

45
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,160
 that Taoists perform at a Chinese funeral,

46
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,620
 but it's not about all these religious

47
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,880
 or spiritual practices.

48
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,480
 It's more about finding out the meaning of life and death.

49
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,240
 But today, I don't wanna talk about this movie.

50
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,280
 I'm not gonna spoil it for you guys.

51
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,120
 I do wanna zoom in a little bit

52
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,480
 into one particular character.

53
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,040
 So there is this family behind the screen,

54
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,760
 behind me on the screen, there is this family,

55
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,560
 the oldest guy, it's the Taoist priest.

56
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,080
 He perform all the rituals.

57
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,760
 In Chinese, we call him (speaks in foreign language)

58
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,240
 and he does all the very funny dance,

59
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,200
 and so that's what he does.

60
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,720
 And he actually has a son,

61
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,760
 and very conveniently, his son followed

62
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,640
 his father's footsteps and also became a Taoist priest,

63
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,160
 and this would be his son right here.

64
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,900
 But somehow, this son of his,

65
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,480
 who himself is a Taoist priest,

66
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,260
 he actually married a Catholic lady,

67
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,880
 or a Christian, a Catholic lady,

68
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,360
 and they gave birth to a very cute son,

69
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,600
 and the son follow his mom to be a Catholic.

70
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,200
 And so this is a true Hong Kong story

71
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,240
 in many different sense,

72
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,200
 but one of the way it's very Hong Kong

73
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,320
 is that as this boy is growing up,

74
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,320
 he needs to apply for a school.

75
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,060
 And of course, his mom would want him to apply

76
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,560
 to get into a Catholic school or a Christian school,

77
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,360
 and this is a true Hong Kong story

78
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,520
 because the school said if both parents

79
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,720
 are baptized into the church,

80
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,080
 the boy would get extra points to get into the school.

81
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,220
 Very Hong Kong, right?

82
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,520
 So like what all mothers would do,

83
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,640
 this mom, wearing that hat behind the husband,

84
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,200
 required, asked the husband,

85
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,660
 "Hey, could you get baptized?"

86
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,720
 She asked a Taoist priest to get baptized,

87
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,320
 and of course, for the son, the priest said,

88
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,080
 "Yeah, I'll do it, I'll do it for him."

89
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,920
 And later, okay, I know this is a bit of a spoiler,

90
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,920
 but I promise, just this little bit, all right?

91
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,000
 You can still go to watch the movie.

92
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,400
 It's still very enjoyable with this little bit of spoiler.

93
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,060
 So there was one time the whole family was having dinner,

94
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,160
 and the wife was doing this,

95
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,720
 "Hey, hey, hey."

96
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,320
 Like what?

97
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,360
 Hey, now you're baptized.

98
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,120
 You gotta say grace before your dinner.

99
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,800
 And so the Taoist priest, the younger one,

100
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,700
 was forced to say grace in front of the entire family,

101
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,080
 and you could imagine what his father would react to that.

102
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,220
 It's funny, you know, there are so many,

103
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,980
 there are so many modern movies and TV shows

104
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:31,840
 that they would include kind of like a Christian character

105
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,600
 or a character with Christian or Catholic faith background

106
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,880
 into the plot.

107
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,320
 And in other shows and movies we watch,

108
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,960
 we sometimes would see that.

109
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,240
 Yet, it's also not uncommon that the portrayal

110
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,840
 of these characters and their faith

111
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,000
 sometimes is quite negative.

112
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,880
 In pop culture, when a Christian is in the plot of a movie

113
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,840
 or a TV show, well, at best, that character,

114
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,920
 what they wanna show you is that this character

115
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,600
 is quite committed,

116
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,680
 or this character has very strong moral values.

117
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,320
 But strong moral values sometimes means this character

118
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,400
 is sort of like conservative.

119
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,560
 Or old-fashioned.

120
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,520
 Or stubborn, illogical,

121
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,560
 judgmental, and worst case scenario,

122
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,800
 this guy is hypocritical.

123
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,720
 This is how Christians are being seen

124
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,080
 in our modern day pop culture or in entertainment.

125
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,840
 And sometimes we think that, you know what,

126
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,400
 this is just stereotype,

127
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,280
 just because they never step foot in a church,

128
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,400
 they never meet people like you and me,

129
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,000
 that's why they have such a stereotype.

130
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,760
 Perhaps that's what we're thinking.

131
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,480
 To a certain degree, I agree,

132
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,160
 because they haven't met you guys,

133
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,680
 so that's why they don't know better, right?

134
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,900
 But maybe some of us here, we're rather new to this faith.

135
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,480
 Maybe a couple weeks ago, you were not Christians yet,

136
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,600
 and that's also how you used to see Christianity,

137
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,680
 that's how you used to see Christians,

138
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,000
 that's how you used to see people in the church.

139
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,560
 We're like, old-fashioned, judgmental, hypocritical,

140
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,880
 until you have an encounter with Jesus himself

141
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,120
 and you join a community of faith

142
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,240
 and you find, oh, maybe it's not that bad,

143
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,240
 it's a little bit different.

144
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,960
 Or maybe you're sitting here right now

145
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,320
 even feeling a little bit uncomfortable

146
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,240
 when you hear the name Christian

147
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,440
 being associated with all these qualities

148
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,040
 I just mentioned.

149
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:37,440
 But my point is, collectively as a church,

150
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,600
 we may have certain reputations.

151
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:47,000
 I know some of you understand what I'm talking about,

152
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,320
 I can feel it.

153
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,720
 I know sometimes those labels on us,

154
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,420
 they may not do us justice,

155
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,160
 but I would also like to call us

156
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,480
 to a place of reflection today, church.

157
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,840
 What do these impressions about Christians come from?

158
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,440
 Where do they come from?

159
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,600
 What are we known for in this city?

160
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,560
 What are we known for as a church here in Yuen Long?

161
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,000
 Interestingly, when we open up the New Testament

162
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 and look at a group of people

163
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,280
 who are known as the Pharisees,

164
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,080
 they have certain reputations as well.

165
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,920
 As a New Testament reader, as we read through this book,

166
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,580
 we probably form our opinions about them

167
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,760
 based on the narratives and the comments

168
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,240
 about this, you know, in the gospel story

169
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,680
 about this group of people.

170
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,900
 And we normally know the Pharisees as they're stubborn,

171
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,440
 they're judgmental, legalistic,

172
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,500
 a self-righteous, hypocritic.

173
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,840
 That's what, that's how we see them.

174
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,320
 And surely if one of them, one of these Pharisees,

175
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,960
 if they were alive today,

176
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,960
 and if he stand right here with us in this room right now,

177
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,940
 he would tell you,

178
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,160
 or he would try to tell you a different story.

179
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,960
 He would try to disagree with all the labels we had on them.

180
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,480
 And he would start to explain to us

181
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,720
 what Pharisees believe in

182
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,780
 and what they, what are the practices all about.

183
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:16,140
 They were actually a group or a movement

184
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:20,040
 started about 150 years before the time of Jesus.

185
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,320
 That's a period of time between the Old Testament

186
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,160
 and the New Testament.

187
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,800
 And just as the prophet Daniel prophesied

188
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,440
 in the Old Testament,

189
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,760
 there were rulers or nations rising to power

190
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,280
 to rule over the Jews or Israel

191
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,800
 after they returned from exile.

192
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,760
 We know that Persia actually replaced Babylon

193
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,840
 as the new superpower.

194
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,680
 And then we all heard about Alexander the Great,

195
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:51,520
 his Greek empire took over the entire region.

196
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,160
 And then it was the Romans.

197
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,220
 But when Alexander the Great,

198
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,160
 when the Greek empire took over that area,

199
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,960
 they tried to do something.

200
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,160
 Well, the Romans actually copied them as well.

201
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,520
 They tried to export their own culture,

202
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,840
 their language, their practices, their philosophies.

203
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,840
 They've been teaching everyone in the entire empire

204
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,880
 in different regions, how to talk right in Greek,

205
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,360
 how to think like a Greek, they've been doing that.

206
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,520
 So that's why in the New Testament,

207
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,160
 the language of the Bible is no longer written in Hebrew.

208
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,920
 It's actually written in Greek, Koine Greek.

209
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,680
 Oh, yes, yes, positive, yes.

210
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,720
 It's Koine Greek, it's not classical Greek,

211
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,440
 it's not the modern Greek we're reading.

212
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,920
 It's a very special form of Greek

213
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,920
 that was popular during that time.

214
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,080
 But we read the New Testament or it's written in Greek.

215
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,400
 But not just that.

216
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:49,400
 When this language, we do have a lot of Hong Kongers here

217
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,160
 who are slightly more mature in age,

218
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,520
 who were born before 1997.

219
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,080
 So you would have a sense of, you know what it means

220
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,760
 to be in a colony.

221
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:06,000
 Well, some of us here, like myself, I'm Chinese,

222
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,320
 well, speaking about my ethnicity,

223
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,120
 but I grew up learning English.

224
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,880
 That's why I can preach here today.

225
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:16,240
 I grew up learning English because we were a British colony.

226
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,720
 And I don't just learn English, I learn,

227
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,080
 I pick up the way how English speakers would think.

228
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,840
 I pick up the way, I pick up Western philosophies as well.

229
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,560
 Because of that, I pick up a little bit,

230
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,640
 just a little bit of Westerner kind of lifestyle.

231
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,320
 So when these Jewish people,

232
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,680
 when they were being influenced by the Greek or Roman culture,

233
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,680
 it's not just the language they spoke that was influenced.

234
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,640
 It's also the way they think, the way they see life,

235
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,920
 and they slowly shifted away

236
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,120
 from the original Hebrew roots.

237
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,320
 And there was a group of Jewish people, they saw that.

238
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,320
 They saw how the people are no longer rooted in their faith,

239
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,760
 in this Hebrew faith of theirs.

240
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,640
 And so they decided to do something.

241
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,840
 And they recognize that if there's one thing

242
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,720
 that sets them apart from the rest of all the other nations

243
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,480
 or people around them, that would actually be God's word.

244
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,760
 More precisely, that would be the law of God,

245
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,480
 the law of Moses.

246
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,800
 And so this particular group of people,

247
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,480
 they started devoting themselves to studying,

248
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,960
 translating a little bit as well,

249
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,560
 studying, they copy it, and they started teaching

250
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,080
 the word of God or the law or the prophets.

251
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,720
 And these group of people, they said,

252
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,120
 "We must align our lifestyle

253
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,000
 "with the standard of the law of Moses."

254
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,160
 And that's not enough.

255
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,080
 Sometimes we don't know specifically in our everyday life

256
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,840
 how we can actually practice that.

257
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,040
 So perhaps we should come up,

258
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,000
 we should extend it a little bit,

259
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,400
 give it a little bit of commentary,

260
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,400
 and we have all these oral traditions.

261
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:01,000
 And this group of people, now we know them as the Pharisees.

262
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,960
 If we look at the name Pharisee itself,

263
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:08,600
 it's actually from an Aramaic word called perushim.

264
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,480
 It actually means to separate, to divide, or distinguish.

265
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,560
 So they are saying, "We are the separated ones.

266
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,440
 "We're the ones who are set apart."

267
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,760
 Does that ring a bell?

268
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,400
 Does that sound familiar?

269
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,520
 Maybe you've heard of it in the church before as well.

270
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,560
 We are the holy one, we are the separated ones,

271
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,200
 we are the one that are set apart.

272
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,960
 And they just keep doing this and doing this.

273
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,360
 They try their best to interpret whatever laws

274
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,360
 they know about and how to apply that

275
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,120
 in their everyday life.

276
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,000
 And so, and they come up with more and more

277
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,560
 and more rules and traditions.

278
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,120
 If there's one thing this group of Pharisees

279
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,040
 they want to be known for,

280
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,600
 they want to be known as the righteous people.

281
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,880
 They want to be known as the pious people.

282
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,640
 But fast forward 150 years later,

283
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,840
 when we meet them in the stories of the New Testament,

284
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:09,160
 their reputation wasn't quite what they wished for.

285
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,400
 Self-righteous, legalistic, judgmental, hypocritical,

286
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,160
 these were their reputations.

287
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,840
 And this is how they are remembered

288
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,080
 for thousands of years now.

289
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,080
 And the problem is church.

290
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:28,000
 There was a gap between what their beliefs stood for

291
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,160
 and what they were known for.

292
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,480
 Let me repeat again.

293
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,920
 I believe this group of Pharisees,

294
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,360
 when they first started,

295
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,840
 they have every good intention to honor God,

296
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,080
 to do His will,

297
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,000
 but what their beliefs actually stood for

298
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,520
 and what they were ultimately known for,

299
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,920
 there's a gap there.

300
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:53,720
 And that's a problem or a question for us today as well.

301
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,240
 When we look at our reputation as a church in the city

302
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,960
 or as the church in the city or in this world,

303
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:06,960
 is there a gap between what our faith stands for

304
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,160
 and what we're known for?

305
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,840
 So we reflect on this together today.

306
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,640
 I do wanna open the Bible

307
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:20,640
 and read yet another of Jesus's parables with us today.

308
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,960
 We're going to look at Luke 14,

309
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,480
 and here's the background in first one.

310
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,280
 Luke 14, first one, it says this.

311
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,880
 One Sabbath when Jesus went to eat

312
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,040
 in a house of a prominent Pharisee,

313
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,400
 He was being carefully watched.

314
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:44,080
 One verse, but there's tons of information

315
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,360
 in this single verse.

316
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,400
 So first of all, this is a Sabbath.

317
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,960
 And it's important because, again, spoiler alert,

318
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,800
 a miracle is gonna happen in this chapter,

319
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,280
 and it's gonna take place later.

320
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,200
 In the Gospels, all together,

321
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,800
 in all four Gospels all together,

322
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,200
 there were seven recorded miracles on Sabbath.

323
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,320
 And this is the last healing miracle on Sabbath

324
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,200
 in the writings of Luke, and there were two before it.

325
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,840
 But every single time when Jesus performed

326
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,720
 a healing miracle or any miracle on Sabbath,

327
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,000
 the result was always that some kind of tension

328
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,680
 and conflict would rise up between Him and the Pharisees.

329
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,680
 Because in the Pharisees' interpretation of the law,

330
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,640
 no work is to be done on Sabbath, like not at all.

331
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,520
 And performing miracle, healing someone,

332
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,400
 it's actually work.

333
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,840
 It's productivity, I guess.

334
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,960
 You get someone healed, hallelujah.

335
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:47,080
 But that means if Jesus heals someone on Sabbath,

336
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,880
 He's breaking the law.

337
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,200
 He's breaking the law of Moses.

338
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,520
 That makes Him a very terrible person,

339
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,640
 or at least according to their version

340
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,120
 or their interpretation of the law.

341
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,640
 And so now a leader of the Pharisees invited Jesus

342
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:07,520
 for a meal in his house, and they are watching Him.

343
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,040
 My eyes are on you.

344
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,880
 We're watching you.

345
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,760
 The immediate story tells us that there was a man

346
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,760
 that was ill with a disease called dropsy,

347
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,080
 some sort of swelling in the body.

348
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,720
 But this is interesting.

349
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,520
 Sick people, like we've always explained here,

350
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,160
 sick people in those days are considered,

351
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,880
 they're normally, they're probably sinners.

352
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,320
 And these Pharisees who wanna set apart from bad people,

353
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,480
 from sinful people, they try to stay away from them

354
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,760
 as much as possible.

355
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:45,640
 But in the house of a Pharisee leader,

356
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,600
 there is a sick person.

357
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,160
 There's a possibly sinner here.

358
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:55,240
 So I could only guess this is probably a setup

359
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,760
 'cause they're watching what Jesus is gonna do.

360
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,280
 This is totally a setup.

361
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,600
 But you know that every time you put a sick person

362
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,080
 with Jesus in the same room,

363
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,760
 there's only one thing that could happen.

364
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,000
 The sick person walks out being healed.

365
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,400
 I think we need more of that, amen?

366
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,440
 We need more, we need to put sick people

367
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,000
 in the same room with Jesus more so that they get healed

368
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,800
 so Jesus would perform His miracles.

369
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,640
 We need that.

370
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,040
 And so that's what happened.

371
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,720
 And then this is what's happened next.

372
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,160
 I'm gonna start from verse seven.

373
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,880
 So when Jesus noticed how the guests

374
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,800
 picked the places of honor at the table,

375
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,600
 He told them this parable.

376
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,120
 When someone invites you to a wedding feast,

377
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,880
 do not take the place of honor

378
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,880
 for a person more distinguished

379
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,040
 than you may have been invited.

380
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,680
 If so, the host who invited both of you

381
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,400
 will come and say to you, give this person your seat.

382
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,440
 Then humiliated, you will have to take

383
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,520
 the least important place.

384
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,520
 But when you are invited, take the lowest place

385
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,520
 so that when your host comes,

386
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,920
 he will say to you, friend, move up to a better place.

387
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,120
 Then you will be honored in the presence

388
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,680
 of all the other guests.

389
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,560
 For all those who exhort themselves will be humbled

390
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,880
 and those who humble themselves will be exhorted.

391
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,840
 Then Jesus said to His host,

392
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,160
 when you give a luncheon or dinner,

393
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,160
 do not invite your friends, your brothers or sisters,

394
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,360
 your relatives or your rich neighbors.

395
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,800
 If you do, they may invite you back

396
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,760
 and so you will be repaid.

397
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,760
 But when you give a banquet,

398
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,600
 invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind,

399
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,040
 and you will be blessed.

400
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,800
 Although they cannot repay you,

401
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:43,800
 you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.

402
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,240
 So first of all, when we look at this passage,

403
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,720
 who are these guests?

404
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,920
 Easy, those are the Pharisees, teachers,

405
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,880
 experts of the law who come all the way

406
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,760
 just to watch Jesus.

407
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,840
 And here Luke described Jesus noticed

408
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,080
 how they picked the places of honor,

409
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,840
 the front row seats, the head table at the banquet.

410
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,440
 To give you a little bit of context,

411
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,600
 in a Jewish feast those days,

412
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,040
 they adopted the Greco-Roman furniture called a triclinium.

413
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,960
 Oh, that's this table right here.

414
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,040
 It's a couch for three people

415
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,160
 and they will put different triclinia together

416
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:31,040
 and they will arrange it in a U shape.

417
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,840
 And what they do is the guests would recline on this table

418
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,040
 on their left elbow.

419
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,960
 They would all recline like this

420
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,720
 and they eat and they chat.

421
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,040
 That's how they spend the evening.

422
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,600
 I don't know how they can do that all night.

423
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,320
 If I do this for 50 minutes, I'll have a cramp.

424
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,760
 I don't know how to do that, but that's their culture.

425
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,120
 And the places of honor,

426
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,440
 it's here in the center of that table.

427
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,960
 And also those seats like right next to him,

428
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,520
 those on his left, on his right,

429
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,160
 who would either sit at his back

430
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,200
 or the other one who would be sitting there

431
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,120
 and leaning into his bosom.

432
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,600
 These are the places of honor.

433
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,120
 And Jesus was saying, hey, do not pick these.

434
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,720
 In today's culture, this would be the head table,

435
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,920
 the front row seat where you have a sign VIP there.

436
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,080
 So these people, they want to be VIPs.

437
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,360
 The Pharisees like to pick these places of honor.

438
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,880
 Jesus actually mentioned this in different locations

439
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,720
 in the Bible.

440
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,920
 If you flip through all the gospels,

441
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,920
 you would see Jesus commenting on this practice

442
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,280
 or this behavior that they like the VIP seats,

443
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,160
 they like to be VIP.

444
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,520
 And so Jesus, he decided to tell them something,

445
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,920
 to share a message with them.

446
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,560
 But what's interesting here is that this message,

447
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:52,280
 which appear, Jesus was just addressing that behavior,

448
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,240
 kind of like what Jesus was telling these Pharisees.

449
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,360
 It's just what's happening regarding the scene right there.

450
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,000
 And in fact, he didn't just comment

451
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,840
 on their behavior on the spot.

452
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,960
 He turned this whole scenario into a parable.

453
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,080
 He wanted to tell them something about the kingdom of God

454
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,480
 through this scenario.

455
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,760
 So Jesus, all these words, yes, it relate directly.

456
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,200
 It's relevant directly to what happened

457
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,400
 in that house of the Pharisee that night.

458
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,760
 But Jesus wanted to tell them something more than that.

459
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,640
 Jesus wanted to tell them something

460
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,640
 about the kingdom of God,

461
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,880
 because his conclusion in verse 11 is this,

462
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,920
 "For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled,

463
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,960
 "and all those who humble themselves will be exalted."

464
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:46,120
 These are the exact wordings found in another parable

465
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,920
 about the Pharisees' prayer

466
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,800
 and the tax collector's prayer in Luke 18.

467
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,440
 And Pastor John preached that to us several weeks ago.

468
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,800
 But why is this parable in the Pharisees' house?

469
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,000
 Why is it a parable about the kingdom of God?

470
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,760
 Why don't we take a closer look?

471
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,840
 It says, "The proud will be humbled,

472
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,960
 "and the humbled will be exalted."

473
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,560
 So in English, you know, grammar, this is passive tense.

474
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,480
 They will be humbled, they will be exalted.

475
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,600
 Now, the question is, who is going to exalt them?

476
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,960
 Who is going to humble them?

477
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,800
 And this is the kind of writing technique of the Jews.

478
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:29,480
 The scholars of the Bible actually call this grammar

479
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,240
 or this figure of speech, they call it the divine passive,

480
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,120
 meaning that they omitted the mentioning of God here

481
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,080
 as a form of respect.

482
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,720
 But Jesus was indeed pointing to the moment

483
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,560
 of the final judgment,

484
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:48,560
 when God himself will be there, sit in front of everyone.

485
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,840
 And all those who exalt themselves

486
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,520
 while they're in this life, God is going to humble them.

487
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,400
 Those who humble themselves in this life,

488
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,360
 God is going to exalt them, God is going to raise them up.

489
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,000
 This is God's doing, this is what he wants to do.

490
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,480
 It may appear here that Jesus was giving them

491
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,560
 a word of advice about the social life,

492
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:16,560
 but if we look closer, Jesus really wanted to communicate

493
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:21,680
 the ultimate reality that they and all of us here,

494
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,800
 it's going to face one day.

495
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,080
 And so church, get ready for that.

496
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,760
 Because how you choose to live in this life

497
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,360
 would affect how you spend eternity.

498
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,840
 You can try every day, try your very best

499
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,040
 to promote yourself, to gain status, to be powerful,

500
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,640
 to be famous, to look good in front of other people,

501
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:50,640
 trying to be somebody while you are in this life.

502
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,200
 And then you spend eternity as a nobody.

503
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:59,720
 Or you can live your life in a way

504
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,240
 that as though you are a nobody here

505
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,040
 in this part of the world, in this life.

506
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:09,080
 And the day when you stand before the King of Kings,

507
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,880
 the Lord of Lords, when you stand before his throne,

508
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,360
 he will tell you, my son, my friend,

509
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:20,920
 come, I have the place of honor for you.

510
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,080
 You are my VIP in my kingdom.

511
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:29,360
 Everybody will know you as somebody in eternity.

512
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,080
 It's our choice, it's up to us.

513
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,640
 He's asking us, what would you choose?

514
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,600
 How are you going to choose in your everyday life

515
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,720
 while you're on this side of eternity?

516
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,360
 And the most beautiful thing here is that we thought,

517
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,600
 yeah, Jesus is rebuking these Pharisees.

518
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,080
 Say, you know, you guys are so bad.

519
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,520
 But in fact, Jesus is giving them a choice,

520
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,640
 offering them a choice.

521
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,600
 Jesus is warning them, God would humble you one day

522
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,800
 if you don't humble yourself right now.

523
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,720
 But he also invites them into the humility,

524
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,600
 into humbling themselves, so one day,

525
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,840
 when they stand before the judgment of God,

526
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,560
 they will actually be exalted by God.

527
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,200
 Jesus is not here to condemn them right now.

528
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,120
 He's inviting them into that ultimate reality.

529
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,240
 I do want to exalt you, my friends,

530
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,720
 but first you do have to humble yourself in this life

531
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:34,240
 so that one day when I meet you in that final judgment,

532
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,520
 I can exalt you.

533
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:41,520
 And as Christians, I'm sure we've all heard

534
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,600
 about the virtue of humility,

535
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,640
 but this is the tricky part, church.

536
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,200
 I struggled with that myself as well in my life.

537
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:54,640
 If we spend the rest of our lives trying to be humble,

538
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,520
 trying to do or say all sorts of things to look humble,

539
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,640
 to sound humble, and at the end of the day,

540
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,520
 oh, we go home, we look at ourselves and say,

541
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,720
 oh, I'm such a humble person today.

542
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,200
 When I talk to Pastor Tim, oh, I was so humble just now.

543
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,360
 Oh, when I talk to my friend, oh, I'm such a nice guy.

544
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,520
 I finally achieved humility.

545
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,160
 Oh, so good, right?

546
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:31,160
 That's the voice of pride speaking, right?

547
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:36,680
 And so let me do read you a paragraph from C.S. Lewis.

548
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,080
 He says this.

549
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,160
 Do not imagine that if you meet a really humble man,

550
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,520
 he will be what most people call humble nowadays.

551
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,880
 He will not be sort of greasy, you know, swarmy person

552
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,440
 who is always telling you that, of course, he's nobody.

553
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,000
 He's not gonna say that to you.

554
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,040
 Probably all you will think about him

555
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,800
 is that he seemed a cheerful, intelligent chap

556
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,840
 who took a real interest in what you said to him.

557
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,600
 If you do dislike him,

558
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:08,000
 it will be because you feel a little bit envious of anyone

559
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,840
 who seems to enjoy life so easily.

560
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,960
 He will not be thinking about humility.

561
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,560
 Well, in fact, he will not be thinking about himself at all.

562
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,480
 Okay, if anyone, if you need to take picture, do it now.

563
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,480
 I'm gonna move on.

564
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,160
 And there's another pastor, Pastor Rick Warren.

565
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,040
 He said something quite similar,

566
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,640
 which is complimentary to what I read just now.

567
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:38,200
 He said, "Humility is not thinking less of yourself.

568
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,520
 "It is thinking of yourself less.

569
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,400
 "Humility is thinking more of others.

570
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,280
 "Humble people are so focused on serving others,

571
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:51,440
 "they don't think of themselves."

572
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:56,360
 And so you see, here's the problem with the Pharisees.

573
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,240
 Yes, they've been trying to obey the law.

574
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,800
 They've been trying to fulfill all these requirements,

575
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,320
 but their focus was still on themselves.

576
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,040
 They thought about themselves too much.

577
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,400
 If we focus solely on ourselves,

578
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,640
 our pursuit of righteousness

579
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:18,640
 will eventually turn into self-righteousness.

580
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,080
 Let me say that again.

581
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,520
 If we focus solely on ourselves,

582
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,320
 our pursuit of righteousness

583
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,360
 will inevitably lead to self-righteousness.

584
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,200
 I don't know what motivates us to read the Bible,

585
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,960
 to come to church on a Sunday,

586
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,720
 to sing those worship songs,

587
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,960
 to behave like a Christian every day.

588
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,800
 But if we are doing that for ourselves,

589
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,480
 if we're trying to make ourselves feel better,

590
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,960
 that I'm a Christian, so I'm better than,

591
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,640
 oh, that person sitting next to me at work,

592
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,480
 he's not a Christian.

593
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,080
 You know, he has all these bad habits in life.

594
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,960
 I'm a better man than him, and I'm sorry.

595
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,720
 Our pursuit of righteousness

596
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,000
 will just turn us into another self-righteous person.

597
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 So Jesus actually offered the antidote to pride

598
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,120
 in the following.

599
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,520
 In the next story, he reads that

600
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,000
 when you give a luncheon or dinner,

601
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,040
 do not invite your friends, your brothers or sisters,

602
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,960
 your relatives, your rich neighbors.

603
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,440
 If you do, they may invite you back

604
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,960
 so you will be repaid.

605
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,680
 But when you give a banquet,

606
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,600
 invite the poor, the cripple, the lame, the blind,

607
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,080
 and you will be blessed.

608
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,840
 Although they cannot repay you,

609
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,840
 but you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.

610
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:41,960
 So we gotta think about others, those around us.

611
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:47,040
 If you can give without expecting anything in return,

612
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:51,560
 not even how much praise you will receive because of that.

613
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,880
 If I'm buying someone dinner,

614
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,240
 and I'm expecting that person to go around,

615
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,560
 "Oh, you know, Chapman bought me dinner last night.

616
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,120
 "He's just such a nice person."

617
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,200
 That's what you're getting in return.

618
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,240
 That doesn't count if you do it for nothing in return,

619
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:11,440
 and you just focus on meeting the needs of others around you,

620
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,720
 serving them wholeheartedly.

621
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,360
 That's humility in God's eyes.

622
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,400
 I remember a couple of years ago,

623
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:25,120
 before we have this church here in Yuen Long,

624
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,560
 me, Pastor Ivan, Pastor Tim,

625
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,520
 we were all part of the Wan Chai pastoral staff.

626
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,160
 And so we work in Wan Chai every Sunday.

627
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:37,320
 I remember there was this particular service one Sunday.

628
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,480
 Halfway through the service,

629
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,920
 the preacher has already been preaching,

630
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,680
 speaking on the stage.

631
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,480
 And there was a person walking through the door,

632
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:50,080
 slowly moving towards the front of the stage,

633
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,440
 to the front row.

634
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,560
 And I can assure you, most of the time in Wan Chai,

635
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,560
 well, like our English services,

636
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,280
 the whole church is just very packed.

637
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,840
 There's no seat at all,

638
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,760
 but he was walking on the front row.

639
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,600
 And later I found out he might have

640
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,640
 a little bit of special needs.

641
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,920
 And as the staff on the roster,

642
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:13,200
 when I saw that, my first response is,

643
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,360
 oh my gosh, he's disturbing the service.

644
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,480
 I gotta do something.

645
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,000
 Maybe I should bring him somewhere else.

646
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,760
 Maybe I should put him to the back.

647
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,080
 I was running all these different scenarios.

648
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,160
 How should I react?

649
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:26,840
 But luckily, or unluckily, I was actually on the balcony.

650
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,080
 I was so far away from that.

651
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,240
 So I was just mentally, what should I do?

652
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,920
 What would I do if I'm down there in the lower house?

653
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,720
 While I was still thinking about all these,

654
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,360
 that day, Pastor John, our founding pastor,

655
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,040
 he was actually there in the service.

656
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,960
 And he was sitting in the front seat,

657
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,560
 right in the middle on the first row.

658
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,320
 So the next moment, what I saw was,

659
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,200
 as the guy was walking alongside,

660
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,600
 I saw that John actually stood up,

661
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,400
 gently escorting that man to his seat.

662
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,320
 And he quietly walked towards the back

663
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,880
 for the rest of the service.

664
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,880
 And I was watching on the balcony.

665
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,640
 I was telling myself, he is the founding pastor.

666
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,480
 If there's one man who deserves to remain in his seat,

667
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,800
 that would be John.

668
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,920
 And he taught me a lesson that day.

669
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:23,520
 I look at John, I saw what he did.

670
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,040
 And I was telling myself,

671
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:30,440
 man, I hope one day when I am his age,

672
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,240
 I could do the same.

673
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,160
 That my heart is not filled with entitlement.

674
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,000
 Well, I'm somebody, somebody,

675
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,640
 that somebody else should move away from their seats.

676
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,840
 I should be here.

677
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,600
 Somebody should be giving me their seats,

678
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,920
 not the other way around.

679
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,560
 I hope one day when I reach there,

680
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,880
 I could still do that.

681
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:56,760
 I think sometimes we do feel we're entitled to some things

682
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,360
 because of how much effort we put into

683
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,760
 something of our expertise,

684
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,200
 how good or how much good we've done.

685
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,440
 And we thought we're entitled to something.

686
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,640
 Humility is not thinking less of yourself,

687
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,560
 not thinking, oh, I don't deserve to be seated here.

688
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,680
 It's not like that.

689
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,200
 Humility is not thinking less of yourself.

690
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,960
 Humility is simply thinking of yourself less.

691
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,520
 Think about others.

692
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:28,360
 I'm wondering today, if you have a seat,

693
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,600
 who can you give that seat to?

694
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:34,520
 Who would you give up that seat for?

695
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,640
 Is it only someone whom you think

696
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,960
 is more superior than you,

697
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,000
 have a high status than you,

698
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,480
 have a better reputation than you,

699
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,680
 older than you, look better than you?

700
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:52,040
 Or you're just gonna give it to someone who is in need?

701
00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:00,520
 What do we want to be known for as a church in our city?

702
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:05,000
 The Pharisee loves places of honor at feasts

703
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,880
 and best seats in the synagogue.

704
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,040
 How about us?

705
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:14,600
 Do we or can we do the opposite

706
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,920
 by giving the seats to other people,

707
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,920
 the best seats to different people?

708
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:24,720
 Can we act in a way that communicates to those around us

709
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,320
 that we think they are more important?

710
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,400
 Can we ask God to bring us to a place

711
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,560
 where we think of ourselves less

712
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,080
 and think of others more?

713
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:42,560
 That's my prayer for myself.

714
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,040
 That's my prayer for my church family.

715
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,640
 I do think that there is a gap

716
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,640
 between what our faith stands for

717
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:54,480
 and what we're known for in the city right now.

718
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,640
 I do think that gap exists.

719
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:01,640
 My prayer, my desire is to see that the church

720
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,640
 will have a better reputation here.

721
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:10,800
 But as the evangelist Moody, he says this,

722
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,120
 "If I take care of my character,

723
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:17,480
 "my reputation will take care of itself."

724
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:21,360
 I do think we need to close that gap,

725
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,120
 but that gap is not reputation.

726
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,680
 That gap indeed is character.

727
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:32,120
 What our faith stands for

728
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:36,080
 and how we behave what we're known for,

729
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,720
 can we close that gap?

730
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,360
 And don't do it by our own power

731
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,400
 and don't come one day,

732
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,320
 oh, I finally closed that gap, I've done it.

733
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:50,560
 Let's just think of ourself less.

734
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,040
 Let's think of those around us,

735
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,120
 those in the city more in our everyday life.

736
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:03,080
 I care deeply about the reputation of our church

737
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:09,400
 and the church in our city, in our world.

738
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,400
 And we don't need better marketing.

739
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,040
 We don't need better branding.

740
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:17,000
 We just need to work on our character.

741
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,240
 And I need to work on my character.

742
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,880
 (smooches)

743
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,280
 And I believe as we start to do that,

744
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,000
 as we invite the Holy Spirit into our hearts,

745
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,800
 as we work on our character,

746
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:36,800
 I believe our reputation will start to work on itself.

747
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,480
 My dream is that somewhere in the future,

748
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,240
 maybe in the next generation,

749
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,440
 when my daughters get to go into movies,

750
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:48,600
 when their portrayal of Christian characters in those movie,

751
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:52,200
 those characters are not known for being legalistic

752
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,280
 or self-righteous or hypocritic.

753
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:00,720
 They'll be known for how they long to sacrifice

754
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,800
 for other people.

755
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,200
 They'll be known for their service for other people.

756
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,880
 I long for the day that this is how the world will see

757
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,200
 what they will see in us.

758
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,640
 And this, we cannot control how other people

759
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,600
 see us right now.

760
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,640
 We cannot control how they perceive us because of the past,

761
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,200
 but we can start today.

762
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,680
 We can decide how they will see us tomorrow.

763
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,840
 And I think as we draw close to a parable series,

764
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,000
 as God is calling us into his kingdom,

765
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 understanding what it means,

766
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,440
 my prayer is that by understanding the parable of Jesus,

767
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,640
 by understanding his heart a little bit more,

768
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,520
 by understanding how he wants to run his kingdom,

769
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,600
 we will start to manifest that kingdom

770
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,080
 in Yuen Long and in our city.

771
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,120
 If you wanna be part of that,

772
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,920
 can I invite you to stand and pray?

773
00:37:52,920 --> 00:38:13,680
 Holy Spirit, I thank you.

774
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,240
 You always come and pour out God's love into our hearts,

775
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:22,240
 come and heal our wounds, come and embrace us,

776
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,240
 come and draw near to us so that we could feel secure,

777
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,240
 we could feel loved.

778
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,560
 I thank you for that.

779
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:33,920
 But Jesus also mentioned that you would come into our hearts

780
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,600
 and point us into the word of God.

781
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,840
 You would bring us into truth

782
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:42,040
 and you would transform our character

783
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,560
 so that we look more like Jesus.

784
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,760
 And that's what I'm praying for right now, Holy Spirit.

785
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,480
 Come, come and fill us.

786
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:57,000
 Come and fill the body of Jesus in this room right now.

787
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:07,560
 God, I don't pray that we, by our effort,

788
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:10,000
 we would close that gap between our reputation

789
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,120
 and what our faith actually stands for.

790
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,400
 But I do pray that we can close that gap

791
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:21,480
 between your word and the reality

792
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,520
 of our heart and our character right now.

793
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:27,600
 I pray that you would come and close that gap,

794
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,120
 that you would come and grow us.

795
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:32,400
 We pray that we would be a community

796
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,680
 that really grow big people,

797
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,520
 people who demonstrate the character of Jesus,

798
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,960
 who shows the mercy, who shows the love,

799
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,560
 who shows the servant heart of Jesus in our city.

800
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:53,000
 I pray that if there are strongholds in our hearts,

801
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,520
 if there are things that are hindering us

802
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,000
 from moving in that direction,

803
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,440
 I pray that by the power of resurrection right now,

804
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:04,360
 you would come and destroy those strongholds in our life

805
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:08,400
 and you will take every thought of us captive right now.

806
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,080
 I pray that we could align our hearts

807
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,480
 with yours today once again, Lord.

808
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,760
 Come and fill us.

809
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,760
 Come and fill us up, Lord.

810
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,720
 We need your grace.

811
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,120
 We need your mercy.

812
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,600
 We need your encouragement.

813
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:34,200
 We need you to come and be that fire inside of us.

814
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,440
 Keep burning inside of us.

815
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,560
 Until our hearts fully burn for Jesus

816
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,240
 and we only live for him.

817
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,120
 So come, Lord.

818
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,680
 So come, Lord.

819
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,520
 (water trickling)

820
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,100
 (gentle music)
