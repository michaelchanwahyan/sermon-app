1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
 Thank you church, thank you worship team.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,480
 That was a beautiful time of singing

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,740
 and worshiping together.

4
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,600
 You may have a seat as you sit down.

5
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,280
 There might be someone new next to you so you can say hi.

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,400
 If you have some seats free next to you as well,

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,680
 just hold up your hand, let our host know

8
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,740
 so that we still have some people that are standing by

9
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:18,680
 wanting to get a seat.

10
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,680
 So if there's a seat free next to you,

11
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,980
 you can hold up your hand.

12
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,740
 Our host will come and fill up as many people

13
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,880
 as we can in this room.

14
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,360
 If you're in the overflow, a big welcome to you.

15
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,480
 Thank you for being here with us.

16
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,280
 And if you're joining us online,

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,640
 a very good morning from Hong Kong.

18
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,680
 Wherever you're joining us from, welcome as well.

19
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,080
 So we've kicked off this sermon series

20
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,280
 that we've called Uncharted.

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,080
 And actually I figured something out.

22
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,240
 It's actually quite a good way to get away with stuff

23
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,440
 in the office these days, right?

24
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,480
 So for example, if you do something like,

25
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,600
 you know, go for a three hour lunch and you come back

26
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,960
 and Carla's like, where have you been?

27
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,120
 It's like, oh, on a lunch, it was three hours.

28
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,680
 Well, it's Uncharted, right?

29
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,720
 I mean, we've never taken three hour lunches before,

30
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,440
 but now it's the way we're gonna do things.

31
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,100
 And so, just being cheeky, but you know,

32
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,960
 I figured it could be like a get out of jail free card

33
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,000
 sometimes as well.

34
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,120
 But we are, we're in this new sermon series

35
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,800
 we've called Uncharted where we feel like God in this year

36
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,960
 has challenged us with a vision to go places

37
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,440
 we've never gone before, right?

38
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,400
 No strategy, no knowledge, no necessarily any plans

39
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,200
 or steps that we are intending to take,

40
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,680
 but just be wide open in going where God

41
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,680
 is leading us to go.

42
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,720
 But a lot of that has to do,

43
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,400
 starts with the way we think, right?

44
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,180
 We have to be thinking, right?

45
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,180
 We have to be thinking as God is thinking

46
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,520
 in order for go and do where he's called us to do

47
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,280
 and go where he's called us to go.

48
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,400
 And our thoughts are with us all the time.

49
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,560
 You know, growing up, there's certain things

50
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,160
 I've realized now that have been so ingrained,

51
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:59,160
 like incepted into my mind that as I grew up as an adult,

52
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,600
 you know, as you live life, you realize actually

53
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,480
 has a bigger impact on you than you first realize.

54
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,920
 Right, some of these are funny and nonsensical, right?

55
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,760
 And you probably have heard some of these things.

56
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,260
 For example, my mom and my grandma always told me

57
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,000
 that if you sleep with the fan on blowing in your face,

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,860
 right, you will suffocate and die, okay?

59
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,520
 I'm sure I'm not the only one that's been

60
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,560
 grown up with that thought, right?

61
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,120
 If you don't sleep with the fan on,

62
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,600
 it's gonna blow against your nose

63
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,480
 and then the air, something happens, right?

64
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,360
 And then you will die in your sleep, okay?

65
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,600
 Another way, okay, another thing that my parents

66
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,640
 often told me was if you don't finish

67
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,640
 every single grain of rice in your bowl, okay,

68
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,440
 that's gonna be a mark on your future wife's face, okay?

69
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,680
 Now my wife is sitting here right now,

70
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,800
 you can see no marks on her face, very pretty, okay?

71
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,720
 But, right, so I would eat all my rice, right?

72
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,280
 (speaking in foreign language)

73
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,800
 So like you have to eat every single grain of rice, okay?

74
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,760
 And otherwise, you're gonna end up with,

75
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,160
 you know, a scarred-faced woman.

76
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,160
 So, growing up, I was always very hot and very full, okay?

77
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,200
 Now I'm addicted to rice these days.

78
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,280
 You can ask my friends, like,

79
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,760
 if there's rice, I will always eat it.

80
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,720
 Right, so there were some funny ways, okay?

81
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,920
 But some of these other thoughts

82
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,560
 that I feel like were imprinted into my mind

83
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,640
 were slightly more damaging, right?

84
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,640
 For example, I developed a huge fear of making mistakes,

85
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,120
 right, because making mistakes

86
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,400
 often led to harsh punishment from my mom.

87
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,040
 And so instead of admitting to mistakes,

88
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,200
 I would hide, I would lie to cover things up.

89
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,040
 But of course, as you know, the more you hide,

90
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,480
 the more you lie, the bigger trouble I would get in

91
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,520
 in the end, and the more punished I would be, right?

92
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,040
 And I realized this started to affect

93
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,240
 the way I express myself, right?

94
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,920
 I began to believe that, you know,

95
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,640
 actually, I can't make any mistakes at all,

96
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,680
 so I have to keep everything hidden inside, right?

97
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,600
 I might feel this way, but I'm not gonna say it, right?

98
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,680
 'Cause I might be wrong, and if I'm wrong,

99
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,760
 then I'm gonna be punished.

100
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,440
 Now I used to think everybody thought like this.

101
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,320
 This was just a normal way to function in life, right?

102
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,640
 Until after I got married, I realized,

103
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,280
 actually, I should say it was pointed out to me, okay,

104
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,040
 that this pattern of thought was deeply affecting me, right?

105
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,560
 Because 100% it affected the way I was communicating

106
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,560
 with Brittany and the quality of our marriage.

107
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,840
 Now I will also say this, right?

108
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,080
 I love my mom deeply, and over the years,

109
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,960
 she and I have had some, started to have some

110
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,160
 really beautiful but hard conversations

111
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,440
 about the way she raised me, right?

112
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,800
 These healing and forgiving sort of conversations

113
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,200
 about my childhood and her childhood,

114
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,960
 and as we talked, I began to realize

115
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,000
 that the reason why fear was such a big part

116
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,160
 of my upbringing was because she was also raised

117
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,000
 in an environment where fear was even more,

118
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,920
 you know, deeply saturated into a background

119
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,880
 and punishment from my grandparents to her and her siblings.

120
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,600
 And so through a little bit of counseling

121
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,160
 to try and help me out, right,

122
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,400
 Brittany and I, I tried to express myself

123
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,320
 as best as I can these days.

124
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,880
 I tried to be intentional, not to let my own

125
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,280
 negative experiences now also shape the way

126
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,000
 I parent my two boys.

127
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,640
 But what I've come to realize is that

128
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,920
 for things to really change, I really have to go back

129
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,880
 to the source, right, and change the way I think.

130
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,600
 Right, I have to tell myself, remind myself

131
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,120
 literally these days that it's okay to make mistakes,

132
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,560
 right, no one's gonna come at me with a feather duster

133
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,600
 for the bad thing that I did, all right?

134
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,840
 Now, this is just a personal example,

135
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,120
 but the point I'm trying to make is this, right?

136
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,400
 It's not very hard to see that our thinking patterns

137
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,800
 have a significant effect on our beliefs

138
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,560
 and how we live our life and our behaviors,

139
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,360
 right, which is why with this vision

140
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,000
 that the Lord has given us to embrace the uncharted,

141
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,520
 to go forth into territory that we've never been before,

142
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,880
 we have to be open-minded.

143
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,440
 And if God wants to change the way we think,

144
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,400
 we have to let the Holy Spirit challenge us

145
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,880
 in our beliefs and challenge us in our behaviors

146
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,360
 and challenge us in our traditions

147
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,280
 to go where God wants us to go, right?

148
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,680
 We sang this just now, shake up the ground

149
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,840
 of my traditions, bring down the walls of my religion.

150
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,520
 Now, again, don't get me wrong, right?

151
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,400
 I'm not saying all religions and traditions are bad, right?

152
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,000
 There are lots of tenets of truth and traditions

153
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,120
 that play an important role in our faith, right?

154
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,280
 There's certain tenets and pillars of the Christian faith

155
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,320
 that I would say are definitely true

156
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,240
 and unshakeable and unmovable,

157
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,560
 and anyone who tells you anything else, it's a liar, right?

158
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,880
 For example, Jesus is the only way,

159
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,480
 the truth and the life, right?

160
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,280
 That cannot be changed, okay?

161
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,240
 That there is one God who exists as the Father and Son

162
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,640
 of the Holy Spirit, right?

163
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,800
 You will never change, that is just a fact, okay?

164
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,200
 That Jesus was born of a virgin, lived a sinless life,

165
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,000
 died on the cross as a perfect sacrifice for our sins,

166
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,640
 was resurrected on the third day,

167
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,560
 and sits enthroned in heaven.

168
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,640
 He's coming back to restore his creation

169
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,480
 and judge the living and the dead, okay?

170
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,400
 That is a fact that you can never change.

171
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,720
 We have God's word, these 66 books

172
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,960
 that God has given us as holy scripture.

173
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,040
 The words of this book will never change.

174
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,120
 No one can ever add or take away from this book.

175
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,520
 We have beautiful traditions like communion,

176
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,440
 which we celebrate every month, right?

177
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,480
 Some churches celebrate even more, right?

178
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,280
 It's a reminder of God's love and sacrifice

179
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,680
 and his presence with us.

180
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,640
 We have baptism, where we publicly display

181
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,640
 our faith in Jesus.

182
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,040
 These are some traditions and things,

183
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,320
 part of our faith, that are unshakable, unmovable.

184
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:46,440
 On the other hand, though, we have to be careful

185
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,640
 not to let other things bind us so much

186
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,400
 that the new and fresh things that God wants us to do

187
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,640
 are hindered by these barriers that we put up in our lives.

188
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,600
 And unless we're willing to embrace God's way of thinking,

189
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,160
 we will never be like I've been saying,

190
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,840
 go where God is leading us to go

191
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,000
 and do what he's asking us to do.

192
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,120
 So the question we have to ask ourselves today

193
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,560
 is this, church.

194
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,520
 Are we open to changing our thinking?

195
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,040
 Are we open to changing our traditions

196
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,600
 whenever God challenges them?

197
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,560
 Now, this is a huge challenge,

198
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,480
 because most of us are comfortable with the way we think.

199
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,520
 Most of all, are comfortable with,

200
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,760
 we think we're right all the time.

201
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,200
 For example, after I got married,

202
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,480
 did you realize that there is a correct way?

203
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,600
 I didn't think there was a correct way

204
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,640
 to put milk in the fridge, but apparently there is.

205
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,520
 I didn't think there was a correct way to fold towels

206
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,160
 that stack up in the bathroom a certain way,

207
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,240
 but there is, guys.

208
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,240
 But we develop these mindsets, right?

209
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,400
 We get so ingrained in these traditions,

210
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,520
 we get rooted into habits, we become stubborn,

211
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,960
 and that becomes hard to change.

212
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,120
 Especially, maybe some of these things

213
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,920
 have offered us comfort and guidance in the past.

214
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,760
 We wanna hold onto them so that we feel protected

215
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,160
 as we go into the future.

216
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,120
 But we've been saying, as we go into the future,

217
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,000
 we don't know what's going on.

218
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,320
 We don't know where God is leading us to go.

219
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,480
 So if we hold onto those things,

220
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,360
 we don't know if they're actually gonna be useful or not.

221
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:25,000
 Today, we're looking at a passage in scripture.

222
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,480
 And through looking at this story,

223
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,000
 I hope we can see that God,

224
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,440
 we realize that God is a God who's not afraid

225
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,040
 to challenge the way we think,

226
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,560
 to help us to break free from the things that hold us back,

227
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,680
 even if some of those things

228
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,240
 might have been good at one stage.

229
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,240
 If it's not fit for purpose now,

230
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,040
 God is challenging us to change the way we think

231
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,560
 so we can be the people he's called us to be.

232
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,200
 So let's open up God's word.

233
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,840
 You can listen to me, or you can read on the screen,

234
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,240
 or if you have your Bible, open that up.

235
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,040
 Acts chapter 10 is where we're gonna be.

236
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,880
 At Caesarea, there was a man named Cornelius,

237
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,560
 a centurion in what was known as the Italian Regiment.

238
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,640
 He and all his family were devout and God-fearing.

239
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,720
 He gave generously to those in need

240
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,440
 and prayed to God regularly.

241
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,560
 One day, at about three in the afternoon, he had a vision.

242
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,960
 He distinctly saw an angel of God who came to him

243
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,720
 and said, "Cornelius!"

244
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,660
 Cornelius stared at him in fear.

245
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,740
 "What is it, Lord?" he asked.

246
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,800
 The angel answered, "Your prayers and gifts to the poor

247
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,960
 "have come up as a memorial offering before God.

248
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,860
 "Now send men to Joppa to bring back a man named Simon

249
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,420
 "who is called Peter.

250
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,500
 "He is staying with Simon the Tanner

251
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,920
 "whose house is by the sea."

252
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,280
 Now right away, I think what Luke's trying to do

253
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,920
 is get us to shift and change.

254
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,800
 He's challenging us to look at certain things

255
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,420
 with a different perspective.

256
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,240
 Let me explain what I mean.

257
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,440
 At this time, Israel was still under Roman rule

258
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,960
 and authority.

259
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,600
 One of the things that Romans were most proud of,

260
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,280
 they were ruling over Israel at the time,

261
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,920
 they were the main authority,

262
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,980
 and one of the things that they were most proud of

263
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:13,480
 was their strong military power, their army.

264
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,500
 Now Cornelius was a big part of that army,

265
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,880
 a centurion in a very important city.

266
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,200
 So as a man, as a centurion in a place like Caesarea

267
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,000
 with an important port city,

268
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,280
 he had a good amount of influence,

269
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,920
 a powerful leader, and centurion means he had 100 soldiers

270
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,960
 under his control.

271
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,660
 And so we would expect him to fit the stereotypes

272
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,600
 of a Roman officer.

273
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,520
 And what were those?

274
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:43,040
 Well, they were known as being brutish and cruel,

275
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,440
 people who wouldn't hesitate to throw you in prison

276
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,720
 at the drop of a hat, to have you tortured,

277
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,080
 or even to have you killed if they didn't like

278
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,240
 the way you were doing something.

279
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,780
 As Romans, they would have worshipped pagan gods,

280
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,100
 other gods, not Yahweh, but their own gods

281
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,800
 and their own religion.

282
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,120
 So that would be the way that people would think about

283
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,000
 a Roman soldier or a centurion,

284
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,960
 someone in authority who is part of the Roman Empire.

285
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:12,440
 But this isn't what Cornelius is like at all.

286
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,280
 Instead, we are told that he is a God-fearing man,

287
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,880
 devout, he's generous to the poor,

288
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,560
 and very strikingly, they say he is a man of prayer.

289
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,240
 He prays to God.

290
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,020
 So what Luke is trying to do through this story

291
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,940
 is to help us open our eyes

292
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,460
 and open up our thinking a little bit.

293
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,500
 Because it would be easy to have written Cornelius off

294
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,100
 and say to ourselves, there is no way a man could ever use,

295
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,580
 a God could ever use a man like that.

296
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:44,300
 A Roman soldier, an idol worshipper,

297
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,540
 he's cruel, he's unsympathetic.

298
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,500
 But what God is trying to say,

299
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,100
 I can use anybody I choose to use.

300
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,180
 One thing to remember is this,

301
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:57,360
 we are not told how Cornelius actually came

302
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,080
 to know who God was, and to be so generous,

303
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,920
 to be so devoted to prayer.

304
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,800
 I don't think it would be too much of a reach, though,

305
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,340
 to sort of think that actually,

306
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,600
 Cornelius, too, had to go through a process

307
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,540
 of changing his mind.

308
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,640
 Knowing his background, knowing the way he was raised,

309
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,080
 he was probably raised in a home

310
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,740
 that did not worship God, that was cruel, that was brutish,

311
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:23,280
 embracing all those stereotypes that he grew up with.

312
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,260
 At some point, he had to change his mind,

313
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,860
 saying, I'm not gonna be like that,

314
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:30,020
 I'm not gonna be cruel, I'm not gonna be mean to people,

315
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,340
 actually, I'm gonna be generous, I'm gonna pray to God.

316
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:36,140
 He had a fundamental shift in the way he thought

317
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,900
 and in his beliefs.

318
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:42,460
 He had to make the big decision of pledging himself,

319
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,500
 not to Caesar, right, that's how the Romans were prayed to,

320
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,300
 pray to Caesar, but to pray to Yahweh instead.

321
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,120
 You see, what God was doing,

322
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,000
 God had amazing plans for Cornelius.

323
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,640
 There was something he was trying to do through Cornelius,

324
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,560
 but first, he had to challenge Cornelius

325
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,480
 in his way of thinking.

326
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,320
 Now, as I was reading this,

327
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,600
 I felt like this was a word in season for us,

328
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,920
 in the way we look at our leaders here in Hong Kong.

329
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,920
 Hear me out.

330
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,520
 Over the past few years, it's no secret

331
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,700
 that we have struggled at times.

332
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,300
 There's been a struggle between the city's leaders

333
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,300
 and the citizens.

334
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,020
 And perhaps certain decisions that have been made,

335
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:32,780
 it's easy to look at those in governing powers over us,

336
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,300
 to look at authority figures

337
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,020
 and think of them negatively, straight away,

338
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,860
 believing that they're all unkind,

339
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,940
 that they do not care about their citizens,

340
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,780
 that they're their own agenda in mind.

341
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,620
 But actually, I would say

342
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,900
 this is probably not just a Hong Kong problem,

343
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,940
 but all over the world, it's easy for us now

344
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,580
 to look at our earthly authority figures,

345
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,500
 people in government, people in authority over us,

346
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,140
 through a lens of disdain,

347
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,820
 much like a first-century Jew

348
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,660
 might have looked at a Roman soldier, an officer,

349
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:08,180
 seeing them as cruel, barbaric, and unsympathetic.

350
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,780
 And because we think these things about them,

351
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,580
 we feel like we can't trust them,

352
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:15,220
 and we feel like we don't want to follow them.

353
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,460
 We think they're cruel and unkind.

354
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,900
 We don't want anything to do with them.

355
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,780
 But I felt like when I was reading this,

356
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,140
 God was challenging us to shift our perspective,

357
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:30,140
 especially to those who govern over us.

358
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,540
 Because what if, and not even what if,

359
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,300
 I believe, actually, that God is calling us

360
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:39,300
 to truly pray for those in authority over us.

361
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,140
 And for some of us,

362
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,580
 this is gonna take a big shift in our thinking,

363
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,740
 and a big shift in the way we believe things.

364
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:50,980
 But I think this, because as we pray for our leaders,

365
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,380
 as God has commanded us to do in Scripture,

366
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,580
 perhaps God is also, at the same time,

367
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,620
 doing the work of raising up leaders,

368
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,020
 people in authority, authority figures,

369
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,460
 changing their hearts, changing their minds,

370
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,140
 like he might have done with Cornelius,

371
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:07,100
 who will then go on to live, to govern,

372
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,500
 to serve society in the way

373
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,860
 that God has called them to serve.

374
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,940
 And then we'll start to see the change

375
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,460
 that we've been all hoping to see.

376
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,220
 You see what I'm trying to say?

377
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,060
 So church, are we willing

378
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:24,460
 to change the way we think about leaders

379
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,860
 and those in authority over us?

380
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,460
 Are we willing to think and break out of those peoples

381
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,340
 that we've stereotyped as certain things,

382
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,780
 so that we can join in with God

383
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,140
 and want the best for their lives, and pray for them,

384
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:41,220
 and as God changes and moves people

385
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,900
 in ways that we don't even understand how,

386
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,740
 we get to partner with God in shaping

387
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,060
 and providing hope for this world.

388
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:53,300
 So with this new way of thinking,

389
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,340
 Cornelius, like we say, he suddenly and immediately,

390
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:59,100
 Cornelius suddenly receives a message from God,

391
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,420
 and immediately, he responds obediently

392
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,620
 to this mysterious message.

393
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:09,340
 Go to Joppa, find Peter, bring him back to me.

394
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:12,140
 And Cornelius responds immediately in obedience.

395
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,340
 It says this, "Cornelius called two of his servants

396
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:17,300
 "and a devout soldier who was one of his attendants."

397
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,900
 So three dudes, he says, he told them everything

398
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,460
 that happened and sent them to Joppa.

399
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,420
 Now at this moment, you have to realize,

400
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,500
 Cornelius has no clue what was going on.

401
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,540
 He's received a vision, an angel has come to talk to him.

402
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:36,340
 He's wondering, what is this all about?

403
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,940
 Who is this Simon Peter guy?

404
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,380
 Why is he at Simon the Tender's house?

405
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:44,140
 Why is the name Simon so popular in this area?

406
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:47,020
 Why does God want him to bring me back here?

407
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,980
 There's no answers yet,

408
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:53,820
 but what we can see is faith and obedience.

409
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,660
 And as God shifts our thinking,

410
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,500
 we also have to ask ourselves these questions.

411
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,820
 Once he does that, are we willing to be obedient

412
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,740
 even when things aren't clear for us?

413
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:08,500
 Are we willing to do what God calls us to do

414
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,060
 even when we haven't seen the whole picture yet?

415
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,980
 Andrew talked a bit about this last week,

416
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,500
 but obedience is easy when we understand.

417
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:23,060
 True obedience though, is when we don't see it all,

418
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,340
 yet we are still willing to do it anyway.

419
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:30,380
 This is what it means to take a risk,

420
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:34,700
 to not rely on a strategy, to have total surrender to God,

421
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,580
 but it has to start with the way we think,

422
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:40,460
 because most of us like a plan of action,

423
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,940
 even myself, right, most of the time I'm flying

424
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:46,140
 by the seats of my pants, right, whatever you say,

425
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,980
 but, okay, even for myself,

426
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:52,340
 at least some guardrails are comforting sometimes.

427
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:56,620
 But are we willing, right, to break of our comfort zones

428
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:59,060
 of knowing every single step

429
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:02,860
 and to simply let God lead the way and have his way?

430
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,780
 And when we do this, church,

431
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:10,700
 we see amazing things begin to happen.

432
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,100
 Okay, check it out, this is what happens next.

433
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,540
 About noon the following day,

434
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,580
 they were on their journey and approaching the city.

435
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,780
 Peter went up on the roof to pray.

436
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,100
 He became hungry and wanted something to eat,

437
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,860
 and while the meal was still being prepared,

438
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,460
 he fell into a trance.

439
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,220
 He saw heaven opened and something like a large sheep

440
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:31,340
 being let down to earth by its four corners.

441
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,940
 It contained all kinds of four-footed animals

442
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,900
 as well as reptiles and birds.

443
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:41,980
 And a voice told him, "Get up, Peter, kill and eat."

444
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,860
 "Surely not, Lord," Peter replied.

445
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:49,500
 "I have never eaten anything impure or unclean."

446
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,000
 The voice spoke to him a second time,

447
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,340
 "Do not call anything impure that God has made clean."

448
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,460
 This happened three times,

449
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,180
 and immediately the sheep was taken back to heaven.

450
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,540
 So the story is beginning to emerge.

451
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:08,060
 Now it's Peter's turn to have a supernatural encounter,

452
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,380
 to have a vision from heaven.

453
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,220
 And in his vision, we see something like a sheet

454
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,380
 that's filled with all kinds of animals,

455
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:20,340
 and he's commanded to get up, kill, and eat.

456
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:25,220
 Now, in our Chinese context, this sounds like a jackpot.

457
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,220
 Good punchoi, this is like a buffet.

458
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,280
 As a Chinese person, it's kind of hard sometimes

459
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,020
 to imagine things we can and cannot eat.

460
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,700
 So if we were to see a vision like this,

461
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,700
 God says, "Come on, kill and eat."

462
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,560
 It's like an invitation to a buffet.

463
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,500
 "Let's do it, come on, I'm excited.

464
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,540
 "I can eat anything I want."

465
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,060
 That's like the best deal ever.

466
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,780
 But Peter is not excited.

467
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,400
 He doesn't wanna go anywhere near that stuff.

468
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,820
 In fact, he almost sounds insulted

469
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,940
 that Jesus would ask him to do such a thing

470
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,980
 in the first place.

471
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,440
 Jesus was asking Peter, essentially,

472
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,920
 to break the food laws.

473
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,000
 All kinds of unclean animals that Jews were forbidden

474
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,800
 to eat were filled up in this sheet.

475
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,520
 Peter's like, "I've never touched those things.

476
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:15,000
 "From since I was a baby, I've been observing these laws.

477
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,480
 "These laws that have been passed down

478
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,000
 "from generation to generation,

479
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,500
 "since we've been freed from slavery in Egypt up till now.

480
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,440
 "My parents, my grandparents, my great-grandparents,

481
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,160
 "we have all followed these laws.

482
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,800
 "Things have always been this way."

483
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,320
 Which is why Peter says, "Surely not, Lord.

484
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,500
 "I have never eaten anything unclean."

485
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,560
 And you have to realize that actually,

486
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,440
 this wasn't just about food laws.

487
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,880
 This was about identity.

488
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,720
 It was a matter of holiness.

489
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,280
 The food laws were part of the laws

490
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,280
 that set the nation of Israel apart from other nations.

491
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,880
 From Jews, from Gentiles.

492
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,440
 Gentiles means anyone who's not a Jew.

493
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,200
 So this is what it did for them,

494
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,200
 to set them apart, to keep them holy,

495
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,200
 to keep them protected from other nations.

496
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,680
 And Jews would look at all these unclean foods

497
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,560
 that the Gentiles would eat and would label them

498
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,400
 as evil and wicked for these unclean things

499
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,520
 that Gentiles would do.

500
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,920
 Us as Jewish people, we don't do those things.

501
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,000
 And so when Peter says, "No, I'm not gonna do that,"

502
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,500
 you can sort of sympathize him a little bit at first

503
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,980
 to why he had that sort of reaction.

504
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,840
 Like I said, his whole life,

505
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,500
 this was ingrained to his beliefs,

506
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,880
 the importance of keeping up Levitical law,

507
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,840
 certain rules, certain things, right?

508
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,360
 And it wasn't just food laws as a whole,

509
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,360
 but 617 laws that they had to follow.

510
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,160
 It was part of their identity.

511
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,120
 Right, in fact, the food laws were particularly important

512
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,580
 that they were revered in a way

513
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,520
 some of the heroes of the Old Testament faith.

514
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,720
 Remember David and his three friends, right?

515
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,480
 They refused to eat the king's food.

516
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,200
 And in the end, they were commended

517
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,240
 as people who truly follow God

518
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,600
 and God blessed them in a certain way.

519
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,080
 They were rescued by God

520
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,080
 precisely because they didn't break the food laws.

521
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,040
 So Peter was thinking this, I'm set.

522
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:18,000
 These are things that can never be done.

523
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,120
 Certain foods are prohibited by God.

524
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,120
 I'm never gonna break that law.

525
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,800
 And for a time, like I said,

526
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,800
 that was needed and it was right.

527
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:31,080
 But now what God was doing through this vision, right,

528
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,840
 even though Peter doesn't quite see it yet,

529
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,640
 he makes clear that there is now no distinction

530
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,000
 between Jews and Gentiles.

531
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,960
 God is using this picture of unclean food now made clean

532
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,920
 to pertain that the Gentiles too

533
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,960
 are included in God's plan.

534
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,280
 They've always been, right?

535
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,520
 That they're included in God's plan,

536
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,600
 that the Gentiles have been made clean.

537
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,600
 And so what this means now is for you yourself, Peter,

538
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,680
 as a Jewish person, you can now go and fellowship

539
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,280
 and do life and minister to these people.

540
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,280
 In fact, that's what I'm gonna call you to do.

541
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:09,520
 I am welcoming them fully into this family of God, Peter,

542
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,160
 and so should you.

543
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,440
 So Peter, put out your old way of thinking

544
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,160
 and be a part of what I'm trying to do now.

545
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,880
 This is what God is trying to say.

546
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,280
 In fact, he says it very clearly.

547
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:28,280
 Do not call anything impure that God has made unclean.

548
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:32,040
 Like I said, it's more than just about food laws.

549
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,000
 It's not just saying to Peter,

550
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 hey, go and eat taffy right now, okay?

551
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,720
 It's more than that.

552
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,240
 One level, yes, dig in, but like I said,

553
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,880
 he's trying to say there are no lines of boundaries now

554
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,120
 that one separates it from you and the others.

555
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,560
 Jesus is drawing Jew and Gentile together,

556
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,960
 not moving past one to get to the other,

557
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,240
 not choosing one and rejecting the other,

558
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,000
 but bringing them together to draw close

559
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,320
 what was once far apart.

560
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:04,640
 When I was studying this, I may think, what about us?

561
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,920
 What are some ways in our society

562
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,680
 and these traditional ways of thinking

563
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,640
 that we have labeled other people as unclean

564
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,480
 and rejected them?

565
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,200
 What are some lines and boundaries within our own culture

566
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,880
 that we need to begin and start changing our thinking on?

567
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,080
 In many ways, what God was challenging Peter to do,

568
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,960
 similar what we're facing in Hong Kong today.

569
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,280
 Like Peter, for those of us who grew up in Hong Kong,

570
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,920
 we've grown up in sort of like a colonized environment,

571
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,680
 meaning we've always been under the rule

572
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,800
 of some sort of foreign power.

573
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,440
 But now that we're no longer accordingly,

574
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,960
 we've returned to our home country for some time now,

575
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,160
 but because we've been separated for so long,

576
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,680
 we don't really feel that connected as Hong Kongers

577
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,360
 to our roots and our origins.

578
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,760
 So we find ourselves, I feel like,

579
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,080
 in a bit of an identity crisis.

580
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,640
 We're not British enough to be British,

581
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,960
 we're not Chinese enough to be Chinese,

582
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,120
 so we have Hong Kong culture.

583
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,560
 And so as Hong Kongers, we're proud of this in many ways.

584
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,720
 I am so proud to be from this city,

585
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,480
 and it's such a beautiful thing.

586
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:16,120
 We have a rich diversity here in Hong Kong, don't we?

587
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,600
 Melting pot from people from all over the world.

588
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,880
 We can even see that reflected in this very room itself.

589
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,400
 We've got Cantonese language,

590
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,800
 colorful, very descriptive, right?

591
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,760
 You could ask for a spoon and end up with a fork, right?

592
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,160
 Get one tone wrong,

593
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,920
 and it completely changes what you're trying to say.

594
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,960
 We have amazing food, right?

595
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,080
 Vibrant, delicious, fusion foods from all over the world.

596
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,400
 You can have an amazing meal for $45,

597
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,640
 or you can have an even better,

598
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,400
 you can have a good meal for $4,500, right?

599
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:51,080
 Either one, it's amazing and delicious, it's in own way.

600
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,320
 At the same time though,

601
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,600
 because I feel like we have these struggles with identity,

602
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,040
 we've developed these sort of defense mechanisms,

603
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,880
 these barriers, these ways of thinking that we've put up

604
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,280
 that separate us from others.

605
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,720
 And these have developed into some unhealthy

606
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,760
 and prejudiced ways of thinking

607
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,520
 that we might view people in our city.

608
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,920
 So for example, when we encounter someone from the mainland,

609
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,160
 as a Hong Konger, maybe one of our natural instincts

610
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:26,000
 is to think, "Oh, well, they're not really like us.

611
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,200
 "We might look similar,

612
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,080
 "but they don't really share in our culture.

613
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,280
 "They don't really, you know, we speak a similar language,

614
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,720
 "but it's quite different enough for us

615
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,560
 "not to be able to understand each other,

616
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,080
 "so we're not gonna engage with them."

617
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,600
 What about our foreign domestic workers?

618
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,480
 Well, these people might live alongside us,

619
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,080
 but really they're just a worker in our homes.

620
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,280
 We're the busy, successful Hong Kongers

621
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,960
 going about making money.

622
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,000
 We don't need to really engage with them.

623
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,480
 And sometimes we don't even think of them

624
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,280
 and treat of them as members of society, right?

625
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,680
 Since the pattern of thinking we've developed,

626
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,320
 their role is just to serve.

627
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,600
 And we fail to truly love, respect, and honor

628
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,880
 our foreign domestic workers, our helpers, and aunties

629
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,600
 who support our families so well.

630
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,200
 What about our other ethnic minorities

631
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,440
 that live in this city, right?

632
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,120
 They too eat differently, dress differently,

633
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,600
 have languages that we don't understand.

634
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,960
 Again, but they haven't grown up here.

635
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,360
 They're not really Hong Kongers,

636
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,240
 so let's keep them at arm's length as well.

637
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,960
 Now, we're in Hong Kong.

638
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,800
 I'm a Hong Konger.

639
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,640
 We're speaking in a very Hong Kong context,

640
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,240
 but if you're listening today and you're not from here,

641
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,640
 or you're listening from somewhere else,

642
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,680
 the idea is the same, right?

643
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,360
 You see what I'm trying to say?

644
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,640
 In your own context, in your own culture,

645
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,000
 what are these barriers that you've set up?

646
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,760
 What are these faulty ways of thinking

647
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,160
 that you've developed about other people,

648
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:56,160
 other cultures that are not like you?

649
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,960
 Or what about when it comes to even in this gathering,

650
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,000
 our own church itself, right?

651
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,080
 Do we label people with certain sin struggles

652
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,760
 to be more unclean?

653
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:12,040
 Do we take a holier-than-thou approach

654
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:15,400
 to people struggling with certain sins?

655
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,160
 Do the barriers that we see in culture

656
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,560
 seep into our faith gatherings?

657
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,200
 So on the surface here, it might seem like

658
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,680
 everyone's getting along, raising their hands in worship,

659
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,920
 getting along, praising God together,

660
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:29,320
 but deep down, I would never go to this person's house.

661
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,160
 No way.

662
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:34,520
 That true connection is not there.

663
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,040
 These barriers break God's heart.

664
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,560
 It's certainly not how he thinks about things.

665
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,680
 And as we hold on to these old ways of thinking,

666
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,440
 we hold on to our prejudice,

667
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,320
 we are calling impure by our own judgment

668
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,480
 what God has already made clean.

669
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,480
 What are we refusing to change, church,

670
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,360
 but we know God has deep down,

671
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,120
 we know that God has called us to change.

672
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,120
 These are the ways of thinking

673
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,880
 that God is challenging us in.

674
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,920
 And it's a beautiful thing

675
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,760
 when Peter realizes what's happening.

676
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,840
 When Peter realizes what Jesus is asking him to do,

677
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,520
 it's like a eureka, ding, ding, ding sort of moment

678
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,360
 in his life, right?

679
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,880
 Listen to these words.

680
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:22,400
 I now realize how true it is

681
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,880
 that God chose not favoritism, listen,

682
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,320
 but accepts every nation who fears him

683
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,440
 and does what is right.

684
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,680
 You have to understand Peter's mindset from before.

685
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,400
 He became a man from so adamant, right,

686
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,160
 about not ever, he's a very stubborn man

687
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,560
 to changing his thinking

688
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:47,360
 into what God has been asking him to embrace.

689
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,320
 This is the beautiful thing

690
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,920
 about letting God do the thinking instead of us,

691
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,840
 because he's infinitely wiser,

692
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,840
 his perspective is infinitely wider than any of us.

693
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,000
 We find out, actually,

694
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,240
 this is what God has been working at the whole time,

695
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,960
 even though we don't know it.

696
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,920
 It took them to respond in change of thinking

697
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,760
 and their obedience.

698
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,920
 Now they see it, right?

699
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:15,320
 Last week, we realized that Peter and the Ethiopian eunuch

700
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,960
 were, it wasn't a coincidence that they got together,

701
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,480
 but it was the Holy Spirit who was orchestrating.

702
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,800
 God was orchestrating the whole thing, right?

703
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,000
 Later on in the story of Acts,

704
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,440
 we have Saul and Ananias,

705
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,800
 two people that should never have been together,

706
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,920
 but God brings them together.

707
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,000
 And now we have Cornelius and Peter,

708
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,280
 two men who are willing to change the way they think,

709
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,440
 respond in obedience to God,

710
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,160
 and now God's gonna use them in a remarkable way.

711
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:47,720
 Like I said, the transformation that Peter has gone through

712
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,760
 is actually pretty remarkable, right?

713
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:55,000
 'Cause Peter was always a person who thought he knew best.

714
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,240
 Last week, we figured out, right,

715
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,080
 Peter was the one who thought he knew better than Jesus,

716
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,160
 that planned for Jesus' life

717
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:04,320
 until Jesus rebuked him to his face.

718
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,480
 Peter was once, he thought that violence was the best way

719
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,280
 to stop the soldiers from worshiping Jesus.

720
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,120
 So what did he do?

721
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,280
 He took things into his own hand.

722
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,760
 When the soldiers were coming to arrest Jesus,

723
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,400
 he pulls out his sword, tries to cut the guy's head off,

724
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,520
 and said, "Just get his ear," right?

725
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,800
 He thought that was the right thing to do.

726
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,280
 But God told Jesus, says, "Not this way, Peter."

727
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,960
 Peter was so stubborn in his thinking,

728
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,800
 "I'm gonna be loyal to Jesus,

729
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,040
 "and even if it costs me my life,

730
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:34,200
 "only to deny his best friend hours after that."

731
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,320
 So Peter has gone through this journey

732
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,760
 in the way he was thinking,

733
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,320
 but there's one particular moment,

734
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:46,040
 as I was reading this passage and thinking back,

735
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:49,040
 that I felt like Peter was probably thinking about

736
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,440
 when he came across this thought.

737
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,960
 Matthew 16, 19 tells us,

738
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,080
 when Jesus is having this conversation with Peter,

739
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,520
 he once said to Peter,

740
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:01,320
 "The keys to the kingdom of heaven have been given to you."

741
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:05,400
 And I really wonder if Peter was thinking

742
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,160
 about that conversation when he realized

743
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,280
 that's what's happening in this moment.

744
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,440
 It's God was saying, "Remember, Peter,

745
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,200
 "I gave you the keys.

746
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,200
 "You are the gatekeeper in this moment

747
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,600
 "of the kingdom of heaven.

748
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,240
 "I want you to take those keys, Peter.

749
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,040
 "I want you to open the gates and throw them wide open,

750
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,800
 "and now your job is to tell the whole world,

751
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,000
 "everyone who loves me is welcome in.

752
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,120
 "Doesn't matter if you're Jew,

753
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,640
 "doesn't matter if you're Gentile.

754
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,760
 "Open those gates, Peter.

755
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,720
 "You have the key.

756
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,200
 "Your job is to tell the world who I am

757
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,760
 "and let everybody into my kingdom.

758
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,800
 "This is the new way of thinking

759
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,720
 "that I'm challenging you with,

760
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,560
 "not just to the Jewish nation, but to everyone."

761
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,120
 And this is what Peter's life changed.

762
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,320
 We see him launching into this mission,

763
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,920
 and he goes and he starts spreading the gospel.

764
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,600
 He starts with Cornelius and his family.

765
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,600
 He starts sharing with them the gospel,

766
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,240
 telling them who Jesus is.

767
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,680
 Even though they love God, they haven't yet met Jesus,

768
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:05,160
 and so in this moment, Peter shares the gospel

769
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,400
 with Cornelius, his family.

770
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,840
 He starts to tell them about his death and his resurrection,

771
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:13,200
 the forgiveness of sins that come through believing in him.

772
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,880
 And Peter has fully embraced his thinking

773
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:19,200
 that everyone who gives their life to Jesus

774
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,240
 is welcome into his kingdom.

775
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:24,480
 All the barriers now, the very fact that he's in Cornelius'

776
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,520
 house itself already means that his thinking

777
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,040
 has been changed.

778
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,640
 But this is the most amazing thing.

779
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,240
 An astonishing thing happens here.

780
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,680
 Peter didn't even get to finish his message

781
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:40,800
 because at that moment, the Holy Spirit falls,

782
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,320
 and Cornelius and his family begin speaking his tongues

783
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,760
 and they're baptized fully into God's family.

784
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:50,560
 But we saw this happening earlier, actually,

785
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,720
 in the book of Acts, on the day of Pentecost,

786
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,080
 when the disciples themselves were filled

787
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,600
 with the Holy Spirit.

788
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:00,680
 Now it's the Gentiles' turn, the non-Jewish family's turn,

789
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,240
 to receive the Holy Spirit.

790
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,160
 This is God's final confirmation of the picture.

791
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,120
 This is truly what I'm trying to do.

792
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:11,480
 Everyone now is welcome into the kingdom of God.

793
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,800
 This is for real.

794
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:20,080
 All this was possible because Peter was willing

795
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,120
 to think differently.

796
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,600
 He was willing to put down his traditions,

797
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:28,320
 his culture, so he could respond to what God

798
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,440
 was calling him to do.

799
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,560
 Right, he could have been stubborn,

800
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,600
 he could have been stuck in his ways

801
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,840
 when he saw that sheet and he said,

802
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,960
 "I'm not gonna do that, I'm gonna keep to my lane,

803
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,960
 "I'm gonna stay what I'm doing.

804
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,080
 "You go find someone else to do this."

805
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,400
 But notice, that's not what happens.

806
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:50,400
 He responds by changing his thinking in obedience to God.

807
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,360
 Right, notice, this is always about God's work.

808
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,000
 It's not that Peter changed his thoughts

809
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 in somehow orchestrated events, right?

810
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,240
 It's not that he saw, it wasn't just a random vision

811
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,680
 in the sky that he responded to it.

812
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,720
 This was God challenging him to his way of thinking

813
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,680
 into ways he'd never thought about himself,

814
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,200
 but responding in obedience to what God

815
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,120
 was calling him to do now.

816
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,800
 And as we look, this is very typical

817
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,280
 of the way God works across the Bible.

818
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,360
 Right, helping people change their perspective,

819
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,600
 change their thinking so he can respond

820
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,440
 in obedience to him and then they can do

821
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,360
 what he's called them to do.

822
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,120
 For example, Moses.

823
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:31,120
 Right, Moses always thought he wasn't a good speaker.

824
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,240
 I'm not, I don't have the words,

825
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,120
 I'm not a good speaker, Lord.

826
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,000
 But God used him to speak to Pharaoh

827
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,160
 and set his people free from slavery.

828
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,520
 Gideon thought to himself, I'm the smallest dude

829
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,640
 from the smallest tribe, there's big army before me,

830
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,080
 how can I ever do, how can I ever defeat them?

831
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,560
 God shifts his perspective, changes thinking,

832
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:58,120
 and with just 300 men, Gideon defeats the enemy army.

833
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,960
 Right, the woman at the well thought, you know,

834
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,880
 Jesus was there to condemn her, just like everybody else.

835
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,480
 She thought, you know, I'm no longer worthy of society,

836
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,600
 I have to come out here in the heat of the day

837
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,760
 just to get some water, I have no place in society anymore.

838
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,440
 But as she encounters Jesus, her perspective changes

839
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,880
 and she goes back and evangelizes

840
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,800
 the entire region of Samaria.

841
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,480
 You see how now it's not our role to think up strategies,

842
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,520
 to come up with ideas, to come up with plans,

843
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,840
 to figure things out, God has already done that for us.

844
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,680
 All he asks us to do is shift the way we think

845
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,160
 so that we can walk in obedience

846
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,560
 and then he can use us to do the things

847
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,400
 that he has called us to do.

848
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,800
 It's all about being obedient to Christ.

849
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,000
 So let me give us a few guidelines from scripture

850
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,160
 as to how we can switch our minds

851
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,040
 so we can be more obedient to the things

852
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,160
 God is calling us to.

853
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,840
 Number one, 1 Corinthians 2, 16,

854
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,720
 scripture tells us to do this,

855
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,680
 to put on the mind of Christ.

856
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,440
 This means that we don't think like the world thinks,

857
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,360
 but rather we put on the mind of Christ,

858
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,880
 we're saying that we think like Jesus would think.

859
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,160
 We approach things from a godly perspective.

860
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,160
 We set our minds on the things that are what?

861
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,760
 Above.

862
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,560
 And as we do this, scripture tells us

863
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,720
 we can't do this by our own experience.

864
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,440
 We lean not on our own, what church?

865
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,480
 Understanding.

866
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:36,120
 But submit all our ways to him, that's Proverbs 3.

867
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,240
 We embrace the wisdom of God,

868
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,680
 we trust that God's way are not our ways,

869
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,800
 his thoughts are what?

870
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,960
 Higher than our thoughts, Isaiah 55.

871
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,200
 You see, if we do things,

872
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,880
 if we keep just thinking in our own ways

873
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,360
 and doing things our own ways,

874
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,960
 we're only ever gonna get earthly results.

875
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,400
 But when we shift our thinking

876
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,240
 and respond in obedience to God,

877
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:03,240
 we get godly, heavenly, supernatural results.

878
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:08,160
 We do not conform to the pattern of this world

879
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,520
 that Bible tells us,

880
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,120
 but our minds are transformed,

881
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,800
 we are transformed by the renewing of our minds.

882
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,840
 Then we will be able to test and approve what God's will is,

883
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,040
 his good, pleasing, and perfect will, right?

884
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,920
 To obey him, to walk in the way he wants us to walk,

885
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,440
 Romans 12.

886
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,760
 We take every top captive and make it what?

887
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,160
 Obedient to Christ.

888
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,920
 This is what I mean when we say

889
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,960
 we need to change the way we think, right?

890
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,240
 It's not about mustering up more willpower,

891
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,240
 it's not about manifesting, okay?

892
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,280
 Don't come at me with that.

893
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,440
 Okay, into reality.

894
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,160
 It's not about setting a more positive mindset even,

895
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,200
 it's about changing your thinking

896
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,160
 so you can be obedient to God

897
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:51,040
 and walk in the way that he's called you to walk.

898
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,000
 This is what it means to change our thinking.

899
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,560
 And when we do this,

900
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:06,280
 when we do this, the world truly begins to change.

901
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,680
 When we have a church that's filled with people

902
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:12,360
 who are thinking right, guided by God's wisdom,

903
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,800
 obedient to what Jesus has called us to do,

904
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,840
 empowered by the Holy Spirit,

905
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,520
 boldly going into these uncharted areas

906
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,960
 that we've been challenged to go,

907
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,520
 to places in our community,

908
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,600
 we bring down the strongholds

909
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,880
 that have been taking other people captive.

910
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,480
 We can say amen to that, yes?

911
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,680
 Imagine what it would be like.

912
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,920
 Our city is so stuck in the ways of thinking,

913
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,160
 some of the things that we see in our society

914
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,320
 that we've sort of given up on.

915
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,440
 But if we go together,

916
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,240
 if we're obedient to what Jesus has called us to do,

917
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,400
 and we start to bring a new perspective

918
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,800
 to some of these strongholds,

919
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,160
 think what would happen.

920
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,800
 So the thought in the city that money is more important

921
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,720
 than everything else,

922
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,080
 from God's perspective that looks like,

923
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,920
 you know what, I'm gonna teach people

924
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:02,240
 and teach myself to put God first.

925
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,680
 Right, the thought that you need to be a certain position,

926
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,240
 to be considered somebody,

927
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,640
 becomes God loves you and values you

928
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,760
 and cherishes you unconditionally,

929
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,240
 no matter who you are.

930
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,320
 This thought that we need to put this immense pressure

931
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,200
 on our kids to be high achievers

932
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,040
 and have all these academic achievements

933
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:25,240
 becomes Jesus wants you just to have childlike faith.

934
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:30,080
 The thought that this city can never be evangelized

935
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,640
 because people are too busy chasing the Hong Kong dream

936
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,400
 becomes with God, all things are possible.

937
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:40,080
 The idea that separation and separation is a reality

938
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,440
 that people will never be truly united

939
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,440
 becomes in Christ there is slave nor free,

940
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,000
 Jew nor Gentile, male or female.

941
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,080
 This pandemic that we see with our young people

942
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:54,520
 giving up hope, turning to drugs and suicide, right?

943
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,720
 The generations of Hong Kong have no hope

944
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,480
 becomes you, oh Lord, are my hope and my salvation.

945
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,040
 The thought that the idols of the city

946
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,280
 will always have a foothold,

947
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,360
 that will never break free from the things

948
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,440
 that hold us back from really following God

949
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:11,920
 become Jesus is the way, the truth and the?

950
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,800
 The idea that there's families,

951
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,640
 that children out there,

952
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,480
 that need families out there right now,

953
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,080
 foster care and adoption,

954
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,880
 and that they will always be stuck in this situation,

955
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,800
 that generations upon generations of fatherlessness,

956
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,080
 of parentlessness becomes look after the widows

957
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,880
 and the orphans and a group of Christians

958
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,480
 will rise up to that challenge

959
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,440
 and every single child can be placed

960
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,200
 into a home that loves them.

961
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,360
 Come on church,

962
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:41,200
 let's not sit back and be defeated by our thoughts.

963
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,840
 That's what the enemy is trying to do,

964
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,480
 to try to confuse our way we think,

965
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,400
 but this is a call to rise up,

966
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,680
 change our thinking, change our perspective,

967
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,720
 ask God to give us a new mind and a new heart

968
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,680
 so we can walk in obedience to him

969
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,640
 and be the people he's called to be,

970
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,520
 do the things that he's called us to do,

971
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,840
 defeat and claim back some of these uncharted areas

972
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:05,360
 that the enemy has taken for the glory of God.

973
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:09,400
 This is how we bring the light of the gospel into the city.

974
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,840
 Jesus had made all things clean,

975
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:15,440
 our job now is to bring things back into his presence,

976
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,040
 do the work of reclaiming city in the name of Jesus

977
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,960
 and it starts with the way we think church.
