1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Alright, so again, welcome to the church.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 You can have a seat if there's some free seats down here if you want to scoot in, feel free

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 to take a seat as well.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 This is Branches of Hope Sunday.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 You've heard us say that a few times, you might have seen some of the booths outside.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 But if you're new to the church, we welcome you by the way, you might be wondering, you

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 know, what exactly is Branches of Hope?

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 And what do we mean when we talk about seeds of growth?

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Well, Branches of Hope is an amazing NGO that partners alongside the Vine.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 We are sort of two in one, but they do amazing work in the area of giving assistance and

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 help and relief in all different ways to our refugees and asylum seekers here in this city.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 And it's had a long history, it's, you know, going through some things and there's an aim

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 and a vision that we want to partner with BOH in as well.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 So to give you a little bit more about the context and the history of Branches of Hope,

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 please turn your attention to the screen and welcome our founding pastor, Pastor John Snellgrove.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Hi, I'm John Snellgrove and I'm one of the founding pastors of the Vine Church.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 I expect you're asking yourself on this special BOH Sunday, what has the Vine got to do with

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 BOH? And I'd like to give you a little history lesson.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 It's time to take back almost 20 years.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 The Vine Church was known for a number of things, things like worship, worship style.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 We're also known as a church that stood up for justice.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 And when we were confronted with asylum seekers, when we actually went to visit an asylum

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 seeker in prison, in Victoria Prison, who was only in prison because he overstayed.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 We suddenly realized there was a sense of injustice.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 And then one Saturday afternoon, I'm going to tell you this story.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 I was in the church and there was a group of African boys from Togo and they'd actually

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 been sleeping on the star ferry because they had nowhere else to sleep.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 And they came in and asked me, you know, could I provide them a room where they could go

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 and pray? And I found them that.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 And I went out and got them a McDonald's big Mac meal.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 And I guess the rest is history.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 You know, that was the beginning of our African fellowship.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 At that time, asylum seekers, children couldn't go to school.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 And next to my office was another office, which was actually a makeshift kindergarten.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 And I had to work during the day with kids making all sorts of noise.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 And I wasn't allowed to take part in the things that normal kids were taking part in.

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 And I guess the most poignant story for me was of a young man called Sidi.

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 He came here from the Congo and he came to us and he actually ran our African fellowship

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 for a while, but he got sick and he needed a transplant.

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 He needed a new kidney.

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 And you know something? He wasn't even allowed to be placed on the waiting list.

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 And of course, being a asylum seeker, we couldn't send him anywhere else.

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 And to cut a very long story short, this man that a man used to call me dad,

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 and I regarded him as my spiritual son, actually eventually passed away.

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 And all of this has caused us as the Vine Church to want to do more.

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 And so rather than just something that we did as a church, we decided to form our own NGO.

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 We called it Branches of Hope because we believe in hope.

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 We believe in justice. We believe in supporting those who cannot support themselves.

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 And what we've been doing these past few years is working with refugees,

50
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 asylum seekers, those caught in trafficking, and really doing what we can with our prayers,

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 with our help, and with our finance to make their life easy.

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Their life in Hong Kong still is not easy.

53
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 But hopefully, through the help of people like you, supporting Branches of Hope,

54
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 we can do something. We can do something to make them feel they belong to a community.

55
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 And I think that's what Branches of Hope has actually done.

56
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 We've created a community here where people feel respected, they feel loved,

57
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 and they feel part of what we're doing here at the Vine.

58
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 In conclusion, people always say to me, "The Vine has done a lot for refugees and asylum seekers."

59
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 I say, "Yes." But then I say, "I'll tell you something.

60
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 Refugees and asylum seekers have done much more for the Vine.

61
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 The Vine would not be the church it is today were it not for Branches of Hope."

62
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 Really wonderful. So you've heard a bit about the history of BOH and where it's come from,

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 but to give us a bit of an update about where BOH is now and some of the initiatives that really need our support,

64
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 we're going to welcome Herr Porter. Hello, my friend.

65
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 So Alex is our Executive Director at BOH, and him and his team have been doing some really cool work

66
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 in working alongside the refugee and asylum seeker community.

67
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 We at the Vine get the privilege of doing some quite intimate work with them in ministry together,

68
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 in relief work together. So here's Alex to give you a bit more of an update.

69
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 Why don't we just pray for him quickly as he comes in to share.

70
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 So Father, we thank you for BOH. Lord, we thank you for the work that they're doing

71
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 and for Alex's leadership over this community, over this organization.

72
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 So just bless him today, Lord, as he shares a bit about what BOH is,

73
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 what they're trying to do, and help us to connect with the work, Lord. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

74
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Thank you very much. And good morning. I think it's full morning. Yeah, I'm sorry.

75
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 15 minutes left in the morning. And don't worry, I'm not going to do this in German despite my heritage.

76
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 So thank you very much, Alison. Yeah, it's great to be here.

77
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 We're extraordinarily blessed and honored to once again be hosted by the Vine for Branches of Hope Sunday.

78
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Alison already mentioned I'm Alex. I'm the Executive Director of Branches of Hope.

79
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 Our theme this year is Seeds of Growth, and this serves as a metaphor for how our work enables the community

80
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 which we serve to reach more of their potential. And it's also a reflection of the Vine's motto, Growing Big People.

81
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 Before Pastor Andrew takes the stage to give the work of Branches of Hope a bit more of a biblical perspective,

82
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 I wanted to take a moment to connect the message that we heard from Pastor John in the video to what we do today.

83
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 So to connect the past with the present. Pastor John called it a history lesson, which I think was quite apt,

84
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 because the work of Branches of Hope actually long predates the existence of the organization

85
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 and is embedded in the very identity of the Vine Church.

86
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 What we do at Branches of Hope is born out of a church ministry and remains the justice expression of the Vine.

87
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 Perhaps more importantly, we continue to provide the groups we serve with a sense of belonging and community.

88
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Pastor John also mentioned the Vine would not be the same without Branches of Hope, and while that is certainly true,

89
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 we and the work we do could not exist without the continued support of the Vine Church and congregation.

90
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 In other words, every one of you here. Even though we work in different ways, we remain inextricably linked.

91
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 That said, Branches of Hope continues to grow and evolve, and last year we were blessed to celebrate our 10th anniversary.

92
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 We continue the work that we do with the generous support of the Vine and others,

93
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 and serve hundreds of families and individuals with our two programs,

94
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Refugee Opportunity and Development, ROAD, and Stop Trafficking of People, STOP.

95
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 Though the needs of the two communities we serve are somewhat different,

96
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 we have a unified approach in our service, and we call this the three pillars of service.

97
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 Those three pillars are care, empowerment, and social change.

98
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 While empowerment remains our core mandate by ensuring the self-agency of our communities through various personal development initiatives,

99
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 we recognize that without addressing the basic needs of the communities we serve, we would not be as impactful as we could be.

100
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 Hence, the care aspect of our work. Pastor Andrew will be reflecting on this in greater detail.

101
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 And without addressing society as a whole and working towards changing hearts and minds about the communities we serve,

102
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 large-scale, long-term positive impact would be out of reach.

103
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 Hence, the three pillars of service, care, empowerment, and social reform, social change, continues to inform our work.

104
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 What does that look like today?

105
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 The STOP team reaches out on a regular basis to sex workers, migrant domestic workers, and other migrant workers

106
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 to let them know that we are here to assist them if they or someone that they know faces a situation of labor exploitation or trafficking.

107
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 Over the past year, the team has spent 66 hours on the streets, in public spaces on Sundays, and even in brothels to reach those vulnerable that we are seeking to serve.

108
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 We provide Know Your Rights workshops, along with rehabilitation assistance to those who have been abused in their places of work,

109
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 and conduct policy research to highlight best practices in prevention and response.

110
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 Over 2,700 members of the public and the community members we serve alike benefited from trainings, workshops, and educational talks over the past year.

111
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 Similarly, the ROAD team works very hard to fill the many gaps refugees and asylum seekers face that are left by the insufficient subsidies they receive.

112
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 The team helps find a new home or to connect to medical services when needed.

113
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 In the last 12 months, we have helped around 2,300 people in this way.

114
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 Sometimes with something as small as, for example, an in-kind donation, for example, some clothes or a second-hand phone.

115
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 In other cases, something much more major, like monthly financial assistance.

116
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 We keep children in school by providing and covering the costs of books, uniforms, and the like.

117
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 We provide summer activities, and we help young adults pursue a degree.

118
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 It is with great pride that we were able to support 80 students this year alone.

119
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 And as much as we do to foster a sense of community and offer avenues for integration,

120
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 we recognize the hard and sad truth that, unfortunately, for the ROAD clients that we serve, none of them are actually allowed to remain in Hong Kong indefinitely.

121
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 And so we assist in resettling community members through private sponsorships to third countries,

122
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 and we work to ensure successful reintegration for those being repatriated.

123
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 And over the past year, 19 of our community members were able to start a new chapter of their lives in countries outside of Hong Kong.

124
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 As you may tell from this little window into our world, we have a lot on our plate.

125
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 And to help you digest all this information and perhaps give you the opportunity to dive a little bit further,

126
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 we did bring a little present for you all today.

127
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 You'll find the pouches on your seats, which Allison already mentioned.

128
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 Inside, there's a prayer guide, there's a brochure, and there's also the seed pencil.

129
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 The seed pencil is a bit of a symbol for our Seeds of Growth theme this year,

130
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 because at the base, there's a little capsule that has basil seeds inside, so you can take that home and you can plant it.

131
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 And of course, we hope that as that plant grows, it'll be a continuous reminder of the work that we do at Branches of Hope.

132
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Much like a plant, we have been watered by God's grace and your and the Vine Church's generosity.

133
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Allowing us to meet many different needs over the past 10 years.

134
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 And with the same divine grace and continued generosity, we will continue to work to provide dignity, justice, and hope

135
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 for the next 10 years and beyond, to continue reaching those who would otherwise be forgotten.

136
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 Thank you for your support.

137
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 Thank you, thank you.

138
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Yeah, we're so excited that we get to do this together as a family today,

139
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 because really at the very heart of it, Branches of Hope's work is a spiritual work.

140
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 It is the work of Jesus Christ at work in communities, fostering unity, creating hope, bringing dignity and justice.

141
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 And we really do see that as a work of God's Spirit.

142
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 So I wonder whether we might be able to just do a spiritual work together as we pray over Alex and his team.

143
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 I want to invite you guys all to stand as we do that.

144
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 And would you stretch out your hands with me and we're going to pray over these guys together this morning.

145
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 Father, we recognize that the work of justice, the work of empowering vulnerable communities,

146
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 all the work that Branches of Hope does is your work.

147
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 And it is a work that's infused by the heart of God through the power of the Spirit.

148
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 So will we stand together as a church community and pray over Alex and what he represents with the wider team and staff

149
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 and the clients that Branches of Hope serve.

150
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 We pray now, Father, that you would infuse this work with a deep sense of what we were singing about in that song earlier,

151
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 that nothing can stand against the power of God.

152
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 And we pray that whatever issue that these clients are facing, whatever struggles that are in front of them,

153
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 whatever obstacles seem like they can never overcome, nothing can stand against the power of God.

154
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 And we pray, Lord, that as we lean into this idea of your power and the way in which your power shapes us

155
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 to be people of generosity towards those that are vulnerable,

156
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 we pray that that power would be what Alex and his team look to every single day.

157
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 That they would understand, as I know they deeply know, in the humility that they carry,

158
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 that they cannot do this work without you.

159
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 And so we stand together as a community of faith and we cheer them on, we pray for them,

160
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 and we release, Lord, everything you have in your Spirit over these guys.

161
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 And we thank you for that in Jesus' name.

162
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 Everyone says? Can we give Alex another round of applause? So good.

163
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 Have a seat, have a seat.

164
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 So 20 years ago, 20 years ago, I met a man who radically changed the way that I think about justice,

165
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 about serving vulnerable communities, and about God's heart to reach out to those that desperately need help.

166
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 This man actually represents so much, I think, of the kind of work that Branches of Hope does.

167
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 His name's Joseph Fati. And Joseph Fati fled to Hong Kong from Burundi.

168
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 And in Burundi at that time, there was a massive kind of ethnic cleansing that was taking place

169
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 amongst competing tribes, the Hutu and the Tutsi.

170
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 And these two tribes were going at each other all the time, and some of the tragedies were incredible.

171
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 And Joseph Fati witnessed firsthand the horrors of ethnic cleansing.

172
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 He was from a large farming community, and his family was one of the largest farmers in their particular region.

173
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 And one day, Joseph Fati was coming home from a long day out on the farther ends of the fields of his farm,

174
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 and he was late getting home. And as he gets near to his farmhouse,

175
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 he sees that the competing ethnic group have surrounded his house.

176
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 And they have brought out every single member of his family to the front area of the porch of their home.

177
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 And Joseph Fati hides in the cornfields that they were growing nearby.

178
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 He hides inside these cornfields, and whilst he's hiding there,

179
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 he witnessed this ethnic group murder every single member of his family, one by one.

180
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 I don't know if you could imagine what it would be like to see the people that you love,

181
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 the people that you've grown up with, the people that you live with, systematically murdered in front of you.

182
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 But this caused a huge amount of trauma and really disorientation for him.

183
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 He fled out of the fields that day as the only survivor of his family.

184
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 A wealthy friend of his enabled him to basically pay off bribes in the airport to get Joseph Fati on an airplane.

185
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 He didn't know where he was going. He didn't even have a passport.

186
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 But he gets smuggled onto this plane, and the plane flies from Burundi and eventually lands here in Hong Kong.

187
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 Joseph Fati comes off the plane, he goes to immigration, he's got no passport, he's got no money,

188
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 he's got nothing, just the clothes that he's literally wearing that day.

189
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 He walks up to immigration, and unsurprisingly, immigration places him in a quarantine center, in a detention center.

190
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 And there he discovers that there is this thing called UNHCR, the United Nations Human Rights Organization.

191
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 And they give him advice as to how he can now apply for asylum because of what he's experienced and what has happened to him in his home country.

192
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 So Joseph Fati applies for asylum, and that enables him a couple of months later to be released from the detention center,

193
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 but he's placed in the city of Hong Kong with literally nothing.

194
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 No finances, not given the ability or the right to work, no resources whatsoever, no family, community, or friends in this city.

195
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 I wonder if you could imagine how lonely that would have been.

196
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 And that's a good example of how many of those in vulnerable communities in Hong Kong feel.

197
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 After about two weeks, only just about two weeks, Joseph Fati's found this reality that life is no longer worth living.

198
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 So he tries to kill himself.

199
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 And in the process of trying to kill himself, he ends up in a hospital here in Hong Kong.

200
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 And it just so happens that his bed in the hospital in Hong Kong is right next to the bed of one of our Vine congregation members, Ailing Father.

201
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 And this congregation member was going in daily to see their Ailing Father, and one day when they go in, there's an African man on his own in the bed next door.

202
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 And because this congregation member is super friendly and a really nice, kind person, they notice this African man, and they wanted to know his story.

203
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 So they asked the African man, "Well, what's your story?" And Joseph Fati begins to share his experience of what he had experienced in Burundi, getting on the flight, getting to Hong Kong, detention center, the whole story.

204
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 And the congregation member is like torn up inside.

205
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 And so the congregation member then tells this person their story.

206
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 And as part of that story is their relationship with Jesus Christ.

207
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 And two hours later, Joseph Fati prays the prayer to receive Jesus as his golden Savior.

208
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 I meet Joseph Fati for the first time just two days later as he's released from hospital and he shows up here at the Vine.

209
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 Back in those days, some 20 years ago, the church was much smaller than the one that you see here today.

210
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 And we didn't really know what to do with vulnerable communities like this, but there was Joseph Fati standing in front of us and saying, "I need help."

211
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 And so we rallied around him as best we could.

212
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 I mean, he was the very definition of vulnerability.

213
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 He was alone. He was without any resources in need of emergency care.

214
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 And so we were able to raise some funds to be able to provide some food for him and get some clothes for him.

215
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 Actually, one of our founding senior pastors, Tony Reed, opened up his whole home for Joseph Fati.

216
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 And Joseph Fati came and lived in his house for two and a half years.

217
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 I think that's a rather cool example of sacrificial giving in small apartments like we have here in Hong Kong.

218
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 I remember one day I took Joseph Fati to buy a pair of sneakers.

219
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 I went to Sneakers Street in Mong Kok.

220
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 And I brought him what I can admit before you today to be a reasonably cheap pair of sneakers.

221
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 But for Joseph Fati, these were like I had brought him an original pair of Jordan 1s.

222
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 I mean, these were the greatest things he had ever received.

223
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 You know what I'm saying?

224
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 And we were able to meet Joseph Fati's felt needs, but in the process of meeting his felt needs, we realized that there was something else that we could never meet.

225
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 And that was the brokenness that was inside of him, the trauma of seeing what he had seen with his family,

226
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 the anger and hatred he had towards that ethnic group.

227
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 And we knew that the only way that that would change would be a work of the Holy Spirit.

228
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 That had to be something that God was going to do inside of him.

229
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 That needed to be a transformative thing.

230
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 And we were praying and we were believing and we were standing with him.

231
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 But Joseph Fati was going through life now cared for, but not necessarily free.

232
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 Free from the pain and the hurt and the anger and the bitterness.

233
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 I remember one day, as clear as anything from 20 years ago,

234
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 we decided to go up into the rooftop of Tony's apartment building.

235
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 We weren't supposed to be up there, but there was five of us from the youth ministry.

236
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 We broke into the rooftop.

237
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 One of them had an acoustic guitar.

238
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 It was all for Jesus, okay?

239
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 One of them had an acoustic guitar.

240
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 And we're up on this rooftop and we start doing worship together.

241
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 Joseph Fati's with us.

242
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 And Joseph Fati wasn't a very communicative person.

243
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 He didn't talk a lot.

244
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 He was very non-emotional.

245
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 You never really kind of knew.

246
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 I don't think I ever saw him smile very much before that moment on the rooftop.

247
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 But when we're up there on the rooftop and we're singing some Christian songs

248
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 and we're doing some worship together, suddenly he begins to weep.

249
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 And he weeps and he weeps and he weeps.

250
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 And you can tell that the Spirit of God is doing something inside of him.

251
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 And we just are standing around and we're praying for him and laying our hands on him.

252
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 And he's just pouring out, just crying after crying.

253
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 You could see it.

254
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 And there was this, I guess, just months of all this pent-up pain just coming now out of him.

255
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 It was actually truly beautiful to see.

256
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 And after he had managed to kind of recompose himself,

257
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 he begins to tell us what was going on inside of him and what he was doing.

258
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 And I want to read to you what he said to us that night.

259
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 He said, "I forgive them, for I myself have found grace and forgiveness in Jesus.

260
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 I love them," speaking of this ethnic group that murdered his family,

261
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 "for I myself have been loved when I was not worthy.

262
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 And I pray for them, for I myself have been prayed for by Jesus."

263
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 In that moment, Joseph Addy was more close to the heart of God than I think I've ever been in my life.

264
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 He was able to express something of the deep work of the Spirit of God

265
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 and transform somebody into becoming more and more like him.

266
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 So Joseph Addy would go on to get refugee status by New Zealand of all countries.

267
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 Gotta love New Zealand.

268
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 He went to Bible school there, which was partly funded by the Vine Church.

269
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 He graduated with honors at Bible school.

270
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 He met the woman of his life.

271
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 They got married.

272
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 My wife and I were able to be at their wedding.

273
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 It was an amazing affair.

274
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 He now lives in Australia.

275
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 He has a growing family of his own.

276
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 And he now works for an NGO that's actually serving people that have experienced trauma from war, just like him.

277
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 That's somebody who has experienced something of Christian grace,

278
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 who has experienced something of the transformative power of Jesus Christ,

279
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 and who has now become a flourishing member of society,

280
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 so much so that he's able to then feed into the very people that have experienced what he's experienced.

281
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 That's, my friends, seeds of growth.

282
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 And that's why we gather here today.

283
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 Because whilst Joseph Addy's story is personal to him, it is not unique to the people that we're serving at Branches of Hope.

284
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 You heard in the video about the Togo Boys and Saidi.

285
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 And there are many others, many that are actually sitting in this room right now,

286
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 that we at Branches of Hope are walking with and serving,

287
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 who have similar stories of trauma, similar stories of needing to flee their countries,

288
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 similar stories of needing to be ministered to, both with the hope of Jesus,

289
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 but also the practical resources that come with beginning to get your life back together again.

290
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 And although now, 20 years later, Branches of Hope does so much more than just relieving people's felt needs,

291
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 as Alex so wonderfully just shared with us, some of that work that now Branches of Hope is doing,

292
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 the core of our work over those 20 years has not changed.

293
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 We, as an organization, boldly walk into vulnerable communities in our city

294
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 with the hope of Jesus and with the reality of health.

295
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 And through working, through relief work, we're able to provide physical, mental, emotional, and social care to those that need it the most.

296
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 That's what Branches of Hope does.

297
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 Now, what is it that drives this idea of us to serve those around us?

298
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 Well, it's not just because there are needy people in society, and that just seems to be a nice thing to do.

299
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 We serve in this way as a church community and through Branches of Hope

300
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 because of what I like to call a "theo-anthropological imperative."

301
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 Everybody take a deep breath.

302
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 "Theo-anthropological imperative."

303
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 You might be wondering, "What is that?"

304
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 Let me explain.

305
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 The reason why we serve vulnerable communities in Hong Kong is because God, Theo,

306
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 has created all human beings, anthropological, in His image.

307
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 And because all human beings are created in God's image,

308
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 every single human being, regardless of their status, regardless of their culture,

309
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 regardless of whether they're wealthy or they're poor,

310
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 regardless of whether they have it all together or their world is falling apart,

311
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 every single person reflects something of God's image.

312
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 Therefore, everybody has inherent dignity,

313
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 inherent worth,

314
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 inherent purpose,

315
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 and inherent value.

316
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 Every single one is called to walk in the purposes and promises of a God who's created them.

317
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 And if that's the case, then we all have a role, a joy, a life,

318
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 to be able to serve those who are like that because we see them as one of us.

319
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 We don't see them as people that are desperately in need and we better do some nice things because that actually makes us feel better.

320
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 We actually see these communities as people who are made in the image of God,

321
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 equal and powerful under God's heart, and because of that, we connect with them.

322
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 In other words, the vulnerable should never be charity cases

323
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 in which we kind of think of ourselves as a savior.

324
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 No, we need to see them as children of God in which they become part of our family.

325
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 See, when we see vulnerable communities and vulnerable people in that way,

326
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 that's a steel anthropological imperative.

327
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 We have this idea that they're brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, children of God.

328
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 We have this idea that they're part of our family,

329
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 and if they're part of our family, when we support them, it's not out of duty and obligation.

330
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 "Oh, I guess I better do this because this is what a good Christian does."

331
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 We support them because they're a member of our family.

332
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 They're people just like us, made in the image of God, carrying dignity and worth,

333
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 and so therefore we have a joy and honor.

334
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 We serve out of love and honor, not out of duty and obligation.

335
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 And in just a bit, I'm telling you at the end before the beginning,

336
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 I'm going to ask you to give some money today,

337
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 but you're not going to give out of duty and obligation.

338
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 You're going to give out of love and respect and honor

339
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 because we're not giving to charity cases that need a savior.

340
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 We're giving to children of God who are part of our family.

341
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 Are you with me, people?

342
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 Yeah, that's a serf-something.

343
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 Now, it's not just us that has a steel anthropological imperative,

344
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 but Jesus embodies this.

345
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 It was actually that that Jesus would use to speak to those around him.

346
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 He would speak of the reality of being made in the image of God

347
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 and how we are all children in his kingdom.

348
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 This is the language that Jesus would use for the people of his day

349
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 to get them to turn towards the vulnerable communities of their day.

350
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 Now, here's the crazy thing.

351
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 It was the religious leaders and the religious communities,

352
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 like the divine church in the first century,

353
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 that actually did not serve, did not help,

354
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 did not stand in the gap with vulnerable communities.

355
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 And it was because the Jewish leaders of the day,

356
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 within that sort of understanding of Judaism at that time,

357
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 those who were on the outsides, who were vulnerable,

358
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 were seen as unclean, mostly.

359
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 And because they were unclean, their theology was they were unclean

360
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 because of some sin or because of some bad choices.

361
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 That's why they're blind.

362
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 That's why they're crippled.

363
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 That's why they're out there.

364
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 They've done something.

365
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 Either their sin or poor choices has caused them to be on the outside of society.

366
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 And if we engage with them, we're in the risk of becoming unclean and defiled ourselves.

367
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 And so the prevailing winds of the day was that there wasn't this kind of Christian movement

368
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 towards serving those vulnerable people.

369
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 Instead, there was this kind of at a distance, holding them away.

370
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 And for Jesus, this was an affront to the heart of God.

371
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 Jesus couldn't understand how his people had gone so far away from what actually drives God's heart.

372
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 That if these people are made in the image of God,

373
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 then they carry that equal dignity and worth,

374
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 and justice is to reach out to the vulnerable and broken communities

375
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 and bring them in as much as possible because we're part of one family.

376
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 So Jesus begins to speak strongly to the religious authorities and the people around him of his day

377
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 about the need for them to get over this concern of becoming unclean

378
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 and actually begin to serve the very people that they put on the outside.

379
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 One of the places that you see Jesus do this the most is around the dinner table.

380
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 Interesting, Jesus, man, he loved to eat, Jesus.

381
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 In fact, a lot of scholars say that in the Gospels, Jesus was either on the way to a dinner,

382
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 at a dinner, or leaving a dinner.

383
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 That was pretty much Jesus.

384
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 In this way, Jesus really was a true Hong Konger.

385
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 Let's be fair.

386
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 Like, you know what I'm saying, foodies in the house, you know it.

387
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 That's Jesus, right? He was always at a meal.

388
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 And Jesus was invited to meals because, of course, in the first century, that was the way things happened.

389
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 That was the social context of the day.

390
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 A lot of business was discussed that way.

391
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 A lot of teaching was done in that context.

392
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 Around the meal table was a very important place for relational connection.

393
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 Now, here's an interesting context about the meal table in Jesus' time.

394
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 The meal table was a symbol of power.

395
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 The meal table was where if you were a host and you had a table in your home,

396
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 and you invited somebody to come for a meal,

397
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 you were, as the host, the person in power,

398
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 and you would invite somebody into your home who you knew, by being invited into your home,

399
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 they were now obligated to invite you back to their home.

400
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 There was this reciprocal culture in the first century

401
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 where if I open my home to you, then you are under now my debt,

402
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 and you need to now open your home to me.

403
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 Are you with me?

404
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 Now, because of that culture, what it meant was a lot of wealthy people would invite even more wealthy people to their home

405
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 because they wanted to get invited to the really wealthy people's homes.

406
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 Are you with me?

407
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 Isn't it great that we don't do this anymore?

408
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 Come on, Hong Kong.

409
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 But we do this, and we invite people over to things, we do things,

410
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 and we kind of think that now they're kind of obligated to invite us back,

411
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 and that's exactly what was going on in the first century.

412
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 And so Jesus saw that the dinner table, that the hosting of it,

413
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 that the resources of eating and drinking and community and fellowship

414
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 was actually a power structure, a hierarchical power structure,

415
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 and it was pushing the poor away and was only benefiting the rich and powerful.

416
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 And Jesus, being invited into a Pharisee's home,

417
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 because the Pharisee was expecting Jesus to give him something back,

418
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 whether pray for him, bless him, do something for his family, whatever it might be,

419
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 Jesus begins to stand against this prevailing thought,

420
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 and he flips everything upside down.

421
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 I want to read to you what Jesus actually says to the Pharisee and his host in Luke 14, verse 12.

422
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 Everybody okay?

423
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 Listen to this.

424
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 Now Jesus said to his host,

425
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 "When you give a luncheon or a dinner, do not invite your friends,

426
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 your brothers or your relatives, or your rich neighbors,

427
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 for if you do, they may invite you back so you will be repaid.

428
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind,

429
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 and you will be blessed.

430
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 Although they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous."

431
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 This is Jesus turning the table upside down, if you will.

432
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 He's saying to the Pharisee, "You've invited me here today because you're expecting me to give something back,

433
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 but here's the kind of table fellowship that is the reality in my kingdom."

434
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 And he names four communities for him to invite.

435
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 He says, "You've got to invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind."

436
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 And those four communities were exactly the four communities that the Pharisees thought had sinned,

437
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 and that's why they were ostracized.

438
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 Those were the communities that they didn't want to invite in because they thought they would become unclean if they invited them in.

439
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 Jesus names exactly those four.

440
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 And he says, "You want to know who should be at your dinner table?

441
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 It's the ones that you're currently keeping out.

442
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 It's the ones that have nothing to give you back.

443
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 It's the ones who when they come, they're only going to receive

444
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 because they've actually got nothing to give.

445
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 Those are the ones that should be at your table."

446
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 What Jesus is saying here is, "Here's your mindset to vulnerable communities that don't have resources.

447
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 If you have resources, you should open your table."

448
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 Come on, church.

449
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 If you have resources, if you have stuff, then you should open it towards those that don't.

450
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 Jesus' thinking is radical.

451
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 It's this.

452
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 "If some have food, all will eat."

453
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 What does that mean?

454
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 Not if some has food, everybody.

455
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 But if some have food, all will be able to eat.

456
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 Because the some that have will be generous in my kingdom,

457
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 and they will open up towards the some that do not.

458
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 Jesus' vision for community was where everybody was invited.

459
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 And the only way that everybody could be invited and sustained

460
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 is if those that had resources were generous towards those that would not.

461
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 Are you with me still?

462
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 I don't know if you've noticed, but over the last month, we had a local artist.

463
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 Her name is Erin Hung.

464
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 And she came and she painted one of the windows in Pacific Coffee downstairs.

465
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 It's the window facing Chef's Blend just on the opposite side of our street.

466
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 I want to show you a photo of that window that she created.

467
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 She drew this.

468
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 I love this.

469
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 "We are all humankind."

470
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 The idea is we are all made in the image of God, all carry value, equal dignity.

471
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 Notice the picture.

472
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 Lots of different cultures, lots of different people coming around a meal table,

473
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 all sharing together in a meal, everybody bringing the resource they have

474
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 so no one goes hungry, no one's left out, and everybody can connect together.

475
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 Do you see that picture?

476
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 And that's exactly what Jesus is talking about here.

477
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 He's saying, "If you have a dinner table, this is what you should be doing.

478
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 If you've got resources and there are those without in your community,

479
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 you should be thinking about how you can distribute those resources

480
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 so those in the community can also be a part of this table experience."

481
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 Now, I want you to see two things really quick here

482
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 that Jesus is emphasizing through this teaching to the Pharisees.

483
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 The first is this.

484
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 Notice how he says in the passage here.

485
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 He says, "Invite the very people who cannot repay you."

486
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 Ha! I love that.

487
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 "Invite the ones who are under no moral obligation to have to pay you back.

488
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 Invite the ones that even if they wanted to, they can't right now.

489
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 They've got nothing. There's nothing they can do to serve you.

490
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 You're literally selflessly, sacrificially serving them."

491
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 He's saying, "Invite those people."

492
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 This is radical economic grace.

493
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 I'll say that again.

494
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 It's radical economic grace.

495
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 It's Jesus saying, "Wouldn't it be amazing

496
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 if we gave our resources without any expectation of return,

497
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 without any expectation that they can give us anything back?"

498
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 This is the kind of table Jesus sees.

499
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 And I want you to know that at the branches of hope table,

500
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 the people that are sitting around that table are asylum seekers, refugees,

501
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 people caught in human trafficking,

502
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 people that are dealing with the ravages of war, sexually broken,

503
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 those that cannot get themselves up in Hong Kong culture and society,

504
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 those are the ones around our table.

505
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 And the beautiful thing is every single donation that comes into branches of hope,

506
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 what that donation does is it puts literal and metaphorical food on that table.

507
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 It provides literally food, food, water, sustenance in that way.

508
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 But it also provides finances to enable accommodation,

509
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 to help stand in the gap where there are material needs but also emotional needs.

510
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 The money that's given helps some people to be able to get counseling support

511
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 for their trauma or whatever it might be that they're going through.

512
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 Whatever is given into branches of hope, 100% of it gets on that table

513
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 so that those who could never pay us back

514
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 can actually get a step up in society around us.

515
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 This is the joy of the work we do.

516
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 We get the great joy of partnering with Jesus

517
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 in the radical economic grace that is found in his kingdom.

518
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 And whenever we do that, our reward is not with the person that we're giving to.

519
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 Our reward only will ever come at the end of all things

520
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 when Christ brings us into his kingdom

521
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 and we get to see everybody at that time,

522
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 nobody without the differences of resources,

523
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 but everybody coming together.

524
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 And we get to say that future should be a part of the world right now.

525
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 Because if in the future everybody is going to be equal,

526
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 why can we not use our resources today to begin to build a picture of what that future does?

527
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 And if we can do that, maybe people outside in the world today

528
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 will actually look at the church and its generosity

529
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 and see its radical economic grace and begin to think,

530
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 "Hey, let's not exploit profits over people."

531
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 I think I'm the only one here today. Hi guys. My name's Andrew.

532
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 Anybody else here?

533
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 Wouldn't it be great if companies didn't exploit profits over people?

534
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 Could it be that the church could be a place where radical economic grace is shown

535
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 through how we open up our meal tables?

536
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 Literal and metaphorical meal tables for the world

537
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 as we step in the gap to help those in need.

538
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 Are you with me still?

539
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 But here's the second thing.

540
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 And this is the one that, oh, this is so Jesus.

541
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 The second thing is he's telling the Pharisee,

542
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 "Open up your home and invite these guests in for a meal."

543
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 He's not talking about a takeaway restaurant.

544
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 He's not talking about a food pant or a delivery room.

545
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 He's not saying, "Write a check and just send it over to them."

546
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 He's saying, "Invite them in and have a relationship with them."

547
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 Because if they're going to sit at your table, you're going to be in proximity to them.

548
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 You're actually going to have to connect with them.

549
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 You're actually going to have to talk to them.

550
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 You're actually going to have to host them for a number of hours.

551
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 You're going to have to get to know their story.

552
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 A little bit like my friend who was standing at the hospital bed

553
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 decided to get to know the person's story.

554
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 This is the intimacy of what Jesus is doing.

555
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 He's saying this is not just about some charity.

556
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 This is actually about the work of justice.

557
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 You see, charity provides crumbs from a table.

558
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 Justice allows a seat at that table.

559
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 Are you with me?

560
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 See, for Jesus, radical economic grace was as much about relationship as it was about relief.

561
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 And relief was important because that needed to be there in order to bring them up into society.

562
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 But he was also trying to create an environment where the Pharisees would actually get to know the poor and the vulnerable and the marginalized

563
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 and those that they weren't getting to know because they were staying away from them.

564
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 Jesus is saying you need proximity.

565
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 I love the fact that with Jesus, he actually is with the poor far more than he talks about the poor.

566
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 I wonder if you've ever noticed that in Scripture.

567
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 He's actually with the vulnerable and the marginalized far more than he actually talks about the vulnerable and the marginalized.

568
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 I find that deeply challenging.

569
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 As I was preparing my message today, that was deeply challenging.

570
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 I'm like, do I talk at the Vine more about justice than I do justice?

571
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 Do I talk more about the vulnerable and the marginalized than I'm actually inviting them into my home, getting to know them?

572
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 That's a challenge for me as your apostle.

573
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 I wonder if that's a challenge for you.

574
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 That was Jesus' challenge to the Pharisees of his time.

575
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 He was saying, are you really willing to open your table, not just so that you can provide, but you can get to know?

576
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 See, Branches of Hope is committed to not just providing a relief to someone,

577
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 but actually putting that person in the very place where they can flourish in society the most.

578
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 That's what drives what we do.

579
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 We're not just about providing.

580
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 We're also about positioning.

581
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 Come on, church.

582
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 Not just about providing, but also about positioning.

583
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 Providing and positioning together.

584
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 Now, this really is summarized for Branches of Hope in the area of what we call, within Branches of Hope, economic emergency relief fund.

585
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
 It's our emergency relief fund.

586
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 Emergency relief fund is the idea of bringing together both relief and relationship and seeing those two things come together.

587
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 You see, there are so many people within Hong Kong society that are in need of emergency support.

588
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 Many of the clients that actually Branches of Hope supports are in need of emergency support.

589
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 See, we have finances already available to provide some of the programs that we run.

590
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 But so often when you're working with people in vulnerable communities, an emergency takes place.

591
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 Let's give you an example.

592
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 Recently, we see some of our asylum seekers are evicted all of a sudden from where they're living, and they're now homeless.

593
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 Well, in those times, Branches of Hope can pivot with their emergency relief fund and provide temporary accommodation,

594
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
 whilst longer-term accommodation is being sorted out.

595
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 Or for some of our vulnerable communities, they have a mental health issue.

596
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 A lot of them are dealing with deep traumas like Josephati that I spoke about earlier.

597
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 And they need counseling support to help them to get emotional balance again.

598
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 And again, sometimes there's an episode that happens, a psychological episode, that we at Branches of Hope,

599
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 we can step in with those emergency relief funds and help provide the kind of care that they need.

600
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 There's also sometimes medical issues.

601
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 You know, we all go through life, don't we, when we get sick or something happens,

602
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 and most of us either have insurance through work or finances that we can use to go to the doctor.

603
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
 With the vulnerable people that we're serving through Branches of Hope, they don't have those funds available.

604
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 So when they get sick, they need someone to help step in and provide immediate medical relief for them.

605
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 And that's also something we do through our emergency relief fund.

606
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
 Let me tell you this briefly about how this fund works.

607
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 It costs us right now about $68,000 a month in emergency relief work.

608
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 That's an average of what it is that we pay out in this emergency relief area, about $68,000.

609
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
 Now, $68,000 goes to serve asylum seekers, refugees, and those caught in human trafficking.

610
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 We serve about 20 clients a month with that $68,000.

611
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 So that money goes a long way to serve 20 people.

612
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,000
 Now, here are the ways in which we're actually serving them.

613
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 Housing, food, transport, medical expenses, legal costs, mental health support.

614
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 And over a one-year basis and an annual basis, that's roughly about $800,000.

615
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 And here's what we're wanting to do at all of our services across today on Branch of Hope Sunday.

616
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 We want to raise that amount.

617
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
 We want to raise $800,000 today.

618
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 And if we can do that, what we're doing is we're taking a huge burden off Alex's shoulders.

619
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
 And I work side by side with Alex pretty much every single day.

620
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,000
 And I know the pressures that their team are under, the burdens that they carry,

621
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 and the sacrificial ways in which they serve these communities.

622
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,000
 And if we, as a community of faith, were able to say, "You know what? Our table is big enough.

623
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
 Our table is a place where we can invite people in.

624
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 We have resources that we can give in a way that we don't expect anything back."

625
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 I think if we could raise $800,000, we're standing in the gap today.

626
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 And we're taking a huge burden off of Alex and his team's shoulders.

627
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,000
 And we're saying that emergency money that you need on a monthly basis to pivot as soon as you need to pivot,

628
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
 that money's in the bank.

629
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 We're setting that aside for you so that you can keep your table open.

630
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,000
 Because the worst thing that happens is when there's not enough resources, tables get closed.

631
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,000
 But when we see the resources flowing across the kingdom, we can keep a seat open for people.

632
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 People like Matthew.

633
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
 Let me tell you about Matthew.

634
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 Matthew came to Hong Kong from a South Asian country.

635
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 He was persecuted for his religion in that country.

636
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
 And he fled to Hong Kong and he claimed asylum at the border here.

637
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 He was put in detention for a period of time.

638
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:23,000
 And after coming out of detention, he found himself on the Kowloon side, the Chipsaw Choy side of Star Ferry.

639
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
 And when he's standing there, he bumps into somebody from his country.

640
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
 So he begins to chat with them.

641
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
 Turns out that person also is here as an asylum seeker.

642
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
 And that person's a client of Branches of Hope.

643
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
 So Matthew gets invited to Branches of Hope.

644
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 He comes along and hears about our services.

645
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 And he's somebody that we use the emergency relief fund to help in that initial period.

646
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:47,000
 Get him off the streets, in the temporary accommodation, and get him set up for his time in our city.

647
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 Matthew has become, over time, a member here of the Vy Turch.

648
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 He's with us every single Sunday.

649
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:59,000
 And Matthew's also passionate about going back into the detention centers to serve the asylum seekers there.

650
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
 Because he knew what it was to be there himself without anybody coming visiting him.

651
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:09,000
 So he now goes on a regular basis to the detention centers in Hong Kong, visiting asylum seekers, so that he can bridge the gap for them.

652
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:15,000
 Matthew is someone who was met through emergency relief fund, but now becomes a flourishing member of society.

653
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
 Or I could tell you about Namala.

654
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
 Namala, who comes from also a South Asian country near here.

655
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
 And Namala's husband in that country was injured.

656
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,000
 And so much so that Namala suddenly had to provide for her whole family.

657
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
 And she knew that she couldn't do that by staying in her country.

658
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,000
 So she heard about an agency that was hiring people to be domestic workers in Hong Kong.

659
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
 She signs up with this agency, but the agency's a bit of a scam.

660
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 And she gets to Hong Kong and she finds herself in labor exploitation.

661
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
 Her actual employer here abused her deeply.

662
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:55,000
 And so much so that she makes the brave decision to flee out of the house and make her living on the street.

663
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:01,000
 Well, she comes into contact with Stopper, Stop Trafficking of Persons work within Branches of Hope.

664
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:11,000
 And there they're able to take her in and help her get her off the street and get her also operating again as a normal functioning person in society through the emergency relief fund that we have.

665
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:24,000
 And through that process, she is now in a place where she's looking forward to actually going back to her home country and starting an NGO there that does work in the very areas that she found herself struggling with here in Hong Kong.

666
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
 That's somebody who's a seed of growth.

667
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:34,000
 This is the work that happens through Branches of Hope and through this idea of our emergency relief fund.

668
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:43,000
 And so in a moment, I'm going to call you to be a host of a table, to be willing to dip into the resources God has given you.

669
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,000
 And in this room, I know that there's a broad social economic demographic.

670
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
 There's some people in here that are very wealthy and some of us that are not so wealthy.

671
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
 Whatever it is, it's not about anything to do with that.

672
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:01,000
 It's about whatever it is that God has blessed you with, regardless if it's a lot or a little, the call is the same.

673
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:11,000
 You have a theoanthropological imperative to respond out of love and honor to those in the community around you who desperately need help.

674
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:30,000
 And I believe that as we open up the tables, both within Branches of Hope and here at Divine Church, we will be able to stand together on behalf of these vulnerable communities to make sure that nobody feels like they are unclean or defiled, but everybody feels welcomed into a community that grows.

675
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
 Amen?

676
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
 I wonder whether you would stand with me.

677
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
 I'm going to invite you to do a couple of things as we do this together.

678
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
 First of all, I want to get your little pouch that you had earlier that Ellison talked you through.

679
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
 I want you to open up your pouch.

680
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
 Inside that pouch, there is a prayer guide.

681
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,000
 That prayer guide has been put together by John and Tony, our founding senior pastors here at Divine.

682
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
 And that prayer guide, we're going to go through in just a moment.

683
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
 And we're going to actually pray the first day of that prayer guide together.

684
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
 But let me tell you about what's going to happen after that.

685
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
 After that, we're going to have a time of worship together.

686
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
 And I want you to understand that this is the most important part of our service.

687
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
 I want everybody's attention right now.

688
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
 Can everybody please look at me?

689
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
 Everybody stop moving and look at me.

690
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
 Thank you.

691
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
 Thank you.

692
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
 Okay.

693
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
 This is the most important part of today.

694
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
 In a moment, we're going to have a time of worship.

695
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
 And during that time of worship, I'm going to invite you to give.

696
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
 And I believe across services, we're going to raise that $800,000 together.

697
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
 Now, as you give, you have the opportunity to do that in multiple ways.

698
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
 There are baskets right here in the lower house and two in the front.

699
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
 So two in the middle just here, two in the front.

700
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
 In the upper house, there are two baskets at the top.

701
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
 On your seat are envelopes, blue envelopes, okay?

702
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,000
 Those blue envelopes are a way for you to put any money in there, a check in there.

703
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
 If you want to put in your credit card details and credit card amount, you can put that in there.

704
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
 And in a moment when we're worshiping, you'll be able to drop that in the basket.

705
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
 If you want to pay directly by credit card today,

706
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:05,000
 you can even do that with our credit card machines, our Branches of Hope team right out here on the second floor have credit card machines.

707
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:11,000
 You can go to them, and you can make a one-off donation to Branches of Hope directly through your credit card, through the machines also.

708
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:16,000
 And you'll be invited to do that during our worship time in a moment if that is what you would like to do.

709
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
 We also have ways of giving digitally.

710
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
 Those are going to be on the screen during our worship time.

711
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,000
 So once again, you can also give digitally if you would prefer to do that.

712
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,000
 However you might do it, we want to invite you to stand with us today.

713
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
 Whatever God puts on your heart is exactly what it is that you are to give today.

714
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,000
 But before we do that, let's go into this in a place of prayer.

715
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
 And I'm going to invite Alex to lead us in day one of your prayer.

716
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
 So if you get the prayer guide, open up to day one.

717
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,000
 There's some places for you to respond in the guide as well.

718
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:52,000
 So, Abdi, our daily theme for Sunday is finance.

719
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:58,000
 Lord God, thank you that when you created humanity, you made us like you.

720
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
 That we might show your goodness and grace to others.

721
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:08,000
 But we have disregarded your plans and instead have become aggressive and look for ways to deceive and exploit others.

722
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:19,000
 We ask you to look down on your people again, Lord God, and hear the cry of those who are enslaved, abused and downtrodden by others.

723
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:28,000
 Lord, lift the veil of deceit which hides these crimes from being exposed and release those who are often trapped by their own shame.

724
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,000
 Lord, hear my cry for justice.

725
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:41,000
 We thank you for the team in Righteous of Hope and who have worked tirelessly to meet the needs of those who struggle with finance and the daily provision in life.

726
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:47,000
 Thank you for the help that our government offers and for those who have generously given to help them.

727
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:56,000
 We pray for the Vine Church who have generously gifted the administrative costs for Righteous of Hope, allowing for all donations to be given to help the recipients.

728
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
 Lord, bless this gift.

729
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,000
 Lord, we pray for the needs of Righteous of Hope.

730
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:11,000
 We thank you for the programs that have been designed to serve those who are victims of trafficking and the asylum-seeker and refugee community.

731
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:18,000
 We trust you to provide for our needs and touch the hearts of those who would be moved to support financially.

732
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
 Lord, hear my prayer.

733
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
 Stir up my compassion.

734
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:35,000
 So I invite you just to take a moment to reflect, to pray, and when you're ready you can fill out the envelope, you can give, you can move out towards the buckets during the worship time, you can give during this time.

735
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,000
 But let's do this in an attitude of prayer and worship.

736
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:49,000
