[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400]   For your glory, Lord Jesus.
[00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.200]   And everyone says, "Amen."
[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.200]   Amen.
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.880]   Hey, can we thank our worship team as always?
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.520]   Thank you guys so much.
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.480]   Have a seat.
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.280]   You know, I think it's pretty clear and beautiful that God is doing something new amongst us
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.280]   here at the Vine.
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.520]   It's something that we've been sensing over the last number of weeks.
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.000]   And what I want to do today is actually lean into that a little bit and talk to you a little
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.720]   bit about what I think some of this new thing is that God is doing amongst us.
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.880]   And in two weeks' time, we're going to have Vision Sunday on the 2nd of March, as Carla
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:35.880]   shared earlier.
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.920]   And on that Sunday, I want to actually put a lot more flesh around the bones of what
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.320]   we're sensing the Holy Spirit wants to do in and through the life of the Vine in the
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.320]   year ahead.
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.920]   So I'm really excited about that.
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.600]   But as I was preparing my heart for the message for Vision Sunday, I felt like the Lord said
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.360]   there's something that needs to be said before we get there.
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.800]   And so today, I wanted to take a time, just as a one-off message, to teach around something
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.360]   that I feel is important to prepare us for Vision Sunday, but also is a reflection of
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.080]   this new thing that I think God is doing amongst us right now.
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.560]   And we've been saying here at the Vine that what God is calling us to this year is a year
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.240]   of action.
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.900]   That He's calling us to be a church, to be people, to be individuals who live our faith
[00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.280]   much more publicly in the year ahead.
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.380]   What I want to do today is tell you why I think that is the case.
[00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:37.000]   Why I think God is taking us from a year of intimacy last year to a year of action this
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.680]   year, and in doing that, prepare our hearts for what God's going to say to us in two weeks'
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.680]   time.
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:50.040]   I think it's really important to understand that the Scriptures always connect the activity
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.560]   of God to the worship and proclamation of His glory.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.780]   There's always a connection between when God does something and the response of His people
[00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.360]   in the glorification and the worship of Him.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.080]   When God moves, God's people respond.
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.000]   When God speaks, God's people declare.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.920]   When God's presence is here, God's people worship.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.320]   One of the beautiful things about the Vine over almost 30 years now that the Vine has
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.400]   been going here in Hong Kong is that we have been incredibly blessed by moments of worship.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.120]   In fact, I would say, and I've been around pretty much since the beginning, I would say
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.560]   that pretty much every single Sunday, God shows up in some form, His presence in some
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.920]   form in our worship.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.120]   One of the things that we can honor is the fact that God has often used the Vine in a
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.760]   place of worship.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.120]   In fact, in our newcomers' nights, when we hold those as a church, we always ask people,
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.480]   "Why is it that you come to the Vine?"
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.400]   I would say nine times out of ten, people will say, "Well, we're here because of the
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.400]   worship.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.400]   We love the worship.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.840]   When we come in here, it's not just about the music that's played and the skill of our
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.440]   team," although, of course, they have skill.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.800]   People's reflection is, "When I come to the Vine, I feel God's presence.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.280]   I sense God is here.
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.600]   I encounter God's presence when I'm here in this place."
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.220]   That's a beautiful thing.
[00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.080]   God has magnified, I think, through the gift of worship here at the Vine over some 30 years,
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.360]   his presence among us.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.600]   Now, there's a danger to that, though.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.000]   The danger to that is that we think, therefore, that that is what worship is.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.720]   That worship is, therefore, coming to a building with a group of people to sing some songs
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.040]   and encounter the presence of God.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.600]   We come to think that worship is primarily defined by this idea of something that happens
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:48.160]   for 90 minutes as we gather together as Christians, fellow believers, in a closed environment,
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.160]   and we think that that's worship.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.840]   And so we talk to each other about, "Oh, I can't wait to go to worship this Sunday."
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.120]   Does that make sense?
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:02.000]   And we begin to think that this gathering and what happens here is the totality of what
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.720]   it is to experience the presence of God.
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:05.720]   And here's the thing.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.120]   If we're really going to be a church that is going to take our faith much more seriously
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:17.640]   and begin to live out our faith much more publicly in the year ahead, we cannot do so
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:24.680]   until we redefine how we think about worship from an experience in a room to a lifestyle
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.160]   in the world.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.840]   Our worship has to be not just an experience in a room, but it has to be a lifestyle that
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.800]   we're living out there in the world.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.680]   And we love the experience in the room.
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.640]   And here at The Vine, we're going to continue to lean into that.
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.600]   We're going to continue to invest our resources and our heart and our prayers so that when
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.840]   we gather here, we do experience the presence of God.
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.520]   But what we have to realize is that this gathering and this experience of the presence of God
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.320]   is only one part of what worship truly is.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:04.160]   In fact, what we do in this room is actually more a modern day thing than it is a biblical
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.160]   thing.
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.280]   That does not mean it's wrong or bad.
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.080]   It's amazing to gather like this, and we love to gather like this, and we will continue
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.200]   to gather like this.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.120]   But when the Scriptures think of worship, when the Scriptures speak about worship, they
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:23.040]   speak about something much grander and broader and more holistic and more a complete lifestyle
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:29.640]   than some songs sung behind closed doors with people.
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.720]   If I could say it clearly, I would say this.
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:39.360]   I think one of the new things that God is saying amongst us is that maybe our worship
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:46.040]   and ultimately our faith is far too private.
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.040]   Far too private.
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:53.800]   And what I want to say to us here this morning is why I think God is saying we need to shift
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:00.920]   from a private embrace of faith to a much more public walking out of faith.
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:06.200]   And to do so, I want to base it in one of my favorite Psalms, Psalm 40.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.200]   I'm just going to read the first three verses of this incredible Psalm.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.840]   If you haven't read Psalm 40 in its entirety, you can do so later today.
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.760]   I would encourage you to do so because it expands on the themes I'm talking about this
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:17.760]   morning.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.560]   But I want to just focus in on the first three verses.
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:26.080]   Psalm 40 says this, "I waited patiently for the Lord and He turned to me and He heard
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.480]   my cry.
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:32.680]   He lifted me out of the slimy pit, out of the mud and the mire, and He set my feet on
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.680]   a rock.
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.480]   He gave me a firm place to stand.
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.780]   He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God.
[00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:47.200]   He will see and fear and put their trust in the Lord."
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.840]   I love what David's doing here.
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.160]   The Psalm is appropriated to David.
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.240]   Whether actually David wrote it or not, we don't know.
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.320]   But let's just assume that it did, that he did write this Psalm.
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.320]   It says that he did.
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.540]   So let's just take that as truth.
[00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:02.040]   So I love what David's doing here.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.160]   He's writing into the church.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.960]   He's writing this beautiful poem, this song that would be sung.
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.280]   And he's basically saying, "Look, you need to understand what happened in my life."
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.600]   He's like, "Things haven't always been great.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.780]   There have been seasons of trial and difficulty, and there have been seasons where I've had
[00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:17.720]   to wait on the Lord."
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:23.020]   He describes what's happening in his life here as like a slimy, slippery pit.
[00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:28.360]   And in this beautiful kind of poetic language, he says, "I waited on the Lord.
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.800]   The Lord turned to me.
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:30.920]   He heard my cry."
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:36.680]   And he says, "He lifts me out of a place of slipperiness, and He places me on a solid
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:37.680]   ground."
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:42.360]   So this beautiful kind of metaphor and imagery behind where David was saying, "I was slipping.
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.240]   I was losing faith.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.400]   Things were overwhelming to me, but I was waiting patiently for the Lord."
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.400]   I love this.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.920]   He's like, "I still had hope.
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:55.560]   Even though things were really hard, I was patiently waiting for God to come."
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:00.900]   I must have prayed for over 50 people over the three services last week personally, laying
[00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:05.640]   my hands on, having a conversation and prayer with about 50 people on Sunday last week.
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:06.640]   Beautiful.
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:10.960]   And I think every single person, I think they would kind of reveal what David is saying
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:11.960]   here.
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.880]   They would say, "Hey, I'm in a hard situation.
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.880]   Things are not going how I want them to go, but I have faith.
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.180]   I have hope.
[00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:22.520]   And I'm coming forward right now for prayer because I believe that God can change my situation."
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:27.880]   And I love for David how he's saying, "Things are really slippery and bad, but I'm waiting
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:28.880]   patiently."
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:33.480]   And then he declares, this is his testimony, and I believe for the 50 people I prayed for,
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:38.360]   for like the whole church that we as a staff and leaders all prayed for last week, our
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:44.320]   prayer is that you will also turn into a testimony of how God comes, acts, responds, and changes
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.560]   things.
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:50.040]   And David gives this glory here right at the start of the psalm and says, "God changed
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.920]   my situation from slipperiness to solid ground."
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.000]   But notice this.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.720]   He doesn't just say that God has changed my circumstance.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.920]   What he's ultimately saying is God has changed me.
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:06.200]   He's saying God hasn't just done something where he's taken me out of a hard time into
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.200]   a new time.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:14.560]   He's actually changed something so profoundly inside of me that I am now a different person.
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.780]   This is what verse three is about.
[00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:21.960]   Verse one and two, he's laying out the situation, but in verse three, he's saying, "There has
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:27.080]   been a profound change within me, and because there is something that has changed in me,
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:33.280]   I cannot help but proclaim what it is that God has done inside of me."
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.000]   Let me read verse three again to you.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.520]   He says, "He's put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God.
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:46.280]   Many will see and fear and put their trust in the Lord."
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:51.280]   I want to step you through this verse, and I'm going to unpack it in detail with you
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.280]   bit by bit.
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:58.040]   The first thing he says is he's put a new song, a new song.
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:01.800]   It's this beautiful thought for David that because God has come and done what God has
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:07.800]   done, there's something now inside of him that was not there before.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.880]   He describes it as this new song.
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:14.120]   Now, in the Greek New Testament, now this is the Old Testament written in Hebrew, in
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:18.060]   the Greek New Testament, there are two Greek words for the word new.
[00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:22.840]   There's neos, which basically means something new from something that was old, so like the
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.440]   idea of restoring an old thing.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:30.120]   And then there's this word kainos, which we also translate new in our New Testament, but
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:34.280]   that word in the Greek actually literally means something new that has never existed
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.440]   before.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:39.920]   So it's a brand new thing, not just a new thing polished up from something old, but
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.600]   something completely new.
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:46.680]   Now although this is of course written in the Hebrew, in the Greek Roman Empire when
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:52.520]   they actually came to write the Old Testament in Greek, it's called the LXX, that's the
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.840]   name for this Greek Old Testament.
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:59.720]   The word they chose to describe the new here is the word kainos.
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:04.320]   So what they're saying is that David is basically exhorting to his people that God has done
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.800]   something in him that has never been done before.
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.640]   This is not a new thing of like, "Hey, he's taken some of my old things and polished them
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.080]   up and tried to make them better."
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:19.080]   He's saying, "No, what's inside of me, this song that is inside of me is completely and
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.960]   utterly brand new.
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:25.840]   And then because it's so brand new, I want to bring a proclamation, an explanation.
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.920]   I want to tell about it because it's something completely that has never happened to me ever
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:30.920]   before."
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:34.360]   I love the fire and the passion that is inside of him.
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.800]   Now notice what he says.
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:40.520]   He says, "He put the new song in me."
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:41.520]   I like this.
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:44.120]   He didn't say, "I earned the new song."
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:49.560]   "Oh, I prayed hard and I deserve the new song."
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:55.440]   He says, "You have to understand that God, even though I was waiting patiently, I was
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.240]   hopeful as so many of you were last week.
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.800]   I'm hopeful for change, but it's God who's responded.
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.080]   It's God who's acted.
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.840]   It's God who's done the new thing.
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.400]   He's the one who's put it inside of me."
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.960]   And it's important for David to express this to Israel, to express that this testimony
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:15.720]   has come from God because he doesn't want Israel to think that they can earn the new
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.720]   thing.
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:21.500]   And one of the things that we at the Vine have to be really careful with as God continues
[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:26.520]   to do a new thing amongst us is that we begin to think, "Oh, this is because of 30 years
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:28.640]   of faithful service to Hong Kong.
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.920]   Oh, this is because we're doing some really good things.
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.800]   Oh, this is because everybody's leaning into worship.
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:38.360]   Oh, this is because we're praying some pretty desperate prayers."
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:43.480]   And all of those things are helpful in our ongoing discipleship of being with Jesus,
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:48.720]   but we have to understand that the new thing God is doing amongst us is His prerogative.
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.640]   It's His sovereignty.
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.720]   It's His decision.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:57.080]   He's put it in us.
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:00.840]   The danger we have is that when we see the new thing that's happening and we connect
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:06.000]   it to ourselves, what we come to think is not worship but worth it.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.320]   Are you with me, church?
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:15.360]   And our worship actually is diminished because we think we're worth it.
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:19.880]   And we have to make sure that we're linking ourselves in this very clear thought.
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:23.600]   It is not our song, it is His.
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.560]   It's not our song, it is His.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:33.320]   I wanted to take a moment just to really honor Emma and Jethro and the worship leaders and
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:39.440]   the worship staff and team here at the Vine because I know personally that the platform
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:43.160]   and a platform ministry is very seductive.
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.600]   It's very seductive to pride.
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:49.320]   It's very seductive to getting a big head and thinking that you're responsible for all
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.320]   this stuff.
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:54.520]   There's a lot of stress and pressure that comes on a platform type ministry.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:59.720]   And I think one of the reasons why we're seeing such a response amongst you in a place of
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:05.640]   worship is because I honestly have seen Emma and Jethro not on stage but off the stage.
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:09.560]   I've seen the hours and the time that they put into praying and walking with people in
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:13.420]   our church to fostering a humility.
[00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:17.720]   And I believe that one of the reasons why God is doing a new thing is because they've
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:21.400]   committed themselves to going, "That's not our song, it's His."
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.360]   It's not about us, it's about Him.
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.480]   He's doing something, we need to respond to what He is doing.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.240]   He's put it here.
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:32.880]   And our role is to steward what He's put, not to think that we've earned it or we deserve
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.620]   it.
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:38.680]   And I think as we hold on to that, we become the most authentic versions of ourselves that
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:39.680]   we can be.
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:45.880]   Your worship will always be the most authentically glorifying when you constantly remind yourself
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.880]   that it's not your song, it's His.
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.380]   Come on, church.
[00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:54.620]   That's when our worship becomes the most authentically glorifying because we know it's got nothing
[00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:55.620]   to do with us.
[00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:56.620]   Are you with me?
[00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:58.900]   So there's a new thing that God is doing here at the Vine.
[00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:02.700]   There's a new song and He has put it in us.
[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:04.860]   Now I want you to see what He then says.
[00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:10.020]   He says, "He has put this new song," notice this, "in my mouth."
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:13.860]   The first thing He says here, I want you to see, He said, "My mouth."
[00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:19.500]   He doesn't say, "God has done this new thing and He's put a new song in our mouths."
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.100]   He didn't say, "He's put a new song in Israel's mouth."
[00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.900]   He actually says, "No, the new song, it's in my mouth."
[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:31.100]   In other words, I have a personal connection to the new thing that God is doing.
[00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:35.460]   He's just said in verses 1 and 2, His testimony of what God's doing.
[00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:38.220]   He's saying, "It's in my mouth."
[00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:39.700]   And here's what I'm convinced.
[00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:43.660]   If the Vine is really going to be a church that's going to move into action with the
[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:48.780]   gospel in our city, it's only going to happen when every single one of us in the church
[00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:52.020]   goes, "I've got a song in my mouth."
[00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:54.260]   This is not about Andrew's vision.
[00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.380]   This is not about some worship team and what they do.
[00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:59.380]   This is not about the fact that I'm just showing up on a Sunday and I guess I'm a part of the
[00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:00.380]   Vine.
[00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:04.700]   No, I'm taking responsibility for the gospel that's in me.
[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.140]   It's in my mouth.
[00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:13.100]   Oh, what's the new song that He has put in your mouth to sing?
[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:16.980]   That's the primary question you should be asking yourself in a year when God's calling
[00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:18.420]   the church into action.
[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:23.660]   What is it that you've got to sing in our city of Hong Kong this year?
[00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:24.820]   And I want to be really clear with this.
[00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:26.300]   This is really important.
[00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:33.500]   Somebody else's song is not your new song to sing.
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.620]   Somebody else's song is not your new song to sing.
[00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:41.140]   Now that doesn't mean that we can't be moved to worship because of somebody else's testimony.
[00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:42.460]   Of course we can.
[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.600]   We saw this last week in our services.
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.620]   At the start of each of our services last week, we asked somebody in the congregation
[00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:52.420]   to testify to what God had done in their lives and as they testified, everybody was called
[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:53.420]   into worship.
[00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:54.580]   It was a profound thing.
[00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:58.140]   We often worship off the back of somebody else's testimony.
[00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:01.500]   That's a legitimate, valid, great thing.
[00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:06.540]   But I think the thing that God is really calling us to this year is to say that somebody else's
[00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:11.380]   song shouldn't be the foundation or the basis to every part of my worship.
[00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:12.940]   Now I have a song.
[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:14.060]   He's done something in me.
[00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.940]   The gospel has been personal to me.
[00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:21.380]   It's changed something in my life and if I do not open my mouth and sing, the world
[00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:25.540]   will not hear the unique thing that Christ has done for me.
[00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:28.860]   It's in my mouth.
[00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:32.620]   That's a responsibility of that, which is funny because David's just said, "It's God's
[00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:33.620]   song."
[00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:40.140]   But then he said, "Because it's God's song doesn't mean I'm devoid of responsibility.
[00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:45.380]   God has decided in his sovereignty to put that song in my mouth."
[00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:49.020]   So I have a decision.
[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:53.020]   Notice that decision is highlighted because he says, "In my mouth."
[00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:54.020]   I love this.
[00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:58.820]   I don't know about you, but I think it would have been maybe sensible for David to say,
[00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.740]   "God has placed a new song in my heart."
[00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:04.700]   Wouldn't that make theological sense?
[00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:06.100]   That kind of makes more sense to me.
[00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:08.060]   Like God has placed it in my heart.
[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:09.540]   But he doesn't say that.
[00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:10.940]   He doesn't say it's in my heart.
[00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:14.820]   He says it's in my mouth because I think David is trying to challenge Israel.
[00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:18.820]   I think God is trying to challenge us at the vine to realize that if David has said, "It's
[00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:23.300]   in my heart," what he's basically saying is, "It's a private thing for me.
[00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:24.780]   It's in my heart.
[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:25.780]   It's changed me inside."
[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:31.060]   It's like Mary who experiences the activities of God and scripture says, "She hides them
[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:32.060]   in her heart."
[00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:35.260]   David's not saying that.
[00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:36.260]   He's saying, "No, no.
[00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:37.260]   It's not in my heart.
[00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:38.260]   It might be in my heart.
[00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:39.260]   It's changed my heart.
[00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:40.260]   It's changed.
[00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:41.260]   But it's in my mouth."
[00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:46.820]   This thing that God is doing that I have a personal responsibility for because it's happened
[00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:50.260]   to me, he says, "I need to proclaim it.
[00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:53.900]   It's in my mouth because it's not something that should be private.
[00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.380]   It's something that should be public.
[00:18:56.380 --> 00:19:00.340]   It's something that I should say or act or do or be.
[00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:02.620]   It's something that needs to be shown in the world.
[00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:04.900]   If it was just in my heart, then fine.
[00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:05.900]   It's private.
[00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:06.900]   It's for me.
[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:07.900]   I need to wrestle with it."
[00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:13.740]   No, he's put it in my mouth because there's something publicly that he wants me to do
[00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:16.420]   with the song that he's placed in me.
[00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:17.820]   Follow this?
[00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:21.260]   "It's in my mouth," he's saying.
[00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:26.020]   And I think that's so profound because so often we wrestle with this.
[00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.180]   Here's the thing I think I personally wrestle with.
[00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:35.780]   I get so used to making my faith so private that I think my mouth has lost its muscle
[00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:39.460]   memory.
[00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:43.900]   And I wonder whether that's the reality for many of us, that we become so used to our
[00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:49.380]   faith being so private and personal to us and so good for us that we've actually lost
[00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:57.180]   the ability to speak in the public realm about what it is that Christ has done in us.
[00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:58.180]   And it's not in our mouths.
[00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:00.620]   It's just in our hearts.
[00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:04.300]   The Bible says out of the heart, the mouth speaks.
[00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.380]   So what's here needs to come out here.
[00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:08.220]   And I think David's emphasizing that.
[00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:12.240]   Here's some reasons why I think we've lost our muscle memory of our mouths.
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.860]   I think sometimes we're afraid to say the things that God has done in us.
[00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:16.940]   And that's understandable.
[00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:18.740]   It's a scary thing at times.
[00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:24.460]   But that fear can actually hold us back from having the courage to be a proclaimer of the
[00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:26.460]   things that God has done in our lives.
[00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:33.140]   I think the other reason why we don't speak or live or act in public the way we might
[00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:38.820]   in private is because we've seen other Christians do such a bad job of it.
[00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:44.060]   And the last thing we want to do is join the chorus of Bible bashes, people who are smacking
[00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:45.420]   people on the head with the Bible.
[00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:49.540]   The last thing we want to do is take that loud hailer and scream at people.
[00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:53.260]   The last thing we want to do is become like a street corner prophet.
[00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:58.580]   And because we've seen such bad examples of how people have tried to exclaim their faith,
[00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:02.900]   we're like, "I'm just going to live this private faith because I want to distance myself.
[00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:05.380]   I don't want to join in with these other people."
[00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:11.780]   Just because some people have done it badly doesn't mean it's a bad thing to do.
[00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:16.180]   Just because some people have made the name of Christ bad doesn't mean Christ's name is
[00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:17.180]   bad.
[00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:21.740]   And perhaps what is happening here at the church is God is lighting a fire amongst us
[00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:30.180]   to be more creative, more interesting, more wise, more subtle, more bold, more just revolutionary
[00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:35.420]   in how we think about presenting the gospel because it's in me, it's in my mouth, it's
[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:36.420]   personal.
[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:37.420]   I have a testimony.
[00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:38.420]   I want to say it.
[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:46.260]   Oh, he's put it there so that others might know.
[00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.540]   Which is why he then says this.
[00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:51.140]   He then says, here's what he's put in my mouth.
[00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:55.580]   He says, "A hymn of praise to our God."
[00:21:55.580 --> 00:22:02.620]   The Hebrew here, the theme, the kind of topic that he's talking about is this idea of hallelujah.
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:07.140]   And the word hallelujah is a word that gets repeated a lot in the Old Testament in particular.
[00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:11.700]   We sing it in our songs today, but I think we often misunderstand what the word hallelujah
[00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:13.380]   is about.
[00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:17.180]   The word hallelujah literally means praise God.
[00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:21.740]   But when we come to think of it in our modern context, we often think that it's a exclamation.
[00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:24.020]   Praise God!
[00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:27.140]   Like we think it's like a God is awesome kind of thing.
[00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:28.140]   That's what we think.
[00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:33.100]   And we actually use often in our modern worship songs, we actually use the word hallelujah
[00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:37.180]   as this like, kind of like, woohoo, God is awesome kind of thing.
[00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:39.860]   And therefore it becomes a very Christian word, right?
[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:44.980]   It becomes a very private to Christians word.
[00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:48.060]   Actually the word hallelujah in the Hebrew, in the original way that it's written, it
[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:52.940]   does mean praise God, but it's a command, not an exclamation.
[00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:55.020]   So it's not, "Woohoo, praise God!"
[00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:56.380]   It's praise God.
[00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:59.820]   That's what hallelujah means.
[00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:01.680]   It doesn't mean, "Woohoo!"
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:05.380]   It means, "Get off your butt and praise God."
[00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:08.880]   That's the English Andrew translation of the Hebrew word.
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.060]   Get off your butt and praise God.
[00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:11.060]   That's what it means.
[00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:16.420]   In other words, when you read it in the Old Testament, people of God are challenging one
[00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:20.220]   another to be public with their faith.
[00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:25.260]   To not just hide it privately inside of themselves, but to say something that matters in the world.
[00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:26.740]   Get up and praise God!
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:29.940]   Go into your office tomorrow and praise God.
[00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:35.320]   Go live a life that shows the grace of God, that shows that God has done something inside
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:36.320]   of you.
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:38.960]   So when he says it, he's put a hymn of praise in my mouth.
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:45.160]   He's not just doing a proclamation, he's doing an invitation.
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:50.700]   He's saying, "Here's what it is that God has done for me in my life, and here's how you
[00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:54.540]   could experience a God just like that."
[00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:59.660]   It's a proclamation and an invitation.
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:01.660]   That's the word hallelujah.
[00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:08.520]   Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:14.540]   Now notice how he wraps this up as I wrap this up.
[00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:17.700]   He says this, we're not going to do that at the 11.
[00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:22.100]   He says this.
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:23.300]   That's going to totally get cut.
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:26.740]   I know, and put on like a loop somewhere.
[00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:27.980]   Okay.
[00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:36.740]   So he says this, he says, "Many will see and fear and put their trust in the Lord."
[00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:40.580]   This is David saying, "Here's the result of what happens when we take our faith from a
[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:43.060]   private thing to a public thing."
[00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:46.600]   He says, "Many will see and fear and put their trust in the Lord."
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:51.220]   Now notice what he says here, because the more natural thing for him to say, he's just
[00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:52.880]   been talking about the mouth.
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.780]   He's been talking about a song.
[00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:56.300]   He's been talking about singing.
[00:24:56.300 --> 00:25:00.880]   The more natural thing for David to write here is, he's put this thing, "And many will
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:05.220]   hear and fear and put their trust in the Lord."
[00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:06.220]   He doesn't say that.
[00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:08.100]   This is weird.
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:11.300]   Like if you follow the logic, he should say, "Many will hear here."
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:12.300]   He doesn't say it.
[00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:15.100]   He says, "Many will see."
[00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:20.180]   And what he's challenging himself, and I think Israel with, is that when we proclaim the
[00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:25.220]   name of Jesus, we got to be careful not just to say some things and live in a different
[00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:26.900]   way.
[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:31.540]   We got to be careful not just to speak out something and live a lifestyle that's completely
[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:32.540]   different.
[00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:36.740]   But actually, what will truly cause people to fear the Lord and put their trust in Him
[00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:40.220]   is when you live the things that come out of your mouth.
[00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:44.820]   When they see the new song that is inside of you, not hear the new song that's inside
[00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:45.940]   of you.
[00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:51.220]   When they actually begin to see you living in such a way that they cannot deny the reality
[00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:53.420]   that God has stepped in and changed this person's life.
[00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:58.140]   "Oh, I remember the old Andrew.
[00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:03.300]   But now I see the new Andrew, and something has happened to that Andrew."
[00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.260]   Are you with me?
[00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:07.180]   Or whatever it might be for you.
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:11.220]   David said, "God has put this new thing that He's never done before, and He's put it inside
[00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:13.540]   of my mouth because He wants me to proclaim it.
[00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:20.180]   But I recognize that if I'm just proclaiming it, and I'm not living in it, I'm not embracing
[00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:25.460]   it, it's not changing how I act and think, how I purchase, how I consume, how I think
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:26.460]   more justly.
[00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:31.540]   It's not acting, it's not impacting my generosity, or the ways in which I'm speaking and teaching
[00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:35.620]   people, or the ways in which I'm walking with people, or the ways in which I'm just living
[00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:37.300]   more graciously and more loving.
[00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:41.580]   If it's not doing that, then it's not doing anything," he's saying.
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:47.320]   Because people will fear and trust and put their hope in the Lord when they see the reality
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:50.460]   of God's work in this world.
[00:26:50.460 --> 00:27:01.740]   See, when the church begins to live publicly the complete redemption that has happened
[00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:08.100]   inside of them privately, when they actually show the world the love of Jesus and not just
[00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:13.060]   speak of it, when they actually lay their lives down and not just talk about a God who
[00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:21.320]   has done so, then many will see and fear and put their trust in the Lord.
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:27.820]   And I think the great question that God is asking the vine this year is simply this,
[00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:34.220]   if we're really going to put our faith into action this year, can people see our worship
[00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:40.200]   as much as they can hear our worship?
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:45.700]   Can you see the new song?
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:50.420]   This is the why of why I think God is calling us into this year of action, because 92% of
[00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:53.060]   the people in this city don't know Jesus.
[00:27:53.060 --> 00:28:00.020]   92% of the people that we're living around every day don't know Jesus, and we love to
[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:01.340]   gather on a Sunday.
[00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:04.020]   I love to gather like this and to worship like this.
[00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:08.420]   But what I'm more excited about this year is that we would continue to gather like this
[00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:11.900]   and continue to experience the amazing things, but then we would realize that God has put
[00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:20.260]   a new song in our mouths personally, and we would dedicate ourselves to living that out
[00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:23.180]   in the places where we're spending the majority of our time.
[00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:29.860]   And that if the church could truly begin to see and show the new song that is placed inside
[00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:36.180]   of them, then I think that statistic of that 92% could actually change in our lifetime.
[00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:42.420]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:44.720]   In our lifetime, it could actually change.
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:54.700]   And that we would realize that actually what Christ is doing here is not for here, it's
[00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:55.700]   for there.
[00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:56.700]   Can you stand with me?
[00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:59.700]   I'd love to pray for you.
[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:10.020]   Father, I just thank you so much for each of us and for this community of believers
[00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:13.020]   that call this church their home.
[00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:20.020]   Father, I thank you for the beauty that is in the gospel, and that we see just a small
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:27.380]   picture of David bringing a poetic voice to what you had done in his life, and then that
[00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:35.020]   challenge to proclaim and invite, to live a life and not just say some words.
[00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:38.420]   Father, I'm just so grateful.
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:46.220]   I'm so grateful that your scriptures constantly challenge us in this area of worship, for
[00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:52.180]   us to be challenged to move out of the beauty of a room like this, to receive what it is
[00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:57.500]   that you have for us in a place like this, but then to take it out and put it into action,
[00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:02.660]   to begin to put flesh and bones around ideas and thoughts.
[00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:08.520]   So Lord, I pray that if what has been shared this morning is helpful, I pray that you would
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:12.540]   now speak to each person here about the song that is in their mouths.
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:18.540]   Lord, it will be different perhaps for each one of us, but you have placed a song in their
[00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:20.220]   mouths.
[00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:25.820]   You've put it there, Lord, and the gospel has had a unique impact to each person in
[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:28.900]   this room's life.
[00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:33.440]   And Lord, you put it in their mouths not just so that they would experience a new life,
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:39.460]   but so that they would be able to be proclaimers and inviters to the kingdom of God.
[00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:44.040]   And Lord, yes, we've seen terrible ways that the church has done that in the past, ways
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:47.980]   that have actually hurt rather than invited and released.
[00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:55.140]   Lord, I pray that Father, we wouldn't be held back just because of that, but that Lord,
[00:30:55.140 --> 00:31:00.180]   you would show us new and creative and honest and beautiful ways to share the gospel today.
[00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:05.020]   And Lord, throughout this year as we talk more about that and we do some trainings around
[00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:09.800]   how we might do that, and Lord, as you move us as a church into this deeper and deeper,
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:17.340]   it starts here with this desire for people to see the new song in us, not just hear about
[00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:18.660]   it.
[00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:23.580]   So I want to pray for each person here, Lord, that you would show them ways to practically
[00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:29.140]   put that song into action in their lives this year.
[00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:36.660]   Lord, we want people to see the new song.
[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:42.380]   Maybe just open your hands and I just want to invite the Holy Spirit just to...
[00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:49.060]   For some of you, you're so excited about evangelism and it's bubbling up inside of you and you
[00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:50.060]   can't wait to get going.
[00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:54.700]   Lord, I want to pray for more, Lord Jesus, fan into flame the passion that is in this
[00:31:54.700 --> 00:32:01.420]   room for those that long to serve and to share and to show the world the love of Christ.
[00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:05.660]   Lord, for those of us in this room where we're excited but we don't know what the next step
[00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:09.220]   is, Lord, I want to pray that you would speak to them about the next step.
[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:12.580]   You would show them practically how they can put this into action.
[00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:19.180]   Lord, for those of us in this room where we're sort of like, "I hate this thing.
[00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:22.580]   I don't like the idea of sharing my life or my faith.
[00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:24.180]   I'd rather be a private person.
[00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:25.180]   I'd rather be...
[00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:28.180]   You know, that's for others to do."
[00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:32.840]   Lord, I want to pray that you would just honor them and where they're at, but I would pray
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:38.460]   that also, Lord, you would show the beautifully unique personal ways they can do it in ways
[00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:41.020]   that are comfortable for them.
[00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:42.220]   And I want to just say this over you.
[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:44.500]   You do not have to try to be like someone else.
[00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:49.180]   Remember, somebody else's song is not the new song you're supposed to sing.
[00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:53.200]   So for some of you in this room where this is not a natural thing for you and it's difficult,
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.100]   Jesus understands that.
[00:32:55.100 --> 00:33:00.820]   And I believe he will give you your personal ways to do it in ways that are right for you.
[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:04.860]   So Lord, for those that are passionate and for those of us that are wrestling, Lord,
[00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:06.460]   would you come?
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:11.140]   May your glory be seen for the 92% that do not know you.
[00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:14.700]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:15.200]   Amen.
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.780]   (gentle music)
[00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:20.360]   (gentle music)
