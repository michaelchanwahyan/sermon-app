[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   Let me pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.760]   Everyone says?
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:04.760]   Amen.
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.840]   Can we give Jesus a big round of applause?
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:09.840]   Thank you, Lord.
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.640]   Have a seat, have a seat.
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.640]   Welcome to the Vine.
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.640]   My name's Andrew.
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.280]   I'm one of the pastors here, and it's great to be with you this morning.
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:25.760]   I want to be really honest and vulnerable with you up front here this morning and let
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:32.040]   you know that the topic that I want to teach on this morning is one that I'm doing out
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.120]   of a place of very deep and personal conviction.
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.120]   I want to teach you today on the topic of being prepared for the persecution that may
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:49.640]   come for standing boldly for our faith in a time of historical cultural change.
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.040]   I want to talk about that because I think the Lord is preparing His bride for the season
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.960]   to come, and it's something that He's been speaking to me and dealing with me in my own
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.960]   life for over the last year or so.
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.840]   And in this series that we're in right now where we're looking at the values that the
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.880]   Lord placed in the disciples to enable them to be that victorious church in an uncharted
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.840]   season of sharing the gospel in the Greco-Roman Empire, I think it's this value that we're
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.680]   looking at today that I struggle with the most.
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.840]   It's the value, if I could put it most distinctly, it would be this.
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.520]   The value that the early church had was a personal and a communal willingness to be
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.080]   persecuted for their faith.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:41.880]   A personal and a communal willingness to be persecuted for their faith.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.680]   And I think in a year where the Lord is saying to the divine church, "This is a year where
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.240]   I want you to live your faith more publicly.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.080]   It's a year where I'm moving you into an uncharted season where you're going to be out of your
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.840]   comfort zone and you're going to be in places where you've never been before."
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:05.880]   I think our own personal and communal willingness to be bold and courageous for the gospel,
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.720]   even though that might create some pushback, might create some critique, might create some
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.160]   adverse responses from the people that are around us.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.240]   Our willingness, our ability to still push forward for the gospel despite the criticism
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:29.320]   that might come, that is going to be foundational for whether the church in Hong Kong is going
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:35.360]   to move forward in victory or retreat in the years ahead.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:44.000]   And because this is so important, the Holy Spirit has been showing me that I lack preparation
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:54.280]   for it, that I personally feel that I lack the readiness that I need for what might be
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.240]   ahead for us.
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:04.400]   I know that I recognize in me just quite a bit of fear and anxiety as a church leader
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.360]   in this time, as somebody who menaces in the pulpit in this time.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:20.240]   I can feel in me that tension to want to be silent when I should find my loudest voice.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.420]   I think the reality is that the Holy Spirit has been challenging me deeply in this area
[00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.000]   because I think He wants to challenge all of us in this area.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.140]   One of the things that the Holy Spirit has been saying to me quite abruptly is He's been
[00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.040]   reminding me of the moment when Paul wrote to the church in Rome when they were under
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.640]   an incredible season of persecution, and he wrote this.
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:47.200]   He said, "I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation for
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.080]   those who believe."
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.400]   I am not ashamed of the gospel.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.800]   The Holy Spirit has been challenging me as to whether I actually believe that, and if
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:06.000]   I believe that, then whether I'm going to be as bold in my time as Paul was in his.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.320]   I think that's the great challenge that sits on me as I bring this word to you today.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.640]   I want you to know right up front that what I'm preaching you today is coming from a place
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.280]   of conviction rather than confidence.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.760]   I don't stand before you arrogant, bold, and always courageous for the things of God.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:31.280]   I stand before you as someone who's personally wrestling with the need for repentance for
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:37.560]   the fear that I have for being bold in my faith in this time.
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.680]   Maybe that resonates with you.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.880]   Maybe the topic of persecution is one that you kind of just push to one side in your
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:44.880]   life.
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.960]   Maybe it's one that you recognize is important in our time at this time, but is one that
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.680]   you maybe haven't thought about too deeply.
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.360]   I wonder whether maybe some of us in this room feel that same way, that there's a sense
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.880]   of anxiety, sensitivity, a sense of maybe that fear that might be there because of that
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:02.880]   in our future.
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:09.880]   If that's the case, then I think we're all in good company here because we come submitted
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:15.580]   to the victory that is in Christ Jesus, even though at times we wrestle ourselves with
[00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:16.580]   how we might feel.
[00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:17.580]   Amen?
[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.920]   I want to pray for us as we open the word together here this morning.
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:26.280]   Lord, I thank you so much for the power that is in your word.
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:32.000]   And Father, as we open Scripture, as we look at the journey that the early church had,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.120]   as we think about our own personal lives, as we wrestle with this call that is upon
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:44.800]   us to live our faith more publicly in the year ahead, Lord, I want to pray for humility.
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.520]   I want to pray for the conviction of your word, but I also want to pray for the confidence
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.400]   that comes through the victory found in the cross of Christ.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:01.760]   And Lord, out of that place of victory, we as a church might move forward boldly in a
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.760]   season where we need to find our loudest voice.
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.960]   We thank you for this in your name.
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.600]   Amen.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.480]   A quick review of church history will show you that whenever God calls the church to
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:25.320]   live boldly for the faith in a time of political, cultural, societal change, persecution always
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.240]   comes.
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.240]   And when you see that and recognize that, you'll notice through church history that
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:36.400]   when that persecution comes, the church sometimes is strong and stands faithful.
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.720]   And sometimes the church is weakened and retreats.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.480]   And if I think about what's happening in the globe at the moment, if we look at global,
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:49.060]   political, social, and cultural change that's, I think, happening at unprecedented rates
[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:54.560]   around the world right now, I think a time has come again where the church is being tested
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:00.200]   and where the church is being asked whether it really does stand on the solid rock of
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:06.080]   Jesus Christ and his word or whether it's on the shifting sands of popular opinion and
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.400]   its comfort.
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.960]   And I truly believe that here in our city, if the church is going to be faithful and
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.040]   if the church is going to be victorious in the years ahead, we're going to have to embrace
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:23.540]   this same value that the early church had to embrace and wrestle with, this willingness
[00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.400]   to be persecuted for our faith.
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:32.680]   And I think one of the important things is that we just need to be prepared for it.
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.440]   Here's the thing that I want to say right up front.
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:41.960]   If we're not prepared for the challenge, the inevitable negative reaction that will come
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:47.240]   from each one of us living our faith more boldly and publicly in the year ahead, then
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.320]   here's what will happen.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:57.140]   We will all too easily compromise the gospel and as a result, we will diminish its power.
[00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.660]   That's what will happen.
[00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:03.740]   If we're not prepared, if we're not ready, when it comes, we will too easily compromise
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:09.380]   the gospel and we will therefore ultimately diminish its power.
[00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:14.220]   We have to understand that in a season where God is calling his church to the uncharted,
[00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:20.100]   it is always a call to more radically live out the purposes and the values of the kingdom
[00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:27.060]   of God and understanding that that may therefore cause us to rub up against where the peoples
[00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:34.220]   or structures or society that may not agree or accept the thing that we're standing for.
[00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:39.620]   We have to understand that the kingdom that we believe as Christians is different from
[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.780]   the structures that are found in this world.
[00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:48.660]   This has always been the Jesus way, the call to faith in Christ Jesus, the adventure of
[00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:49.660]   following Jesus.
[00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:54.360]   It's not an adventure to an easy, comfortable or straightforward life.
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:09:01.980]   It is a calling into a place where we have to walk a narrow path that few actually journey
[00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.780]   on.
[00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:08.740]   It's a place where we have to recognize that there is a clash of systems that happen when
[00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:10.980]   we want to live it faithfully in this world.
[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:14.620]   I love the way that British theologian John Stott has put it.
[00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.060]   Let me read this to you from him.
[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:22.340]   He says, "Persecution is simply the clash between two irreconcilable value systems,
[00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:27.380]   that the word of God and his spirit of love and the world of the flesh and its spirit
[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:28.380]   of greed."
[00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:35.700]   I think that's so profoundly beautiful that it is this clash of two, I love this, irreconcilable
[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.620]   value systems.
[00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.820]   When we understand that, we should understand, well, this is why therefore Jesus himself
[00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:46.180]   was persecuted for living out his message and for the way in which he lived it out and
[00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:50.820]   the things that he said and the way that he acted in the Greco-Roman culture around him
[00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:51.980]   of his day.
[00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:55.880]   Jesus was persecuted by every strata of society.
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:00.940]   Of course, by the Greco-Roman authorities eventually in his killing on the cross, from
[00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:06.200]   the Jewish religious authorities around him who labeled him a heretic, from the crowds
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:10.660]   that had initially gathered around him in joy and yet as his teachings got stronger
[00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:18.120]   and stronger, began to fade away, to even his disciples and his best friends, who when
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:25.680]   persecution really came, were the first to either betray him or deny him publicly.
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:30.780]   And Jesus understood that in the persecution he had experienced in sending out the disciples
[00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:34.780]   with the call of the Great Commission and this beautiful idea of what it is to live
[00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:37.140]   God's values in the world around us.
[00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:42.320]   He understood that in sending the Holy Spirit upon them to empower them in that journey,
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:49.180]   that he was necessarily sending them into the same structures, the same irreconcilable
[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:53.620]   systems, the same reality that there might be persecution ahead.
[00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:56.860]   I love the way he says it actually in John 15, 20.
[00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:57.860]   Let me read this to you.
[00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:01.580]   He says, "Remember the word that I said to you," this is Jesus speaking to his disciples,
[00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:03.940]   "A servant is not greater than his master.
[00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:08.220]   If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also."
[00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:11.940]   And so the starting point when we come to a topic like this is that we should not be
[00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:13.820]   surprised.
[00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:17.220]   Peter actually himself writes, "Do not be surprised by the fiery trial that you're going
[00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:18.580]   through."
[00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:21.980]   The church should not be caught unawares.
[00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:27.140]   We should not be surprised by the reality that there are two irreconcilable value systems
[00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.380]   and that we're going to rub up against it.
[00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:32.460]   That doesn't mean that we go out looking for persecution.
[00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:37.260]   Hear this, the goal of the Christian is not to find persecution.
[00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:41.480]   The goal of the Christian is to be obedient to Jesus and submit our lives to him.
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:47.140]   But the reality is as we live the goal and the purposes of our faith, the reality is
[00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:53.380]   there is an inevitable clash that will lead perhaps to some true and real persecution.
[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.500]   Our starting point is to be prepared.
[00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:01.740]   And this was the thought for the early church as they began to disciple their church.
[00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:07.580]   They had heard Jesus say exactly this in John 15, 20, and they went into raising up leaders
[00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:13.300]   for the church and the Greek and Roman culture around them with this particular readiness,
[00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:17.060]   with a preparation to be persecuted.
[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:23.020]   I want to read you how Paul does this so beautifully, I think, for one of his young prodigies, Timothy.
[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:29.420]   And this is right when Paul is sending Timothy out to be a pastor in the church of Ephesus.
[00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:32.300]   Timothy was not there when Jesus was ministering.
[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:37.020]   Timothy came later, was raised up, came to faith, and Paul then sends him out to do the
[00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:38.940]   work of church.
[00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:42.180]   Notice what he says to him here in 2 Timothy 3 verse 10.
[00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:47.380]   He says, "You, however," speaking of Timothy, "know all about my teaching, my way of life,
[00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:55.060]   my purpose, my faith, my patience, my love, endurance, my persecutions, my sufferings.
[00:12:55.060 --> 00:13:01.420]   What kinds of things happened to me in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra, the persecutions I endured.
[00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:04.540]   Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them."
[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:05.540]   Notice that.
[00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:10.580]   He didn't say, "The Lord rescued me from some of them, from all of these persecutions."
[00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:15.660]   In fact, everyone, notice this, "who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will
[00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:16.940]   be persecuted."
[00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:18.700]   Isn't that a happy verse?
[00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:23.140]   We don't like to teach on these verses.
[00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:28.220]   Everyone, that includes you, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus
[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:30.860]   will be persecuted, he says.
[00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:36.500]   "While evil men and imposters will go from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived."
[00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:41.020]   In other words, the church is going to suffer persecution and everybody on the other side
[00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:42.260]   will be seen to rise.
[00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.380]   You notice this?
[00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:48.820]   Church will feel like this, everybody else is going to feel like this.
[00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:53.460]   And then he says, "But as for you, continue in what you have learned and become convinced
[00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:57.660]   of because you know those from whom you have learned it.
[00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:02.900]   And how from infancy you have known the holy scriptures which are able to make you wise
[00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:06.420]   for salvation through faith in Jesus Christ."
[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:07.900]   I love what Paul does here.
[00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:12.100]   He starts out by saying to his young mentee, "Okay, you know how I've lived my life.
[00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:13.100]   You know all the good things.
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:18.260]   You know my endurance, my patience, my loving, the way I've ministered the gospel.
[00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:23.060]   You've seen all the good things, Timothy, but you've also seen the bad and ugly things.
[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:25.620]   You've seen the sufferings I've had to endure, the persecutions."
[00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:29.260]   When Paul's writing this to Timothy, this is towards the end of Paul's life, he's been
[00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:34.540]   arrested, he's been beaten, he's been shipwrecked, he's been imprisoned.
[00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:39.940]   I mean, basically everything that could happen to him other than death has happened to him
[00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:42.340]   because of his faith in Christ Jesus.
[00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.300]   And so he's writing to Timothy, he's saying, "You know all about this.
[00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:46.660]   You know about the persecutions.
[00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:47.860]   You know about the sufferings."
[00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:52.660]   And he says this, "Anyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted."
[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:54.580]   Notice what he says here.
[00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:59.380]   He does not say everyone who believes in Jesus will be persecuted.
[00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:00.820]   Come on, church.
[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.380]   He says everyone who wants to live a godly life.
[00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:08.180]   In other words, there's a choice like Ellison was talking about last week.
[00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:12.900]   There's a choice before the church whether we will just believe in Jesus or live a godly
[00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:14.980]   life in Jesus.
[00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:18.500]   And believing in Jesus is easy.
[00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:22.140]   Living a godly life in Jesus, that's a whole different thing.
[00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:25.860]   And Paul is trying to get across to Timothy, "Here's what I want you to do.
[00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:29.580]   I want you to live a godly life in Jesus, but when you do so, don't be surprised that
[00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:31.700]   it's going to be hard.
[00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:36.680]   If you want easy, don't live a godly life in Christ Jesus."
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:40.020]   And he's saying this to Timothy because he knows what Timothy's about to go through.
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:43.660]   And the godly life is defined for Paul like he had just explained.
[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:50.060]   This loving life, this life of living before the world, the hope of Christ Jesus, wanting
[00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:55.700]   to forgive your enemies and love those who persecute you, wanting to live a person of
[00:15:55.700 --> 00:16:01.220]   radical forgiveness and grace, wanting to be yeast in dough, wanting to share the gospel
[00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:06.300]   because you want to see people come to relationship with Jesus, wanting to stand for the things
[00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:11.000]   that the kingdom stands for, doing it from a place of love, not from a pace of rebellion
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.340]   or wanting to disrupt the world, but from a place of loving the world.
[00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:20.640]   I want to love this world so much that I will not be ashamed of the gospel.
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:27.500]   So what Paul's saying is, if you want to live a public life of faith, then you need to realize
[00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:30.940]   that you're going to be persecuted, which if you follow Paul, this is really good, you
[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:32.100]   might want to write this down.
[00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:38.740]   Here's how to avoid persecution, live a private life of Christ Jesus.
[00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:44.900]   Take your faith, which is a bright light, and put a basket on top of it.
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:47.060]   That's the best way to avoid persecution.
[00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:55.620]   If you want an easy life, just believe in him and know that one day you'll go to heaven.
[00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:59.340]   And if you believe in him, you will one day go to heaven.
[00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:02.020]   Belief in Jesus is so important.
[00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:06.940]   But if you want to live the way in which the Bible is saying we should live our faith,
[00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:11.900]   then you do not take your light and put it under a basket, but you let your light shine
[00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:13.780]   before all this world.
[00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:18.460]   And if you're going to commit to that, then you have to recognize it's not going to be
[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:21.380]   easy.
[00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:26.780]   Paul says that sufferings will come and that these sufferings will be hard.
[00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:30.620]   Paul's not saying that every suffering you will ever experience as a Christian should
[00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:34.620]   be labeled persecution.
[00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:38.300]   Because sometimes we suffer for our own sin.
[00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:41.040]   Sometimes we suffer because we make mistakes and bad decisions.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:44.700]   Sometimes we suffer because of somebody else's sin and their bad mistakes.
[00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:48.880]   He's not saying every suffering that you ever have is a persecution.
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.860]   I think sometimes the church can be a little bit like that.
[00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:52.660]   It's like, "Oh man, I'm suffering so bad.
[00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:55.500]   I'm under persecution because I lost my job."
[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.180]   And it's like, "Well, maybe you lost your job because you did something dumb."
[00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:02.180]   Are you with me?
[00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:05.300]   It's not everything that we do is therefore labeled persecution.
[00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:09.860]   What Paul's saying is if you live a godly life and in living a godly life, in other
[00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:15.300]   words, as you devote yourself to Christ and live in a way of devotion to Christ and persecution,
[00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:18.300]   suffering comes, you can label that persecution.
[00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:22.420]   It is the suffering that comes from our devotion to Christ.
[00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:26.020]   And that devotion to Christ is the preeminent thing that we do.
[00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.020]   And the suffering can be real.
[00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:33.140]   It can be emotional and psychological suffering, name-calling, being made to feel like on the
[00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:38.780]   outside of things, being shunned by the people that you used to be accepted by.
[00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:42.600]   Maybe those in your family or those in your offices turning their back on you or saying
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.820]   things behind your back or even saying things to your face.
[00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:48.380]   It can be emotionally and psychological suffering.
[00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:53.180]   It can be like for Paul, physical suffering, beatings and floggings, which actually still
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:58.140]   occurs in our world today because of faith in Christ Jesus.
[00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:02.780]   Or maybe in our level, it might be losing our jobs because of the value systems that
[00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:07.700]   we hold and how they've rubbed up against the employer that we're working for.
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:12.620]   Or perhaps our financial challenges that might come to us because of our devotion in Christ
[00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:13.620]   Jesus.
[00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:16.340]   There could be a number of ways that it can happen physically for us.
[00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:17.500]   I think it's also spiritual.
[00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.660]   We can have spiritual suffering.
[00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:23.020]   We can have an attack from the enemy because of the way in which we're living our lives.
[00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:25.100]   That's a very real thing as well.
[00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:27.540]   And then there are some dramatic things that take place.
[00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:33.540]   There's even imprisonment and death, not just in the first century, which we see throughout
[00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:40.040]   the pages of Acts, but in our world today, in countries not too far from this one.
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:42.680]   That is still happening today.
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:46.860]   So there's this idea that there's this suffering that's going to happen.
[00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.980]   And here's the thing that I felt the Holy Spirit been challenging me around.
[00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:57.780]   Am I really, and I mean really, prepared to suffer for my faith?
[00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:03.460]   Am I really prepared to take what might come, not again because I'm looking for it, not
[00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:09.500]   because I'm going out there to stir up trouble, but as I'm living a godly life for Christ
[00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:14.940]   Jesus in the world that is as it is right now, am I really willing to press on with
[00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:18.860]   my faith even if suffering might come?
[00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:27.820]   Or do I recognize within me the need to fit in too much, the need to be accepted too much,
[00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:33.820]   the need to not want to upset people too much, the need of fear of what people might think
[00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:36.620]   around me too much, or whatever it might be.
[00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:41.020]   That sits on my spirit and it weighs on me.
[00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:43.260]   And here's how I think I've been processing it.
[00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:47.660]   I've recognized, and this is just an honest confession before you, I've recognized that
[00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:52.980]   sometimes my faith is too shallow.
[00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:53.980]   It's too shallow.
[00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:59.080]   And what I mean by that is that at the nearest hint of somebody who might be upset at me
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:06.440]   because of something I've said, I am tempted to assimilate to that person.
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:12.660]   And as I've been wrestling with this, I felt the Holy Spirit has led me to a personal passage.
[00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:16.620]   I want to read this to you because it might resonate with some of you as well.
[00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:19.580]   In Matthew 13, there's a beautiful parable of the sower.
[00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:23.860]   You know the parable probably, the scattering of seed and some of it falls on certain ground,
[00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:28.340]   rocky ground and soil that doesn't accept it and other soils that do.
[00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:31.780]   And then Jesus explains the parable a little bit later in the passage.
[00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:33.460]   I want to pick up from verse 20.
[00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:38.820]   Notice this, he says, "The one who has received the seed that fell on rocky soil or rocky
[00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:44.500]   ground is the person who hears the word and at once receives it with joy.
[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:49.460]   But since he has no root, he lasts only for a short time.
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:57.140]   When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, he quickly falls away."
[00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:02.900]   Jesus led me to that passage and this was like Jesus, you know those moments where you
[00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:07.100]   know that Jesus is lovingly convicting you.
[00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:10.500]   And he led me to that passage and he's like, "Andrew, you're kind of like the rocky ground
[00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.660]   sometimes.
[00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:16.500]   You're like the rocky ground where my word comes to you and you accept it with joy, but
[00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.500]   there is not a lot of root sometimes.
[00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:23.660]   And when there's not root, when the wind comes and the storms come and the stuff comes, it's
[00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:28.100]   very easy for that word just to get lost in you."
[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:30.960]   And I recognize that I wrestle with this.
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:35.060]   And so as the Lord brought that passage to mind, I began to pray and ask the Lord, "Why
[00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:36.420]   am I shallow?
[00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:37.420]   What's going on?
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:40.460]   What keeps me shallow sometimes in my faith?"
[00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:42.460]   And he came and said something to me, which I journaled.
[00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:43.860]   I want to read this to you.
[00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:44.860]   He said this.
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:46.580]   I'm just being very honest with you, by the way, today.
[00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:47.580]   I hope that's okay.
[00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:49.020]   Welcome to the Vine.
[00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:52.420]   "Andrew, I am both your Savior and your Lord.
[00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:58.100]   You need to be careful you don't just live as if I am only your Savior."
[00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:02.140]   And I think this is so profound, or at least it was for me, that there is this idea that
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:05.260]   He is our Savior and our Lord.
[00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:11.460]   But so often, this is what keeps us shallow, we just keep Him being our Savior and we don't
[00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:14.220]   submit to Him as Lord.
[00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:15.960]   And when that happens, here's what it is.
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:18.900]   We like the fact that we have that ticket out of here.
[00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.520]   We like the fact that our sins are forgiven.
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:25.220]   We like the fact that we have someone to go to, to offer, and to know that we are forgiven
[00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:32.400]   and redeemed and saved, but then we fail to fully submit our everyday life to Him.
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:38.220]   And so He's our Savior, yes, but can we actually say that He's our Lord?
[00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:41.140]   And I think what Jesus was saying to me, and perhaps what He's trying to say to us as the
[00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:46.460]   church here this morning, is that how we go deep is we move beyond just the recognition
[00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:51.060]   of Him as our Savior, and because He is our Savior, because of the work of the cross,
[00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:55.100]   because of the grace of forgiveness, we don't keep it cheap.
[00:23:55.100 --> 00:24:00.940]   And we actually press to a place of deep-rooted obedience and submission to His laws, to His
[00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:06.660]   love, to His challenges, to His conviction, to His Word, living a godly life out of a
[00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:10.020]   place of reverent submission to Him.
[00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:11.940]   That's the root.
[00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:17.500]   And so Jesus must be for us at the Vine as we move into this time of uncharted both Savior
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:23.100]   and Lord, and if you're anything like me, perhaps you get this part well and this one
[00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:27.420]   you struggle with sometimes.
[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:32.820]   And in that, we have to wrestle with the honesty of coming to Him in confession and saying,
[00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:34.980]   "I know You are Savior and Lord.
[00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:42.140]   Hold me back from just living like You're my Savior only."
[00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:47.980]   As the church wrestles with this, I think it begins to position us in a place where
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:51.940]   we can begin to respond, because this is not just a personal thing, it's also a communal
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:52.940]   thing.
[00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:56.980]   We can be churches that are what I would call rocky-ground churches.
[00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:03.980]   Oh, eager to worship, eager to put our hands up, eager to have a great moment on a Sunday
[00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:07.140]   together, and yet where's the depth?
[00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:09.140]   Where is the obedience?
[00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:12.500]   Where is the submission to what the Father is saying amongst us?
[00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:17.740]   And I do not want the Vine to be a rocky-ground church.
[00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:21.460]   And I recognize I don't want to be a rocky-ground person.
[00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:22.980]   How do we change this?
[00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:26.340]   I was reminded of something I read recently by Leonard Ravenhill.
[00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:27.340]   Let me read you what he said.
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:28.340]   I think this is so challenging.
[00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:32.260]   "The early church was married to poverty, prisons, and persecutions.
[00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:38.420]   Today, the church is married to prosperity, personality, and popularity."
[00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:44.020]   I think when that happens, a church has Jesus as their Savior, but not as their Lord.
[00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:47.380]   When that happens, we seek all the benefits of relationship with Him without any of the
[00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:50.820]   responsibility.
[00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:56.140]   I was in a conversation a few years ago with an incredible pastor who lives in an Asian
[00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:59.660]   country that is well-known for its persecution of Christians.
[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:03.140]   And we were talking about the church, the global church.
[00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:06.500]   And as we were in conversation together about the global church, he said this thing to me.
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:12.660]   He said, "The church in the West has had years of prosperity, and it has weakened."
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:16.620]   And he says, "It's interesting, because the church in my country has had years of persecution,
[00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:19.500]   but we have only strengthened."
[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.940]   And then he said this, and this blew my mind.
[00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:32.360]   He said, "Persecution is much better than prosperity when it comes to the gospel."
[00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:35.700]   And I felt a deep conviction when he said that, and I feel it now as I'm sharing it
[00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:39.120]   with you.
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:45.060]   And this conviction of saying true revival will come when we actually honor and understand
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:51.580]   that, when we're willing to live a godly life in Christ Jesus boldly and courageously, despite
[00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:58.020]   how that will rub us up against that irreconcilable value system, and yet do so in a place of
[00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:02.100]   love, even in a place of joy.
[00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:03.300]   How do we do that?
[00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:05.820]   Notice what Paul says here in this passage.
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:07.140]   He lays it out for Timothy.
[00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:11.860]   He's not trying to give Timothy a hard time, because he says, "But as for you," verse 14,
[00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:17.700]   "continue in what you have learned and become convinced of, because you know those from
[00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:19.060]   whom you have learned it."
[00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:20.060]   That's the first thing.
[00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:21.060]   He says, "You want to go deep."
[00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:24.680]   He says, "Continue to meet together like this.
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:28.100]   Continue to submit yourself under the Word of God in a public setting.
[00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:31.860]   Continue to have your small group and have fellowship in your small group.
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:36.460]   Continue to learn under those that you have respect for, those that you have seen, how
[00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:37.820]   they've lived their lives.
[00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:42.260]   Continue to submit yourself under an environment where you are learning and growing from the
[00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:46.100]   people that you respect, whether that's a church on a Sunday, whether that's a small
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:47.100]   group during the week."
[00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:49.180]   He's basically saying, "Look, commit to that."
[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:55.500]   But then notice what he says, verse 15, "And how from empathy you have known the Holy Scriptures."
[00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:59.140]   So he's saying there's a two-fold rootedness that takes place for you.
[00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:05.020]   If you want to grow rooted in the gospel to live a godly life, it comes from this moment,
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:09.060]   submitting yourselves in fellowship to a church community, but it also comes from taking up
[00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:13.540]   your own personal responsibility of being in the Word of God.
[00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:17.180]   The Holy Scriptures that he says to Timothy, "You've known since you're young.
[00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:21.680]   Don't give up on the Scriptures that you've read, that you've studied, that you've done
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:26.020]   the hard work in, and don't give up on what you've learned from those around you that
[00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:27.020]   you respect."
[00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:28.620]   Those two-pronged things.
[00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:34.300]   That's the way that you put roots down deep in the kingdom of God, no matter what might
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:35.580]   come.
[00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:37.140]   And I think it's those two things.
[00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:41.980]   The understanding of who Jesus was and how they had been with Jesus, they had learned
[00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:46.780]   from him and they'd seen him, as well as their own reflections and understanding of the Scriptures
[00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:52.020]   enabled the early church to stand up with this value of the willingness to be persecuted
[00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:54.580]   for their faith.
[00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:59.140]   Let me take you just quickly to a passage where this gets illuminated to us from Acts
[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:01.020]   chapter 5.
[00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:04.020]   Acts chapter 5, starting in verse 27, says this.
[00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:05.700]   Before I read it, let me tell you a little bit.
[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:08.160]   I'm getting too ahead of myself.
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:13.020]   This is the moment just about two or three months after the disciples have seen the death
[00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:15.580]   and resurrection of Jesus and seen Jesus ascend.
[00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:18.340]   It's about two or three months after the sending of the Holy Spirit.
[00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:20.260]   And remember what Jesus has said to them.
[00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:24.620]   He said, "You'll be my witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and the ends of the world."
[00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:26.600]   Jerusalem to begin with.
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:28.020]   And so here's what the disciples are doing.
[00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:31.980]   They're spending every day in the temple courts in the heart of Jerusalem.
[00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:37.660]   They're sharing that Jesus is the Messiah, which was a radical thing to do in the temple,
[00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:43.020]   the very center of the Jewish faith for the people who are looking for their Messiah.
[00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:47.760]   And the disciples, this small band of people, are coming and sharing every day in the outer
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:52.940]   courts of the temple with whoever who would listen to them that Jesus is their Messiah.
[00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:58.500]   And this has become so much that the Sanhedrin, who are the sort of religious leaders of the
[00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:03.780]   day, 71 men that were leading the temple of that day, they had already told the disciples,
[00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:06.540]   "Stop talking about Jesus."
[00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:09.900]   But the disciples were like, "We're not going to stop talking about Jesus."
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:13.540]   And so we pick up the story from the point where the Sanhedrin brings them in to talk
[00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:14.620]   to them, verse 27.
[00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:18.980]   "Having brought the apostles, they made them appear before the Sanhedrin to be questioned
[00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:19.980]   by the high priest.
[00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:23.620]   'Hey, we gave you strict orders not to teach in his name,' he said.
[00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:28.020]   'Yet you have filled Jerusalem,'" notice this, "'filled Jerusalem with your teaching and
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:31.260]   are determined to make us guilty of this man's blood.'
[00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:38.340]   Peter and the other apostles replied, 'We must obey God rather than people.
[00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:42.820]   The God of our fathers raised Jesus from the dead, whom you had killed by hanging him on
[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:43.820]   a tree.
[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:48.700]   God exalted him to his own right hand as prince and savior, that he might give repentance
[00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.980]   and forgiveness of sins to Israel.
[00:30:50.980 --> 00:31:02.140]   We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those
[00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:03.140]   who obey him.'"
[00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:04.140]   I love this.
[00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:07.500]   The Sanhedrin are saying, "You need to stop teaching Jesus."
[00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:11.900]   And the apostles say, "We must obey God rather than people."
[00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:16.740]   Peter stands up in front of the people that could literally have him stoned, and he says,
[00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:20.900]   "We're going to obey God more than we're going to obey you."
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:25.060]   Now you've got to understand, this is the same Peter who just about three months prior
[00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:32.020]   to this, when he sees Jesus get arrested, denies him three times.
[00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:37.260]   Denies him three times, runs away, and returns to being a fisherman, and gives up the whole
[00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:39.880]   cool that Christ had placed upon him.
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:44.980]   He goes away from it all, and in fear, he basically hides.
[00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:51.380]   I think at this time, Peter saw Jesus as his savior, but not his Lord.
[00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:55.900]   And because he had seen Jesus as his savior, when Jesus was arrested, he was like, "This
[00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:58.020]   is going to end really badly for Jesus.
[00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:05.060]   It could potentially end really badly for me, so I guess maybe he's not Jesus, the Messiah.
[00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:07.100]   He's not the one that we had thought he was.
[00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:08.340]   He's not our savior."
[00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:13.820]   And when Jesus dies on the cross, before Peter is seeing him in his resurrection, he runs.
[00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:15.180]   He flees away.
[00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:21.780]   And then Jesus, in his resurrection, meets him on the beach, restores to him, gives him
[00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:26.580]   his calling to be one of the fathers of the church, and just three months later, here's
[00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:31.260]   Peter standing before the very persons that three months prior he was afraid of, and now
[00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:36.180]   he's standing in front of them and saying, "We're going to obey God over you."
[00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:41.340]   Something has so radically happened in Peter that now he sees Jesus not just as his savior,
[00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:43.100]   but also his Lord.
[00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:48.540]   And because he's his Lord, he's willing to submit everything under the kingship of Christ
[00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:53.300]   Jesus, so much so that he can stand before his people and say, "I'm going to always put
[00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:54.300]   God first."
[00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:59.620]   Now notice, Peter is not trying to incite some revolution against the powers of the
[00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:01.020]   day.
[00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:04.700]   He's not trying to say, "Hey, we're just going to disregard all of you guys."
[00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:08.180]   He's not trying to say, "Look, we should work against the laws of the land."
[00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:09.540]   He's not doing that.
[00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:12.180]   I think Peter has a deep respect for his people.
[00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:15.020]   I think he's got a deep respect for the laws of his land.
[00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:18.380]   He's not advocating some rebellion against the laws of this land.
[00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:24.100]   What he is saying, though, he's saying, "If it ever comes down to it, where the word of
[00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:31.500]   my king and the word of this world clash, I'm going to side with my king."
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:32.500]   That's what he's saying.
[00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:35.060]   And he's saying, "That's where my obedience will be.
[00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:36.220]   That's where my life will be.
[00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:40.140]   That's where I will submit myself to over and above everything else."
[00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:42.460]   And we can hear that and go, "Yeah, that sounds great.
[00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:44.740]   Oh, I always would put Christ first."
[00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:48.180]   And then persecution comes.
[00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:51.740]   You know, I think it's actually really easy for us to put God first when it comes with
[00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:55.540]   very little personal cost to actually living it out.
[00:33:55.540 --> 00:34:02.340]   But when putting Christ first comes at deep sacrifice and cost, I know that we are so
[00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:11.820]   easily tempted to choose what is safe rather than what is faithful.
[00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:16.820]   And Peter is standing before his people and saying, "I will always put God first.
[00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:18.060]   I didn't three months ago."
[00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:20.380]   I love how beautiful Peter is.
[00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:21.780]   He's like, "I'm not perfect.
[00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:24.540]   Three months ago, man, I even denied him three times.
[00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:26.060]   But now I stand before you.
[00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:29.740]   He's my savior and my Lord."
[00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:30.740]   So how do we do this?
[00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:31.740]   How do we practically?
[00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:37.740]   I know I'm going a bit long, but how do we practically put a word like this, begin to
[00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:43.060]   put it and shape it into our lives in the months and years ahead for us here in Hong
[00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:47.500]   Kong, a place that we love, a place that we want to see flourish and grow?
[00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:50.540]   Well, I want to suggest a few quick things.
[00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:53.380]   First of all, number one, do not be surprised, right?
[00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:57.380]   Do not be surprised by the reality of these two irreconcilable value systems that are
[00:34:57.380 --> 00:34:58.700]   going to rub up against each other.
[00:34:58.700 --> 00:34:59.820]   That's the first one.
[00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:02.260]   We've seen that throughout our time together today.
[00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:04.300]   Here's the second one.
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:06.500]   Pray for the grace.
[00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:12.340]   Pray for the grace to be able to stand up against whatever might come to you.
[00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:13.340]   But I want you to see this.
[00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:18.100]   The grace that Christ gives us for persecution has two directions to it.
[00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:23.140]   The first direction is the grace that we need to stand up under persecution.
[00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:26.660]   But the second direction of the grace is the one we often forget about.
[00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:32.500]   That grace should also then work through our lives outwards towards our persecutor.
[00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:38.420]   Jesus said, "Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you."
[00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:43.780]   And so if we get to stand up under that clash of value system, we should be asking for the
[00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:48.940]   grace not just to stand up against it, but for the grace to be able to withstand whatever
[00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:50.620]   persecution might come.
[00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:54.180]   It's really interesting because Peter, after saying this thing he says, they're actually
[00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:57.900]   flogged and they're beaten so badly.
[00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:01.380]   And they leave from that place of being flogged and beaten and they say these words.
[00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:08.780]   They say, "We rejoice that we have been counted worthy of suffering for the name."
[00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:11.940]   If I was the disciples in that moment, if I was Peter, I would have left with these
[00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:12.940]   emotions.
[00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:13.940]   Not joy.
[00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:15.900]   My emotions would be anger.
[00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:17.980]   My emotion would be hate.
[00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:21.320]   My emotion would be, "How do I get revenge here?"
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:23.460]   Their emotion was rejoicing.
[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:24.460]   Joy.
[00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:28.380]   Joy that they've been counted worthy of suffering for the name.
[00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:33.300]   Another way of saying it, joy for realizing that in living a godly life, the persecution
[00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:35.980]   has told them that they're on the right track.
[00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:38.100]   They're on the narrow path.
[00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:39.740]   There's great joy in that.
[00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:41.460]   Here's the third thing.
[00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:44.600]   Deepen your relationship with Jesus.
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:46.380]   The easiest way I can say it is this.
[00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:51.660]   You will never be prepared to suffer for something or someone you do not know.
[00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:54.700]   Come on, church.
[00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:58.500]   We are only prepared to suffer for something that we know and that we love and that we
[00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:00.940]   believe is valuable to stand for.
[00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:05.380]   So as we deepen our roots in Christ Jesus, that's the greatest way that we prepare ourselves
[00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:07.260]   for whatever might come.
[00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:09.540]   Here's the fourth thing.
[00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:14.180]   Replace our fear of people with a healthy fear of the Lord.
[00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:17.540]   It's so easy for us to feel afraid of what everybody might think or afraid of what might
[00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:20.460]   happen or afraid of the opinions of those around us.
[00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:21.460]   And that's a very real thing.
[00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:24.620]   And I've already told you that's something I struggle with a lot.
[00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:27.340]   Replacing that fear with a healthy fear of the Lord.
[00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:28.340]   This is Peter, right?
[00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:34.500]   "I will obey God over human beings because I put my fear, my ultimate trust, my ultimate
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:40.900]   reverence, my ultimate worship under my king rather than under any human authority structure.
[00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:43.620]   Ultimately, that's what I do," says Peter.
[00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:47.820]   We need to replace our fear of people with a healthy fear of the Lord.
[00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:51.580]   Here's the final one and I'll close with this.
[00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:58.860]   We need to not forget that the church is victorious.
[00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:03.420]   Not forget that we as God's people hold the victory.
[00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:06.940]   And that even though we might, as Paul would write to the church in Corinth, be on the
[00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:10.860]   dying side, the people around us are on the rising side.
[00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:14.920]   That they get to see the gospel and they get to come into relationship with Jesus.
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:17.220]   They get salvation and a Lord.
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:21.920]   And in seeing people being brought into the kingdom of God, we're willing to take the
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:25.220]   dying side if they're going to have the rising side.
[00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:29.440]   We're willing to live a godly life for Christ Jesus, even though it might rub us up against
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:34.600]   the grain of sin, simply because we long to see the victory that is found in the church
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:35.600]   of Christ.
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:40.120]   That Jesus would say, "I've built this church and the gates of hell will not come against
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:41.120]   it."
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:46.440]   Paul, as he's writing to the church, he finishes with these powerful words.
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:47.680]   And I want to read these over you.
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:50.920]   So as we close, can I invite you to stand with me?
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:57.920]   And I want to read these words over you because I'm hoping that some of what I've taught you
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:00.280]   today has been helpful for you.
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:04.140]   I'm hoping that it has been challenging to you.
[00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:11.100]   But I'm hoping that you will leave here not in a place of fear, but in a place of worship.
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:15.340]   That you leave here going, "I want a Savior and a Lord."
[00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:18.120]   That you leave here saying, "I know it's not going to be always easy.
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:21.440]   That's the narrow path, but I'm not doing it alone.
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:24.420]   I'm doing it with a room filled with people like this.
[00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:28.520]   I'm doing it in a church community that loves me and that will help me.
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:31.680]   I'm doing it amongst people who will pray for me.
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:37.360]   But more than that, I'm doing it as a victor, not as someone in defeat."
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:38.800]   Notice what Paul says over his church.
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:43.100]   And I want to encourage you just to close your eyes as I read this to you.
[00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:48.100]   He says, "Because those who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God.
[00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:53.660]   For you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fear, but you received
[00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:56.440]   a spirit of sonship.
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:59.180]   And by him we cry, 'Abba, Father.'
[00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:04.620]   For the Spirit himself testifies with our own spirit that we are God's children.
[00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:10.500]   Now if we are the children, then we are also his heirs, heirs of God and co-heirs with
[00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:11.500]   Christ.
[00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:17.460]   If indeed we share in his sufferings, in order that we may also share in his glory.
[00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:23.300]   For I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that
[00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:25.180]   will be revealed in us.
[00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:31.460]   No, for in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.
[00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:37.620]   For I am convinced that neither death nor life, nor angels nor demons, neither present
[00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:44.020]   nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all of creation
[00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:52.060]   will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
[00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:55.220]   Father, I pray for your church.
[00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:58.700]   I pray for the vine, for these incredible people that you love.
[00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:00.340]   I pray for myself.
[00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:06.420]   I pray that we would take conviction, that we would turn it into repentance, and that
[00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:11.580]   out of a place of repentance, we would move forward in glory, Lord.
[00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:15.140]   I want to pray, Lord, for a resurrected church.
[00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:22.260]   Lord, I want to pray a glimpse, the temptation to the rocky ground church, to the rocky ground
[00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:26.340]   Christian, the temptations that I have had to battle with.
[00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:32.540]   Lord, I want to pray for the rising of a conquering church, Lord, the church that knows that we
[00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:38.260]   are more than conquerors in Christ Jesus, that as his forgiveness and his spirit and
[00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:44.300]   his power comes upon us, and as we choose to live a godly life for him, not out of rebellion,
[00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:49.780]   not because we're seeking some persecution, but because we so love the world that Jesus
[00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:55.460]   was sent here, and that we have a gospel and a story to proclaim in the world around us.
[00:41:55.460 --> 00:42:02.380]   Lord, as we stand on the victory of the risen Jesus and the power of the Spirit in us, Lord,
[00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:08.140]   we will stand.
[00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:14.180]   So Father, I want to pray a blessing over each person here today.
[00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:19.820]   I want to pray the blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
[00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:22.580]   would be their rear guard.
[00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:27.020]   I pray that you would go before them, you would be around them, and that you would be
[00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:28.640]   behind them.
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:32.620]   And that, Lord, if anyone in this room right now is under a place of persecution for their
[00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:37.380]   faith, Lord, we want to pray as the church of Jesus Christ for them.
[00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:42.260]   We want to pray a lifting right now off of the oppression that the enemy would want to
[00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:46.260]   bring upon them, and we want to pray hope and faith and life.
[00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:50.740]   Lord, we want to pray that they would find themselves being able to stand firm in whatever
[00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:54.260]   persecution they may be struggling with at this time.
[00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:58.540]   And Lord, we want to pray that we would be all for your glory.
[00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:00.860]   All for your glory.
[00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:02.420]   All for your glory.
[00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:10.620]   And Lord, the final thing I want to pray, I want to pray for anyone here who recognizes
[00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:13.980]   that they have you as their Savior, but not as your Lord.
[00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:20.460]   Lord, I want to pray for anyone here who recognizes that you are their Savior, but they do not
[00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:25.060]   and they know that they struggle with submitting themselves fully to your Lordship, to your
[00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:26.060]   kingship.
[00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:32.900]   Lord, I want to pray that as you take them deeper this year in seasons that are uncharted,
[00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:37.460]   that their obedience and submission to you as their King would be the place of their
[00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:41.060]   greatest joy like it was for Peter.
[00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:46.140]   And Lord, in that place of overwhelming joy, we would move forward.
[00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:49.580]   And we pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:50.580]   Amen.
[00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:51.580]   Amen.
[00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:51.580]   Amen.
[00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:52.420]   Amen.
[00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:53.260]   Amen.
[00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:55.500]   (applause)
