1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 All right, now I've got to preach about sex.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Oh, Lord Jesus!

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 Well, welcome to the Vine.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Give me a moment, give me a moment.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Oh, that was emotional.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 That wasn't supposed to be so emotional.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 Oh, Lord Jesus.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 All right.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Well, welcome to the Vine.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 If you're new, we're emotional here.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Man, we're in this series of intimacy, aren't we?

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Talking about intimacy this year.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 And we're talking about how God is calling us in 2024 to be as intimate with Him as possible.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 To draw into deeper relationship and community with Him.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 And we've been talking about how God has created us with an innate desire for intimacy.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 All of us, as humans, created in God's image,

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 we have an innate desire for intimacy with God and with one another.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 And we've been teaching in this series that when we fail to find the fullness of our satisfaction in intimacy with God, first and foremost,

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 when we fail in that connection,

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 then what will happen for all human beings is that we will naturally turn to other alternative forms of intimacy

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 to try to satisfy the hole that is there where we haven't been satisfied in that relationship with God.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Does that make sense?

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 So when that one's not satisfied, we very naturally turn to other alternative forms of intimacy.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 And I would say the most seductive and the most destructive alternative form of intimacy that we turn to is sexual intimacy.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 And so today I want to talk about sex.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 I know that is a full-on topic.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Some of you have got salt and pepper in your head right now.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 We're going to talk a little bit about this idea of sex.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Now, I want to say something that is a personal conviction for me right up front on this topic, and it is this.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 I do not think that the global church is talking about sex enough.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 In fact, I would put it this way.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 I would say the global church is actually in this time largely silent about sex.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 And when the church is silent about a topic that is central to human flourishing and what it means to be made in the image of God,

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 then basically what we're doing is we're allowing others to dictate to us in the church what we should believe about this topic.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Because you've got to understand that the world is talking about this topic.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 In fact, they're talking about it all the time.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 You just need to turn on your social media.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 You need to look at the newspapers.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 You need to watch films and TV shows.

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 You'll know that everybody is talking about sex.

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 In fact, I did a poll on my Instagram this week, and of course that is the ultimate source of everything.

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 I did a poll on my Instagram this week, and I asked people how regularly are people talking about sex?

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 And over 65% of the people that responded said that they are in kind of friendship groups where people are regularly talking about sex.

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 So this is a conversation that's happening out there.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Here's the reality. When the church outsources its responsibility to talk about sex, two things happen.

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 First of all, everybody else will define for us what sex is, and second of all, the church will be upset about that and will point fingers and judge.

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Isn't that funny?

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 Like when we outsource our responsibility to talk about sex, the world then talks about it, and then we judge that and point fingers at it.

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 You can't have your cake and eat it, church.

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 We have to take up the responsibility to begin to speak about a glorious, biblical vision of sex and sexuality,

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 bring that back into the heart of the church, because when we don't, we shouldn't therefore be surprised when we see a lot of sexual brokenness,

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 both in the world but also within the church.

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 Hello, everybody.

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 The problem is when we have talked about sex as the church, we've talked about it really badly.

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 If you grew up here in church, no doubt you've probably heard some stuff be talked about sex over the years.

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 Normally, here is the rhetoric. Normally, here's what church will do.

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Church will just say, "Look, sex is bad. Sex is to be avoided. Sex is something that you should not do.

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Sex is something that's kind of mucky and disgusting and is a little bit messy, and sex is not right, okay?

59
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 And sex is just bad, so you should only reserve it for the one that you love."

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Like, that's a good argument.

61
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 Like, sex is terrible, bad, wrong, never do it.

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 Oh, by the way, but when you get married, suddenly everything will be perfect, and you'll have this amazing sex life.

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 This is how we as a church have often talked about it, and I have to say there is a brokenness within the purity culture.

64
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 Because if you have been fed a diet that sex is essentially bad and wrong,

65
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 and when you get married, hey, presto, everything's going to be perfect, we end up actually letting a lot of people down in the church.

66
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 Because the reality is, what actually happens is, I can't tell you the number of times that I've pastorally sat with a young married couple

67
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 who are struggling with guilt and shame in the early years of their sex life in marriage,

68
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 because they've been fed a constant rhetoric in the church about how bad sex is,

69
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 and they brought that into their marriage, and it's a wonder that they're now struggling with trying to find enjoyment and pleasure

70
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 in something that God has created good.

71
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Do you see that?

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 So I'm convinced that there has to be a better way for the church to be talking about sex. Amen?

73
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 And I want to do that a little bit today.

74
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 That's my hope. That's my goal.

75
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 It's to maybe paint a broader, bigger, and maybe a better way for the church to be talking about sex,

76
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 and to understand the sex act, and also understand how that fits into a way that we've been created,

77
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 and ultimately how that fits into marriage, and what all that is about.

78
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 And I want to say up front, I've only got about 40 minutes with you, I can't cover everything.

79
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 And I bet some of you have come in today and you're like, "Oh, I've got my question on sex.

80
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Is Andrew going to talk about my topic of, you know, my question on sex?"

81
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 The reality is, I can't talk about everything today, but what I want to do is point a picture broad and glorious and beautiful,

82
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 and invite you into it.

83
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 And I want to say a couple of things before I start. Here's the first thing.

84
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 The first thing that I think we have to wrestle with is the reality that this topic is for all of us.

85
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 No matter who you are in this room right now, this is an important topic for you.

86
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 If you're here and you're single and you're happy and you're celibate, it's also for you.

87
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 If you're here single and searching, if you're here single and dating,

88
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 if you're engaged and preparing yourself for marriage, if you're married and you're flourishing,

89
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 if you're married and you're struggling, if you're divorced, if you're a widow,

90
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 no matter who it is, no matter where you're from, this topic is for you,

91
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 because this topic sits at the very center of what it means to be created human.

92
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 And so this is a topic also for you.

93
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 Here's the second thing. I recognize that there is a lot of brokenness around this topic for all of us.

94
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 Every single one of us in this room, we bring a story into this topic,

95
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 a journey that we've had perhaps in this area.

96
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 And there's hurt involved in that.

97
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 There's brokenness and there's some pain and some suffering.

98
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 And the reality is we're all in a journey in this area,

99
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 and I just want to recognize and acknowledge that there are feelings about this topic, strong feelings.

100
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Latest statistics would suggest that one in five people have been sexually abused or harassed at some point in their life.

101
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 One in five.

102
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 And so there are many of us in this room where this is a personal and painful topic,

103
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 and I want to just acknowledge that.

104
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 And I want to let you know that I'm not standing here as an expert on this topic,

105
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 nor am I standing here as someone who has complete victory in this area of my life.

106
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 I'm here also as a fellow sojourner, if you will,

107
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 in the challenges and the difficulties that this topic presents in our lives.

108
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 And so we're in this together.

109
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 And one of the problems is that when the church has tried to address this topic,

110
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 they've so often done it from a name and shame perspective.

111
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 And some of you in this room, I want to acknowledge this,

112
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 some of you in this room have only ever been felt shame from the church

113
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 because of your sexual history or your sexual background or your sexuality,

114
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 and you've only ever felt hurt or pain from the church.

115
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 Perhaps even, if I can be honest, this church.

116
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 And I'm convinced of a couple of things.

117
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 One is that the church has done a lot of damage in this area over the years,

118
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 perhaps even so the Vine.

119
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 I'm also convinced of this, that shame is never the way to help people walk through this topic.

120
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 And there have been way too many sermons that are based on trying to shame people into sexual purity.

121
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 I hope today is not one of those.

122
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 In fact, I'm convinced of this, that I think shame is one of the main reasons

123
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 why there is so much brokenness, and if that's the case,

124
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 then shame surely cannot be the solution to it.

125
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 Are you with me, church?

126
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 Here's the third and final thing.

127
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 I'm not here today, my assignment here today is not to give you my opinions about sex or relationships.

128
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 If you want opinions, you can go to Instagram and hear lots of people give you their opinions about it.

129
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 Today is about hearing what Scripture has to say about it,

130
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 what God's glorious vision is for this,

131
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 and for us to sit within that glorious vision in our hearts and our lives.

132
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 Is that okay?

133
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 So I hope that my opinion is limited,

134
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 and I hope that the Scriptures are the things that you hear and take away with you today.

135
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 And so to do that, we have to start in Scripture.

136
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 And I want to start right at the very beginning,

137
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 because the very first thing you need to understand about sex in God's perspective

138
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 is that it is interwoven into the creation story itself.

139
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 In fact, sex takes one of the prominent positions in the opening pages of the Bible.

140
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 I want to take you to Genesis 1, verse 27 and 28.

141
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 Is this okay still so far?

142
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 All right.

143
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 It says this, "So God created humanity or man in His own image.

144
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 In the image of God, He created him. Male and female, He created them.

145
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 God blessed them and said to them, 'Be fruitful and increase in number.

146
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 Fill the earth and subdue it.

147
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air,

148
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 over every living creature that moves on the ground.'"

149
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 These are the fundamental things that God says to His created beings, humanity,

150
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 His gendered beings, He speaks over them, these very critical things.

151
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 And what God is doing in these passages, these are famous words for you,

152
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 but I want to break this down in a way that perhaps you've not seen before or understood before.

153
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 I want you to really get a grasp of what God is trying to create

154
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 when He's created you and me and humanity.

155
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 And I want to do that by showing you the four specific things that God creates

156
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 right at the start that have something to say about who you are.

157
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 The first thing He says is that He blessed them.

158
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 Very simple words, He blessed them.

159
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 Before there was original sin, that happens in Genesis 3,

160
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 there's an original blessing that happens here in Genesis 1.

161
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 The very first thing He does after creating humanity is that He blesses humanity.

162
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 He pours out His heart towards humanity.

163
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 He creates pretty, this is the way of thinking about it,

164
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 He brings Himself into relationship with humanity

165
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 and invites humanity to be in relationship with Him.

166
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 That's the first primary thing that happens.

167
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 Before He says anything, before He does anything, before anything else happens,

168
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 He actually says, "I bless these people and they are to be in relationship with Me."

169
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 So what basically God does right at the start is He creates this worship element

170
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 of Him with humanity and humanity with Him.

171
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 We are created fundamentally to worship,

172
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 to be in relationship with God and in community with Him.

173
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 And we receive blessing in that and we give blessing to that as well.

174
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 You follow that?

175
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 Then He says, "I have made them in the image of Me, in God."

176
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 God makes us in His image.

177
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 This speaks primarily about the idea of identity.

178
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 Not only identity, okay?

179
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 Not only are we created to be worshipers, first and foremost,

180
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 in our blessed relationship with God,

181
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 but out of that He says, "You are made in My image."

182
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 He gives us an identity right at the start.

183
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 And here's what you have to hear.

184
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 That identity is central to who you are before you've done anything.

185
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 As soon as you are conceived in your mother's womb,

186
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 you are given identity as one who is created in the image of God.

187
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 That means that you have, listen, you have inherent value, worth, love, and goodness.

188
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 It's inherent in you.

189
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 That's what it means to be made in God's image.

190
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 No one is born into this world without any worth, any dignity, any value.

191
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 No matter who they are, no matter what they go on to do,

192
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 no matter whatever actions they might have,

193
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 no matter what sexual history they have,

194
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 in the beginning point, you are created with inherent value.

195
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 That's the gift of being made human in the image of God.

196
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 Are you with me?

197
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 That identity is really important that you understand,

198
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 and that you understand that that identity flows from your relationship with God.

199
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 And I'll come back to that in a bit more.

200
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 Then He says these words.

201
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 He says, "Be fruitful and multiply," or in other translations,

202
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 "Be fruitful and increase in number."

203
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 Here's the thing you've never seen before. I love this.

204
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 The first words of God over humanity are not, "Go and pray."

205
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 Come on, church.

206
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 The first words that God speaks over humanity are not, "Go and do a Bible study."

207
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 It's, "Go and have sex."

208
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 I'm going to say that again.

209
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 Somebody's going to edit this, and it's going to be really bad.

210
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 "Go and have sex."

211
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 That's what He says right up front.

212
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 He says, "Go and have sex together,"

213
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 because this is the way that you're going to express what it is to be in this relationship with me,

214
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 made in the image of God.

215
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 And so there is this sexuality that is right there at the beginning of all things.

216
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 Now, I want you to hear this.

217
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 If you've never had sex in this room, if you're a virgin,

218
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 or if you've made a decision to be celibate in your life for the rest of your life,

219
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 you are still a sexual being who has sexuality.

220
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 So this is not talking specifically only about the sex act.

221
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 So I want to make sure that those in this room who have never had sex feel included in God's picture.

222
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Sometimes we think if we haven't had sex, we're not fully who we are created to be.

223
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 I don't want you to hear that.

224
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 You, whether you've had the physical act of sex or not, you are a sexual being with sexuality.

225
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 You hold a sexualness to you, because that is what is being created in you in the image of God.

226
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Are you following this?

227
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 Okay, that's really important that you understand that there is sexuality that is created in us as human beings.

228
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 He then says, "Fill the earth and subdue it."

229
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 This is God basically saying, "Not only are you created to be in a relationship with me,

230
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 to know that you have inherent worth, value, and dignity, to be a sexual being,

231
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 but you are also created with purpose.

232
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 Go and fill the earth, subdue it, bring it under flourishing."

233
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 I don't have time to unpack this theologically, but essentially what God is saying is,

234
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 "Go into the world and co-partner with me in its shalom building, its shalom making.

235
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 Go and flourish this creation that I have created.

236
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 You humans are to partner with me in the flourishing of creation."

237
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 Now, I want you to see something really important here.

238
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 Not only do we have inherent self-worth, we also have active worth.

239
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Come on, church.

240
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 We have inherent worth.

241
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 So, in other words, if you never picked up any piece of work, if you never bothered to do anything in life,

242
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 you still have inherent worth, love, and dignity from God. Amen?

243
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 But he's also invited you to active worth, active dignity, active love in how we relate with one another,

244
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 how we do our work in the world, how we go and bring the purpose of the gospel into the world.

245
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 All of these things are relational things that we get to do and are invited into.

246
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 Are you still tracking with this?

247
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 Okay, so this is what it means to be human.

248
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 You are somebody who's created to worship.

249
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 You have an inherent dignity and worth.

250
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 You are a sexual being, and you have purpose, active worth, in what you are doing in this world.

251
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 This is all of us, and when you stand back from this, you begin to see a picture of what intimacy is.

252
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 Because intimacy flows from all four of these central things about who you are.

253
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 So, there is a spiritual intimacy, which connects to the worship of who you are.

254
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 There is spiritual intimacy.

255
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 There is also here emotional intimacy, because you have this inherent self-worth and dignity,

256
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 which gives you an emotional connection to who you are, to who God is, and to who creation is, and everybody around.

257
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 You also have a sexual intimacy, which again, as I said earlier, is not just about the idea of sex,

258
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 the physical act of sex itself, but you are given a sexual intimacy in terms of who you are made in the image of God.

259
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 And that actually is really important, because what it says is that our immeasurable worth in who we are,

260
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 created in God's image, and our sexual identity have always been linked from the very beginning.

261
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 It's really important you see this, because this actually has a lot to say later when we get into other areas.

262
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Our identity, who we are in the image of God, and our sexuality, those two things are inherently linked from the very beginning.

263
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 And then purpose is the idea of relational intimacy.

264
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 How we relate to one another, how we relate to the world around us, how we relate to creation.

265
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 These four areas are the areas of our intimacy, and what you need to see is that all four of these are interlinked together,

266
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 and none of them can exist alone, separate from the other.

267
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 We are created to be unified in these things.

268
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 So we have a spiritual intimacy, which impacts our emotional, sexual, and our relational intimacy.

269
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 Does that make sense to you?

270
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 But you also have a relational intimacy that also impacts your emotional, spiritual, and sexual intimacy as well.

271
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 You can't separate any of these together.

272
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 They're all together, all interlinked, and this is the way that it was created.

273
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 And God stands back from that and says, "That's very good. That's really good.

274
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 That's the way the things ought to be."

275
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 And then, before anything else happens in Genesis 3, something else significant happens in Genesis 2.

276
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 God says, "Here's how I've created every human being to be."

277
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 And when this gets expressed in the idea of family, in the way that God sees this being expressed in the idea of marriage and family,

278
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 this is where this takes on a fullness of itself.

279
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 So if I take you to the end of Genesis 2, it says, "For this reason, a man will leave his father and his mother and be united to his wife,

280
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 and they will become one flesh."

281
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 The man and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame.

282
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 There it is, no shame.

283
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 So this is what happens, and this is why the Bible focuses in on the idea of marriage.

284
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 That a couple can come together and be what's called here, "one flesh."

285
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 Let me unpack for you what this idea of one flesh is, because it has everything to link into what these four areas are.

286
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 The word that the writer here of Genesis, for oneness, the word he's using is the Hebrew word, "echad," E-C-H-A-D.

287
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 And "echad" means oneness formed out of many parts.

288
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 Now, here's the important thing for you to know.

289
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 The word "echad" is primarily used in the Old Testament to speak about God.

290
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 It's the primary word that's used in relation to who God is.

291
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 In fact, the central scripture of the Old Testament to speak about God's heart is the Shema.

292
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 "Love the Lord your God with all your mind, heart, soul, and strength. Love your neighbor as yourself."

293
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 That, the Shema, it begins with this.

294
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 It begins with, "You, O Lord, O God, are one."

295
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 It's the primary statement of the Old Testament position of who God is.

296
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 "You, Lord, are one." That's the word "echad."

297
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 What it's saying is the Trinity, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,

298
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 three somewhat different kind of elements, if you will,

299
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 come together to form a oneness in God that no one can break.

300
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 Do you see this?

301
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 And this is the important thing.

302
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 "Echad" is used in this relationship with God as the primary picture of who God is.

303
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 He is the Lord our God is one.

304
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 Three in one.

305
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 And there is a bond in that that cannot be shaken.

306
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 It cannot be broken.

307
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 They're in an intimacy and a relationship together that is the ultimate picture of oneness.

308
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 So when the writer of Genesis begins to think about,

309
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 "How do I describe the coming together of a couple in marriage?"

310
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 He goes, "I'm going to link it to who God is."

311
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 So what you've got to understand is that this is not just speaking about marriage.

312
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 What actually is happening here in Genesis 2 is speaking about God as well.

313
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 It's trying to bring marriage and God and the two of those things together as this one kind of idea.

314
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 When a couple comes together in marriage,

315
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 they become "echad" in the same kind of way that God is "echad."

316
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 And when God comes together in a oneness that no one can separate,

317
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 so these two can come together into a oneness that no one should separate.

318
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 So marriage becomes the primary picture in the world of the "echad" of God.

319
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 You still following this?

320
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 And this is a beautiful thing.

321
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 Because what it means to the couple getting married is that their relationship together

322
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 is lots of separate parts coming together to form one whole

323
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 that is a picture to the world of who God is.

324
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 So marriage is not just about the sex act.

325
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 But the sex act is included in this idea of coming together of the spirit, of the body,

326
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 of the emotions, of our relationship, of everything that we are comes together with the other person

327
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 that we're married to and in the sexual union, in the act of sex,

328
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 it is the ultimate outcome of the "echad" that is seen in God.

329
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 This is why the Bible makes a really strong point that sex is reserved for marriage.

330
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 Because if sex is the coming together, remember for the Bible, sex is never just a physical act.

331
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 That's one of the greatest lies of the world, that sex can just be physical.

332
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 The Bible stands against that picture.

333
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 Because the Bible says sex is part of this one flesh, "echad."

334
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 So it is mind and spirit and emotions and body and everything else all coming together in one.

335
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 And if that's the way it is, no one should be able to break that because that's never broken in God.

336
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 And if no one should break that, then you should not go do that with lots and lots and lots and lots of people.

337
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 Because if you do that, what you're actually showing the world is a separateness, not a oneness.

338
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 This is why sex is reserved for marriage in the Christian tradition and faith.

339
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 Because we get this beautiful gift to show the world oneness.

340
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 When done in the right way, sex and marriage stands boldly against the tendency in this world to see more separateness take place.

341
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 Now does that mean that Christian marriages are perfect?

342
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 No.

343
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 Does that mean that we don't still struggle with brokenness in marriage?

344
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 Of course it means all those things.

345
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 But that doesn't negate the reality that God has created this institution as the only place for sex to take place.

346
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 Because our physical act of sex is a part of our echadding in the world,

347
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 showing the world what the oneness of God is like.

348
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 So when this all comes together, I want you to see how this then all flows together.

349
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 Because here's the thing, sexual brokenness is essentially the breakdown of the oneness, the echad that God has created for it.

350
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 You need to understand if this thing here gets broken first,

351
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 when our relationship with God and our intimacy with Him, when that breaks, that always impacts this.

352
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 I need you to see the flow.

353
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 When this breaks, that impacts this.

354
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 Suddenly we don't feel loved anymore.

355
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 Suddenly we don't have the solid sense of inherent worth and value.

356
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 Because that solid sense of inherent worth and value only ever flows from intimacy and relationship with God.

357
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 God has imputed that to us, made in creation with Him, image of Him.

358
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 But when we break our relationship with Him, the first thing that takes place is us going, "I don't feel loved anymore.

359
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 I don't feel like I've got a value anymore."

360
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 And not only that, but I don't think others have the same value I thought they had before.

361
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 And here's the inevitability, when this breaks, this breaks, and then that will always break.

362
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 One of the reasons why we have such great sexual brokenness in the church,

363
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 there is so much sexual brokenness, I would say, in the church.

364
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 Primarily because there has been a breakdown in the fundamental relationship with God here,

365
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 which then has changed our belief and our acceptance of who we are and who others are.

366
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 When that happens, we will find ourselves pursuing and seeking sex as a way to get back how we feel about ourselves.

367
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 We will then use sex as a tool to try to feel more love, try to feel more acceptance,

368
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 try to feel more value in the world around us,

369
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 which inevitably is going to break our relationships more with the people around us.

370
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 Because when you have a selfish desire to use this to get that back, you're going to break this as well.

371
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 Following?

372
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 And so the way that God has created this is He's saying, "Can you just see the vision that I've created?"

373
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 When this is strong, you will have a strong sense of who you are.

374
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 And when you know that you're loved and you have a strong sense of who you are,

375
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 then you can reserve the sexual act for marriage,

376
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 believing that you want to show the world the oneness that there can be,

377
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 that two have been brought together.

378
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 Let no one break that apart.

379
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 And in that, in the security of that, you can raise children, have children,

380
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 flourish children, and have relational connections with those around us.

381
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 And you're not using relationships or identity and emotional brokenness and manipulation

382
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 to try to satisfy something here that can only truly be satisfied from here to there to there.

383
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 That's the beautiful invitational vision.

384
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 And here's the brokenness.

385
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 We so often turn people into objects.

386
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 The majority of sexual brokenness that happens in the world happens because we objectify people.

387
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 This is really powerful.

388
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 I want you to track this with all the theology I've been giving you this morning.

389
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 If Echad is about oneness, about separate parts coming together,

390
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 and if that oneness is best seen in marriage and in the way that that happens within marriage,

391
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 then here's what objectifying other people is all about.

392
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 It's about separating the parts again.

393
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 It's the opposite of Echad.

394
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 It is basically saying, "I'm not interested in you for your emotions, for your relationship, for who you are.

395
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 I'm only interested in your body.

396
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 I'm going to separate all the other elements of who you are,

397
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 and I'm just going to focus on your body for my own sexual gratification.

398
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 I think your body is attractive, and because I'm attracted to your body,

399
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 I'm going to now use that to gain pleasure and satisfaction for myself

400
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 because ultimately I'm broken here, and when I'm broken here, I think everybody else is broken,

401
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 and I will start doing the opposite of Echad.

402
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 I will separate people down to just their physicality,

403
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 and I will use that and abuse that to try to make myself feel better

404
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 when this is the thing that's truly broken."

405
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 Is this helping anyone?

406
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 That's the glorious vision, and that's why there is so much brokenness.

407
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 We've gotten our intimacy in the wrong way and in the wrong order.

408
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 Let me finish just by showing you a little demonstration of this.

409
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 I got this demonstration from another pastor.

410
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 Pastor is Robert Madu. He's based in the U.S., although lots of other pastors have done it since,

411
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 so I just wanted to tell you up front I'm gleaning something today.

412
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 Remember a few weeks ago? This is a glean, but I've changed it a little bit

413
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 to make it more applicable to what we're talking about today.

414
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 I want you to see these boxes of intimacy.

415
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 The largest box is always the spiritual one because that is the primary one

416
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 that has been created for us.

417
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 That is the top left-hand corner here.

418
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 That is the thing that is always for us.

419
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 Now, there are other intimacies that we have.

420
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 We have, for example, the emotional intimacy.

421
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 Emotional intimacy is a big one because there is also so much for us to say and do

422
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 and understand about ourselves.

423
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 As I've talked about earlier, we have this idea of relational intimacy.

424
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 That's a little bit smaller box because our relational intimacy is not just dependent on us.

425
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 It's dependent on other people.

426
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 There are boundaries sometimes to that.

427
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 We're not able to always be in relationship with the people we want to be in relationship with.

428
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 That one's a little bit smaller.

429
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 Then over here, we have the sexual intimacy box, which is the smallest of all

430
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 because this is the one that has the greatest boundaries around it in Scripture,

431
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 the one that has the context around it, and also it's the one that--yeah,

432
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 just is small because--yeah.

433
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 Anyway, it doesn't always last very long.

434
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 That's probably another way of saying it.

435
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 Okay, so--now, let me explain to you--sorry, sorry.

436
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 I should have said that.

437
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 There was bound to be something I was going to say that would come out wrong.

438
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 Okay, so I want you to see this.

439
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 Here's how I think we often approach relationships.

440
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 I would say in the world particularly but also, unfortunately, in the church,

441
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 we start with a sexual premise to begin with.

442
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 That person's hot.

443
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 I'm attracted to that person.

444
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 There's a desire for that body or there's a desire for that satisfaction.

445
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 Right off the back of that, we throw on some emotional intimacy

446
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 because what happens when you have physical sex with someone

447
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 is there's an incredible, powerful link of emotional insecurity.

448
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 But what you do is you connect your sex to the emotion,

449
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 and then that way, those things become unhealthily connected now

450
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 so that if you're having sex, you feel emotionally connected to that person.

451
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 When you're not or that's broken, then you struggle with your emotions

452
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 about that relationship.

453
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 In the world, often, we then try and throw relational intimacy on top of that

454
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 because it's like we try to buy first.

455
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 We get emotionally connected.

456
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 We then go, "Well, I guess maybe we should start dating or hanging out more

457
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 or maybe we should try and be a little bit more committed."

458
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 I think in the church, sometimes this is the driving factor.

459
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 We then find this, and then we decide that we need to get engaged

460
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 or something like that.

461
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 Then ultimately, if you're not a Christian, then that's where you'd stop.

462
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 But us Christians, we then want to slap some spiritual intimacy on top,

463
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 and that's what happens.

464
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 Are you with me?

465
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 Now, here's the biblical vision that God gives,

466
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 which is the one we need to understand.

467
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 It starts with the worship.

468
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 It's got to start with the spiritual intimacy first and foremost,

469
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 which then tells us who we are and who others are.

470
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 That's the identity piece that's there, which then, of course,

471
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 enables us to be in healthy relationship with those around us

472
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 as well as potentially a life partner.

473
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 If marriage does eventually come, then we can enjoy

474
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 the incredible sexual intimacy that has been provided out of it.

475
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 That's the biblical picture.

476
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 That's what I want to inspire you with today.

477
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 For those that are single here and perhaps never going to get married

478
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 or maybe have decided in celibacy,

479
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 it doesn't mean you're one-third or three-fourths a human being, remember?

480
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 Because you are a sexual person,

481
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 whether you're actually engaged in that activity or not,

482
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 you're a whole person, and you can still have healthy sexuality

483
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 even if you're celibate or not ever married

484
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 or if you're a virgin for life.

485
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 Does that make sense to you still?

486
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 But for those that do get married and can engage in that,

487
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 you then put that on top as a way of expressing this oneness,

488
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 the echad of who God is in marriage.

489
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 That, my friends, is the biblical vision.

490
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 I think as we lean into this and get inspired by this,

491
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 again, it doesn't mean that every Christian marriage is perfect,

492
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 but it does mean that we submit ourselves under the grace of God

493
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 and invite Him to help us.

494
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 Christianity is not behavior modification.

495
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 Christianity is inviting the vision of Christ and the gospel

496
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 into our hearts and our lives and saying,

497
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 "I want to live like that. God, give me the grace to do so.

498
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 And forgive me where I so know that I so often fall short,

499
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 but that does not negate the beautiful picture you've given me.

500
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 Help me. Help me to be one who can honor the echad

501
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 of who you are in this world."

502
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 So my encouragement to you today is not to feel bad.

503
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 Hopefully, you haven't felt shamed.

504
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 Instead, I hope you felt inspired.

505
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 I hope you've been welcomed into a beautiful, bigger vision

506
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 of who you are yourself.

507
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 And regardless of what state you are in life right now,

508
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 what status you might have in relationships,

509
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 that you would say, "This is what I want for me and my family."

510
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 And as we come together in that, we pray for each other

511
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 and we ask God to heal us of all the brokenness that is there.

512
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 Because if you're anything like me, there's brokenness there.

513
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 And we come around each other and encourage each other

514
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 and love on each other and pray for each other.

515
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 And we live because the world needs this narrative.

516
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 This is hope. This is how families are created.

517
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 This is how children are to be nurtured and brought into the world.

518
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 This is the way it should be.

519
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 And God stands back from that and says, "It is very good."

520
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 Can I pray for you? Let's pray.

521
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 Father, I thank you so much for every person here.

522
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 And Father, I thank you for the fact that you've made them human.

523
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 And as we've seen this morning, that's such a glorious picture.

524
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 And you've created us sexual beings.

525
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 And you've given us this gift of sex and all of its beauty and wonder and mystery.

526
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 And Father, we pray that you would help us to be good stewards

527
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 of the intimacy you have blessed us with.

528
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 Spiritual, emotional, relational, and sexual.

529
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 And that in our stewardship of that intimacy, we would remind ourselves

530
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 that it is our relationship with you, out of which flows everything else.

531
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 And when that relationship breaks, other things also begin to fall.

532
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 And I wonder whether you would just take a moment here this morning,

533
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 just to allow God to speak to you about you and Him.

534
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 That spiritual intimacy with Him.

535
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 Because how you think about yourself and how you think about others,

536
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 and therefore your sexuality, and therefore your relationships,

537
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 all flow from that point.

538
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 You're blessed. You have inherent worth and dignity and value.

539
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 He loves you.

540
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 But when that breaks down, everything else breaks down behind it.

541
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 So maybe today's response is just for you and Him.

542
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 Just to take a moment now.

543
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 Maybe for some of you, you want to worship Him.

544
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 You want to just offer your life and heart to Him again.

545
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 For some, it might be you want to listen to what He has to say to you today

546
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 about this area of sexual identity and sexuality and sex itself.

547
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 Perhaps for some of you, it's opening your heart

548
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 to what the Holy Spirit might want to challenge you about.

549
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 But it's you and God always, first and foremost.

550
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 And out of that might come the need for other things.

551
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 But right now, I want to encourage you to connect with Him.

552
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 And in that intimacy, you would hear His voice.

553
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,340
