1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
 Today we continue our sermon series on a remedy for relationships and we have Pastor Tim.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:14,000
 Communal relationships. The last three and a half years, they've been exhausting.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:25,120
 First we had social unrest, we had the protests in 2019, and then in 2020, Covid-19, the pandemic hit.

4
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:33,600
 So I don't know about you, but this season just has been tiring and has been wearing us out to

5
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:41,600
 one degree or another. So it's no surprise that this has impacted us in many different ways.

6
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:50,640
 So in some ways that this has impacted us relationally, socially, economically,

7
00:00:52,160 --> 00:01:00,640
 emotionally, but also spiritually. Our relationship with Jesus

8
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,800
 has suffered during this time for many of us.

9
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,760
 There's many different reasons for that and I'm just going to name a few. It might not be your

10
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,360
 reason, but I believe there's ways that everyone has been impacted by what's been happening.

11
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,720
 So perhaps during this time you got stuck in addictive behavior.

12
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,880
 Maybe it's an old addiction, maybe it was something new.

13
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:37,840
 Maybe the worries that all this, what's happening around us, the social isolation, all that brought

14
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:45,680
 just was so overwhelming and absorbed all our time and all our energy. That was just crushing us

15
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,800
 and it's this heavy burden that's been like just laying on our shoulder.

16
00:01:48,800 --> 00:02:00,240
 Then for others, perhaps you've been upset with God, the church, even church leadership,

17
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:07,120
 or maybe we're just tired and we're drained and there's just a level of exhaustion that

18
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,680
 just doesn't seem to go away. It's been running on empty for quite a while.

19
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,320
 So I don't know exactly what's been happening in your life, but to one degree or another,

20
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,080
 we all have been impacted and our relationship with Jesus has impacted.

21
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:29,680
 So today, we want to hear how God wants to speak to us about that, speak into our lives about this

22
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,280
 tiredness, this exhaustion. And so we're going to explore two questions together. The first one is,

23
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:43,520
 how does Jesus invite us to receive the grace and the life that he has to offer that restores,

24
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:50,640
 renews, and truly satisfies? So that's the first question. And then the second one that we're

25
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,400
 going to look at is, what are some of the ways of relating to Jesus that have kept us from

26
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:07,680
 experiencing all the fullness that he has to offer to us? So we are in the Remedy of Relationships

27
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,800
 series, and today our topic is communal relationships. We're going to look at the

28
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:19,040
 count of Jesus in the Gospel of John. And before we read the passage together, I just want to set

29
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:27,600
 the context for us. So Jesus is by the Lake of Galilee, and he's in the middle of nowhere,

30
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:33,040
 but people have been following. So there's 5,000 plus people with him, and he does an incredible

31
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:40,080
 miracle. People are hungry, they need food, and so he multiplies bread and fish so that everyone

32
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:49,440
 has enough to eat. I mean, it's amazing. But then Jesus discerns that the crowd, they want to make

33
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:55,840
 him king, and they have an agenda for him, but that's not the type of king that Jesus has come

34
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,840
 to be. And so he decides to withdraw, and he goes to the mountainside. And in the meantime,

35
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,520
 the disciples, they take the only boat, and they start heading back to Capernaum,

36
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,400
 on the other side of the lake. And I'm like, "Why are the disciples taking off without Jesus?

37
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,800
 What kind of friends are that? Just leaving him behind, right?" So then in the middle of the night,

38
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:24,000
 Jesus, he also starts heading back, and another miracle occurs. He walks on water,

39
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,400
 and he meets some of the disciples, and they go to Capernaum. So that's where we are picking up

40
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:35,760
 the story. The crowd wakes up from their camping trip in the wilderness, and they're looking for

41
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:42,080
 Jesus. Where did he go? And they take some boats, and also head to Capernaum, and that's where we

42
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:51,920
 enter. It's John 6, verse 25 to 35. So it says, "When they found him on the other side of the lake,

43
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:58,240
 they asked him, 'Rabbi, when did you get here?' Jesus answered, 'Very truly I tell you,

44
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,080
 you are looking for me, not because you saw the signs I performed, but because you ate the loaves

45
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:11,680
 and you had your fill. Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life,

46
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:19,840
 which the Son of Man will give you. For in him God the Father has placed his seal of approval.'

47
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:26,800
 Then they asked him, 'What must we do to do the works God requires?'

48
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:35,760
 Jesus answered, 'The work of God is this, to believe in the one he has sent.' So then they

49
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:42,240
 ask him, 'What sign will he give us that we may see it and believe you? What will you do?'"

50
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,720
 Just think of this right now for a moment. He just did this incredible miracle,

51
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,560
 and right now they're asking Jesus again for a sign. Crazy, right? Continuing,

52
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,640
 "Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness. As it is written, 'He gave them bread from heaven to

53
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:07,520
 eat.' So Jesus said to them, 'Very truly I tell you, it is not Moses who gave you that bread from

54
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:14,640
 heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is the

55
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:22,720
 bread that comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.' 'Sir,' they said, 'always give us

56
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:30,240
 this bread.' Then Jesus declared, 'I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry,

57
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,320
 and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.'"

58
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:41,920
 So here we have a part of a dialogue between the crowd and Jesus.

59
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:48,320
 And there are some postures and some attitudes in the crowd that I want us to take a look at,

60
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:56,800
 because these postures and attitudes, they actually undermine what Jesus wants to do

61
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,160
 in the people's lives. And it's keeping them from fully experiencing and fully receiving

62
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:08,160
 what Jesus has to offer to them. And I believe that we hold those same postures,

63
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,200
 and they also stand in the way of what Jesus wants to do in our lives.

64
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,800
 So let's look. There's three things we're going to look at. Let's look at the first one.

65
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,240
 So when they find Jesus in Capernaum, they ask him, "When did you get here?"

66
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:32,720
 And asking this question, "When," is rather trivial. Basically, it's small talk.

67
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,640
 And Jesus, it's interesting how he responds. He doesn't say when he got there, how he got there.

68
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:46,000
 He's not like, "Oh yeah, so I was on the mountain, and then about 3 a.m. at night, I decided to walk

69
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,720
 on water, and then at 3.45, you know, I arrived." So he doesn't do that. But what he does is he cuts

70
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,320
 right through the chase, and he gets right to what's going on. He speaks truth, and he says this.

71
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:04,800
 He says, "Very truly, I tell you, you're looking for me, not because you saw the sign I performed,

72
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,680
 but because you ate the loaves and you had your fill."

73
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:18,000
 Now, Jesus, he loves us, and he doesn't shy away from confronting us, but also speaking truth to us.

74
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,320
 Because he wants for us to fully receive what he has to offer. He doesn't want the crowd to

75
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:30,800
 miss that. But he doesn't shy away from calling things out. Whenever we come before Jesus,

76
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:37,680
 he knows everything about our lives anyhow. And he already has decided that he loves us,

77
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,000
 and his grace and forgiveness, he wants to extend that to us.

78
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:50,560
 But the crowd, he's discerning that they're coming to him with wrong motives.

79
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:59,200
 And they don't come to him because they saw him perform the sign that pointed to that he is the

80
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,600
 son of God, that he's the Redeemer, he's the way that Messiah. That's not why they come to him.

81
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:11,120
 They come because their stomachs were filled. They got food. And so they focus on the sign,

82
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,480
 the bread, instead of what that bread and that multiplication of the bread, what that points to,

83
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,280
 the significance of it, and the thing that Jesus wants them to see.

84
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:38,240
 And they approach Jesus with their own agenda. They want Jesus to make more food for them.

85
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:46,480
 Now, today when you ask somebody, or if you ask, actually let's do it this way, if you ask somebody

86
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,800
 back then, "Why do you work?" They would say, "We work just to put food on our table and to survive."

87
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:59,440
 You know, that's really the reason why you work. And scholars, they estimate that about 80% of

88
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:06,400
 people's income back then went just to providing for food. Now, for some of us, that might still

89
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:11,520
 be true today, but for a lot of us, we don't use as much of our money for providing food.

90
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:17,600
 And so this food was very significant to the people. It was a matter of life and death.

91
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:26,960
 And so they're focused on the food, and they want Jesus to make more food. They want to fit

92
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:32,240
 Jesus into their agenda, into their business. They're like, "Hey, Jesus, let's make more food.

93
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:39,040
 You make more food, and then we can start this fishing business. We can buy a boat,

94
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,320
 you know, the thing that we always dreamed of. We can buy that field." I'm just trying to imagine

95
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,960
 what people dream of, you know, back then. Fishing boats, fields, chickens.

96
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:58,400
 But we still do the same thing today. We also approach Jesus with the wrong motives,

97
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:04,800
 and we try to fit him into our agenda, that Jesus helps us, you know, succeed in business,

98
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:11,040
 that Jesus helps us or does this relationship thing for us. And it's okay to bring those

99
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:17,360
 things to Jesus. Actually, we can come with those things to him, and he loves when we pray and bring

100
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:23,280
 those up. He loves to bless his people. He loves to give good gifts to his children. He loves that.

101
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:30,240
 But when we only come for him to accomplish our agenda, and we don't care about the relationship.

102
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,840
 We're just, we miss Jesus who's standing right in front of us.

103
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:38,880
 We miss what he wants to give us, because we're just so focused on our agenda.

104
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,640
 So, when we only approach Jesus with the purpose of having him help us achieve our goals and

105
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:51,680
 accomplish our own ends, we miss out on what he truly has to offer us, which is a life-transforming

106
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,320
 relationship. Now, I don't know if you have experienced that when you're interacting with

107
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:03,360
 somebody, that they just talk to you because they're trying to get you to accomplish their agenda. And

108
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,640
 they're super focused on that. I've had this experience to the point where I'm like, even like,

109
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:13,920
 "Hey, I'm here." Like, but I felt like not even acknowledged as a person. So, Jesus is saying,

110
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,120
 "I'm right here to the crowd. Don't miss out on me, what I have to offer to you."

111
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:27,360
 So, we try to fit Jesus in our agenda, and we miss out on the relationship, the grace, and the life

112
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:35,200
 that he has to offer to us, that he wants to give us and pour out over our lives, and let this good,

113
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:45,200
 beautiful work unfold in us. So, what are some ways that you're trying to fit Jesus into your agenda?

114
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:53,280
 Well, let's look at how the conversation can take place.

115
00:12:53,280 --> 00:13:00,320
 Well, let's look at how the conversation continues. So, Jesus continues to respond. He says,

116
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:07,360
 "Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of

117
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:15,440
 Man will give you. For in him, God the Father has placed the seal of approval." So, besides exposing

118
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:22,320
 their wrong motives and agendas when they come to Jesus, now he encourages them to stop striving

119
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,960
 and working for food that does not truly, fully fulfill.

120
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:37,360
 And he asks them to focus on food that endures to eternal life. So, what Jesus is saying to

121
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:44,240
 the crowd is, "Stop chasing after things that don't fully satisfy you. You're chasing after

122
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:53,600
 the wrong things." And so, we long for this deeper quality of life. We have these deep longings of

123
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,960
 significance. We want to be significant. We want to be worthy. We want to be lovable, loved.

124
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:08,960
 And we try to find those things in material things and other things, and we chase after them.

125
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:18,560
 And we say to ourselves, "I know what will make me happy. If only I could have this flat, this job,

126
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:24,400
 this education, then I will truly be happy. Then I will truly be whole."

127
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,480
 And so, then we start chasing after those things.

128
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:34,640
 Now, I remember when I was a teenager in the 90s, so it's been a while,

129
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:44,720
 the big popular thing at that time were Levi 501 jeans. Come on now. I heard, somebody told me that

130
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:52,320
 they're popular again. Is that true? Yeah? Kind of? Yeah? And so, for me, I thought, "If I get those

131
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,840
 jeans, I'm going to be cool. And the girl I have is going to have a crush on, she's going to like me."

132
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:04,400
 And so, I went to my parents, and I also told them what the, how much the jeans cost, which at that

133
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,960
 time was 200 marks, 100 US dollars, which now is like 200 or something like that. And they're like,

134
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:18,000
 "No." So, my dreams were crushed. But then we went to the US, and in the US, that pair cost $32 or

135
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,200
 something like that. And I was like, "Yes!" And so, I got a pair or two. And when I came back,

136
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:32,880
 did they really deliver on being cool? Not really. Did they really help with the crush?

137
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,560
 So, I wrote her a little love note, put it in her pencil case, that was like the thing back then.

138
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:45,120
 And then she thought that somebody was trying to mess with me and had sort of written a fake note.

139
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:53,120
 Ouch. So, it didn't work with either. But I know this is kind of a silly story, but the reason why

140
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,840
 I'm telling this story is because I had this object, these jeans, and they stirred within me

141
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:04,960
 a desire that I thought, "If only I had this, then I will be cool. Then I will be loved."

142
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:12,800
 We do the same thing with objects and with relationships. They stir within us a desire

143
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,680
 and a longing. They touch on something very deep inside of us. We say, "If only I have this,

144
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:23,520
 then I will be okay. Then I will be whole. Then I will be content. Then I will be truly happy."

145
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:36,960
 And so, we make things that are good things in themselves, we make them ultimate things.

146
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:45,120
 We turn them into idols that we believe will fulfill our deepest longings, and we chase after

147
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:52,400
 them. Now, Tim Keller, a well-known New York City pastor, he defines idols as follows. He puts it,

148
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:58,240
 "An idol is anything more important to you than God, anything that absorbs your heart and

149
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:05,200
 imagination more than God, anything you seek to give you what only God can give."

150
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:15,200
 Now, those jeans, they stirred in my heart and my imagination. It really was a focus for me,

151
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:22,000
 and we have other things in our lives that do the same thing for us. And we think that this

152
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,520
 job or this degree or this relationship will bring this deep satisfaction.

153
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:34,640
 And a lot of times, they do bring pleasure. They're not bad things in themselves,

154
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:41,600
 but they never fully deliver what we hope for and what we expect. And what we do then is like,

155
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,520
 "Well, you know, oh yeah, that's okay." And then we set our heart on something else,

156
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,960
 we chase after that, and we think that that will give us this true contentment, this true happiness.

157
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:58,880
 But it fails to deliver. And so Jesus is saying to the crowd, "Do not work for food that spoils,

158
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,880
 but for food that endures eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you.

159
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:10,000
 Come and receive from me the life that I have to offer to you. Let me fill you,

160
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:20,960
 because I do deliver. I do satisfy. I do meet those deep longings that nothing else can fill."

161
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:31,760
 So Jesus challenges us to stop investing all our time and energy into trying to find fulfillment

162
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:38,960
 in material things, and instead invest ourselves in Him as our source of true and lasting satisfaction.

163
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:49,920
 So what's been taking up your imagination? What's been stirring in your heart? And what have you

164
00:18:49,920 --> 00:19:00,800
 been chasing after? So the third thing in that dialogue between a crowd I want to highlight is,

165
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:07,040
 so Jesus, He challenged the crowd to work for food that endures. And so the crowd,

166
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:14,880
 they pick up on the word "work." "Work? I like to work." And they asked Him, "What

167
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:21,840
 must we do to do the works God requires?" They're asking Jesus to give them a to-do list

168
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:29,440
 so they can receive His favor, receive His blessing, that they can be acceptable.

169
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:37,280
 Because they want to know what they need to do. And basically the idea with which

170
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:44,240
 they're relating to Jesus is that God's goodness, love, and generosity towards them, towards us,

171
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:51,920
 depends on our efforts. Like if I'm a good person, if I'm a good Christian, if I pray more and stop

172
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:56,720
 doing the bad thing that I'm doing, then Jesus will love me, then I will be okay, then He will

173
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:05,440
 bless my plans that I have. And we do that. And it's not surprising because that's actually how

174
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:12,480
 a lot of our life works. You know, when we were children, if we were a bad boy or a bad girl,

175
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,440
 then we didn't get the reward, but if we were good, we got the cookie.

176
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:30,400
 And it also works in a lot of relationships for us that way, that we have to earn favor or work

177
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,600
 on, you know, recovering the favor that we maybe had and earn that love back. And so it's no

178
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:40,800
 surprise that we apply the same thing to God. Maybe try to earn God's favor, we try to earn

179
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:49,840
 God's blessing, we try to earn God's love, but that's not how it works. Because Jesus, He loves

180
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:58,000
 us. So Jesus, He responds to that, that way of approaching Him through works and through our

181
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:05,600
 efforts. In verse 29, He says this, "The work of God is this, to believe in the one He has sent."

182
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:12,960
 And it's interesting because before the crowd asked Him, "What works must we do?" So they're

183
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:19,040
 focusing on themselves and the works that they need to do. But now here, it's talking about

184
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:26,720
 the work of God, so the work that God already has done. And all they need to do is to believe

185
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,360
 in the one He has sent, which is Jesus talking to them.

186
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,000
 Because the only way of receiving and experiencing God's love is

187
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,960
 if we place our trust in Him. We can't earn it. It's a grace gift,

188
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:49,520
 this unmerited God's goodness that He just wants to pour on us and give us.

189
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:55,200
 But a lot of times, we work really hard to earn God's love.

190
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,240
 We try to redeem ourselves instead of letting Jesus redeem us. We put faith in our own works

191
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,720
 instead of putting faith in what God has already done.

192
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:15,520
 And a lot of times, we like it that way because then we can feel like God owes us something or

193
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:22,400
 we can demand something from God. But God, just in His love and goodness, He just wants to pour

194
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:28,000
 His forgiveness, His life. He wants to renew us. He just wants to pour that into our lives.

195
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:36,480
 But we can only receive it as a gift when we come to Him and just receive what He has to offer to us.

196
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:46,080
 So let's briefly review these three ways of how the crowd related to Jesus and how we a lot of

197
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:52,240
 times relate to Jesus. First, there was trying to put Jesus, fitting Jesus into our agenda,

198
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,200
 where we just try to have Jesus accomplish what we're trying to do. We don't really care about

199
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:03,840
 how He wants to relate to us or who He is. We just want Him to do for us what we want done.

200
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:12,480
 So that's the first thing. Then, there is the part where we focus on material things

201
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:18,560
 and we think that they're going to fully satisfy us. We even forget about Jesus. We get distracted.

202
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:23,440
 And we think that these things will make us happy. And so we chase after them. We give

203
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:30,000
 it our energy. We give it our life. But it always comes up short. Yes, there is some pleasure,

204
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,960
 but it always comes up short. It never fully delivers.

205
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:43,120
 And then, we try to earn favor. We try to earn God's love. And we strive so hard. And it's so

206
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:51,600
 exhausting and depressing because it's never enough. But again, that's not how it works.

207
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:58,320
 Because Jesus just freely wants to pour the Spirit on us and give us this life that He has for us.

208
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:09,040
 So now, we see in all these ways that we come and we approach Jesus or have or that has crept back

209
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:14,960
 into our lives. But let's turn to the question we originally asked, which was, "How does Jesus

210
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:21,760
 invite us to receive the grace and life that He has to offer that restores, that renews,

211
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:28,080
 and that truly satisfies?" How do we receive that? How do we receive that today?

212
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:36,960
 Because a lot of us are exhausted and tired. And there's brokenness in our lives.

213
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:47,760
 Maybe we barely made it to church today. Maybe we're just watching online. We've barely turned

214
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:54,080
 on the service because we're so ashamed about what's been happening in our lives.

215
00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:02,480
 And we feel so distanced from God. But if you notice throughout the dialogue, Jesus keeps

216
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:10,160
 leaning in. He doesn't give up on us. He didn't give up on the crowd. He keeps wanting to draw

217
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:16,240
 them in and wanting them to fully see Him, who He is and what He has to offer. And He wants to do

218
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:25,040
 the same here today with us. He wants you to fully see Him and to receive what He has to offer to you.

219
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:32,320
 His love, His grace, His goodness, His kindness. He just wants to pour it on you.

220
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,680
 We're exhausted. He wants to renew you.

221
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:40,400
 Where there's an addiction, He wants to break the power of addiction in your life.

222
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:49,440
 That's what Jesus does. So the dialogue continues with the crowd.

223
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:56,800
 And then we come to this ultimate declaration that Jesus makes in verse 35. He says,

224
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:04,400
 "I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me

225
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:16,880
 will never be thirsty. I am the source that fully satisfies in a way that nothing else can satisfy."

226
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:22,720
 That's what Jesus is saying. If you notice, He used the phrase "I am."

227
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,400
 In the book of Exodus, God uses that phrase to reveal who He is, His name to Moses.

228
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:37,760
 And so this is a revelation moment where Jesus is revealing who He is to the crowd

229
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:43,840
 so that they may fully see Him, that they know that life and satisfaction are found in Him.

230
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:51,600
 And in the Gospel of John, there's seven "I am" statements where every time Jesus reveals

231
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:58,160
 a little bit more about who He is and who He wants us to know who He is.

232
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:07,840
 And He does the same today. He reveals Himself to us. He makes Himself known to every person.

233
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:14,960
 Because He wants you to see, He wants us to see who He is,

234
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,640
 and how He loves us, how He meets us,

235
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:29,920
 even when our lives are a mess, when they're broken, when they're in shambles, when they're ugly.

236
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:41,840
 So the remedy for brokenness, for our brokenness,

237
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,080
 tiredness, and emptiness is found when we come to Jesus.

238
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:51,280
 When we commune with Him, He invites us into a relationship.

239
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:58,080
 And when we receive His grace poured out over us through the work of the Holy Spirit.

240
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,960
 I want to invite the worship team to come up.

241
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:12,480
 Our messy and broken lives, they're renewed not because of what we do,

242
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:18,160
 but they're renewed because of what Jesus has to offer and what He has done.

243
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:24,560
 And a lot of times you feel like that we first need to clean up our life and get our lives together.

244
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:29,040
 And I first need to stop my addiction before I can come to Jesus.

245
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:36,080
 But that's not how it works. Jesus is just saying, "Come, come to me.

246
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:43,040
 Let me fill you with that bread, with that water that quenches your thirst and your hunger."

247
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:55,040
 And that's when we come, and because we come to Jesus, that the power of sin is broken in our lives.

248
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,520
 And when He pours out His Spirit, His Holy Spirit into us,

249
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:10,320
 because of the Spirit's work and the grace, we can become different people. We can live differently.

250
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:17,440
 That's how it works. We come to Jesus' empty hand and we say, "Jesus, I need you."

251
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:27,280
 We just pour whatever's been going on. And then Jesus, He loves pouring out His grace for us.

252
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:31,680
 He loves us and He wants to give us this life that He has to offer.

253
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:37,440
 So as we receive this grace, it never leaves us untouched.

254
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:45,200
 God's grace touches us, moves us, because it's so beautiful and it's so undeserved.

255
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:51,200
 The grace of God, it breaks the power of sin and addiction in our lives.

256
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,680
 And today, as I was praying, I did really have the sense

257
00:29:55,680 --> 00:30:00,480
 that some of us are struggling in that area, and there's been a lot of shame,

258
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,880
 and it's even been making it hard for us to come to church.

259
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:11,360
 But Jesus today, He wants to break the addiction and the sin, the power of that over your life.

260
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:17,680
 He wants to set you free, because He loves you. You're not created to live in that way.

261
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:24,880
 He has something better for you.

262
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:33,600
 And so when the grace of God is poured out over us, we become, it says in the Gospel of John,

263
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,560
 "become born again, born by the Spirit." He gives us new life. We're a new creation.

264
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:44,080
 If anyone is in Christ Jesus, He's a new creation. The old has gone, the new has come.

265
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,440
 Jesus does something new, something beautiful. We come with our brokenness. He takes it,

266
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:57,600
 and He does something new. And He does it over and over again, because even if you're Christian,

267
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:04,880
 we still need His grace. We still need His filling. We still need His renewing work in our lives.

268
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:13,520
 And so He's inviting all of us to come to Him, to receive, to be filled up again, to be renewed.

269
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:27,040
 I was at a point in my life a few years ago where I was just empty, had nothing left.

270
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:33,760
 I honestly didn't care if I died at that point. I've shared this story before.

271
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,680
 And I came to Jesus empty-handed.

272
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:52,800
 And He met me, and He poured where I had lost hope. He gave me hope and renewed faith. I thought

273
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:57,600
 there was no point in living on and moving forward. But He gave me hope to move forward.

274
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,720
 And where I saw a dead end, He created a new and an open way for me.

275
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,800
 And He spoke words over my life. "I am not finished with you yet."

276
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:12,320
 And Jesus right now, He's speaking that over our lives here. "I am not finished with you yet.

277
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:17,200
 I'm going to do something new. I'm going to break the power of sin that's been holding

278
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,840
 you back from all that I want to give you. And He's not finished with us yet.

279
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:26,800
 So I'm going to pray over us. Let me do this right now.

280
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:38,080
 Jesus, we come to you. We're tired. We're exhausted. We're stuck in sin.

281
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:49,120
 We're angry. You know what people are feeling and experiencing and where they're at.

282
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,160
 And Jesus, I thank you that when we come to you, when we come empty-handed, we say, "Jesus, I need

283
00:32:54,160 --> 00:33:03,920
 you. That you meet us every single time. That you never disappoint. That you pour your Spirit over us.

284
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:11,440
 That you do a beautiful, healing, renewing, and restoring work. And Jesus, I pray right now,

285
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:16,480
 you know what everybody's going through. And I pray that in the unique way that everyone needs

286
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,120
 us right now, that you, Holy Spirit, we ask you to come and minister to people's hearts.

287
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,720
 That you do that healing, renewing, refreshing work in people's lives.

288
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:38,240
 That you pour out your grace. We need it, Jesus. And we give you the thanks that you forgive us,

289
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:44,240
 that you love us, that you redeem us, that you renew us, and that you are refreshing us right now.

290
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,560
 I pray this in your name, Jesus. Amen.

291
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:55,200
 I do want to invite you to just meditate and come to Jesus right now on your own.

292
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,720
 And then in a little while, the worship team will lead us in worship. So let's do that right now.

293
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,000
 Talk to God. Share with him what's been going on. And receive his grace.

294
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:17,440
 And receive the Holy Spirit and the work he wants to do in your life.
