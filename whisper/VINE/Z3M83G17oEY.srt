1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,400
 This is the third week of Advent.

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:04,600
 We are 10 days away from Christmas.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,700
 How are you guys doing?

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,240
 Too many parties already?

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,480
 You're like, oh good, too many parties, too many wine.

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,840
 Like, oh, I'm so tired.

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,120
 Too many parties?

8
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,000
 Anybody went to more than like three Christmas parties

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,840
 already?

10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,240
 Yeah.

11
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,080
 Yeah.

12
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,460
 Well, yeah, staff and small group

13
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,280
 and our daughter's school's Christmas parties were three.

14
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:34,340
 Anyway, party is great, party is good.

15
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:39,880
 Nobody believes a pastor is saying that, hey, come on,

16
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,440
 parties are biblical, all right?

17
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,040
 You see parties in the Bible.

18
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,940
 As long as we are doing, you know,

19
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,360
 we're celebrating for the right thing,

20
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,060
 we're not getting wasted, it's biblical, come on.

21
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,760
 Do you know that when we get saved,

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,280
 there's a party going on in heaven?

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,900
 You know that, right?

24
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,380
 So celebration, it's good, it's biblical.

25
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:05,400
 And in fact, celebration, it's a vital part of life,

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,560
 it's so important that what we're doing here

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,880
 every Sunday morning or afternoon,

28
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,820
 it's a celebration in itself, right?

29
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,960
 The songs we sing, the way we, you know,

30
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,040
 the way you clap, the way we do what we do,

31
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,800
 it's part of a celebration, amen?

32
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,800
 I'm like, okay, half of you, half agree with me, okay.

33
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,160
 All right, I still love you.

34
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:31,860
 Anyway, so Christmas is coming,

35
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,660
 I'm sure you've been hearing a lot of music going on.

36
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,560
 We did sing some Christmas songs,

37
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,360
 and in the car, I play Christmas songs,

38
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,960
 and fun fact, my daughter asked me to play a Christmas song

39
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,760
 a couple weeks ago, said I want Christmas song in the car.

40
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,960
 I was about to reach for, you know,

41
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,920
 jingle bells or something, and she said,

42
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,620
 I want last Christmas.

43
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,620
 [audience laughing]

44
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,040
 Yeah, so you know the music taste of my daughter now.

45
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,840
 Anyway, yeah, music, it's so beautiful,

46
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,880
 and we sang a lot of Christmas songs,

47
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,080
 a lot of the songs we do, they are for Christmas only.

48
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,980
 Worship team, we have a special set list for Christmas.

49
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,640
 And in fact, in the Bible story or in the Bible narrative,

50
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,280
 when you look into it, in the gospel of Luke,

51
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,440
 those chapters talking about the birth of Jesus,

52
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,120
 there were indeed some songs inside.

53
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,120
 Today, we're going to talk about one of them,

54
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,680
 and that song, it's by Mary, Jesus' mother.

55
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,820
 Let me just read that to you in fact here.

56
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:40,640
 Sorry, this is what the water is for, sorry.

57
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,500
 So we'll start from Luke chapter one, verse 46.

58
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,200
 There it says, Mary said, my soul glorifies the Lord,

59
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,600
 and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,

60
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,160
 for he has been mindful of the humble state of his servant,

61
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,520
 me basically, from now on all generations

62
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,920
 will call me blessed, for the mighty one

63
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,760
 has done great things for me, holy is his name.

64
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,120
 His mercies extend to those who fear him

65
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,360
 from generation to generation.

66
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,880
 He has performed mighty deeds with his arms.

67
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,440
 He has scattered those who are proud

68
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,920
 in their inmost thoughts.

69
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,360
 He has brought down rulers from their thrones

70
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,440
 but has lifted up the humble.

71
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,740
 He has filled the hungry with good things

72
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,400
 but has sent the rich away empty.

73
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,600
 He has helped his servant Israel,

74
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,940
 remembering to be merciful to Abraham

75
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,800
 and his descendants forever,

76
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,320
 just as he promised our ancestors.

77
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:45,200
 So you probably would have heard of this before.

78
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,440
 Some composer, they even use these words, compose music,

79
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,400
 put a soundtrack to these words,

80
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,840
 and it becomes songs that we would sing

81
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,920
 throughout different centuries of the church.

82
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,160
 And we've been calling this song

83
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,880
 or this passage the Magnificat.

84
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,640
 It comes from the very first word in this passage

85
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,560
 in the Latin Bible.

86
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,040
 So this, oh, it's on the screen, thank you.

87
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,400
 This Magnificat, it's a beautiful pieces,

88
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,820
 but if you start reading it,

89
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,640
 and if you are a Bible reader,

90
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,840
 you like to read, for example,

91
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,400
 the Psalms in the Old Testament when you can't sleep,

92
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,360
 or maybe you can sleep, you just love reading the Bible,

93
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,480
 you start reading it,

94
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,280
 you find a little bit of similarities.

95
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,720
 This Psalm started with, you know,

96
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,080
 my soul glorifies the Lord,

97
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,240
 and my spirit, and my spirit does what?

98
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,860
 My spirit will also, you know, sing in praises.

99
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,880
 My spirit is also worshiping him, worship God, my Savior.

100
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,240
 And this kind of remind you of something

101
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,320
 like Psalm 103, right?

102
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,880
 You know, bless the Lord, oh my soul, something like that.

103
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,640
 And if we continue to read,

104
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,320
 and we would see this Psalm,

105
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,680
 actually it follows a certain format.

106
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,280
 This format in the Old Testament Psalm,

107
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,520
 one of the hymns we call it,

108
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,560
 we call this kind of Psalm a Thanksgiving Psalm,

109
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,320
 a Thanksgiving poem.

110
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,200
 And it always starts with a call to worship,

111
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,960
 or a call to praise God,

112
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,720
 or in itself just a statement to praise God.

113
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,440
 Like what I just said, bless the Lord, oh my soul.

114
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,600
 It's a statement calling myself to praise God.

115
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,400
 This is what Mary is doing here.

116
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,400
 My soul, my soul, my soul glorifies the Lord.

117
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:36,000
 And it's like one of these old Psalms that we normally read.

118
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,600
 And when Mary says my soul and my spirit,

119
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,720
 she is actually saying my very being, my whole self,

120
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,120
 I'll be here to praise God, to worship him,

121
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,200
 to love him, to bring glory to him.

122
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,920
 And that's what it is.

123
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,320
 But this is what we do nowadays as well.

124
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,360
 We have songs like this, bless the Lord, oh my soul.

125
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,460
 And then we sing a lot of songs every Sunday.

126
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,500
 We do this every single week.

127
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,640
 We have praise songs.

128
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,460
 We praise God whenever we come into church.

129
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,160
 So praise is part of the routine,

130
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,080
 the activities that we do here.

131
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,440
 And we can just follow the screen.

132
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,620
 There are lyrics right now, and we just follow,

133
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,040
 and we sing something.

134
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,460
 Sometimes you feel your heart is resonating,

135
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,080
 or your heart really, wow, it really makes my heart beat,

136
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,800
 you know, when I see those lyrics, when I'm singing those.

137
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,520
 Sometimes you're like, oh, okay, that's all right.

138
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:35,760
 But for Jewish worshipers, whenever they're worshiping,

139
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,720
 yes, this call to worship, this statement of worship,

140
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,720
 yes, it's important,

141
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,280
 but they always have the next part in their Psalm.

142
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,500
 And they always have a word,

143
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,560
 a transition word that sounds like,

144
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,120
 for, I bless the Lord, I love you, Lord,

145
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,480
 for, you have done certain things for me.

146
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,600
 They always put a reason.

147
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,920
 They always put a testimony of their own story

148
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,760
 to that Psalm.

149
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,280
 They're always telling you, I'm here to praise God.

150
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,800
 I'm here to worship Him

151
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,960
 because something He has done for me in my life.

152
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,960
 In other words, praise, there's always a reason for it.

153
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:21,200
 And a joy in our lives, there is always a source for our joy.

154
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,260
 Let me say that again.

155
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,860
 There's always a reason for our praise,

156
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,200
 and there's always a source for our joy.

157
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,120
 That's what the Old Testament Psalms,

158
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,040
 and we see how people worship.

159
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,240
 That's what they're trying to do.

160
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,080
 They're saying, my praise is not empty.

161
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,360
 There's always a reason behind to back it up.

162
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,220
 That's my question for us today.

163
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,740
 I'm wondering when we walk through these doors,

164
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,440
 when we come and praise God,

165
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,980
 is there a reason behind our worship?

166
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:54,200
 We can put that slide for those words just now.

167
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,180
 Do we have a reason for our worship?

168
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,900
 When we walk in, do we feel, wow, yes,

169
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,600
 God, I'm praising you today because of this or that?

170
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,300
 Or sometimes, does it feels like

171
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,940
 we're just going through the motions?

172
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,020
 And I know sometimes we all do that.

173
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,300
 We all go through the motions.

174
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,340
 Maybe we're half awake, or maybe, you know,

175
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,980
 for me, it was Manchester United

176
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,060
 that suffered a huge defeat last night.

177
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,540
 When I come in on Sunday morning,

178
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,340
 oh yeah, bless the Lord, oh my soul.

179
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,180
 [audience laughs]

180
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,180
 [sighs]

181
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,020
 Like, oh my gosh.

182
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,860
 So sometimes that happens, but I want to reassure you

183
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:32,300
 that if sometimes you don't feel like saying those words,

184
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,460
 you don't feel you're totally connected with the lyrics,

185
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,560
 it's not a sin, I just want to tell you.

186
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,260
 But that also shows us that we're missing out on something.

187
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,840
 It's an omission.

188
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,460
 We're missing out on something

189
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,540
 because when these people, when the people of God

190
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,940
 in the Bible, when they're praising God,

191
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,820
 they said there's always a reason.

192
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,900
 I can always think of something

193
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,980
 that He has done for me in my life.

194
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,660
 And unless your God stopped working in your life,

195
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:01,060
 unless your God no longer exists in your life,

196
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,380
 otherwise, there should always be a reason.

197
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,420
 There should always be something

198
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,780
 that He's doing in your life that gives you,

199
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:13,660
 that brings you to praise, brings you to worship Him.

200
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:17,280
 And so here, when we look at the song of Mary,

201
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,500
 the Magnificat, we can see that this song,

202
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,220
 she starts with, you know, my soul glorifies the Lord,

203
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,340
 I bless Him, I praise Him,

204
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,680
 and for He has done great things for me.

205
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,400
 But she didn't just stop there.

206
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,660
 She didn't just stop with her own personal story,

207
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,160
 what God has done for me.

208
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,600
 She goes on and on and on to talk about

209
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,940
 the character of God.

210
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,260
 And throughout this song, you would see God is mighty,

211
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:45,660
 He's powerful, but He's also merciful.

212
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,220
 He said He will have mercy on those who fear Him,

213
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,860
 like He draws near to us, that He will be good to us.

214
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,020
 He knows what we're going through

215
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,180
 and He will not abandon us.

216
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,620
 So God is powerful, He is merciful.

217
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,780
 But then at the same time,

218
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,860
 she also shows us that we have a God who is just.

219
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,020
 In Him we find justice.

220
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:12,020
 And justice in the biblical world,

221
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,100
 it means God is gonna lift up the humble

222
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,280
 and He's gonna humble those who are proud.

223
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,860
 Something we explored in a previous sermon series

224
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,000
 and you can go back and listen to that again

225
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,660
 and that's our God, that's what He's doing.

226
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,980
 And so when we look at Mary's song,

227
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,420
 we see that she starts with calling us

228
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,100
 and calling herself to worship

229
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,420
 and then she moved on to giving a very reason

230
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,300
 why she's worshiping God right now,

231
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,340
 why she's praising with her own story

232
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,580
 what God has done for her.

233
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:46,580
 And she talks about what God has done for all her people,

234
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,740
 how that shows God's character.

235
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,880
 And we see that there's a great reversal

236
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,940
 that we have seen, what we talked about.

237
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,900
 He will bring down those rulers from their thrones,

238
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,620
 He will lift up the humble.

239
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,060
 And we see that's what God's gonna do.

240
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:07,060
 For Mary, that's something she experienced very personally

241
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,260
 because she knows she was a nobody.

242
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,380
 She's from a nobody town called Nazareth

243
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,300
 and she's a nobody there.

244
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,820
 If God choose to come into this world as a baby,

245
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,340
 probably He should have choose someone more prominent.

246
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:24,580
 Someone more like her relative Elizabeth.

247
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,900
 Or maybe when she was a bit younger

248
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,360
 'cause Elizabeth is a bit old now.

249
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,540
 But somebody who looks perfect, who has a perfect record,

250
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,240
 who comes from a great family,

251
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,040
 maybe those people should be the ones

252
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,340
 who carry this baby Jesus or the Messiah.

253
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:41,700
 But Mary knew, wow, God is gonna come here

254
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,900
 and turn everything upside down.

255
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,500
 And it's not just for Mary, it's not just for herself,

256
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,180
 that's for the entire world because the kingdom of God

257
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:53,280
 that this baby inside of her womb, Jesus,

258
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,700
 He came to establish is an upside down kingdom.

259
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,320
 Is to reverse the world order,

260
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,060
 is to turn things upside down.

261
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:04,100
 And that's what Mary was trying to communicate to us

262
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:04,920
 in this song.

263
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,020
 It's beautiful, it's biblical.

264
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,620
 Like we read about that,

265
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,740
 Jesus talk about this kind of stuff.

266
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,400
 But today I wanna draw your attention

267
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,260
 to one particular line of this song.

268
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,300
 Mary says this from now on,

269
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,060
 "All generations will call me blessed."

270
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:24,380
 I know we're here sitting in 2024.

271
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:28,140
 We look back this story in the Bible from 2000 years ago,

272
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,660
 I'm like, yeah, of course, Mary, of course you're blessed.

273
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,700
 Come on, you're the mother of Jesus.

274
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,860
 And in some areas, there are people who would even like,

275
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,500
 say prayers to you.

276
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:44,000
 And you're in a place where everybody celebrates you

277
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,020
 at least every Christmas we talk about you.

278
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:51,780
 I remember as a young kid when I was in my church,

279
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,720
 I was a four or five year old kid.

280
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,900
 They made us do a Christmas play

281
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,580
 and I think I was Joseph

282
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,980
 and I learned about Joseph and Mary there

283
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,180
 and I was like four or five.

284
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,580
 Even young kids know about her.

285
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,540
 Of course you are blessed, what are you talking about?

286
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,220
 Of course that's true.

287
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:14,220
 If we look at that story from a 2024 perspective.

288
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,440
 But today I wanna bring us back to the first century.

289
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,300
 I wanna bring us back to the time and space

290
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,340
 where this story actually happened.

291
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:26,080
 You know that this story happened about 2,000 years ago

292
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,440
 in Middle East in an area called Judea.

293
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,160
 So Jewish people, they have their own customs,

294
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,660
 they have their own laws,

295
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,700
 they have their own religious laws.

296
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,280
 When Mary, when the angel one day show up to her

297
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,260
 and say, hey, you know what, Mary,

298
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:45,540
 you're gonna get pregnant because God loves you.

299
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,680
 You're gonna get pregnant.

300
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,340
 Yes, I know you're not married yet,

301
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,620
 but don't worry, you're gonna get pregnant.

302
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,620
 What?

303
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,860
 Don't worry, you're gonna get pregnant, okay?

304
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,300
 Because God loves you, he favors you,

305
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,540
 you're gonna get pregnant.

306
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:04,060
 If I were Mary, honestly I would freak out.

307
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,740
 I'm like, what are you talking about?

308
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,660
 Like, oh no!

309
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:12,500
 Because like some parts of the world,

310
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,860
 maybe in a city among the more Chinese culture

311
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:20,860
 is still true, if you're unmarried and you're pregnant,

312
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,840
 it's actually a big deal.

313
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:29,220
 In the Jewish culture, any unmarried pregnancy,

314
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,260
 it's considered a sin.

315
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,220
 In the Jewish law, it's actually punishable by death.

316
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,300
 Of course, during that time,

317
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,980
 nobody really does that anymore,

318
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,780
 but it's still a big sin.

319
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:44,460
 So you get rejected by your husband or your fiance,

320
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,460
 you get rejected by your own family, your own father,

321
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,340
 and those synagogue leaders, those Pharisees,

322
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,300
 they will brand you as a sinner.

323
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,700
 Sounds familiar, we talked about that a couple weeks ago.

324
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,940
 You will become a sinner,

325
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,700
 you will become an outcast of the society from now on.

326
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,780
 Nobody want to do business with you,

327
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,060
 nobody want to talk to you,

328
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,820
 nobody want to stay near you.

329
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,820
 People, when they see you, oh, okay, hi, I'm sorry.

330
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,640
 They will just run away from you.

331
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,160
 Nobody would want to be with you anymore.

332
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,540
 That's what we're talking about here.

333
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,740
 If you said, you know, mission impossible,

334
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,780
 you say yes to this mission,

335
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,780
 if you say yes to it,

336
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:26,180
 you're gonna be an outcast for the rest of your life.

337
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,620
 Nobody is gonna have,

338
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,460
 won't have anything to do with you.

339
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:34,460
 That was what Mary facing during that time.

340
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,500
 And so when this angel showed up,

341
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,980
 when the angel broke the news to her,

342
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,700
 when she said, I'm the Lord's servant,

343
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:48,260
 there is a prize there, there's a huge prize indeed.

344
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,100
 And today I want to continue to read with us

345
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,420
 a few verses before that song.

346
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:58,100
 I'm gonna read from Luke chapter one, verse 39.

347
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:03,100
 It says, so 38, that's the end of the angel,

348
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,060
 Gabriel bringing that message to her.

349
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,020
 Verse 39 says this, at that time Mary got ready

350
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:12,380
 and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea

351
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:16,620
 where she entered Zechariah's home and greeted Elizabeth.

352
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,300
 So Mary, she lives in Nazareth in Galilee

353
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,620
 and she's going to this place, a hill country of Judea.

354
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:29,620
 That's about 80 to 110 kilometers, give or take.

355
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,740
 If you start your journey here from Yuen Long

356
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,340
 and walk for 110 kilometers,

357
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:38,100
 you probably, one of the possible places

358
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,420
 you will end up in, it's Guangzhou.

359
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:44,060
 Of course now, as Hong Kongers,

360
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,740
 we take the high speed rail,

361
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,140
 you'll be there in less than an hour.

362
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,740
 But we're talking about 2,000 years ago.

363
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:54,340
 We're talking about this rural area

364
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:57,420
 so she would have to walk all the way there

365
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,580
 and she could only take this journey by herself.

366
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:05,140
 And we're seeing that she's actually not in a good mood

367
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,020
 to do a road trip.

368
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,780
 We think, oh yeah, there's a relative,

369
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,740
 let's go and visit her.

370
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,300
 That's what we do sometimes, right?

371
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,580
 Okay, I'm going back home to see my family.

372
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,540
 See you in a few weeks, bye, that's Christmas,

373
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,740
 that's what everybody does.

374
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,220
 That's not what Mary is doing.

375
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:21,380
 She's not doing a road trip to see her friends

376
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,260
 or relatives or family.

377
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,820
 It's not a pleasant trip for her.

378
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:28,100
 Maybe, in fact, while she was traveling,

379
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,180
 she's asking herself a lot of questions.

380
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:33,020
 She got a lot of things going on in her mind.

381
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,580
 Things like, what am I gonna say to my family

382
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,620
 when they find out eventually?

383
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,220
 What should I tell Joseph?

384
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,340
 Will he even believe me?

385
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,780
 Will he even try to listen to me if I tell him,

386
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:50,580
 I got a baby and that baby is from the Holy Spirit?

387
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,980
 Will he even listen to me?

388
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:57,100
 You see, when Mary was on her way to see Elizabeth,

389
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:01,460
 she probably might be filled with confusion and questions

390
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:05,260
 and different emotions all mixed up inside of her.

391
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,980
 That shocking news from the angel

392
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:10,540
 would probably have disoriented her life

393
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:13,620
 or even turned her life upside down.

394
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:18,340
 As a teenager, she had to face a challenge

395
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,900
 that she would have never imagined before.

396
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,620
 As I was reading this story,

397
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,060
 I was actually wondering in my head,

398
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:30,620
 did Mary take this trip before or after

399
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:35,260
 the angel Gabriel appeared to Joseph in Matthew 1?

400
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,980
 If you know the story in Matthew 1,

401
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:41,660
 the angel actually appeared to Joseph

402
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,420
 to tell him the same message

403
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:47,660
 because before the angel visited Joseph,

404
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,420
 he was actually thinking about divorcing Mary.

405
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,020
 Saying, sorry, this is over.

406
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,660
 I don't know what you're talking about.

407
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,740
 I don't understand.

408
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,380
 You mean you're pregnant?

409
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,020
 We're not married.

410
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,260
 How can this happen?

411
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,780
 You must be with another man.

412
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,620
 Sorry, Mary, I like you.

413
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,260
 You're cute.

414
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,340
 You're great.

415
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,020
 And you're beautiful.

416
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,100
 But you're pregnant.

417
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,380
 So I'm sorry, this is the end.

418
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,900
 And the Bible says he wants to do it quietly.

419
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,500
 He wants to say goodbye, that's it.

420
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,260
 Let's break up last Christmas.

421
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,940
 I gave you my heart, but that's it, all right?

422
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:30,020
 So my guess is, my guess,

423
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,020
 the Bible didn't say this timeline,

424
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,500
 but my guess is that this trip

425
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,580
 was even before Joseph found out.

426
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,900
 Because number one, there's no ultrasound in those days.

427
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:43,060
 And number two, for a girl even to find herself pregnant,

428
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,420
 to confirm her pregnancy,

429
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,900
 I have two kids, so I know.

430
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,700
 All right, it takes at least like a month

431
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:53,220
 or a few more weeks when your period stopped

432
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,900
 and you start to wonder and you check.

433
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,420
 I don't know how they do it before like all these.

434
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,580
 Yeah, anyway, I don't know about technology

435
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,660
 in first century, but it would at least take a few weeks

436
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,700
 or at least a few months for her to find out.

437
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,980
 But she took this trip immediately to visit Elizabeth.

438
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,020
 So perhaps she hasn't even thought

439
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,100
 about how to talk to Joseph yet.

440
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,020
 She's just, you know, who's just raising herself her heart,

441
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,740
 like what am I gonna do, what am I gonna say,

442
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,020
 what am I gonna tell him?

443
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:24,700
 So this is where Mary was.

444
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,500
 Maybe she hasn't even thought about how to talk to him.

445
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,140
 Maybe, you know, maybe, maybe, maybe.

446
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,220
 And yeah, of course, if you read the Bible

447
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,180
 in the Old Testament, there's a prophecy

448
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,660
 in one of the prophets, Isaiah,

449
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:41,340
 it says there will be a virgin giving birth to a kid.

450
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,740
 If you take, if Mary take this prophecy

451
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,540
 to Joseph, to his family, I have imagined that,

452
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:52,540
 you know, as a father myself, I do believe in God's power

453
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:59,180
 that could be a virgin giving birth to a child,

454
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,660
 but that will not be my daughter.

455
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,460
 As a brother myself, I could totally believe

456
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,700
 that by God's power, there could be a virgin

457
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,900
 giving birth to a child, just not my sister.

458
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:14,220
 As someone's ex-fiance, 'cause I'm a husband,

459
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,620
 as an ex-fiance, I could believe

460
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,340
 that God could miraculously make a virgin,

461
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:24,340
 you know, give birth to a baby, but just not my fiance.

462
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,700
 You get what I mean?

463
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,980
 Yeah, there could be a miracle,

464
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,180
 but that miracle wouldn't be in my home.

465
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:35,260
 This is what Mary was facing, the rejection, the scandal,

466
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,660
 the way people look at her,

467
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,420
 the way people are rejecting her,

468
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,540
 don't wanna have anything to do with her.

469
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,020
 That's what Mary was facing.

470
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,460
 Being an unmarried, pregnant teenager

471
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,260
 in the first century Jewish society

472
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:53,220
 could be the worst nightmare.

473
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:57,740
 It brings shame to her, it brings shame to her family.

474
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:00,780
 She'll be rejected by Joseph, by her father,

475
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,820
 by her synagogue community, and for the rest of her life,

476
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:06,820
 she's gonna be branded as a sinner.

477
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,980
 And because in the first century Jewish community,

478
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:13,580
 you know what women, their social status,

479
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,180
 their economic status is totally dependent

480
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:19,340
 on her family or her husband.

481
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,740
 And so if she's unmarried, she's pregnant,

482
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:25,820
 she didn't just mess up her social life or her self-esteem.

483
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,860
 We're talking about her livelihood,

484
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,660
 we're talking about every possible area

485
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:34,020
 in her life will be affected.

486
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,260
 So if there's a simple way to describe

487
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,780
 the situation Mary was in,

488
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:41,940
 she was simply in a crisis with her unmarried pregnancy.

489
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:46,940
 And not only that, later because of this child of hers,

490
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,980
 after this child was born,

491
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,580
 you know, she was rejected by other people as well

492
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,780
 when she was, because of this pregnancy,

493
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,220
 when she was in Bethlehem,

494
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:59,260
 when she was supposed to follow her fiance to his hometown,

495
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,660
 they were rejected.

496
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,300
 They couldn't even find a place to stay

497
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:06,420
 and they had to give birth in an animal shelter.

498
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,420
 And after this child was born,

499
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,940
 because this child was being hunted down,

500
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:14,620
 they end up, this family end up as refugees

501
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:17,860
 in a country they had never lived in.

502
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,780
 They become refugees.

503
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:23,540
 And not only that, when this kid finally, you know,

504
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:28,180
 grew up, she had to watch him being tortured to death,

505
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,180
 horrible death.

506
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:33,260
 She had to watch it with her own eyes.

507
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:38,180
 And if we add all these things up and you tell me,

508
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,900
 from now on, all generations will call me blessed,

509
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:45,900
 I think that doesn't quite add up to the math.

510
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,700
 If you're telling me that's how God

511
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,500
 is going to bless me or bless you,

512
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,020
 I don't know about you.

513
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,860
 Probably I'll say pass.

514
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,900
 I don't want to be blessed like that.

515
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,340
 I don't want to be blessed in a way

516
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,420
 that I'll have to go through pain,

517
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,180
 I have to go through suffering,

518
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,700
 I have to see a loved one die,

519
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,820
 I have to be rejected many, many times.

520
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:11,300
 I don't even know if that's blessing.

521
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,660
 How about you?

522
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,980
 What do you see as blessings of God in your life?

523
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,100
 Is it possible in this scenario,

524
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,780
 if we look at it and we think about our lives,

525
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:30,380
 would there be any scenario that God is actually blessing us

526
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:33,220
 but we simply miss it because we thought,

527
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:37,020
 no way, God cannot bless someone like that.

528
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:42,620
 Would we be passing God's blessings without knowing

529
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:45,380
 and said, sorry, I don't want this, I don't want this,

530
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:50,100
 but in fact, it's God's blessing in our life.

531
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:53,420
 But what changed?

532
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,940
 Like if she's going through so much suffering,

533
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:59,700
 if she's going through so much trauma or so much stress

534
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,060
 while she was on her way to see Elizabeth,

535
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:05,820
 what has changed in that house?

536
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,940
 That Mary suddenly said, you know what,

537
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,580
 from now on, all generations are gonna call me blessed.

538
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,580
 So why don't we find out what happened

539
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:16,940
 in that house of Zachariah and Elizabeth?

540
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,500
 I'm gonna read from verse 41.

541
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,780
 When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting,

542
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:24,740
 the baby, John the Baptist inside her womb leaped

543
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:27,540
 and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.

544
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,500
 In a loud voice, she exclaimed,

545
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,100
 blessed are you among women,

546
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,420
 blessed is the child you will bear.

547
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,580
 But why am I so favored

548
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:39,740
 that the mother of my Lord should come to me?

549
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,820
 As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears,

550
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:46,260
 the baby in my womb leaped for joy.

551
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,700
 Blessed is she who has believed

552
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,940
 that the Lord would fulfill his promises to her.

553
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:54,540
 It's beautiful here, it says,

554
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:58,780
 Elizabeth, she was filled with the Holy Spirit

555
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:01,580
 and being inspired by the Holy Spirit,

556
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:06,460
 she recognized who the baby in the womb was.

557
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,580
 It's interesting because the Holy Spirit

558
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:11,420
 has always been the one that points us to Jesus.

559
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,260
 The Holy Spirit has always been the one

560
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,060
 that reveals Jesus to us.

561
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:18,980
 This is the first person being filled

562
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:22,460
 with the Holy Spirit in the New Testament

563
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:26,220
 and her first reaction, she recognized Jesus.

564
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,660
 Oh, that's Jesus.

565
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,460
 Oh, that's the Messiah.

566
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,020
 That's the mother of the Messiah,

567
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,060
 the mother of my Lord coming to me.

568
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,780
 She recognized.

569
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:39,580
 And because she knew who the baby was,

570
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:43,180
 so she said those words, blessed are you among women.

571
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:46,660
 In today's terms, you are like not greatest of all time,

572
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,860
 you're the most blessed of all time.

573
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,660
 So if you can come up with a meme like that,

574
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:53,620
 that's Mary and she's the most blessed of all time.

575
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,620
 She's the most blessed woman of all time.

576
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,940
 That's what she meant.

577
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,580
 And what?

578
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,860
 All right, memes, right?

579
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:02,260
 Okay, and said, oh yeah, this will be my Lord.

580
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:06,540
 And so Mary, Mary, we have to look at Mary.

581
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,780
 She has experienced this blessing,

582
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,980
 but there are actually, according to the words of Elizabeth,

583
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:14,740
 this blessings, there are two parts.

584
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,580
 So the first part, of course, is that baby,

585
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,260
 is the work of the Holy Spirit.

586
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:22,140
 The Holy Spirit came and she become pregnant

587
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,260
 and that's her blessing

588
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,580
 because of the baby inside of her womb.

589
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,980
 That's why she's blessed.

590
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:29,740
 But you know that part, she doesn't have to do a thing.

591
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,860
 She just sit there, do nothing and I'm pregnant.

592
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:33,940
 She doesn't have to do anything.

593
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:37,700
 She's completely passive in this part of the blessing.

594
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:42,620
 But then Elizabeth also talk about an active part

595
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,420
 in this blessing.

596
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:47,420
 She said, blessed is the one who believed

597
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,700
 that the Lord will fulfill his promises to her.

598
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,980
 In other words, when the angel came,

599
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,420
 Mary, she believed.

600
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,620
 She believed the promises of God,

601
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,340
 no matter how difficult it seems,

602
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,380
 no matter how crazy it sounds,

603
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:04,660
 she believed that God is gonna do something.

604
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,940
 And that belief, that trust, that faith

605
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:11,540
 becomes a blessing in her life.

606
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,940
 And so those who continue to believe,

607
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,260
 who continue to trust,

608
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,460
 who continue to hold on to God's promises,

609
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:22,220
 just like Mary, they will be blessed.

610
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:25,580
 But this is very important here.

611
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:32,060
 When Elizabeth declared these words over her,

612
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,540
 she was filled with the Holy Spirit.

613
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,820
 I don't know if you've ever been in a room

614
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:39,140
 or in a situation where someone was filled

615
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:42,420
 with the Holy Spirit and they start just praying for you.

616
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,420
 They're just speaking over your life.

617
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,980
 They start prophesying over you.

618
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,340
 I've had that in a Zoom call before.

619
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,340
 I've had that like face to face before.

620
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:54,180
 I've had that in many different scenarios before.

621
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,460
 You know, what I learned is that when someone

622
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,820
 is filled with the Holy Spirit

623
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,140
 and they're speaking life over me

624
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,940
 or speaking God's words over me,

625
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,500
 the only thing I felt was,

626
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,220
 wow, I have a direct encounter with God.

627
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:12,980
 I think Mary, when she left Nazareth,

628
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,500
 she was totally puzzled.

629
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,300
 She was totally confused.

630
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,620
 But when she arrived in that house,

631
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:21,180
 when Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit

632
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,420
 and started prophesying over her,

633
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:26,060
 I think she had an encounter with God

634
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,260
 and things start to change.

635
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,460
 The confusion was gone.

636
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:34,500
 And she was like, now I know my soul glorifies the Lord

637
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:39,180
 and now generations will call me blessed.

638
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:43,500
 Whatever is gonna happen to me, I know I'm blessed.

639
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,180
 A visitation of the Holy Spirit, a word,

640
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:50,900
 a ministry from the Holy Spirit changed the entire scenario.

641
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:55,980
 And I'm wondering if, you know,

642
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,740
 we need that in our lives.

643
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,100
 We need the Holy Spirit to speak to us

644
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:04,460
 either directly or through someone, speak over us

645
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,700
 so that something inside of our lives,

646
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,700
 maybe some strongholds, maybe some previous hurts,

647
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:14,460
 maybe something's stuck inside us could be changed.

648
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:18,900
 Some of us, some of you here have heard of my story

649
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,860
 or more correctly, my mother's story.

650
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:24,940
 She found out she had cancer

651
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,500
 not long after she gave birth to me.

652
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,500
 So I was still very young.

653
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,340
 And some of you knew that she passed away

654
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,140
 eventually because of cancer.

655
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:38,340
 But what I didn't share with you all was that

656
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:41,220
 my mother actually passed on my third birthday.

657
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:46,140
 I remember as a kid on Tomb Sweeping Festival

658
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:49,220
 or those double nines like Chinese festival

659
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,740
 will go tomb sweeping.

660
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:55,180
 I remember arriving at my mom's gravestone

661
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,460
 and looking at a date.

662
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,460
 That date was supposed to be my birthday.

663
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,660
 It's supposed to be a date for celebration.

664
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:04,500
 But then that date has ever since been turned

665
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,180
 into a date for mourning.

666
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:10,660
 In fact, when I was young,

667
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,060
 my family never celebrated my birthday with me

668
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,140
 on the actual date.

669
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:19,060
 Well, my birthday was right after a major holiday.

670
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,180
 So we always just, you know, do it by the way

671
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:24,060
 and let's just celebrate, have a party during the holiday.

672
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:27,780
 But we never do it on my actual birthday.

673
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:30,020
 Ever since I was young, I thought when I look at that day,

674
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,540
 I always approach that day with mourning,

675
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:35,460
 with sadness, with, oh, this is a bad day.

676
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,940
 I don't like this date.

677
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,820
 Like, this is so bad.

678
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,620
 Like, 'cause my mom left the world

679
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,260
 and she lost her life on this date.

680
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:47,620
 Fast forward, I remember on my 18th birthday,

681
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:50,660
 I was just praying and worshiping at home.

682
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:54,140
 I was just, you know, singing songs to praise God

683
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,740
 and I was praying and somehow,

684
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:58,980
 I don't know why I thought about this part, my mom.

685
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:02,460
 And the Holy Spirit just came into my bedroom

686
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,660
 and he started speaking to me.

687
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:06,300
 He said, "Chapman, you know what?

688
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,780
 "15 years ago this date,

689
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:12,380
 "yes, it was the day that your mom passed away.

690
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,580
 "But that was actually the day

691
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,940
 "that she finished running her good race.

692
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,500
 "It was the day she finished fighting the good fight.

693
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,700
 "It was the day that she has kept her faith

694
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:24,580
 "and now she would receive the crown of life."

695
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:29,580
 And the entire heaven was cheering for her.

696
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:34,060
 That's what happened 15 years ago.

697
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:36,180
 And if there's something you need to react to,

698
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:39,940
 if there's a proper reaction, that will be celebration.

699
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:43,980
 And the Spirit just came upon me

700
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,620
 and I remember for the first time,

701
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:49,060
 I started celebrating that.

702
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,140
 Not just my birthday, not just my birth,

703
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:54,940
 but I started celebrating the end of my mother's life

704
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,620
 on my birthday.

705
00:32:56,620 --> 00:33:00,180
 Because I know what her life actually meant,

706
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,580
 not just to me or my family,

707
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:04,940
 but to all those people she helped during her time.

708
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,860
 I know she fought this good fight,

709
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,300
 so it's a time worth celebrating

710
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,940
 because that's the day she said,

711
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,420
 it's kind of like Olympics,

712
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:15,140
 she got on stage and somebody gave her a medal,

713
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,060
 that's the exact moment.

714
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,500
 If there's something I should do,

715
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,860
 I should be standing there giving her a round of applause.

716
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:26,900
 And that day, the Holy Spirit just came and spoke to me

717
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,940
 and changed my heart.

718
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:35,060
 And ever since, for the next almost 20 years now,

719
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:38,660
 yeah, I do celebrate that.

720
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,940
 I do celebrate my birthday,

721
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:44,260
 but I celebrate the day my mom,

722
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,140
 we say graduated from this life

723
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:49,820
 or she finished her mission here

724
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,380
 and she entered into eternity.

725
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,540
 That's beautiful.

726
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:58,580
 (audience applauding)

727
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,820
 Thank you.

728
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:06,220
 As I was preparing the message for today,

729
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:10,740
 I felt that's what the Holy Spirit wants to do with us today.

730
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:14,140
 Perhaps some of us,

731
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:17,100
 we are struggling with certain things in our lives,

732
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:21,300
 perhaps there are wounds He wants to heal,

733
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,700
 there are strongholds He wants to take down

734
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,940
 and there are things He wants to speak to us directly

735
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,460
 or maybe through somebody else,

736
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,580
 He wants to speak life into us.

737
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:37,980
 I do wanna give us room and space and time

738
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:42,260
 just to be in the presence of God,

739
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,060
 in the presence of the Holy Spirit.

740
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:50,020
 When Mary left Nazareth, I think she was quite puzzled,

741
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:53,340
 I think she was quite nervous,

742
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,740
 but that encounter with God in Zechariah,

743
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:58,980
 in Elizabeth's house, I think it changed her.

744
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:03,420
 I think one encounter with God can do a lot in our lives

745
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:06,980
 and I believe that's what God wants to do this morning here

746
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,500
 or this afternoon here with us.

747
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,420
 This is what we're gonna do,

748
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:13,300
 we're just gonna, you can sit, you can stand,

749
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:17,540
 we're just gonna worship God for a bit

750
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:21,140
 and then later I'll give us some instructions

751
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,620
 on how we're going to pray.

752
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,460
 So if you wanna stand, you can stand,

753
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,340
 if you wanna sit, you can sit,

754
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:30,300
 but we're just going to worship right now.

755
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,700
 (soft music)

756
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:59,500
 Holy Spirit, we invite you.

757
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,500
 We welcome you.

758
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:11,100
 We open our hearts to you today, Lord.

759
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:15,220
 Whether we're like Mary,

760
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,860
 perhaps there are things in our lives

761
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,380
 that you wanna come and bless us,

762
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,420
 you wanna come and speak to us,

763
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:24,260
 you wanna come and release a word of life over us.

764
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:29,020
 Perhaps today here, some of us will be like

765
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,260
 Elizabeth, you are going to fill us with your spirit

766
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,140
 and you're going to speak through us.

767
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,140
 We're going to be your mouthpiece today.

768
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:40,340
 Holy Spirit, I just welcome you.

769
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:43,540
 I just pray that you will come and fill us right now.
