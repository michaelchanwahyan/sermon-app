[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   Father, what a joy it is to gather together and declare some biblical truths about who
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:06.840]   you are.
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.740]   That you make a way where there doesn't seem to be a way.
[00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.540]   Where you are one who can step into the impossible and make it possible.
[00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.860]   Where when you say something, your word does not return to you void, but it achieves every
[00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.100]   purpose and promise for you.
[00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.260]   You're a promise keeper, Lord.
[00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.020]   And Father, as we gather together here at the start of Advent, a season that celebrates
[00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:35.460]   your arrival on Christmas Day, but also anticipates your coming again at the end of all things.
[00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.900]   Father, our hearts are turned towards you.
[00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.660]   And you are who you say that you are, Lord.
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.620]   And we know that so often we struggle.
[00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.100]   We know so often our lives change and things happen that we didn't anticipate or expect.
[00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.060]   Lord, we know that life is not always easy.
[00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.900]   And Lord, although things change and shift so much for us, you remain who you are.
[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.660]   You are the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.780]   You are the anchor by which we can put our trust and our faith in you.
[00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.020]   So Father, I want to pray for every person in this room who's watching online right now,
[00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.660]   anybody who's in the overflow.
[00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.500]   Father, I want to pray by the power of God, Lord, that you would step into their situation
[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.500]   in this moment.
[00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:29.740]   Lord, you don't always guarantee us an immediate change in our circumstances, but you do guarantee
[00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.820]   us your presence in the midst of what it is that we go through.
[00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.580]   And so Lord, I want to pray for each person here who maybe is in a moment or season where
[00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.300]   they need you to reveal yourself again.
[00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.540]   That way maker, that promise keeper, that miracle worker, the one who is the light in
[00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.580]   the darkness for them.
[00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:57.460]   And Father, I want to pray that you, who you are, would be made manifest to every single
[00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.460]   person.
[00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.700]   And Father, our ability to worship flows out of seeing who you are.
[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.760]   Your word says that we are able to love because you first loved us.
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:13.340]   It is that encounter of you, the unchanging, immutable, powerful Lord, that we then extend
[00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.860]   love, extend grace, extend hope, extend freedom.
[00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.460]   Lord, it flows from who you are.
[00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.300]   So Lord, I pray that you would reveal to us, even over the next four weeks, as we celebrate
[00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.980]   Advent and we look at the coming of Christ, you would reveal to us more and more about
[00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.260]   who you are, why you came, how you met us, the way the world has changed and shifted
[00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.940]   since you were born in that stable in Bethlehem some 2000 years ago.
[00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.340]   Father, that's the story we celebrate.
[00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.460]   No matter whether we've heard that story a thousand times before or whether that's a
[00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:53.380]   fresh new idea for us, Lord, I pray that your word would move in power over this church
[00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.100]   over the next four weeks.
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.580]   And Father, we celebrate that.
[00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:58.580]   We thank you for it.
[00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.180]   And we pray all of this in Jesus' name.
[00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.340]   Everyone says, "Hey, can we thank our youth here?
[00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.020]   Look at this!
[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.020]   Our youth!
[00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.820]   Oh my goodness, how cool.
[00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.740]   Next Gen Band, we call them.
[00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:17.740]   We've been working with them.
[00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.860]   Roberto Ginetto, I want to honor him.
[00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.500]   Roberto has been working with them on Saturday mornings to get their hearts and their skills
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.500]   prepared.
[00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.580]   And Emma and the team have been working with them over the last number of weeks as well.
[00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:34.580]   Can we give another round of applause to our youth and all that they've done?
[00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:35.580]   So great.
[00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.580]   Welcome to the Vine.
[00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.820]   If you're relatively new to the Vine, my name's Andrew.
[00:03:37.820 --> 00:04:00.020]   I'm one of the pastors here, and it's just so great to be with you.
[00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.740]   Things don't always work out how we plan them in life, do they?
[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:10.180]   I think if we're honest with ourselves, actually, so much of our lives is a little bit of a
[00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.500]   mess.
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.500]   And no matter how perfect we might try to make stuff appear, the reality is we can often
[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.540]   struggle, can't we, with keeping things perfect in our lives.
[00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:27.460]   That's so often if we're honest with ourselves, we would have to admit that we're pretty messy.
[00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.760]   And at times we can be pretty messed up.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.540]   And I think us humans have become really good at actually projecting a version of ourselves
[00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:42.620]   into the world that looks perfect to everybody around us to kind of mask or hide the reality
[00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.240]   that there's still some messiness and some messed upness in us.
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.740]   Or maybe I'm the only one who does that.
[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:49.740]   Anyone else here maybe do that?
[00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:50.740]   You don't have to put your hand up.
[00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.100]   Okay, put your hand up if you do that.
[00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:58.020]   Yes, I want to see those hands boldly proclaiming that we can do this, can't we, in life, that
[00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.380]   we know that there's some stuff in us that we're not proud of, that we don't love.
[00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.420]   And so we project into the world something because what we ultimately want to do is kind
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:14.700]   of distract people from seeing the true person that we are.
[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.820]   Magicians call this misdirection.
[00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.260]   In fact, if I am...
[00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.380]   Let me just show you this.
[00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.780]   If I was, for example, going to make this coin disappear, what I would do is I would
[00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.340]   show you this coin and I would tell you that this is a Hong Kong $5 coin, that it's a real
[00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.220]   coin, and then I would put it on my thing like this and I would do this, pretending
[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.260]   that I'm going to make it disappear, but then I'd accidentally drop it on the table and
[00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.940]   then I would put it back in my hand and I would start doing this again and then suddenly
[00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.780]   it would disappear.
[00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.660]   Wow.
[00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:47.660]   You're welcome.
[00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.580]   I'm here all week.
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:56.940]   What you may not realize though is that the coin is actually up here.
[00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.940]   There.
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.140]   Misdirection.
[00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:08.340]   Distracting people over here so they don't realize what's truly going on over here.
[00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.380]   Are you with me?
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.820]   Here's why I share all that with you.
[00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:18.860]   I think in the world's modern day celebration of Christmas, we have one of the most subversive
[00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.620]   misdirections that there has ever been created.
[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.740]   I don't know if you've realized this, but the world has secularized Christmas over the
[00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.940]   last number of years.
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.900]   What we have in the world is, "Hey, look at this thing over here that we now define and
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:38.420]   call Christmas," and it has nothing actually to do often with the reality of the true,
[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:39.420]   original Christmas.
[00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.460]   Are you with me?
[00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:46.160]   It's kind of like this sort of thing of like, "Hey, let's even try and get all of Jesus
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.980]   out of Christmas."
[00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.020]   Have you seen X-mas written around the place?
[00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:55.060]   Let's just get rid of Christ from Christmas because that story is just a little bit uncomfortable,
[00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:59.220]   and not everybody believes in Jesus, so we can't talk about Jesus at Christmas even though
[00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.380]   the holiday is actually about Jesus.
[00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:10.140]   We'll call it seasons greetings, happy holidays, and we'll try to make it look as benign and
[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:14.540]   as nice and really all of this about family and celebration, and we'll try to project
[00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:19.620]   this image of what Christmas should be to distract the world from the reality of what
[00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:24.500]   Christmas truly is, about somebody who was born into this life to give people great hope,
[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:29.740]   who on the cross died, gave up his life so that we may have grace and forgiveness, and
[00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.220]   we could know the fullness of life.
[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:36.820]   But we don't want anyone to know that story, so happy holidays to you all.
[00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.340]   Are you with me?
[00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:44.500]   Now even when Jesus is included in the Christmas story, in the modern day celebration of it,
[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.700]   it's normally a saccharine version of Jesus.
[00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:52.420]   It's normally the perfect Jesus that you have ever seen, or maybe the hallmark card that
[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:57.140]   you buy for someone to give to them on Christmas day presents the nativity scene in the most
[00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:59.060]   perfect and beautiful way you've ever noticed.
[00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.620]   Let me give you an example of it.
[00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.620]   I found this one online this week.
[00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:06.020]   Ah, isn't that just the perfect nativity scene?
[00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:08.340]   You've got the beautiful star in the background.
[00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:12.000]   It looks like a wonderful oasis that you might want to go to holiday for.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.720]   Look at that sheep, the perfect sheep ever.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.800]   The sheep just staring gazily into Jesus' eyes.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:23.640]   There's Jesus lying down in a halo of sunbeams, even though he's just been born.
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.400]   Are you with me, people?
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:31.120]   So we turn the Christmas story into this kind of perception that we're comfortable with,
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:36.440]   that we think makes us feel good, when the reality is that's as far away from the reality
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.680]   of that first Christmas as possible.
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.440]   And then we do this in movies, and we do this in stuff like whatever Christmas movie you're
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:47.360]   going to watch over the Christmas period, other than Die Hard, it presents a version
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.240]   of the Christmas family a lot like this one, right?
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.840]   Like the perfect Christmas family.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.840]   There they are.
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.320]   They can't get whiter than that.
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.080]   They're surrounding by the tree behind them.
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.560]   There's beautiful lights everywhere.
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.180]   I mean, it is a beautiful scene.
[00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.920]   This is Christmas.
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:09.360]   And that makes us all, here's the ironic thing, that makes us all want to have the perfect
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.200]   Christmas ourselves, don't we?
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.060]   Like we want Christmas to be perfect.
[00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:15.920]   We want it to look just like that.
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:19.240]   And so we decorate our homes, and we call our friends over, and we cook the food, and
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.320]   we make it perfect, and we want it to arrive on time.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:25.000]   And if it doesn't, we get really angry and upset, and it's super stressful to make everything
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.220]   super perfect.
[00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:29.660]   But we think we need a perfect Christmas because the world is telling us that Christmas has
[00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:33.180]   to be perfect.
[00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:39.880]   The funny thing is we even as Christians spiritualize the perfectness of Christmas.
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:46.960]   Oh, if I could just pull off the perfect Christmas for my family this year, Jesus, we'd be glorified.
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:51.400]   Like if the food is perfect, the turkey's nice and moist, if all the presents are brought
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:55.080]   and put under the tree at the right time, if my kids are happy with what I brought them,
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:10:00.880]   Jesus will be glorified in our midst.
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:07.540]   I wonder in our desire to try to create the perfect Christmas that we're actually in danger
[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:11.900]   of missing out on what Christmas truly is.
[00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:17.140]   Or to put it another way, is our striving for the perfect Christmas simply Christmas
[00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:20.640]   misdirection?
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.580]   Think about it for a moment.
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:29.160]   Because the first Christmas was an absolute mess.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.860]   Nothing went right with that first Christmas.
[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:35.420]   I mean, if you want a perfect Christmas, do not open the pages of the Gospels.
[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:40.200]   I mean, just stop for a moment and think about what you see in that first Christmas.
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:45.300]   Number one, a crisis teenage pregnancy, awkward.
[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:50.620]   Number two, an unexplained and unexpected road trip at the last minute.
[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.980]   An arrival and the accommodation is messed up.
[00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:58.640]   A not very ideal birthing environment for a child.
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:05.900]   And then to top it off, three weird old astrolobers from the East come over and visit you.
[00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:11.060]   And then just to add more to that, there's a genocide that happens in the very place
[00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:12.980]   where the child is born.
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:15.140]   That's a messed up Christmas.
[00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:19.060]   That should make you feel better about some of your messed up Christmases over the years.
[00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:22.500]   But that's the reality of the first Christmas.
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:27.660]   It's so messed up and so chaotic and the people involved in it are so confused about what's
[00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:32.140]   happening that they have no idea that they're getting swept up in this redemptive moment
[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:33.140]   of history.
[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:38.700]   The first Christmas is so messed up and it's just as God wanted it.
[00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:42.340]   It was quite literally Christmas.
[00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:43.340]   See what I did there?
[00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:44.340]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:49.400]   Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:56.060]   This Advent, we want to take you into the messiness of Christmas.
[00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:59.940]   Because it's actually in the messiness where the message of Christmas sits.
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:06.100]   And if you try to do some misdirection, try to ignore the reality that the first Christmas
[00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:10.980]   was a little bit messy, you actually kind of miss what the hope of the first Christmas
[00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:13.540]   is all about for you and for me.
[00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:17.180]   I mean, think about the incarnation for a start.
[00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:24.340]   God decides to send his perfect representation of himself, the perfect manifestation of himself
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:29.180]   in the incarnation of Jesus, fully God and fully human, born into that smelly, horrible,
[00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:34.300]   not like the Christmas card, that smelly, horrible, dark, damp cave that he was born
[00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:35.860]   into.
[00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:39.740]   And he was there in the messiness to tell us something.
[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:44.900]   That no matter how messy the world is, no matter how broken and chaotic this place can
[00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:50.380]   be, and you could probably think that the world today is just as messed up and chaotic
[00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:57.220]   and broken as it ever was, that Jesus is happy to be born in that place.
[00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:00.960]   That he's happy to be born in a place that isn't all right.
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:04.220]   That he's not interested in some misdirection.
[00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:10.060]   That he actually wants to meet you, yourself, in your personal brokenness, in your messiness.
[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:15.460]   The beauty of the incarnation is that Jesus did not come for a perfect world filled with
[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:16.460]   perfect people.
[00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:19.700]   If that was the case, he wouldn't have come at all.
[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:25.420]   He's come to an imperfect world filled with imperfect people because in meeting the imperfect
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:32.620]   people, he might bring us into the righteousness, not the perfection, the righteousness of Christ.
[00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.940]   So that we might know a saving relationship with him.
[00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:40.980]   And when he comes again, advent, when he comes again at the end of all things, we are presented
[00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:47.860]   to him holy and pure, presented to him without blemish as a bride before him because of the
[00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:50.380]   work he's done inside of us.
[00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:54.020]   That's why Christmas is messy.
[00:13:54.020 --> 00:14:00.180]   Because it says something to us about our messiness.
[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:04.620]   And so over advent, we're going to unpack the messy moments of Christmas together.
[00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:09.140]   Next week, we're going to look at that really messy time with Zachariah and the angel in
[00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:10.900]   the temple and his silence.
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:15.500]   And then the messiness of Mary having her pregnancy and everybody thinking that she
[00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:17.900]   had sex before marriage.
[00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:21.940]   The week after that, we're going to look at the family, Mary and Joseph arriving in Bethlehem
[00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:24.460]   and nobody in their family welcoming them in.
[00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:29.980]   Not because as the carols sometimes tell us, that the whole place was filled, but because
[00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:36.260]   nobody in their family wanted anything to do with a pregnant, unmarried teenager.
[00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.460]   And then the week after that, we're going to look at Jesus when he's just eight days
[00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:44.780]   old in the temple and the prophets turn up and speak to him and say some pretty messy
[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:47.540]   stuff to Mary and to Jesus.
[00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:51.500]   Stuff that would come to define the things that would happen in their lives in the years
[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:52.500]   ahead.
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:15:00.980]   And in this, our hope for you and for us is that we would strip the misdirection of Christmas
[00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:08.020]   from us so that we would see Christmas as it was truly meant to be seen.
[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:13.900]   It might surprise you, but the gospel writers were intent in stripping the misdirection
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.540]   out of the story of the life of Jesus.
[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:21.620]   In fact, Matthew and Luke, who are the ones that tell us the birth story of Jesus, they
[00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:25.740]   do everything in that birth story to try to communicate to you that this was not a perfect
[00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:26.740]   time.
[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:31.900]   That this was not just as everybody else thought it should be, although it was exactly as God
[00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:33.580]   had planned it to be.
[00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:38.860]   And I think no more powerfully do they show us this than in what both of them do in presenting
[00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:41.860]   to us the genealogy of Jesus.
[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:45.980]   Genealogy is a fancy word to talk about the bloodline, the family before him that came
[00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:49.180]   to make who Jesus is and was.
[00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:53.060]   Now that genealogy is presented to us in both Matthew and in Luke.
[00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:54.900]   Matthew chapter one, Luke chapter three.
[00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:58.060]   I'm not going to read you in detail those genealogies today.
[00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.580]   You can do that during the week.
[00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:01.060]   I encourage you to do that.
[00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:06.860]   What I want to do today is tell you the stories about the people who are in the genealogies.
[00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:11.640]   Because I think in understanding their story, you might understand Jesus' story better,
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:15.720]   and therefore you might understand your story better.
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:19.300]   You see some incredible people in the genealogies in Matthew and Luke.
[00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:24.940]   You see people like Abraham, the father of the faith, the one who began Israel itself,
[00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:29.900]   the one who was faithful to God and did so many things as an act of love and grace to
[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.060]   him.
[00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:32.980]   You see characters like Isaac.
[00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:35.580]   Isaac, who was incredibly obedient.
[00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:38.620]   In fact, one of the best examples we have in scripture of somebody who's obedient to
[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:40.940]   God's call on their life.
[00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:45.680]   We see the prophets like there's Hezekiah and Amos in the genealogies.
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:50.100]   Great prophets who held God's word and had the courage and the boldness to speak that
[00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:51.100]   word into the world.
[00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:53.280]   And it was a beautiful thing.
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:56.700]   We see great moral leaders in those genealogies.
[00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:03.680]   People like Boaz and Jesse, people like Elam, ones who walked out this idea of what it meant
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:07.080]   to live for God, the kingdom of God in the world today.
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:09.140]   And of course you see kings.
[00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:10.600]   You see kings in the genealogy.
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:16.340]   David, his son Solomon, Rehoboam, all kings that led Israel at different periods of time.
[00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:21.380]   And when you see the genealogy like that, you can begin to understand why Matthew and
[00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:25.060]   Luke include such amazing figures in their genealogy.
[00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:30.760]   See genealogies in the first century were designed to tell you something about the individual.
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:34.040]   If you wanted to say to someone, "Hey, this individual is worth your time," you would
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:36.260]   tell them the family that they've come from.
[00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.460]   We don't do this in Hong Kong society at all, do we?
[00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:40.460]   Oh, okay.
[00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:41.460]   Sorry.
[00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:42.460]   Too close.
[00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:43.460]   All right.
[00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:44.460]   So, but you know what I'm saying?
[00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:48.380]   Like who you've come from, the people who've gone before you say something about who you
[00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:49.380]   are.
[00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:53.340]   And so when Matthew and Luke are trying to present Jesus as the Messiah, they're trying
[00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:58.260]   to fill the genealogy with people that speak of the glory and the goodness of this person.
[00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:03.100]   Matthew, who's writing predominantly to a Jewish audience, starts from the place of
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:07.340]   Abraham, which makes sense because he's trying to convince Jewish people that Jesus is their
[00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:08.860]   long-awaited Messiah.
[00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:14.020]   Luke, though, Luke's writing to a Gentile audience, mostly a Gentile audience.
[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:15.420]   So he doesn't start with Abraham.
[00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:17.040]   He goes all the way back to Adam.
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.040]   Why does he go back to Adam?
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:24.060]   Because Adam is the father of all people, regardless of background or race or culture.
[00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:29.260]   And so Luke takes us all the way back there to say this Jesus is for everybody.
[00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:32.780]   But in their presentations, they're basically saying, "Here's Abraham.
[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:33.780]   Here's the kings.
[00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:34.900]   Here's the miracle workers.
[00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:35.900]   Here's the prophets.
[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.460]   Here's all these people that make Jesus."
[00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:40.740]   And we do the same, don't we?
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:46.340]   When we tell people stories about our families, we tell them the good stuff, right?
[00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:50.140]   We tell them, I've already received a number of Christmas cards so far this year.
[00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:51.540]   I love getting Christmas cards.
[00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:55.300]   Christmas cards tell you all the great stuff that's happening with families.
[00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.300]   Here's all the things that have happened.
[00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:57.420]   And we do this, don't we?
[00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:00.220]   We talk to people like this, like, "Hey, let me tell you about little Bobby and what
[00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:03.140]   he got in his latest test."
[00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:07.420]   If little Bobby didn't do good in the latest test, you don't talk about that, right?
[00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:11.500]   Or whatever it might be, whatever achievement and stuff, we don't talk about the messy stuff,
[00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:12.500]   do we?
[00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:15.100]   We don't present the failures or anything like that.
[00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:19.460]   We don't tell people, "Oh, let me tell you about Uncle Bob who's in jail."
[00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:22.380]   Let me tell you about Ted who cheated on his wife.
[00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:23.380]   He's part of my family.
[00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:26.500]   Oh, a little awkward, but let's talk about that one.
[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:29.060]   You come over to my house and you'll see photos in my house.
[00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.820]   Those photos are from good times that my family has.
[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:36.340]   I don't splash the photos of the arguments and the breakdowns and the discussions and
[00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:38.540]   the things that Chris and I disagree on.
[00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:40.860]   I don't present that sort of stuff to the world.
[00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:45.940]   We love to present to the world who we think the world should think us to be.
[00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:50.580]   And you would think that Matthew and Luke, in presenting Jesus as the Messiah, would
[00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:52.060]   do exactly the same thing.
[00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:53.820]   Here's the thing.
[00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:57.820]   While they do include a few people like I've already mentioned who are amazing people,
[00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:01.100]   the majority of the genealogy, guess what?
[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:05.140]   The people are really messed up.
[00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:07.700]   That should shock you.
[00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:11.700]   That's what Matthew and Luke should not have done.
[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:16.900]   But they don't shy away from the messy background to Jesus.
[00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:19.900]   In fact, they want you to see it.
[00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:27.060]   They shine a light on it so that you can begin to wrestle with the incredible reality that
[00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:33.940]   some really screwed up people went into the bloodline that formed and brought Jesus Christ.
[00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:39.100]   So I want to tell you some of the stories of some of the people that you'll find in
[00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:45.500]   Matthew and Luke's presentation of the genealogy of Jesus.
[00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:53.300]   You'll find characters like this, like Jacob and Jeconiah, who were basically serial liars
[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:57.980]   and manipulative deceivers.
[00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:07.400]   There's people like David and Jocham, who were murderers, adulterers, and rapists.
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.400]   You'll find Judah.
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.620]   Judah's an interesting one.
[00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:14.740]   Judah is a human trafficker and sexual abuser.
[00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:20.380]   You'll find Abijah and Manasseh, both who are idol worshippers, by the way.
[00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:23.860]   Down the list a little bit further in Matthew's, there is Rahab.
[00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:27.060]   She's a brothel owner and a prostitute.
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:29.860]   Tamar's always a fascinating one for me.
[00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:34.940]   Tamar slept with her father-in-law, so basically entered into incest.
[00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:38.420]   You've got Solomon, who was essentially a sex addict.
[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:41.820]   He had 300 sex slaves.
[00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:47.980]   You have Ahaziah, and this one might be the most disgusting of all, Ahaziah, who actually
[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:52.940]   was involved in child sacrifice.
[00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:59.300]   All of these people, Matthew and Luke don't shy away from, despite the difficulties of
[00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:01.260]   their stories.
[00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:04.940]   But it's not just those that have abused that are in the bloodline.
[00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:08.900]   There's also examples of those that have been abused in the bloodline.
[00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:11.340]   So in here as well, it's Bathsheba.
[00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:15.900]   Bathsheba, who was exploited by King David for her body.
[00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:17.620]   There is Ruth, who was a Moabitess.
[00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:19.820]   The Jewish people hated the Moabites.
[00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:21.340]   She's included in the line.
[00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:26.300]   And she was someone who was actually discriminated against time and time again.
[00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:28.220]   You then got Mary in the list, of course.
[00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:29.540]   Mary comes towards the end.
[00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:31.020]   She was someone who was falsely accused.
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:35.060]   People accused her of having sex before marriage when that wasn't the case.
[00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:38.940]   So you've got those that have also been mistreated in the list.
[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:40.660]   Add to that then a whole bunch of names.
[00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:43.180]   Let me read these to you.
[00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:49.580]   People like Azor, there's Zadok, Achim, Eliud.
[00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:53.260]   The reason why I read you these names is because we know nothing about them.
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:55.060]   There's no story about them at all.
[00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:57.180]   They're not mentioned anywhere else in the Bible.
[00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:58.900]   They're completely forgotten to history.
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:05.460]   You could actually argue that these are forgotten, unknown, and insignificant people.
[00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:09.020]   They're also on the list.
[00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:14.540]   So just take a second and look at Jesus's family tree.
[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:19.780]   These are the stories that go to feed into the person of Jesus.
[00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:23.940]   And Matthew and Luke are like, "Look at this."
[00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:27.380]   And some of us in this room, we have some pretty broken families that we're from, but
[00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:32.260]   maybe this is a comfort to you that your family's not quite like this.
[00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:36.060]   This is pretty full on.
[00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:40.140]   And Matthew and Luke, what they're doing is they're like, "No more misdirection here.
[00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:44.700]   We're not going to try and convince you that the Messiah is this perfect God, this perfect
[00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:46.580]   person for a perfect world.
[00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:52.260]   He's a perfect God and a perfect person for a really broken, screwed up world."
[00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:53.260]   And guess what?
[00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:57.820]   All that brokenness, all that screwed upness, it's all come up to form who He is.
[00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:00.360]   His bloodline is not great.
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:05.860]   His bloodline actually is a reflection of us, of humanity.
[00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:08.940]   And this, my friends, is what Christmas is all about.
[00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:13.140]   Matthew and Luke are trying to shine a spotlight right at the start and say, "Here's the purest
[00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:18.120]   message of Christmas, that Jesus is willing to step into the muck and the brokenness and
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:22.120]   all the stuff that there is in life, all of the stuff that we would rather sweep under
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:26.740]   the carpet, we'd rather do some misdirection so people don't know that about us, all of
[00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:29.180]   that stuff is why Jesus came.
[00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.880]   This is the gospel at its purest form.
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:36.160]   He didn't come for you when you got yourself cleaned up.
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:40.000]   He didn't come for you when you were all so perfect and nice.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.120]   So many of us think that Jesus would come to us if we just stopped sinning.
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:49.220]   The reality is He came to you whilst you were still a sinner.
[00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:55.640]   He steps into the muckiest of our mucks and says, "I am here.
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:57.600]   I'm here with you."
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.960]   That's the beauty of Christmas.
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:04.520]   And any time we try to turn it into something else, we're actually stripping Christmas from
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:08.760]   the gospel for which it was founded in the first place.
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:19.800]   See, here's what Jesus' genealogy teaches us, that no one is so bad, so sinful, so mistreated,
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:28.680]   so forgotten, so cast out of the circle of faith that they are outside the story of Jesus.
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.600]   No one.
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:35.400]   And if that doesn't encourage you today, I don't know what will.
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:43.040]   That no one is disqualified from the grace and the mercy of a God who was born in a damp,
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:51.520]   dark cave to give us the message that no matter how damp, dark, and cave-like our hearts might
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:55.560]   be, Jesus can be born in there too.
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:59.520]   His life can come alive in us.
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:05.600]   That in fact, I think actually Jesus likes to search out those that seem more messed
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:10.680]   up than others and say, "You're my child.
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:12.140]   You.
[00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:13.920]   I love you.
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:17.760]   And I am here for you."
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:22.000]   And the beauty of the genealogy of Jesus, in fact, the beauty of every genealogy is
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.480]   that it tells you the people that come to form someone.
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:29.680]   But then you can flip it because that person then becomes the starting point of more that
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:30.680]   would come from them.
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:31.680]   Do you follow that?
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:37.160]   So genealogy goes up towards the person, but then the genealogy goes beyond the person
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:39.120]   outwards from them.
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:42.340]   And every single person who's in this room right now who's a Christian, you're a part
[00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:46.640]   of now the family line, the bloodline, if you will, of Jesus.
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:50.560]   Not the literal bloodline, but the blood that was shed on the cross to pay the price for
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:51.560]   your sin.
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:55.200]   And as we come into saving recognition of that, and we ask God to forgive us of our
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:58.800]   sins and we grow in that, then we are a part of his family.
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.720]   He says, "You are not the same person that you were before.
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:02.720]   You're a new creation.
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:03.720]   You're my son.
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:04.720]   You're my daughter.
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.720]   You're my child.
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:06.720]   You're a child of God.
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.640]   You are in this story now."
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.320]   Isn't that beautiful?
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:15.640]   So the reason why Matthew and Luke start with this story of a broken, messy background to
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:19.640]   Jesus is because they're trying to say something.
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:27.080]   That the family that Jesus was from anticipates the family he's come for.
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:29.560]   Do you follow that?
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:36.800]   The family that Jesus is from anticipates the family that he's come for.
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:43.880]   You and I, who are equally as messed up and as broken as some of those people in the list
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:51.440]   right there, and yet who are not disqualified, and who are ones that God now turns to and
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:54.120]   says, "I choose you.
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:57.760]   That you are going to be a part of this thing called the church.
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:02.760]   This thing filled with kind of messy people who know that they have a God who has saved
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.400]   them and redeemed them and have hope now."
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:08.960]   See, as Christians, we don't worship the mess.
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.560]   We don't go, "Oh, look at all my brokenness.
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:12.080]   Look at all my sin."
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:17.000]   Paul says, "In recognition of the grace of God, do I continue to just go on sinning?"
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   No.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.640]   We don't worship the mess, but we realize that we are part of the mess and that Jesus
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:26.080]   comes and redeems us out of that mess.
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:29.440]   And as he pulls us out of it, we then have a story to tell.
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:36.040]   Christmas should be the most powerful, gospel, evangelistic story that could ever be told
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:42.400]   to a broken and desperate world, but we've allowed the world to strip Jesus from it.
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.560]   Happy holidays.
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:48.840]   When actually Christmas should be the time where the church rises up and says, "There's
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.440]   a better story to be told.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:56.880]   There's a story about the mess of the world and the mess of humanity and the God who is
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:04.880]   not afraid of that mess, a God who steps into that mess and does something about it, who
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:11.200]   invites us to experience his love even in the mess."
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:14.720]   I love how the scholar Raymond Brown puts it.
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:15.720]   He wrote this.
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:19.440]   He said, "The God who wrote the beginnings with crooked lines also writes the sequence
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:24.440]   with crooked lines, and some of those lines are our own lives in witness.
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:29.560]   A God who did not hesitate to use the scheming as well as the noble, the impure as well as
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:34.820]   the pure, men to whom the world hearkened and women upon whom the world frowned.
[00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:40.000]   This God continues to work through the same glorious mess of people."
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.660]   Isn't that beautiful?
[00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:49.720]   This God continues to work through the same glorious mess of people, the Vine Church in
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:51.920]   Hong Kong.
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:54.360]   That fills me with joy.
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:55.840]   That's the gospel.
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:59.040]   That actually is Christmas.
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:05.120]   On your way out in a moment, I want to encourage you to go down the main stairs of the building,
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:08.460]   particularly if you didn't have time to look at them on the way up.
[00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:11.640]   If you're in the upper house, I might want to encourage you guys to come and do that
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:16.080]   even though you might escape through the lift or some other way at the end.
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.300]   Not escape, that was the wrong word.
[00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:19.600]   You go in the lift.
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.280]   You're more than welcome to use the lift anytime.
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:22.280]   I will not think you're escaping.
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:23.720]   The lift is good.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:26.640]   But you might want to come down the stairs and come down the main thing because what
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:30.800]   we've done is we've wanted to visually represent everything I've been talking about today and
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:37.200]   what this series is all about through what we call cabinets of curiosity or rooms of
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:38.200]   wonder.
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:43.160]   They're famous in the 16th century to help people to experience the wonder of the world.
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:47.840]   We, our creative team, have made four of these that are down there on the stairs.
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:49.320]   You can look at them on the way out.
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:54.760]   And we've put specific things inside of them because they represent what I'm talking about.
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:58.400]   They represent the reality that on the outside, we're structured and we have a certain way
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:01.160]   and we project a certain image.
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:04.480]   But on the inside is all the stuff.
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:06.660]   Some of it which we're happy for people to see.
[00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:09.280]   Some of it we're not happy for people to see.
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:15.800]   But in that, we have a gateway to the need for the gospel of Jesus and the need for the
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:20.000]   hope that he brings us by his love and in his power.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:27.560]   And so as we come to look at these little cabinets of curiosity, I wonder you might
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:32.760]   reflect a little bit on the curiousness of your mess in you.
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:35.840]   And it's an invitation for you to bring that mess to him.
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:39.680]   And what we're going to do every step of this series is give you an opportunity to bring
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:44.000]   a certain type or kind of mess to God.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.420]   And I believe that as we get to the end of the series and as we get to Christmas Day,
[00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:52.220]   you will find yourself living out the Christmas story so much better than ever before.
[00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:55.400]   It is not a misdirection.
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:58.720]   Instead what Matthew and Luke do is they're like, "I'm not going to do this by the way."
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:04.080]   But if they took this and went like that, they basically rip it all off and they say,
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:08.680]   "This is how it really is because in this, there is hope."
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:13.240]   For you in this room online right now, everybody in the overflow, no matter how sinful you
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:15.360]   are, there is hope.
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:17.800]   No matter how broken you are, there is hope.
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:20.920]   No matter how forgotten you are, there is hope.
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:25.400]   No matter how mistreated you have been in your life, there is hope.
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:28.200]   That's the gospel message of Jesus.
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.200]   That's what Christmas is all about.
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:33.920]   So may we enjoy the mess this year.
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:38.800]   One of the greatest messes you'll ever encounter is the mess of Christmas Day.
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:42.280]   Do not be too quick to clean it up.
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:44.280]   Can I pray for you?
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:46.920]   Let's pray.
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:53.320]   Father, I am so grateful for the people in this room.
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:59.520]   I'm so grateful for every person who holds a different story.
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:07.600]   I'm grateful, Lord, that you have provided for us all a gateway, an entry point to you.
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:19.000]   That your birth in Bethlehem some 2,000 years ago in a sequence of messy events is really
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:24.840]   our opportunity to experience your welcome in our lives.
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:29.200]   So I want to pray for a few kinds of people in this room as our eyes are closed and our
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.200]   heads are bowed.
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:36.640]   Some of you in this room, you don't know Jesus.
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:42.320]   Maybe when you came in here this morning, you wouldn't have said that you were a Christian.
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:45.680]   Maybe someone's invited you here, or maybe you feel like you had a relationship with
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:54.920]   God in the past, but that's gone and you're wondering how to get it back.
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:34:01.120]   The message that I brought today is a message of hope for you.
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:04.160]   You don't need to get yourself cleaned up before you can meet Jesus.
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:09.800]   And some of you, that's a real message for you today.
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:15.400]   Some of you are thinking, "Well, once I get through that divorce or I stop doing that
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:19.920]   thing there, or once I just become a little bit of a better person, then I can be a Christian
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:20.920]   and come to church."
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:27.720]   The message today, the message of Christmas is no matter how messed up you are right now,
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:29.920]   you are welcome here.
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:31.560]   You're a part of our community.
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:35.480]   But more importantly, Jesus loves you.
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:40.920]   He's for you, and He can help you.
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:45.480]   And so maybe some of you in this room right now or online, you want to give your life
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:47.980]   to Jesus for the very first time.
[00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:52.240]   You've never done that before, but this is a moment for you.
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:54.940]   So whilst our eyes are closed and our heads are bowed, I want to give you an opportunity
[00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:57.160]   to respond today.
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:00.800]   Perhaps right now your heart is just beating a little bit faster because you know that
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:04.440]   God is with you in this, that He's inviting you to a relationship with Him.
[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:06.920]   And you may not have all the answers.
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:13.760]   You may not know all the things, but you do know in this moment that you want to meet
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:19.480]   a God who can meet you right where you are.
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:23.200]   So if you've never given your life to Jesus before, I want to give you an opportunity
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:26.120]   to do that, and I'm going to pray for you in a moment.
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:30.000]   Whilst our eyes are closed, heads are bowed, you have an opportunity to start this New
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.360]   Advent series and season in the right place.
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:37.840]   So if that's you, I want to just encourage you just really quickly, just put your hand
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:42.760]   up so I can see you, so I can pray for you personally.
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:44.760]   Anybody here in the lower house?
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:49.680]   In the upper house as well, just put your hand up so I can see it.
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:52.960]   Great, see that hand, thank you.
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:57.040]   Anyone else want to join my sister?
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:02.720]   Yeah, I see that as well, thank you.
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:07.360]   I can't really see the upper house, but we have pastors up there who can see you if you
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:10.360]   have raised your hand.
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:14.680]   I want to pray for those two people that I've seen, and maybe some people in the upper house
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:15.680]   as well.
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:22.200]   Father, I thank you so much for these two, Lord, who Lord, have brought themselves to
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:25.320]   a place today to meet you.
[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:29.680]   And we're all going to pray as one church together now, but those two in the upper house,
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:32.160]   if it's you as well, I want you just to pray after me.
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:35.680]   We're all going to do it out loud, so you guys are a part of it, but it's particularly
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:36.680]   for you guys.
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:39.160]   So we're all going to pray this together, let's pray.
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:50.840]   Lord Jesus, I want to thank you for coming to earth, for being born 2000 years ago, so
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:53.400]   I could know you.
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:37:01.080]   Thank you for being born into the mess, into my mess.
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:02.520]   Thank you.
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:12.800]   I ask that you would come now and meet me, forgive me and help me.
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:22.920]   I ask for your Holy Spirit to be in me and with me and helping me.
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:31.040]   And I thank you that my new life starts today in Jesus' name.
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:32.040]   Amen.
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:33.040]   Amen.
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:37.040]   Well, if you've prayed that prayer here in the room and in the upper house, do come and
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:38.600]   talk to me afterwards at one of our passes.
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:40.160]   We'd love to pray with you.
[00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:43.520]   Everybody else, I want you to bow your heads and close your eyes again, sorry, because
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:45.200]   we're not done yet.
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:51.040]   And so this is now for everybody else here who's already a Christian.
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:54.000]   I know some of you are from really broken homes.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:00.260]   I know that because I'm your pastor and our pastoral team spends time with you guys.
[00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:05.440]   Some of you are from really difficult, challenging family backgrounds.
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:10.640]   Some of you have been deeply hurt by those in your family.
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:15.880]   And some of you, you've been really impacted and affected over the years by the brokenness
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:19.120]   in your family.
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:24.840]   And I pray today as we take a bit of a look at the brokenness of Jesus' family, that you
[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:29.900]   would find hope renewed in you today, that you would know that there is a God who knows
[00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:38.000]   what it is that you're going through, who knows how hard that it is being for you, and
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.760]   a God who wants to come and walk with you.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:46.280]   He's not a God who always necessarily suddenly makes everything better, doesn't always suddenly
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:51.280]   change our circumstances or situations, but He does guarantee His presence with you in
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:55.200]   whatever it is that you are facing right now and will need to face.
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:39:01.080]   So if you're from a broken home or a challenging family backgrounds, know that the love of
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:03.040]   God and the presence of God is with you.
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:07.840]   And Lord, I want to pray for my family here, whether that's their reality.
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:13.980]   Father, I pray that they would feel hope renewed in them, that they are now swept up in a family
[00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:19.400]   that you're a part of, that you started, that as we carry the name of Christ, we do so as
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:24.480]   part of your family, your sons and daughters, your children.
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:30.840]   And Father, I want to pray lastly for anyone here who's hurt people.
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:36.720]   You know, in the list of Jesus' genealogy are those that have been mistreated.
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:40.600]   We know, Lord, that sometimes we have done that ourselves.
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:43.560]   Maybe some of our family issues are at our doorstep.
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:50.040]   Maybe we were the perpetrators of some of the broken relationships in our families and
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:54.720]   some of the things that we're not proud of.
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:59.760]   Maybe we're the reason why there's been some brokenness amongst the people we love the
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:00.760]   most.
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:06.160]   And I want to pray for you, if that's you in this room, that you would know the grace
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:10.680]   and the forgiveness of a God who forgives you so that you might be able to have the
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:17.360]   strength to move forward and invite and ask for forgiveness for those that you have hurt.
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:22.720]   The Lord's Prayer, forgive us our sins as we forgive those who have sinned against us.
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:28.440]   And I think the Gospels would further add as we invite and ask for forgiveness for those
[00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:29.440]   that we've hurt.
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:34.620]   And so I want to pray for anyone here who recognizes that they've played that kind of
[00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:35.620]   role in their family.
[00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:42.380]   That Lord, I just ask that you would give them the strength, Lord.
[00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:46.980]   This humility, Lord, to seek reconciliation where it's possible.
[00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:51.340]   May not be possible in every circumstance, but where it's possible, Lord, give them the
[00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:54.700]   courage to do that.
[00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:59.640]   And Father, as we stand with this thought today, we're thankful that you minister to
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:01.820]   us in multiple different ways.
[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:04.660]   It's all for your glory and for your grace.
