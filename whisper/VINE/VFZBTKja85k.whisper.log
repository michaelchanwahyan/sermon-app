[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.040]   Well it's good to be here. Happy Easter everyone. And what I want to share with
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.840]   you is I a while actually it's quite a while ago I did a very risky investment.
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:21.700]   So I invested in a stock and at first my investment was doing incredible. So my
[00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.960]   stock price started you know just kept going up and I was like wow I'm like I'm
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.800]   good at this you know whoo I felt like an investment guru. And then suddenly
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.400]   kind of flattened out sort of fluctuating the stock so I was like
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.560]   maybe I should monitor this a bit more. So I got up every day when the New York
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.880]   Stock Exchange opened you know I was watching how my stock was doing. And at
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.280]   first I was okay but after a while it actually became a little bit stressful.
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.920]   How my day was going was based on how that stock was doing. And then suddenly
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.120]   my stock dropped and just started plummeting. And by the time I was able to
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.280]   sell my shares I actually lost quite a bit of money. And as I was reflecting on
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:13.040]   that experience I realized that how I was doing emotionally every day was tied
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.200]   to how my stock was performing. My external circumstances were dictating
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.000]   how I was feeling internally. So when the stock was going up I was feeling good.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.200]   And when the stock was going down there was fear, there was anxiety and there was
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:37.240]   a lack of peace. Now I believe that I'm not the only one who has this experience.
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.200]   And I'm not just talking about investing in stocks I believe in other
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:48.000]   areas of our lives as well. Because the thing is that for most of us our sense
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.920]   of peace, our sense of well-being is connected to our external circumstances
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.040]   and how they are going. Right? So for example when things are going well in
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.400]   our relationships, our jobs, our finances, with our children, with our health, with
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.720]   our investments, we're like "whoo" you know life can be good. And even then
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.480]   sometimes we still even when those things go on sometimes we still don't
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.560]   have peace. But a lot of times those are times when we can feel feel good and we
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.040]   can feel well when things are going well. But suddenly when there's a change
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.080]   when those things change and they can change quite quickly this this peace
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:33.160]   that we had suddenly is gone. And a lot of times there's fear, there's anxiety,
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.280]   there's other things that that we're experiencing. And at one point or
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.120]   another we all come to this point in our lives you know whether it has to do with
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.720]   investments or with your relationships or your job or you can fill in the blank.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.960]   We come to a point where we just long for peace. We just want to be well. We
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.600]   don't want to just live in this anxiety, this fear, the stress. We don't want to
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.240]   have this troubled heart. And we just want a peace that is not dependent on
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:12.720]   our circumstances. We want a peace that doesn't rely on our external circumstances.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.360]   And so what I want to do with you today as we are celebrating Easter and we're
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.960]   excited that Jesus died and that he rose. I want to explore with you a question.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:29.040]   And the question that I want to explore with you is how can I have a peace that
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.920]   is not dependent on my circumstances? And does a peace like that actually really
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.440]   exist or is that just fantasy? And then what does Easter have to do with all of
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.920]   that? So does that sound good? Yes? Okay good. Thank you for the strong yes from
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:54.040]   over there. So we're going to explore through our messages question. They
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:00.920]   were in the Gospel of John. And so I want to set a little bit the context before we
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.040]   go into our actual passage. So the disciples of Jesus, they've been hanging
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.040]   around with Jesus. They've been journeying with him. They've been learning from him.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.840]   Disciple means learner. So they're learning from Jesus. They're part of all
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.920]   these exciting things that Jesus is doing. And it's amazing and it's exciting.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.360]   And so they spent three years with him and now they're heading to Jerusalem.
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.400]   And they're excited. This is the moment. They're excited because they believe
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.240]   Jesus is going to set up his kingdom. He's going to drive out the Romans. He's going
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.160]   to free them from oppression. He's going to bring justice and peace. And they're
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.360]   going to get to be part of that. They are going to get the part of this experience.
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:47.120]   But as we most of us know, that's not what happens. What happens instead is
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:53.280]   that Jesus is betrayed by one of his disciples. That he gets arrested. That he
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.920]   gets an unjust trial. That he is crucified. And that he dies on the cross.
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.000]   Now if you if you think about this for the disciples, you know they they had
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.600]   dreams and were anticipating a future. They were excited about it and suddenly
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:16.040]   all of that is shattered. And that is gone and they're just disoriented. And so
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.680]   that's that's the place that they find themselves in. But then on the third day
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:28.720]   something incredible happens. Jesus rises from the dead. And John and Peter, they're
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.480]   they're going to the grave. And I always find it hilarious if you read the Gospel
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:37.880]   of John. John notes that he was faster than Peter. That he outran Peter to the
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.120]   grave. I always find that a funny detail in the Bible. But when they when they go
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.200]   inside, they find the linens of Jesus. That his body was wrapped in. But his
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.920]   body and Jesus is not there. And John understands. And he believes, we're told.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:57.600]   But he's not the only one who is at the at the tomb. It's also Mary, one of the
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:03.160]   disciples. And and she is in such grief. She talks to who she thinks is the
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.240]   gardener. But it's not the gardener. It's actually Jesus. But she can't tell. And
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:12.560]   then he calls her by her name. He says, "Mary." And and her eyes are open and she
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:18.440]   sees him. You know, a Rabbouni Lord. And she she recognizes him. And he tells her to
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.880]   tell the disciples. So all of this happens in the morning. And we're gonna
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.280]   pick up the story now where the narrative shifts to the evening. So
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.840]   that's what we're gonna look at. So we're in John chapter 20 verse 19 through 22.
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:37.000]   And it says this, "On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.960]   were together with the Dorzak for fear of the Jewish leaders, Jesus came and he
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:49.480]   stood among them and said, 'Peace be with you.' After he said this, he showed them
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:56.340]   his hands and sighed. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord. Again
[00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:02.640]   Jesus said, 'Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, I am sending you.' And
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:11.720]   with that he breathed on them and said, 'Receive the Holy Spirit.'" So the disciples
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:17.920]   they're in hiding. Now I don't know if everyone here has ever needed to hide.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:22.980]   Now we're not talking about hide-and-seek. We're talking about really hiding for
[00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:29.080]   their life, scared to be killed. So disciples are hiding. They're tucked
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:33.600]   away in some house, locked doors and all. Because they think what happened to
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:38.640]   Jesus is gonna happen to them. They're next. That's what they're thinking. And so
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:46.160]   they're hiding away. And just put, just let's try to put ourselves in their
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:53.560]   situation. A week ago they're in freedom. They have peace. They're with Jesus and
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:58.840]   things are going well. They're excited about the future. And then now they find
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:04.840]   themselves hiding in fear and anxiety, a lack of peace and probably no
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:08.360]   expectations about future. More like dreading the future. They're not excited
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:14.160]   about the future at this point. And it's amazing how quick our circumstances can
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:19.000]   change. And we all know that. We've experienced that where something just
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.200]   happens and what you know something was good and then suddenly it's not good
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:32.720]   anymore. And then a miracle occurs. Jesus, he steps into the room where they are
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:43.200]   hiding. He stands among them. And I don't want you to miss this. The disciples they
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:49.240]   are in fear. They're living in anxiety. They're lacking faith. Mary probably told
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.720]   them what she saw but they just struggled to believe. They're still in
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:09:00.880]   hiding. And Jesus, he meets them in their anxiety, in their fear, and their lack of
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:05.080]   faith. You know a lot of times we think we need to get our act together and then
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:12.840]   come to Jesus. But Jesus steps into our issues, our brokenness, our lack of fear.
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:19.440]   And that's what's happening here. That's amazing. And so the resurrected Jesus
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:24.400]   with his love and his grace, he meets them. So Jesus meets the disciples where
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:30.880]   they are in their fear, their failure, and all the uncertainties that they are
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:39.320]   facing. And that is true for us today here as well. Jesus meets us in our fears,
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:46.400]   in our failures, and our uncertainties, and our lack of faith. And just like he
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:52.080]   stepped into the room with the disciples even though the doors were locked, Jesus
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:10:01.400]   steps into our lives, into our places, and he stands among us. And he says, "Peace be
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:08.040]   with you." Now I don't know what what's been going on in your life. You know
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:12.040]   maybe there's been relationship problems. Maybe there's family issues, drama in
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:17.680]   your family. Maybe there's job issues. Maybe you had a bad investment. I don't
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:24.160]   know. But Jesus is able and willing to step into your situation. Maybe you had a
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:29.520]   personal failure. You know we're stupid sometimes. We do really dumb things. And
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:34.080]   there's a lot of shame. But it doesn't keep Jesus from stepping into your life.
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:48.440]   And he's saying, "Peace be with you." This is what Jesus does. That's what Jesus does.
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:54.080]   That's why we're celebrating Easter. Because he steps into our brokenness. And
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.320]   he shows us his love and grace. That's what he did with the disciples. He stood
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:00.840]   among them. They had betrayed him. They had left him. They were not by his side
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:07.080]   when he was arrested and and was on trial. You know what? Jesus meets them
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:11.720]   nonetheless. He shows them his compassion, his love, and grace. So if anyone here
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:17.720]   today is feeling like they don't deserve it, Jesus wouldn't want me, it's not true.
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:23.400]   He loves you. He wants you. He desires you. He wants you to know that he is right
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:34.600]   here and he wants to speak peace over your life. Come on. And so the disciples
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:42.800]   they finally... actually the disciples are there and they're confused. It's even
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.840]   though Jesus has stepped in their midst, it's not clear yet. And so in verse 20 it
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:53.360]   says this, "After he said this, he showed them his hands and his side and the
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:12:00.000]   disciples then they were overjoyed when they saw the Lord." You know, Jesus revealed
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.640]   himself to them. They couldn't recognize him. But he makes sure that they know he's
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:10.720]   not one of the authorities that's trying to kill them. It's him. It is him. And he
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:15.560]   wants to reveal himself to you as well. It is Jesus in our brokenness and in our
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:21.080]   circumstance. He wants to reveal himself to you and say, "Peace be with you and
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:30.040]   speak over your life." And so I also want you to note that this is also the point
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:33.800]   of faith. The disciples, they were lacking faith. They were struggling to
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.840]   comprehend what had happened, which I think we can understand, right? I mean, who
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:42.320]   can in their mind fathom that Jesus has risen from the dead? It doesn't matter for
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:46.440]   an ancient person or a modern person. This is just hard to understand. But it
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:53.160]   has happened. And they see it. It is revealed to them. And they call him Lord,
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:57.760]   which shows that they know who he is. And it also shows that he's their Lord. So
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:03.960]   this is a declaration of faith. Now Jesus had promised them before his
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:12.360]   crucifixion that, you know, after his death that he would turn their sorrow
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:18.640]   into joy. You can read about that in John 16, verse 20 through 22. We're not going
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:22.320]   to go there today. But if you're interested, you can look that up. And
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:27.360]   that's what's happening now. Jesus has turned their fear into faith and their
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:32.920]   sorrow into joy. And I believe for some of us, that's what Jesus wants to do
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:37.720]   today. He wants to take us on a journey. He wants to take us from a place of fear
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:43.360]   and anxiety to a place of faith. He wants to build faith in us. And that doesn't
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:47.360]   matter whether you're not a Christian yet or whether you're Christian. He wants
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:52.800]   to build faith in his people. And he also wants to move us from sorrow, from a
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:58.900]   place of mourning, of grieving, of disorientation. And he wants to move us
[00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:05.600]   to joy. Because he is the only one who has the power to do this. He can go in
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:11.040]   those locked places into our hearts where we don't let anyone else in. Maybe
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:16.840]   even things we're grieving that nobody else knows about. And he can turn your
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:21.600]   life, my life, around. And that's what we're celebrating today with the baptism.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:26.400]   Because Jesus has stepped into the baptism candidates' lives. He has stepped
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:30.400]   in their lives. He has given them peace. We heard about earlier from Anne. He gave
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:35.800]   Anne peace. He met her as she was worshipping. He was making herself known
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:44.560]   to her. That's what Jesus does. And so this is your day. This is your day where
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:48.840]   Jesus wants to start taking you on this journey from fear to faith and from
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:57.800]   sorrow to joy. Don't miss this moment. Otherwise why bother coming here? He
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.680]   wants to take you on this journey.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:10.680]   So then I'll just wrap up really quickly this passage and get to the part that I
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:14.840]   really want to focus on. So in verse 21 through 22, you know, Jesus says
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:20.200]   again, he said, Jesus said, "Peace be with you." So it's repeated twice. When
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:25.800]   something's repeated twice, it's always important. "As the Father has sent me, I am
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:29.960]   sending you." And with that, he breathed on them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit."
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:37.440]   And so Jesus, he is again declaring his peace to them. And he's calling them. He's
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:41.680]   commissioning them, his disciples, to be part of his peace-bringing work in this
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:45.440]   world, this peace-bringing mission in this world. But he doesn't just ask them
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:50.000]   to do it. He also breathes on them. He gives them the Holy Spirit. They are born
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.680]   again and they're empowered to carry out this work, to be peacemakers in other
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:16:00.960]   people's lives and to share the good news of peace that is available in Jesus. So
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:06.640]   what I really want to focus with you on today is
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:19.920]   I just want to also say we love our family and we love our children and that
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:31.000]   is absolutely no problem. Okay? Exactly. We're at peace. Yeah. Because we want the
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.360]   whole family to be here. You know, we're a family church. And so, but what I want to
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:43.520]   focus with you on is this phrase, "Peace be with you," that's repeated twice. That's
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:48.080]   what I want to lean in with you today. And so it's important to know that in the
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:51.760]   Gospel of John, there's a lot of times when Jesus says something, there's a
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:56.120]   surface level of meaning and then there's a deeper level of meaning. And so
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:02.160]   on a surface level meaning, Jesus is just saying, "Hi. Peace be with you." It's just a
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:06.000]   greeting. It's like saying, "Hi." But of course, there's more to it than just
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.120]   saying, "Hi." There's a steeper meaning. So Jesus' greeting, "Peace be with you,"
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:17.320]   shows that he no longer holds their failures against them. He offers the
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:24.240]   disciples a restored relationship because they had abandoned him. They had,
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:27.720]   you know, he could have rebuked him. "Why did you leave me? Why did you not stand
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:31.440]   with me? You first have to show me that you, you know, love me, that you're worthy
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:36.960]   of my time and my presence." But it's not what Jesus does. You know, he meets them
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:40.920]   and he says, "Peace be with you." He forgives them. He restores them into the
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:48.040]   relationship with him. And I just love this grace. I was, I'm trying to teach
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:51.720]   Ellie German, so I have a nine-month-old daughter. It's not easy in Hong Kong as
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:57.120]   the only German speaker in my household. And so there's a song that I've been
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:03.120]   singing and it's about, you know, God's love is this high. God's love is so deep.
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:10.240]   God's love is so wide, you know, and so, you know, and I mean this is, this is
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:15.560]   what, this is here shown, you know, in what Jesus does. His grace, his love is so
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:20.240]   high. Nothing can be higher, so deep, nothing medieval, so wide. Nothing can be wider.
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:26.360]   And it's so wonderful, big. I don't know if there's an English version of that
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:30.000]   song. Okay, good. I don't know. You can teach me how to do it. I just only know in
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:41.160]   German. And then Jesus is offering his disciples a peace, but he actually had
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:47.000]   promised them this peace even in the Last Supper. Before he, you know, died, he told
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.960]   them that he would give them peace. And so we're in John 14, verse 27, and that's
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:58.160]   where he says this, "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give you. I do not give to
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:03.720]   you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid."
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:14.400]   Excuse me. So when Jesus talks about peace be with you, he's not just greeting
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:20.840]   them, he's not just saying hi, he's giving them supernatural peace, a peace that the
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:26.760]   world cannot give, a peace that runs so much deeper, is so much wider, is so much
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:31.120]   higher than anything that we can imagine. That's what Jesus does. And it's a
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:34.200]   supernatural peace. We cannot bring this about. Your friends cannot give that to
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:39.440]   you. You cannot earn it. It's just a gift that Jesus wants to bestow on those who
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:46.200]   trust him and who know him. So Jesus has a peace to offer that the world cannot
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:53.160]   offer. It is only available by him. And I want to highlight two things. First, the
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:58.400]   peace that Jesus gives, and then secondly, the peace that the world gives.
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.000]   And I want to unpack that a little bit. I'll start with the peace that the world
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.800]   gives. Now, on all these things you could say a lot more, so I have to keep
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:10.440]   it simple. But the peace that the world offers is usually based on external
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:17.880]   circumstances. Good finances, good health, good relationships, job, economy,
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:27.480]   political stability, you know, all that stuff. But the problem is that it's
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:32.280]   not a secure peace, because this peace is based on circumstances and they can
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:37.840]   change quickly. You know, my wife Chris and I, we went hiking with someone. We
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:43.440]   didn't know him. A friend introduced them. And then a few months later, she told me
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:50.800]   that this person took their lives, because his investments went down, because
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:54.400]   he didn't. And honestly, I actually had a conviction. I was like, why didn't I
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:58.960]   tell him, talk to him about Jesus? Why didn't I tell him about the peace, you
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:04.160]   know, that Jesus can give? Because if our peace is dependent on our
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:08.200]   circumstances, you know, we are gonna be standing left empty-handed, because
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:12.560]   the circumstances in life, a lot of times they change. And then even if
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:15.480]   they don't change, it doesn't mean that we have peace. You can have the perfect
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:19.640]   family. You can have the perfect, the awesomest, awesomest husband, wife, children,
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:28.960]   job, you can still lack peace. And Jesus wants to give us a peace that's
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:35.960]   different than the world's peace. And so on top of it all, even if our
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:42.080]   circumstances are good, it does not mean that we're good. You know, peace is, based
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:47.860]   on circumstances, is not a secure peace. It is an incomplete peace, a counterfeit
[00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:53.160]   peace that fools us into believing we're secure. That's the world's peace. That's
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:56.400]   the peace that the world gives. It promises us it looks good, we believe it, but it's
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:03.640]   not true. It is not true. You becoming super rich, yes, gives some security, but
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:08.720]   it's not ultimate security. It's not ultimate peace. But we believe this lie,
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:14.000]   don't we? That's the world's peace, but that's not what Jesus gives. So what does
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.800]   Jesus give? Well, let's look at how Jesus' peace is different from the world's
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:23.440]   peace. There's two things I want to point out. The peace with God and a peace of
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:29.360]   God. Those are two dimensions of the peace that Jesus is offering to all of
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:34.760]   us here right now. First, let's look at what it means to have peace with God. In
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:40.840]   John 20, verse 22, it says, "And with that he breathed on them and said, 'Receive the
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:50.560]   Holy Spirit.'" So Jesus, who is God with us now, has done what God did at the
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:57.040]   beginning of creation. We can read about that, how he gave Adam and Eve life when
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:02.160]   he breathed into them, breathed into Adam. Genesis 2, verse 7 says this, "Then the
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:06.720]   Lord God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:14.840]   nostrils a breath of life, and the man became a living being." And now Jesus, he
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:18.520]   does this in a similar way. He breathes on the disciples, he gives them new life, he
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:26.560]   gives them resurrection life, and he pours out his peace with God. And I love
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:32.560]   Raymond Brown, who is a biblical scholar, or what was, he was an incredible biblical
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:35.200]   scholar, and so he has a quote, and I just want to read this quote to you. It says
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:40.920]   this, "Just as in the first creation God's breath brought into existence a human
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:46.680]   being in his image and likeness, so now Jesus' gift of his own Holy Spirit makes
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:51.600]   the disciples God's children in the likeness of the Son. Now they are born of
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:57.760]   the Spirit. The breath of God in Genesis gave life. The breath of Jesus gives
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:04.800]   eternal life." So it's the Holy Spirit that brings us new life. It's
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:11.840]   Jesus breathing on his people and bringing us from death to life. That's
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:16.080]   what we're, again, we're celebrating today in baptism, that we were dead in our sins,
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:20.280]   we were separated from God, and because of this work of God in our lives, the
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:24.560]   saving, the sealing, this renewal, and this peace-giving work, we are raised to new
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:33.240]   life. And it's by the breath of Jesus pouring out his new life, his resurrection
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:41.400]   life, into our life. And like all spiritual blessings, peace with God
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:48.240]   cannot be earned. We don't deserve it. It's just a gift that we can receive, that
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:55.600]   Jesus makes available to us. And it is available to all. So the first aspect of
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:25:00.160]   the peace that Jesus gives to those who place their trust in him is the peace
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:05.560]   with God. Peace with God comes upon us when we receive the gift of the Holy
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:10.960]   Spirit, are born again, and our relationship with God is restored. And a
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.840]   lot of times, for a lot of people who become Christians, one of their
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:20.400]   experiences is that they experience peace. You know, sometimes that peace is because
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:25.440]   maybe we sense this estrangement and disconnection from God, and when that
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:30.480]   relationship is restored, you know, we feel whole, because that's how we're
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:36.280]   meant to be in relationship with God, and it's just peace comes upon us. And so for
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:40.200]   me, I know that was my experience when I became a Christian, that I had no peace,
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:45.760]   and I really had no peace. I was living in anxiety and fear. I was fearful every
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:52.040]   night, and then Jesus came into my life, and I had peace for the, you know, like
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:26:00.960]   that was, that took me out of that place of darkness. Now let's look at the
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:07.680]   second type of peace that Jesus gives. It's the peace of God. So the last
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:12.640]   sentence of John 14 verse 27, it says this, "Do not let your hearts be troubled
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:18.440]   and do not be afraid." Now what this implies is that Jesus is assuming that
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:21.840]   the disciples find themselves in circumstance where it is human for the
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:27.680]   hearts to be troubled, and it would be human for them to be afraid, because
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:32.920]   there is stuff going on that deserves that sort of response. But he's saying,
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:38.720]   "Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid." And that's the type of
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:45.160]   peace that Jesus, you know, bestows on his people, a peace that is not dependent on
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:49.840]   our external circumstances, a peace that we can know despite of what's going on,
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:27:00.120]   despite of things raging around us. And it's a peace that is greater than
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:06.200]   our anxiousness, our fear, our hopelessness, our despair. And Jesus, that's what he
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:09.600]   wants to give us. Now I don't know if you've experienced this type of peace.
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:14.200]   Sometimes as Christians, it doesn't always mean that we're living with the
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:20.720]   peace of God. Now when I was younger, I felt a call out of investing, which was
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:26.480]   probably good after I shared my opening story, and I felt called to this, you know,
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:30.520]   into NGO missions. I didn't know exactly what, so I quit my job, but I had nothing
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:35.760]   lined up. I just felt God asking me to take that step, and I did. But then suddenly,
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:40.800]   I got anxious, and the people around me got anxious. My parents got anxious.
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:44.040]   They're like, "You made the biggest mistake of your life. You threw your career
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:47.760]   away," you know, like, and they're well-meaning, but I started getting
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:52.680]   anxious and was fearful. And again, I had nothing lined up, so I'm like,
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:56.280]   they're empty-handed. It's like, maybe this wasn't a great idea.
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:02.720]   That's how I felt, but I prayed, and Jesus gave me peace. Despite of all this
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:08.000]   anxious around me of people who loved me or were well-meaning, and God settled my
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:14.040]   heart, and I was able to navigate that time. Or I've experienced in conflicts,
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:20.680]   you know, where there's a horrible conflict. And it's not like we can always
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:25.640]   resolve conflicts because it takes two people to resolve something.
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:30.480]   And I've experienced when I come in prayer to Jesus, you know, that he just gives me
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:36.080]   a peace. Even if this conflict keeps going, and there's nothing that I can do,
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:39.560]   maybe I've already owned whatever I need to own as conflict. I've said what I need
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:44.480]   to say, and it still doesn't matter. You know, and I've experienced Jesus giving
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:51.080]   me peace in these situations where it is a supernatural peace. And so I'm sure for
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:55.240]   many of you, you've experienced that peace in different ways, in different seasons.
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:29:03.280]   Maybe it's in sickness, you experience a peace of Jesus. Now, when we receive the
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:07.760]   peace of God through Jesus, we no longer have to be anxious or fearful during times
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:12.880]   of trouble in our lives. The peace that Jesus gives us is bigger than our
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:17.560]   circumstances. And in trusting things to Jesus, something that we can choose to do
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:21.120]   daily. It's actually a journey. It's not something we do one time and that's it.
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:23.680]   It's something that we do on an ongoing basis, that we trust Jesus,
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:27.680]   that we place whatever's going on in his hands. And actually, Apostle Paul,
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:32.640]   he writes about it in Philippians 4, verses 6 through 7, so I want to read this to you.
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:36.320]   That's also where the phrase, "The peace of God," where that is taken from.
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:42.040]   "Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition,
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:46.680]   with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God,
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:50.920]   which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts, your minds,
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:30:00.320]   and Christ Jesus." Notice what it does not say. It does not say that Jesus will take
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:06.920]   away our circumstances. Now, of course, he can do that too. But it says that Jesus
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:11.120]   will give us a peace that transcends all understanding. He will guard our hearts,
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:17.000]   our minds, and Christ Jesus. And this word, "guarding," that is used,
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.600]   it's actually a military term, like from a garrison, guarding a city.
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:25.960]   So in ancient cities, you had these military garrisons that had protected a
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:31.560]   city from attacks. And God is saying, "I'm protecting you when fear,
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:36.880]   when anxiety, when uncertainty comes. I'm going to fight and battle that off.
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:41.520]   I'm going to battle that away from you." So despite of what's going on,
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:46.640]   that you can experience the peace of God in the midst of everything.
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:51.440]   I was once in Albania, in a mountain village in the middle of nowhere.
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:57.080]   There were arranged marriages, young women who had become Christians,
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:03.200]   who had to marry into Muslim families. And for them, there was a lot of fear
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:08.520]   and anxiety because they're not able to practice their faith publicly.
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:13.200]   But they knew the peace of God. He had given them this peace.
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:19.960]   They were actually an encouragement to me as I met them. So it's amazing that Jesus
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:24.080]   gives us the peace of God. That's part of the blessing of being a Christian.
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:28.480]   It's part of the peace that is available to us here and now.
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:31.520]   As we learn to entrust ourselves to God through prayer, we get to know that He is
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:39.280]   committed to us and Jesus is committed to you. You know how we know that?
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:45.000]   We see that through the cross, how Jesus feels about us because He decided to go
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.400]   to the cross for our sake. He's committed to us. He's giving everything,
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.640]   everything to you. So He's not going to withhold this from you.
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:58.640]   He's not going to withhold this from you. And as we entrust ourselves with Him,
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:03.040]   we get to know His love and His care, and we also get to experience our anxieties,
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:09.600]   our fears, how they can melt away in His presence and our hearts can become still.
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:13.600]   So if we know and follow Jesus, our peace is no longer based on our
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:17.640]   external circumstances. We can walk through difficult times and
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:22.880]   experience God's care and peace in the middle of it, through it all.
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:28.800]   So we receive the peace with God and a peace of God.
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:32.560]   Now, earlier I asked the question, "How can I have the peace that is not
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:37.400]   dependent on the circumstances?" Well, we can have it through a trusting
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:41.680]   relationship with Jesus, where we place our trust in Jesus and we
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:51.720]   become followers of Jesus. Now, I wonder, earlier we talked about
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:56.520]   disciples being in a room, being locked up, and Jesus stepped into that situation
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:00.840]   of their fear, their lack of faith, their anxiety.
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:06.040]   Now, I just wonder what sort of situation Jesus is stepping into here right now
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:14.000]   today in your life. And what's been happening with you,
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.920]   where there's been anxiety, where there's been fear, where there has been a lack
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:25.760]   of peace, and where Jesus steps and he says, "Peace be with you."
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:32.720]   And he wants to take away this anxiety, this fear, and just let you know his love
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:38.520]   and his presence so you can find rest and peace in him.
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:41.640]   So Jesus is offering a peace to you right now.
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:46.520]   I want to invite the worship team to come up.
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:49.520]   So we receive this peace when we place our trust in Jesus,
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:54.080]   whether that's for the very first time and we become Christians,
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:57.480]   or whether that is we keep entrusting ourselves to him with what's going on
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:03.160]   in our lives, different circumstances. And then when we do that,
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:06.600]   when we entrust ourselves to him, something transformers happens.
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:13.520]   When Jesus pours out his spirit, we are born again and we are strengthened
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:17.880]   in our faith. And he just does this new and beautiful work in us,
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:22.360]   in our hearts, in our lives. And this is what we're celebrating today
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:26.280]   on Easter, and this is what we're celebrating with our baptism candidates,
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:35.760]   this peace-bringing work of Jesus. Peace with God and the peace of God.
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:42.120]   I want to invite you right now to actually receive this peace,
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:48.240]   this peace that Jesus wants to pour out in your life.
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:53.800]   Don't miss your moment. This is your moment.
[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:58.800]   If you want to become a Christian, I just want to invite you
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:02.720]   with a simple prayer and how you can do that.
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:06.160]   And the prayer, basically, all that we say is we're sorry,
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:09.360]   we say thank you, and we say please. And I want to talk you through that
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:13.320]   so you know what prayer I'm going to invite you to pray.
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:20.000]   We say sorry, and we ask God to forgive us for all that we've done wrong.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.200]   Because we all, we fail God. We all have things in our hearts
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:26.200]   that are just not pretty, things we've done that are not pretty,
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:30.120]   and we need his forgiveness. We say, "Sorry, God, forgive me."
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:38.200]   Second, we say, "Thank you, Jesus, for your forgiving work on the cross.
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:45.200]   Thank you that you died and rose and that you give forgiveness a new life."
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:50.400]   And then finally, we say, "Please, come into my life.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:57.520]   Fill me with your spirit and show me what it means to know and to follow you."
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:01.520]   So I want to invite right now everyone to close their eyes.
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:05.280]   And if you would like to take the step of becoming a Christian,
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:09.680]   of following Jesus, I want to actually ask you to raise your hand.
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:14.400]   And raising your hand is a step of faith.
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:21.760]   You know, we do this because we're responding to the Holy Spirit moving to us.
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:25.800]   And maybe we're sitting there and there's like, we're stirring and we're not sure.
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:28.720]   This is the Holy Spirit working and speaking to you.
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:35.680]   Just want to encourage you to just raise your hand, take the step of faith.
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:39.360]   And so I'm going to lead us now in a prayer, and I'm going to ask everyone to pray along
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:43.760]   and to follow along just to support those who are praying this prayer.
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:47.000]   I'm going to pray a line, and then you can repeat it out loud.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.080]   And let's be loud. Let's not be super quiet, okay?
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:52.000]   And I'm going to pray the next line.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.320]   And this is how you can receive this peace of Jesus that I've just been talking about this whole time.
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:00.320]   So let's do this right now.
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:08.360]   Jesus, I am sorry for all the wrong that I have done.
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:11.800]   Please forgive me.
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:18.960]   Thank you, Jesus, that you died on the cross and rose.
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:23.400]   So that my sins can be forgiven.
[00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:30.920]   And I can receive your gift of new life in you.
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:34.120]   Please come into my life.
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:37.760]   Fill me with your Holy Spirit.
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:41.880]   And give me your peace.
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:45.160]   Amen.
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:51.160]   God's word says that when we confess with our mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, we are saved.
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:57.280]   So if you have prayed this prayer for the very first time, you know, you have experienced Jesus' saving work.
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:59.440]   Sometimes we feel a lot of emotions.
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:00.320]   Sometimes we don't.
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:02.680]   Sometimes we feel peace right away.
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:08.760]   Now, if you pray this prayer for the first time, I also want to encourage you to come and talk to one of the pastoral team.
[00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:15.480]   We would just love to encourage you, pray for you, and also just help you with, you know, what next step do I take?
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:16.000]   What do I do?
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.720]   Why would you know what to do?
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:20.640]   We just want to encourage you and walk with you in that.
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:23.880]   But I want to invite everyone to stand.
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:27.000]   And I actually want to pray for everyone else as well.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.360]   Because just because we're Christian doesn't mean that we have peace.
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:34.040]   Because it doesn't mean that we're inviting Jesus into what's going on.
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:35.600]   So I just want to pray over you right now.
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:37.600]   So let me pray.
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:42.360]   Jesus, thank you that you are the one who died and rose.
[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:45.120]   Thank you that you are the one who gives peace.
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:47.880]   A peace that is not dependent on our circumstance.
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:50.840]   A peace that is greater than our circumstances.
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:39:05.600]   And Jesus, just like you stepped into the disciples' situations, I pray right now that you step into everyone's situations where there's anxiousness, where there's fear, where there's hopelessness, where there's despair, where there's a lack of faith.
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:07.840]   Where we've been just carrying a heavy heart.
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:13.720]   Where we don't know what to do.
[00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:18.920]   And I pray that right now, Lord, you speak these words of us over every single heart.
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:21.560]   Peace be with you.
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:26.640]   Peace be with you.
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:29.480]   That you strengthen your people.
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:36.160]   That you remove the anxiety and anxiousness and whatever else is going on.
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:37.480]   And fear.
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:38.480]   And that you give us faith.
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:43.240]   And that you allow us to rest in your peace, Jesus.
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:44.800]   I pray for rest in your presence.
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:51.280]   I pray for, yeah, just rest, despite of what's going on around us.
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:54.440]   So I pray right now that you just bless your people.
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:56.560]   Holy Spirit, that you will do your beautiful work.
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.120]   I pray this in your name, Jesus.
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:00.960]   And all God's people said, amen.
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:01.480]   Let's worship.
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:06.480]   [Applause]
