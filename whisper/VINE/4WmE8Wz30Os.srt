1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
 Just think about this for a moment.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:07,120
 There are millions of churches around the world in the next 24 hours that are going

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:13,560
 to be declaring those very words that death cannot hold God down.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:20,400
 That we get to, across the world, join this chorus, this symphony of praise that declares

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,800
 that death is not the full stop.

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,080
 That God changes that full stop into a comma and says that there is more to the story.

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,440
 That what is ahead is greater than what has been in the past.

8
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:35,840
 And I think that is a message that we here in Hong Kong get to bring our own voice to.

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,200
 We get to stand in front of all the death that is around us and declare that that is

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,200
 not the end.

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,520
 That that is not the final word.

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,480
 That that is not the end of the story.

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,480
 That there is hope.

14
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:51,000
 That there is this eternal idea that Christ, having overcome sin, now sits at the right

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 hand of the Father.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,280
 So when we call on the name of Jesus, we're not calling on some rabbi from the first century

17
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,240
 who died a painful death.

18
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,760
 We're calling on a God who's present in this moment.

19
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,000
 The one who is Emmanuel, God with us.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,600
 We're calling on the name that is above every name.

21
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,400
 That in doing that, we get to declare something that is radical to the darkness around us.

22
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,520
 That there is hope in this moment for life.

23
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,760
 And not just normal life.

24
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,560
 Not just a life that seems to have all of its ups and downs.

25
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,880
 But as Jesus declares, life and life eternal, abundant life.

26
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,240
 That God is able to do abundantly more than we could ever ask or imagine.

27
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,160
 That's the God that we're singing to right now.

28
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,600
 That's the one that churches around the world are praising in this moment.

29
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:42,040
 Could you imagine what the Spirit of God can do on the earth as millions of churches declare

30
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:48,280
 in their own way what it means to see a resurrected Savior in 2021.

31
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,720
 If we've ever needed Jesus to walk into our workplaces.

32
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,280
 To walk into our aisles and our seats of government and leadership.

33
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,720
 To walk into the places of our neighborhood that seems the darkest.

34
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,400
 To walk into our families and our marriages and our children.

35
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:13,160
 If there's ever been a moment that we've need Jesus to be present in His resurrected authority

36
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:19,920
 and stand over darkness and say, "You do not get the final say.

37
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,920
 Surely it's now."

38
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:27,040
 And I want to just encourage you wherever you are watching this, wherever you're receiving

39
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,040
 this.

40
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,800
 That whatever has happened and whatever is going on right now, we certainly don't play

41
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,920
 down the realities of what we all sit in.

42
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,120
 The struggles that we have, the traumas that we go through, the difficulty of this moment,

43
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,040
 the pandemic that is still here, the wonderings for our future.

44
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,640
 We all are standing there together.

45
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,640
 But we are not without hope.

46
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,160
 I want to encourage you that as you open up your heart, as you open up your hands, as

47
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:00,360
 you open up your spirit, that God will meet you in this moment with His resurrection power.

48
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:07,240
 And He will enable you to see Him afresh and to find that hope new and alive in you today.

49
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:13,000
 It's our prayer as the Vine Church for you watching this, that you'll find that resurrection

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,760
 hope in you in this moment.

51
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,400
 Let me pray for us, each one of us together.

52
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:25,280
 Father, we just thank you for this thought that we join a symphony of glory and worship

53
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,280
 across the world in this moment.

54
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,200
 Though we think of the smallest churches and the largest churches, we think of all the

55
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,280
 different denominations, all the different ways of expressing your glory.

56
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:44,080
 We think of those that express it quietly and those that express it loudly.

57
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,600
 We think of those that, Lord, have very few words and those that seem to be abundant in

58
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,600
 their words.

59
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:56,880
 Lord, we come before you as the global body of Christ.

60
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,220
 And Father, we thank you.

61
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:03,480
 We thank you that you felt like that pain and that separation on the cross was worth

62
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,300
 it for us.

63
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,600
 We thank you that you did not turn your back fully on humanity.

64
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:15,640
 We thank you that through the power of the resurrection of Jesus, you have faced forwards

65
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,640
 towards humanity.

66
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:25,680
 And we can now see you face to face, that that shroud in the temple has been torn, that

67
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:32,120
 your presence now moves here on earth like it is in heaven.

68
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,320
 Lord, we pray for that beauty of heaven on earth.

69
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:44,000
 We pray for glimpses of it amongst us like we've never experienced before.

70
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,140
 We thank you, Lord, that that is our story, Lord.

71
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:51,960
 And we will declare that story from church to church, from place to place, from workplace

72
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,960
 to workplace and home to home, that you are our hope.

73
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:03,360
 And we thank you for this in Jesus name, everyone says, Amen.

74
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,920
 You know, it's amazing to me that we do get to join together in that hope that we get

75
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:15,160
 to be a people together declaring God's good work on earth right now.

76
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:20,300
 And as we open the scriptures to us today, as we come around this idea of what it is

77
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:27,040
 to see the resurrection of Jesus and to feel that spirit moving in us, I'm going to bring

78
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,240
 you a special message that we've been working on here at The Vine for a number of months

79
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,240
 now.

80
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,680
 We filmed this a couple of weeks ago, and in a moment you'll get to see why we're not

81
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,120
 doing it live and why we filmed it.

82
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:43,320
 But it's really a way for us to bring a creative expression around what resurrection hope is

83
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,280
 all about, particularly in dark times right now.

84
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,480
 So whatever it is that you're dealing with, whatever it is that you and your family are

85
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:57,280
 going through right now, my prayer as you watch this, my prayer as we open scripture

86
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:05,240
 together, my prayer as we listen to his hope that you would find renewed hope in you, because

87
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,960
 we are the people of the resurrection.

88
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:29,640
 Let's take a look at this together.

89
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,940
 So it's Saturday, and just the day before, Jesus has been murdered on a Roman cross.

90
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:39,740
 And here are the disciples on Saturday, hiding behind closed doors, overwhelmed by what's

91
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,860
 just happened and filled with fear and grief.

92
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:49,360
 The Bible tells us that when Jesus breathes out his last breath, a darkness descends on

93
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,520
 the earth, like a blackness covers creation.

94
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,380
 And here are the disciples behind those closed doors, and they're feeling like a darkness

95
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,760
 has covered them too.

96
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,280
 Imagine what it would have felt like for those disciples.

97
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,480
 I mean, they had hoped that Jesus was going to redeem all of Israel.

98
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,400
 They believed that Jesus was the one who was going to set them free.

99
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,600
 But they had seen the events of Jerusalem.

100
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,040
 They had seen what had taken place at his trial.

101
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,480
 And then they'd seen him nailed at that cross.

102
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,840
 And for them, it was kind of like evil had just won again, that evil was making its mark

103
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,440
 on the people once again.

104
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,560
 The disciples thought that there was hope with the Messiah, but that hope had been cut

105
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,560
 off.

106
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,840
 And it was like this darkness and this blackness of this evil death had now descended upon

107
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,840
 them.

108
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,520
 I mean, they really believed that Jesus was going to set them free.

109
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:46,120
 But now they're facing the reality that once again, the empire had won, and there was nothing

110
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,240
 that they could do about it.

111
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,320
 A canvas of blackness.

112
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:56,880
 And whilst those disciples are hiding behind those doors, and they're wondering what's

113
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:05,000
 next, something absolutely glorious happens.

114
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,240
 It's subtle and quiet at first.

115
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,400
 No one expects that it happens.

116
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:16,400
 But Jesus, in shedding of his blood on that cross, begins to transform and change everything.

117
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,320
 That moment that seems to be disregarded by the canvas of blackness around it, actually

118
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:27,560
 is the moment when everything in history pivots and change, that in the blood that was shed

119
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:32,720
 on the cross, atonement was going to come for everyone's sin, that all of the world

120
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:38,320
 would be set free again, because Jesus had done what he'd always said he was going to

121
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,320
 do.

122
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,040
 He was going to give up his life on behalf of his friends.

123
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:48,200
 And that breakthrough moment creates such hope for the world.

124
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:55,040
 The Bible tells us that the wages of sin is death, but the gift of life is eternal life

125
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,800
 in Christ Jesus.

126
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,120
 One man's sacrifice for everybody's freedom.

127
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:07,160
 I mean, it's almost like Jesus's blood then covers across everything else, that blackness

128
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,560
 that was there suddenly now finds itself disappearing.

129
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:16,520
 And instead, here comes his blood, and his blood begins to speak of a louder story.

130
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:22,000
 His blood covers over everything that was black before it, like his blood is the thing

131
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,400
 that actually is going to bring all of that redemption, all of that hope, everything that

132
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:31,520
 the disciples had longed for, it is actually going to take place.

133
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:36,200
 His blood for the redemption of you and me.

134
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:42,480
 Friday and Saturday turn into Sunday, the third day.

135
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,000
 And on this day, the women gather towards the tomb.

136
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,680
 They have their anointing oil, wanting to anoint his body.

137
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,320
 And they get to the tomb, and the stone is rolled away.

138
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,480
 And as they enter in, they don't see his body, but they see somebody standing there, and

139
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,880
 an angel comes to them.

140
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,080
 And he says, "Why are you looking for the living amongst the dead?

141
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,440
 For he's not here.

142
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,040
 He is risen."

143
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:08,200
 I mean, there's this proclamation of the resurrection, and the women are beginning to comprehend

144
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:14,160
 what is just taking place, that if Jesus is risen, then death is not the last say.

145
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,160
 And if death isn't the last say, then perhaps sin is no longer going to be the thing that

146
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,480
 will hold us back.

147
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,200
 Perhaps in this glorious moment of the resurrection, there now is a new story.

148
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,760
 Maybe a new colour gets to go over all the earth.

149
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,280
 Maybe now there is hope.

150
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,640
 Now there is something that we can believe in, something that we can hope for, that perhaps

151
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,400
 the empire and the darkness around us will not win.

152
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,960
 Perhaps indeed everybody can come to a saving knowledge of Jesus.

153
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:49,840
 The women are filled with hope and begin to tell the story of the resurrection to the

154
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,600
 men.

155
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:59,320
 And the despondent disciples of Saturday, they become the people of resurrection Sunday.

156
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,920
 Jesus appears to them, and he begins to show them his hands.

157
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,920
 He shows them where he has those scars on his hands and in his side.

158
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:12,320
 He invites them into his suffering so they could understand his new glory, that he has

159
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,520
 risen, that he is alive.

160
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,880
 And the disciples begin to realise that, hang on, if Jesus is alive, it means that that

161
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,680
 canvas of blackness, it means that the death that is all around them does not have that

162
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,000
 final say.

163
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,560
 It means actually that God is not going to wipe away that canvas and start afresh, but

164
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,680
 he's actually going to come and redeem from within that darkness.

165
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,440
 That new hope and new life could begin to rise up.

166
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,460
 And the disciples see that the resurrection is not about looking back to an empty tomb.

167
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:48,560
 The resurrection is about moving forward into the purposes and promises of God in this moment

168
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,600
 now and in all the moments in the future.

169
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,000
 The disciples begin to understand that resurrection is not just about life after death.

170
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,200
 Resurrection is also about life before death.

171
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,880
 That what we do right now matters.

172
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:09,640
 That if Jesus is alive, if death is defeated, if sin is overcome, then no matter how dark

173
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:14,720
 the world might feel, there is still hope.

174
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,880
 So the disciples begin to believe that they could stand before the darkness around them

175
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,800
 and begin to paint a new work of art.

176
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,720
 That God, if he is redeeming from within, then they can be a part of that redemption

177
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:33,000
 story that as the people of the resurrection, they can begin to bring hope.

178
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,840
 And so we see this amazing thing.

179
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:39,360
 The disciples begin to go, "Hey, we need to tell people about Jesus.

180
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,260
 We need to paint a new story.

181
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,920
 We want people to see and to know his resurrection power.

182
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,680
 We want the blood of God to be poured out onto everybody."

183
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,200
 And they begin to celebrate in the glory that that brings.

184
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:58,320
 Not only that, but they know that no matter what might happen with the empire around them,

185
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,600
 they no matter what persecution might come to them, where they were afraid and despondent

186
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:08,400
 behind doors before, now they can stand before the empire and find joy in the persecution

187
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,320
 because they know that the persecution is not the end.

188
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,640
 Not only that, but together they begin to say, "Hey, maybe we can share our resources.

189
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:22,680
 We can begin to live in a completely new way that perhaps together we might be able to

190
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:28,360
 celebrate in the beauty of no one in our community ever being without anything."

191
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:35,760
 And with that, they have the courage to stand before the darkness of empire and speak truth

192
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:41,640
 to power with love and grace, say, "It is God who is worth more than man.

193
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:46,520
 And I will obey God no matter what humanity might throw at me.

194
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:51,840
 Oh, the joy of a resurrected group of disciples."

195
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,040
 And here's the amazing thing.

196
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,840
 It wasn't just the disciples that were the people of the resurrection.

197
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,760
 We, the church today, are also the people of the resurrection.

198
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,160
 It is the same too for us.

199
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:11,520
 Paul would write that the same spirit that actually brought Jesus into resurrection,

200
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:16,040
 that same spirit is alive in us, in me, in you.

201
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,960
 We are a resurrection people filled with the Spirit of God.

202
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:24,720
 And because that is the case, we too can stand before the darkness around us.

203
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:30,080
 And I don't know about you, but there's a lot of darkness in our world still today.

204
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:35,400
 I mean, we've been facing this global pandemic and we still don't know when we might emerge

205
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,360
 fully as a human race from it.

206
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,360
 Right here in this city, we've been dealing with political and social unrest and all that

207
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:48,320
 that brings to us, all the fear that has been created within us.

208
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,720
 Or take a look at the global conversations that are happening right now with all of the

209
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,440
 racism we're seeing, with the increase in violence around the world, with gender inequality

210
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,360
 still rife, with injustices everywhere.

211
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:06,160
 And we can see that the canvas of darkness is broad and wide for us too.

212
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,840
 And we might be forgiven for thinking that maybe like the despondent disciples on Saturday,

213
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:16,280
 we should just make those walls a little bit higher in our churches and just hide behind

214
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,880
 that and just pray and hope that Jesus would come back soon.

215
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:25,120
 No, Easter is a proclamation that the walls of our churches must come down.

216
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,000
 Easter is the invitation into the reality that we are infused with the resurrection

217
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Spirit of God.

218
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,800
 And because we are, we can also stand before the darkness around us of our day and begin

219
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:43,320
 to paint the colours of the resurrection filled by God's leading to be His new work of art

220
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,320
 in this world.

221
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:50,600
 A work of art that invites people, that tells people that every moment counts.

222
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,800
 Everything we do now matters.

223
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,440
 Every kind word we bring, every encouragement we speak out, every act of love as Christians

224
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,080
 that we bring to our neighbours around it, all of it is beginning to paint the colours

225
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,880
 of resurrection hope on the darkness around us.

226
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,440
 So think about this.

227
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,640
 Think about where we are in this world.

228
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:14,000
 Imagine what it would be like for us as a global church to stand before this ongoing

229
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,320
 pandemic and say, no matter what the worst of the world could throw at us, we're never

230
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,720
 going to be socially distant from the one who can change it all.

231
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:28,720
 Or imagine what it's like for us to begin to believe that we can take the gospel into

232
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,680
 the darkest of places, the hardest of places, the places that overwhelm us and like those

233
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:39,320
 disciples not allow persecution or fear to hold us back.

234
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:45,340
 Or how about this, that as Christians we know we are the imago Dei, the beauty of the image

235
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:51,280
 of God, not just in us Christians but in all humanity, all humans created in His image

236
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:58,040
 and therefore there is no race, no diversity, no background, no sexuality that is beyond

237
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:04,640
 the hope of the redemption of Christ and that perhaps like the disciples we might decide

238
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:10,680
 that it's our time, even amongst the crip of empire and the creeping of totalitarianism

239
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:17,080
 in our world today, that we might stand up for the gospel, look injustice in its face

240
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:21,720
 and say justice is on the heart of God and we the people of the resurrection, we can

241
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,640
 make a difference.

242
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:30,960
 I mean it's just such a profound thought that Easter doesn't make us look back to an empty

243
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,040
 tomb but it fills us and it sets us free.

244
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,400
 We are the people of the resurrection.

245
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:44,400
 Now note what I say that the people of the resurrection, not the person of the resurrection.

246
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,480
 We don't do this alone, we don't have to paint in our own strength, we get to do it as part

247
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:56,440
 of a wider community, we get to do it as the body of Christ and because we're the body

248
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,160
 of Christ we get to come together across our age groups and our diversity and our different

249
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:06,320
 cultures and our backgrounds and we get to take the individual palettes of paint that

250
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:12,160
 God has given us and we dip our fingers into there and we say we're going to use our gifts

251
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,120
 and all the things that God has given us for His glory, that the unique thing that is in

252
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,760
 my life and the unique sphere of influence around me that we as the body of Christ can

253
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:28,480
 work together to see God's redemption and history of His salvation come to so many people

254
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,840
 that we can look into the darkness together and say there is still hope.

255
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,000
 So think about this for you.

256
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,040
 Where is it that you might be able to paint the colours of the resurrection on the darkness

257
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,800
 around you now?

258
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,400
 What is in your hands?

259
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,320
 What gifts have been placed upon you?

260
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,960
 Maybe there are personal relationships that you can take to the next level this year to

261
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,120
 bring the gospel to people that need it most.

262
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,400
 Maybe God's blessed you with resources, whether that's energy or time or finances, and you

263
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:02,200
 can use those resources to help those that are vulnerable in your community.

264
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:07,360
 Or maybe there's a justice issue in your neighbourhood or in your city where you can stand up and

265
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,120
 say something about the gospel and how it relates to that justice issue and be a voice

266
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:17,320
 for those that need it the most, that you might stand up and speak proudly of what the

267
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,880
 kingdom of God is doing in this hour.

268
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:25,040
 See, the beauty of being the people of the resurrection, having that spirit living in

269
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:32,800
 us, is that it tells us that no one and nothing is beyond God's ability to restore and renew

270
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,400
 and set free.

271
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:42,200
 What an encouraging story that is.

272
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,960
 You know, just three days before Jesus was killed on that cross, He gathered His disciples

273
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:52,560
 in the temple courts and He said to them, "Destroy this temple and I will rebuild it

274
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:57,080
 in three days," speaking metaphorically about His body.

275
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:01,600
 And He said to the disciples, "Do you believe this?"

276
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,800
 And I believe that's the question that sits over us as the global church right now, that

277
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:10,240
 God would say to us, "Do we really believe that He has been raised from the dead?"

278
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,720
 Because if we do, it means that God is not getting rid of all of this stuff, but He's

279
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,880
 actually recreating from within.

280
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,880
 It means that He's inviting us to reimagine the renewal of all things.

281
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,160
 It means that that spirit that raised Jesus from the dead is alive in us.

282
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:29,840
 And if it's alive in us, then we have something to say to the darkness around us, that we

283
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,920
 can use our gifts and our voice and our energies and our love to begin to spread the gospel

284
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,400
 in new and profound ways that can truly change things.

285
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,400
 We are the people of the resurrection.

286
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:48,640
 We must roll up our sleeves, grab our paint and get our hands messy.

287
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,280
 The question you have to ask yourself is this, "Do you really believe that Jesus has been

288
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,920
 raised from the dead?"

289
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,440
 Because if you do, it's time.

290
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:19,440
 [Music]

291
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,880
 Church, it is time.

292
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,040
 It's time right now for me to challenge you to respond to what you've just watched and

293
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,600
 what you've just encountered in the story of the resurrection.

294
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:35,120
 And I want to speak specifically to us as the Vine Church.

295
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,960
 You know, I think this is such an important moment in Hong Kong's history.

296
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,640
 I think this is such an important moment in 2021 and the world in which we are in, where

297
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,120
 there's no longer any time for any bystanders.

298
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:53,120
 There's no longer any time for Christians just to kind of attend church and kind of

299
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,360
 get on with their normal lives.

300
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,680
 I think now more than ever, Christ is looking for a church that's willing to stand up.

301
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,360
 He's looking for a church that's willing to rise up and say, "You know what?

302
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:10,320
 God has given me in the little ways that he has gifts and ideas and creativity and thoughts.

303
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:16,520
 And in my profession, in my workplace, as a mother to my children, as a leader in the

304
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:23,200
 place that God has me, whatever it might be and however it might manifest, you carry something."

305
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,920
 Just like that palette of paint that is in your hand.

306
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:34,200
 And this is the moment where Jesus is suffering on that cross and all of that side of things,

307
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,640
 where all that pain that he paid for the price of our sin and the power and the beauty of

308
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,760
 his resurrection.

309
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:46,280
 It was all for, I think, this moment where we can stand in the world right now and take

310
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:52,680
 that paint that he has given us as the body of Christ and begin to show the resurrection

311
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:57,880
 work of art on the darkness around us.

312
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:02,680
 Behind me right now is that exact painting that I made on that day.

313
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,320
 It's right there.

314
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:10,740
 And it's there to remind me and to remind you that we have some work to do.

315
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:15,620
 That because this is Easter, we don't just celebrate Jesus's resurrection.

316
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:22,220
 We also challenge ourselves for resurrection in our hearts and our lives today too.

317
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:30,240
 That if Paul is right, that if this same spirit is in us, then it is our invitation to roll

318
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,760
 up our sleeves, grab that paint, get our hands messy.

319
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,000
 So I want to speak into you right now, wherever it is that you're watching this.

320
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,760
 Perhaps your heart's just beating a little bit faster because the Holy Spirit's beginning

321
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,560
 to say to you, "Now is your time.

322
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:52,080
 It's your time to rise up again with the colors of hope that only Christ can bring and

323
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,120
 begin to speak of life again in the world that's around you."

324
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,840
 It'll look different for every single one of us.

325
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,560
 And that's the beauty and the power of the body of Christ.

326
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,400
 It looks different for you than it would for me.

327
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:10,280
 But there's some darkness that you are being called by the Spirit of God to stand before

328
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:16,280
 right now and say, "This darkness doesn't get the final say."

329
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:20,320
 That spirit is rising up in us as a church right now.

330
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,600
 And I know the things that hold us back from doing it.

331
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,300
 Thinking that we're not enough, thinking that we're inadequate, fear perhaps of what others

332
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:33,820
 might think, perhaps just that sense of despondency like we've all been feeling during this pandemic.

333
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:39,660
 There are lots of different excuses that we can have for not being the people of the resurrection

334
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,660
 right now.

335
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:47,040
 But God would stand before the global church and I think bring a clarion call to us today

336
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,240
 and say, "Will you stand up?"

337
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,600
 We don't do it in our own strength.

338
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,400
 We do it by that spirit in us.

339
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,680
 And that's what I want to pray for.

340
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,320
 If you're watching this right now, if you're part of the vine, if this is speaking to you,

341
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:03,280
 I want to pray that the Spirit of God would meet you in this moment and help you to stand

342
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:07,080
 up in the ways that Christ is calling you to do.

343
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,160
 And if you want to respond to that, I want to invite you to do something, whether you're

344
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,800
 in your home, whether you're on transport right now, wherever it might be.

345
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,720
 But if you're like, "This is me.

346
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,920
 I want to take another stand in 2021.

347
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:21,880
 I want to paint the colors of resurrection hope on the darkness around me."

348
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,800
 I want to encourage you just to open your hands where you are right now.

349
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,880
 There's nothing special in that per se.

350
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:32,640
 It's like a symbolic way of saying to God, "My heart is open before you."

351
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,760
 And in doing that, I believe that we then welcome the Spirit, that resurrection power

352
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,600
 to be in us again.

353
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:44,220
 So if you'll join me, if that's speaking to you, would you just open your hands as I pray

354
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,220
 for us?

355
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:51,520
 Father, I pray over every person at the Vine Church right now who's watching this, whose

356
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,660
 hands are open, whose heart is open, who's saying, "Yeah, we don't want to just be a

357
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:01,260
 church that gathers on a Sunday, has a holy huddle, does our thing, and doesn't have any

358
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,940
 impact in the world around us."

359
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:08,240
 No, we believe that you're bringing your power on earth as it is in heaven.

360
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,000
 We believe that justice sits in your heart.

361
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,240
 We believe that resurrection power is also in us.

362
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,320
 And so, Lord, we pray that the walls would come down in our church, Lord.

363
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:25,360
 And we pray that we would be able to walk out the power of the resurrection in our workplaces,

364
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,960
 our families, our schools, in the places that need it the most, Lord.

365
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,480
 And so for every person whose hands are open right now, who's declaring, "This is me.

366
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,800
 This is my journey.

367
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,960
 This is my story.

368
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:43,760
 I want to live out the resurrection more in the rest of this year than I have ever

369
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,000
 done so in my life."

370
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,440
 Lord, their hands are open.

371
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,080
 I pray that your Spirit would come.

372
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,360
 I pray it's your Spirit that infuses us.

373
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,120
 It's your Spirit that inspires us.

374
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:59,920
 Would you move upon your people right now in the name of Jesus?

375
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:04,320
 And I want to speak just briefly also to some people here right now.

376
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,320
 Perhaps you don't know Jesus.

377
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,920
 Perhaps a friend invited you to watch this broadcast.

378
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,360
 Perhaps you're watching it live in the moment or you're watching it at some other time.

379
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:16,200
 And you're watching this and you've heard about Jesus, but you've never had that personal

380
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,720
 relationship with Him.

381
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,280
 You've never really understood fully what He's done for you.

382
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:25,940
 And you've just watched that message and you've just seen something in that creativity.

383
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,680
 And there's something that's come alive for you.

384
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,560
 There's an invitation now for you to also respond.

385
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:37,640
 See, I believe that Christ is at work right now opening up some hearts to this message,

386
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:43,080
 the message of hope and the message of ESA that comes for us in this time.

387
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:47,080
 If that's you, we want you to reach out to us and to respond.

388
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:52,040
 You know, here at The Vine, we dedicate ourselves to wanting to help you journey in your relationship

389
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,640
 with Jesus, whatever that might look like for you.

390
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,880
 And if you're here and you're saying, "Hey, I want to find out more about this.

391
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,480
 I don't fully understand it.

392
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,760
 I kind of like the painting and the creativity, but I don't fully get it.

393
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,480
 But there's something in my heart that's saying, I want to learn more.

394
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,000
 I want to know something more about this Jesus."

395
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,080
 We want to connect with you and we want to tell you a bit more about it.

396
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,920
 So the way to do that right now on the screen is a little Connect card.

397
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,960
 You can scan that QR code right now.

398
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,240
 That'll take you to a website page where we'll just want you to fill in some of your personal

399
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,800
 details and we'll have a pastor reach out to you this week.

400
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:32,000
 He's going to follow up with you on a one-on-one basis to share something of the gospel with

401
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,120
 you to find out what it is that you want to learn about Jesus.

402
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,480
 And we're going to make the time to do that because we so believe in the story that we've

403
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,600
 been talking about and we believe it can really change your life.

404
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:47,120
 We can believe it can really turn you and change you around into new hope this year.

405
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,960
 And so we want to tell you more about that story, tell you what it means to be a Christian,

406
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,940
 how you can become a Christian, how you can begin to live that daily lifestyle of worship

407
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,080
 of God.

408
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,080
 We want to do that with you.

409
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,920
 So scan that code, fill in that form, take a moment to do it.

410
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,680
 I want to encourage you, please take a moment to do it.

411
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:09,200
 You're thinking, "Hey, I would love to learn more about Jesus."

412
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,360
 That's the way to do it.

413
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:15,040
 We will follow up with you and connect with you and we can't wait to meet you and to tell

414
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:21,560
 you more about the gospel, this good news of who Jesus is for you personally.

415
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:26,680
 And one of the things that we've created at The Vine is a chance for everybody to respond

416
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,120
 and to learn more.

417
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,320
 There's this amazing course called the Alpha Course.

418
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,680
 It was started so many years ago out of a church in the UK, and we get the great privilege

419
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,240
 of hosting that course on a regular basis.

420
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,280
 We're going to be launching Alpha next Sunday.

421
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,120
 That's April 11th at 3 p.m.

422
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:48,520
 And Alpha is designed to invite you if you don't know Jesus and you're not too sure,

423
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:52,240
 but you're like, "I want to find out a little bit more about what Christians believe.

424
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,480
 I want to know a little bit more about what the Bible has to say about God and about life."

425
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,120
 Alpha is designed to help you with that.

426
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:04,120
 And so I want to really strongly encourage you to lean into Alpha.

427
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:09,240
 If you're going to fill in that form, maybe also think about connecting with us next Sunday

428
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:14,340
 at three o'clock, and it will be a great way for us to help you to understand a little

429
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,200
 bit more about all of this kind of painting stuff.

430
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,440
 It's not just a nice creative sermon.

431
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:26,360
 It actually is a life-changing idea, a life-changing reality of relationship with Jesus.

432
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:30,600
 And so whether it's filling in the form or coming to Alpha next week, we really hope

433
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,040
 that you'll connect with us.

434
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:38,480
 And for all of us, we get to now respond to this message in celebration, in song, in joy

435
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,480
 together.

436
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:44,140
 So let me pray for us as we just take some time to allow what I've been talking about

437
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,440
 in that message to really soak on us.

438
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:52,280
 Father, as we come into this response in worship, we do so with our hearts opened now to the

439
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:57,960
 desire for more resurrection power in us, so we can take the palettes of paints that

440
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,960
 are in our hands.

441
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,200
 And Lords, I pray that as we worship now, you'll speak to everybody watching this about

442
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,920
 what it is that you've gifted them with, that they can contribute to the work of art that

443
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,880
 you're creating in this world.

444
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,040
 And we thank you for this in Jesus' name.

445
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,040
 Everyone says, "Amen."

446
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,040
 Amen.

447
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,040
 Amen.

448
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,620
 (upbeat music)
