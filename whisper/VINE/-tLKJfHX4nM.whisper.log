[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600]   When Jesus was on the mountain during the moment of transfiguration, Peter said, "Oh,
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.120]   it's so good for us to be here.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.840]   I'm enjoying the presence of God.
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.280]   I'm seeing miracles.
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.120]   I'm seeing great things happening."
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:23.480]   But actually, God, that moment you were talking about suffering, you were talking about your
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.440]   mission on earth, that is to give your life.
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.840]   God, I pray that, yes, as we're singing, how good you are, how good you are to us.
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.800]   Your presence is so beautiful and your kindness to us is just so great.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:46.480]   Father, I pray that we will be reminded that there's a mission for your church in this
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.480]   city.
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.880]   Yes, it's great to be here, to sing that you're good to me.
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:58.920]   But God, I pray that we will be reminded that we exist as a church in the city, like what
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.960]   John reminded us last week, a sword and light, to tell the city that, actually, you know
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:04.960]   what?
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:05.960]   God is not just so good to me.
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:12.440]   He's so good to those people around us, especially those who don't know him yet.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.480]   And we're here to tell them that God is so good to them as well.
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:23.280]   And so God, on the Vision Sunday, as we talk about your heart for this church, God, I thank
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.280]   you.
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.280]   I stand here humbly, thank you that you are so good to us, so good to each and every one
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.560]   of us.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.720]   But God, I pray that this kind of gratitude is going to move us into a place where we
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.480]   would say, I want those around us, those in Yuen Long, those in my workplace, in my school,
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.480]   in my family.
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.880]   I want them to know how good is God as well.
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.480]   So Holy Spirit, I pray you would fall on us today.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:59.520]   You would come and speak to us, that in this gratitude of your kindness, of your goodness,
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:07.560]   may we be moved out of these four walls and share that goodness, that kindness to the
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.560]   city.
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.400]   Thank you, God.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.200]   I just pray that you would fill us with your Holy Spirit.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.360]   You will come and anoint our ears to listen what you're going to say to us next.
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.920]   Open our eyes to see the vision that you are giving to this church.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.840]   I thank you, Jesus.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.840]   I thank you for choosing us.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.040]   I thank you for gathering us under this roof today.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.520]   In your name we pray, everybody say, amen.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.520]   Thank you.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.800]   Thank you, worship team.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.720]   Please be seated, everyone.
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.760]   So good to have you all here.
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.680]   Like I've mentioned, like perhaps a thousand times in the last half an hour, today is Vision
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.680]   Sunday.
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.440]   This is something we do once a year and we're so excited.
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.200]   We're so grateful you're all here because this vision is not just for Pastor Tim or
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.040]   Pastor Ivan or the staff of the church.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.160]   This is a vision that God wants to give each and everyone who call this their community,
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.880]   their spiritual home.
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.040]   And we're very excited.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.840]   And of course, like we love to have our children with us during worship.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.000]   Here before we release them today, I want to bring you a little bit of updates.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.920]   Next week when we come back, we're going to do things slightly differently.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.480]   We're going to close our Seeking the Peace of the City series.
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.720]   And so we just do things a little bit differently.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.680]   I don't want to, you know, I don't want to be a spoiler, but I want to let you know that
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.080]   something is different.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.760]   So this is what we're going to do.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.160]   Next week when we come back, our children, actually they will go to K4C at the beginning
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.400]   of the service, meaning that we will worship here without our kids.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.400]   They will worship at K4C.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.440]   They'll do their whole thing from the very beginning of the service.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.480]   So parents, this is particularly for you guys, when you bring them in, register them, hang
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.480]   out.
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.440]   But before the service begins next week, please send them to all the K4C classrooms.
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.920]   Is that okay?
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:06.920]   Awesome.
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.640]   So we can pray for them and we can release them.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.480]   They're going to have a great time today.
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.760]   And our K4C teachers can't wait.
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.760]   They're so ready there.
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.600]   So let's pray for them and their children.
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.520]   Father, we just lift up every single child in this room.
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:28.560]   God, we know that you love them so much, that you have so much you want to pour into their
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.560]   spirit.
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.680]   And so Father, I just pray that today they will see you as we're talking about vision.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.200]   Father, I pray that you will give them a vision since young age as well, that they will see
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.880]   you, that they will sense a calling from you, that they would know they are here to follow
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.440]   you for the rest of their lives.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.720]   And Father, we pray for your anointing in each of our K4C teachers.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.040]   Use them to communicate your message today.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.760]   I pray that every single one in those rooms will encounter you.
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.520]   In Jesus' name I pray.
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.520]   Amen.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.200]   All right, parents, thank you.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:08.360]   Please, you may send your kids to the classrooms right now for K4C.
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.920]   And for those of you who are here, welcome once again.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.760]   And you may turn to one another.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.280]   If you could introduce yourself and tell them a little bit about yourselves or just say
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.720]   hello, get to know them, that would be awesome.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.840]   All right, well, I'll be back in a moment.
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.800]   Right, forgot to mention.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.520]   If you are here for the very first time, can I just say hi to you wherever you are?
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.400]   Could you say, is there anyone you're here for the very first time?
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.400]   Yes.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.400]   Hello.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.400]   Welcome.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.560]   So great to have you here.
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.560]   Have I introduced myself?
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.560]   I probably have not, right?
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.160]   My name is Chapman, by the way.
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.000]   I'm one of the pastors here.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.720]   So glad you're here with us.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.640]   And if you would love to stay in touch with us in any way or you want to receive new updates
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.920]   about our church, there's a very simple way.
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.640]   I know everybody use WhatsApp here.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.640]   I assume.
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:04.280]   Maybe not, but if you don't, this is a good time to get WhatsApp right now.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.320]   So you can scan this QR code.
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.680]   If you're an Android user, you have to open WhatsApp to scan it.
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.760]   We regularly send out updates about our church through our WhatsApp channel.
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.120]   And don't worry, now WhatsApp, they have this kind of technology.
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.360]   Even if you join this group, other people can't see your phone number.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.440]   So we respect your privacy.
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.760]   They won't find out your number from this group chat, but you will also be able to get
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.640]   updates from us.
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:30.640]   Cool.
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.640]   All right.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.640]   All right.
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.800]   Now, before I move on, I would love to invite Pastor Tim to the stage.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.080]   He has some updates for us today.
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.320]   Yeah, I wanted to share a little bit personal updates.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.400]   So last week it was announced that I wasn't feeling good.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.120]   And so we were actually planning on having Ellie's baby dedication, but then we had to
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.620]   postpone that.
[00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:57.040]   And so what happened was I actually had so much pain sitting, standing or laying, doesn't
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:03.300]   matter what position, that I told Chris, I need to go to the emergency room.
[00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:10.600]   And so then I was hospitalized, had a surgery and am recovering now and glad to, didn't
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.880]   want to leave Ivan on his own here today.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.080]   I'm glad to be here, but I'm still in the recovering process.
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.240]   And I also want to say thank you for every one of you, you know, for praying.
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.560]   Some of you knew, some of you didn't know.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.920]   But yeah, just wanted to take this moment and say thank you.
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:32.360]   Also I'm going to be, well, on sick leave, but then also gone for a while visiting family.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:38.120]   But we have incredible pastors coming and sharing next week.
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.920]   We have Pastor Chapman, you already heard, there's going to be something creative.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:47.520]   Then we have, I don't remember the order, Justin Ho, he serviced that last week.
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:53.200]   So also just a wonderful pastoral pastor who will be sharing.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.160]   And then we have Alison Tsang.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.260]   And so if you don't know Alison, he's always up for a good joke.
[00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:03.920]   And so he will also be sharing a message that actually will be streamed even to one try
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.320]   as well, because they're having renovations.
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.320]   So anyhow, so I wanted to be here today and it's good to see you all again.
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.440]   Thanks for the prayers and back to you.
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:18.960]   We put hands together for Pastor Tim, still in recovery, but he came back to be with us
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:19.960]   today.
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:20.960]   It's awesome.
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:21.960]   And he's going to have a holiday.
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:22.960]   Wow.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:23.960]   Holiday.
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:24.960]   Oh, I miss holiday.
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.960]   Anyway, so some quick announcements.
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:33.800]   Number one, we have this Cantonese parenting workshop happening this Saturday.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:38.800]   If you have some friends around you, they speak Cantonese, they're parents, this is
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.720]   a very good opportunity for them.
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:45.560]   I know a lot of kids are under tremendous stress in OCD right now.
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:49.980]   How parents could support them, this is one of the very good resources for them.
[00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:54.600]   So if they speak Cantonese, they could use this, just scan the QL code, send the link
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.600]   to them.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:00.040]   There will be four parenting workshops throughout the whole year.
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:03.240]   There will be English ones, so stay tuned as well.
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:08.720]   And then the next one, next announcements, it's on next Sunday, we're going to have a
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.200]   first baptism class.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.640]   So there'll be two.
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.960]   You have to complete two to get baptized.
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.960]   But the first one starts next week.
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:22.460]   Of course, if you want to sign up, there's a link.
[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:28.400]   And if you just decided on next Sunday, you want to come and join, of course, that's okay.
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.780]   But we would still encourage you to sign up, you know what I mean?
[00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:33.900]   Because we have to prepare, right?
[00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:40.420]   And so two baptism classes, and then baptism day, it's on Easter Sunday, and on this month,
[00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.180]   the 31st.
[00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:48.380]   So please sign up if you want, if you're inviting anyone, encourage them to sign up.
[00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:53.340]   And so just to guarantee, okay, so even if you go through baptism class, you don't have
[00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:58.300]   to decide, "Okay, I'm not sure whether I want to get baptized like this Easter."
[00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.300]   That's okay.
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.580]   You can come and just find out what it is about.
[00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:04.140]   And we're going to explain to you who Jesus is.
[00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:05.140]   No, okay.
[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:09.580]   Anyway, we're just going to explain to you what Christian faith is about and what baptism
[00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:10.580]   means.
[00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:11.580]   And that's basically, that's it.
[00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:16.860]   So even if you cannot decide whether you want to get baptized this coming baptism, you can
[00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.660]   still join, and we're very happy to have you.
[00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:20.980]   Cool, right?
[00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:21.980]   Awesome.
[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.960]   So that's all the announcements for this week.
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.340]   And we're doing things a little bit different.
[00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.140]   It's a special Sunday.
[00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:34.080]   So instead of moving into another round of worship through offering, I'm actually going
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:38.780]   to invite Pastor Tim and Pastor Ivan on the stage today.
[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:43.500]   On this very special Vision Sunday, the two of them will be delivering the message to
[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:44.500]   you together.
[00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:48.740]   Well, maybe not together, like maybe one by one, but anyway, both of them are going to
[00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:49.740]   speak.
[00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:54.180]   So can I invite you to stretch out your hands and we'll pray for our pastors.
[00:10:54.180 --> 00:11:02.100]   God, we thank you for Pastor Tim and Pastor Ivan for putting all the effort into this
[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:04.180]   church since the very beginning.
[00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:10.820]   And God, today it is them together with Pastor Andrew, they're hearing from you what you
[00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:14.780]   have in store for this church and also for the Vine as a whole.
[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:16.740]   And they're going to release this word.
[00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.860]   So God, I just pray that you would anoint them, Lord.
[00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:23.340]   You anoint this message that they are about to bring.
[00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:27.940]   And also, Father, I pray you anoint us, our hearts, our ears, that as we receive this
[00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:32.540]   message, we would respond to it.
[00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:36.260]   We would walk in this vision that you have for us as a church.
[00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.300]   So in Jesus' name we pray.
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:39.300]   Amen.
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.300]   Thank you.
[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:44.460]   Thank you, Pastor Chapman.
[00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:52.580]   I'm always amazed to see every Sunday we gather together with our familiar faces and also
[00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:54.380]   sometimes with new faces.
[00:11:54.380 --> 00:12:00.380]   I see how God's worked on us in the past few years and also today.
[00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:07.560]   In 2019, Pastor Andrew shared with us, with Divine Wan Chai at that time, the river model
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:11.380]   vision that God gave us as a church.
[00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:18.900]   It's a vision of a vast river network spanning across a large geographical area.
[00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:24.780]   We can see a photo, which is taken by Pastor Tim, I think, at that time.
[00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:31.660]   We can see that there are, actually you can see this is a Hong Kong map, but full of the
[00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:35.820]   river across Hong Kong.
[00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:40.100]   Through this picture, God spoke a key message to us.
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:50.940]   The vine need to shift its metaphor of how it's through like an idea of house or a building
[00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:58.740]   static on one location, in one location, but this is a river that flows all over Hong Kong.
[00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:03.980]   We are not just a building, but it's about a river through over Hong Kong.
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:07.780]   This vision was a decentralizing vision.
[00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:15.300]   Instead of focus on growing the vine in one location, God gave us a vision as a church,
[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:22.360]   like a river reaching out across whole city, watering the land with gospel.
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:32.140]   In this vision, there was one ocean and also primary river, secondary river, and triple
[00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:33.140]   trees.
[00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:39.460]   The river was flowing the opposite direction of how the river normally flow.
[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:45.660]   You know the river flows from the mountain to the ocean, but what we see is this from
[00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:49.060]   ocean back to the land.
[00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:55.460]   The ocean was the Father and Son and the Holy Spirit feeding the river with water.
[00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:57.500]   Yes, you can see that.
[00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.540]   That is what our vision.
[00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:07.460]   The primary river is a main river, divine church, as a resource's hope.
[00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:14.060]   Also, the secondary river is church pond like us, church pond like us.
[00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:23.260]   The triple trees is mission, home churches, and also marketplace, community groups.
[00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:29.780]   The river model vision is still part of our vision as a church.
[00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:37.060]   Our church pond is part of the working, the working out of that river model vision.
[00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:44.740]   On Mission Sunday 2022, we announced that we are planting a church with English and
[00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:46.540]   also Cantonese service.
[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:54.180]   It was during a time when people were moving away from Hong Kong because of COVID restriction,
[00:14:54.180 --> 00:15:01.740]   because of the changing political landscape, because of job relocation, and for other reasons.
[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:08.180]   During that time, some companies even shifted their regional headquarters out from Hong
[00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:13.460]   Kong to Singapore or to other cities in Asia.
[00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:21.140]   We feel that by announcing that we are planting a church, that is a prophetic act.
[00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:26.260]   That's a prophetic act to show that we are saying that God is not finished with Hong
[00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:27.260]   Kong.
[00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:33.940]   While others were pulling out their investment in Hong Kong, we were doubling down.
[00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:37.540]   We are double investing in this place.
[00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:45.060]   God has plan, has purpose, has future in Hong Kong for Hong Kong, and he's calling us to
[00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:47.620]   invest in it.
[00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:54.460]   Through our 2022 and '23 Mission Sunday, we were able to raise our first year operating
[00:15:54.460 --> 00:16:02.780]   expenses, and the cost of here, the veneration, and also the outfitting of this venue.
[00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:05.540]   We launched our church in 2023.
[00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:12.380]   It was in EIS in the beginning of year, and then we moved here in September, and we have
[00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:18.140]   the grand opening in October 2023.
[00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:24.260]   Our first year is so amazing that we can see that God has been giving us an incredible
[00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:31.260]   future, his provision, his faithfulness, and grow us, and now we stand here a year later
[00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:35.860]   on this Mission Sunday 2024.
[00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:43.500]   Mission Sunday usually have been a chance to unpack what we as a leadership of God,
[00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:50.500]   the sense that God telling us divine, how does it really look like?
[00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:57.900]   But in other words, we have been looking at what's God's vision for us, and how we do
[00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:00.380]   this to impact Hong Kong.
[00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:04.300]   It's more about us and impacting Hong Kong.
[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:10.260]   But this year, we sense that God is asking us to flip this around.
[00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:16.460]   The question we should ask is, what is on God's heart for Hong Kong?
[00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:19.380]   What is God's heart for Hong Kong?
[00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:26.460]   And then we ask the other question, so now, how does a church in Yuen Long, divine Yuen
[00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:30.260]   Long, need to respond?
[00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:34.820]   God leading us to see what is happening in Hong Kong and what is his heart, and then
[00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:40.100]   telling us how can we respond to his vision.
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:45.580]   So now I would like to invite Pastor Tim, past time to him, to unpack the vision 2024
[00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:46.580]   for us.
[00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:47.580]   Thank you.
[00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:58.540]   We wanted to make sure to set the context for you, so you have a vision context that
[00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:01.300]   all of this is coming from.
[00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:06.420]   Now Hong Kong has been going through a lot in the last four years.
[00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:12.860]   It's been a difficult, disorienting season for many.
[00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:20.260]   And I wanted to look at some of these uncertainties and challenges that we are facing as a city.
[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:26.620]   And so Hong Kong is facing a major mental health crisis, especially among youth and
[00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:27.620]   the next generation.
[00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:33.020]   Now there was a recent survey that was done from the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups,
[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:41.940]   which interviewed over 3,600 people, secondary students, and it revealed that 51.9% of the
[00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:46.740]   youth showed emotional symptoms of depression.
[00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:52.660]   And out of this group, 48.6% showed levels that were considered to be at the highest
[00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:55.060]   levels of stress and anxiety.
[00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:57.860]   So they have a scale by which they measure that.
[00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:03.940]   And so basically 25% of Hong Kong youth are living at the highest levels of stress and
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:04.940]   anxiety.
[00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:11.860]   I'm going to step a little bit to the side so you can see this here good.
[00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:18.660]   But perhaps more importantly, the suicide situation among youth is alarming.
[00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:23.780]   In a recent survey by Save the Children Hong Kong, they pointed out that the suicide rate
[00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:32.140]   amongst every 100,000 youth between the ages of 15 and 24 had jumped from a rate from 6.2
[00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:40.660]   to 12.2 in 2014 to 12.2 in 2022.
[00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:44.280]   So pretty much that rate has doubled.
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:50.940]   And so our youth have been under increasing stress and not having ways of knowing how
[00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:54.660]   to cope or having the support that they need.
[00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:59.100]   Now I used to be a youth pastor in the city.
[00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:02.900]   And I once hosted in Germany actually youth from Hong Kong.
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:08.300]   And during that time, it was like one of those things when you're on a trip, sometimes you
[00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:12.100]   just really open up more than in other times.
[00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:17.420]   And half the youth from this youth group shared that they had thought about committing suicide
[00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:19.140]   or had attempted.
[00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:20.140]   Half.
[00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:24.980]   And this was even from a church.
[00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:26.780]   So I just want to say this.
[00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:32.100]   These are not like, I'm not just rattling off statistics.
[00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:33.900]   And I know you feel the same.
[00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:37.660]   You've been feeling it this past year with the news that we've been receiving about what's
[00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:38.660]   happening.
[00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:44.380]   Maybe you're a teacher at a school where a student has taken his life.
[00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:49.740]   And so this, I mean, this is a real crisis and this is heavy.
[00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:57.740]   Now in November 2023, there's some data provided from the Hong Kong Jockey Club Center for
[00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:00.740]   Suicide Research and Prevention.
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:05.340]   And noted at least 37 students in Hong Kong have taken their own lives since the beginning
[00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:06.340]   of that year.
[00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:12.700]   And along with this number are approximately 269 who were able to save themselves, but
[00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:14.060]   had attempted suicide.
[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:15.900]   And then this is just the ones we knew about.
[00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:19.580]   And then there's also all those who have thought about it and the ones that are not being reported
[00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:21.500]   on.
[00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:27.380]   So we can say that there is an overwhelming mental health crisis among teenagers, but
[00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:31.460]   also overall in this population in the city.
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:38.860]   And there is helplessness, people are feeling lost, feeling hopeless, there's despair.
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:44.380]   So this is a real challenge and this is heavy.
[00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:49.980]   Now besides mental health crisis, there's also growing economic disparity.
[00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:54.500]   Hong Kong for a very long time has had one of the biggest disparities between those who
[00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.900]   are wealthy and those who are poor.
[00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:01.840]   But during this time period, this disparity has only increased.
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:09.740]   So that means that those who are in the socioeconomic and the lower status of that in Hong Kong,
[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:14.120]   that for them to afford housing has become more difficult, and that the housing situations
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:24.820]   also whatever housing they can afford is usually not ideal and not really that suitable.
[00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:29.420]   So then due to political changes in the city, Hong Kong has also been having a declining
[00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:34.260]   population and the government is well aware that they also need to do things to invest.
[00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:41.980]   I think just this week, they announced plans of how to stimulate the economy and everything.
[00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:47.860]   So there's a need to bring in foreign talent and new investments into the city.
[00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:54.780]   And for local people, especially local youth under the age of 30, there's also a question,
[00:22:54.780 --> 00:23:00.540]   about the future of freedom of speech and expression.
[00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:06.620]   And also whether the one country, two system model will continue without any further and
[00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:08.740]   sudden changes.
[00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:11.020]   So there's a lot of uncertainty.
[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:16.540]   We just don't know what to expect and that causes anxiety and stress.
[00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:23.780]   So it's very clear that we're facing major challenges as a city.
[00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:30.300]   And when we're searching for answers, there hasn't been few and far in between.
[00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:35.160]   So we can put it another way, there is a lack of hope for the future.
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:40.060]   This has stripped joy and positivity out of Hong Kong for quite some time now.
[00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:44.260]   Now in our "Seek the Welfare of the City" sermon series, we've also been talking about
[00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:49.820]   this conversation where people say, "Should I stay or should I go?"
[00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:55.060]   And where we're living in this constant question, what does the future hold?
[00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:59.380]   And that can preoccupy us so much that it paralyzes us.
[00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:01.740]   That we're not able to be present.
[00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:07.980]   Present to our loved ones, present to God, present to what he has for us.
[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:13.940]   And so these trends that I just shared and the statistics, that's heavy.
[00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:16.780]   This is not something that's light.
[00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:27.340]   And so as a leadership, as we were praying over this, we felt that God wants to release
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:30.280]   joy over the city.
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:37.580]   That he wants to turn this lament, this disorientation and despair, that he wants to release hope
[00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:44.820]   through his church.
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:54.180]   And he wants Hong Kong to once again be a shining light of God's presence in China,
[00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:55.180]   but also in the world.
[00:24:55.180 --> 00:25:00.660]   Now I don't know about you, have you heard anyone, do you hear anyone talk like this
[00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:03.080]   about Hong Kong recently?
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:09.440]   That Hong Kong is going to be a shining light in China because of God's presence among the
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:15.220]   people in Hong Kong and in this world?
[00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:19.220]   Now this is not the first time that God has stepped into a situation, has stepped into
[00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:22.260]   a city and has turned around its fortune.
[00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:26.100]   And so what we're going to do today is we're going to look at the book of Zachariah, which
[00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:28.740]   is one of the prophetic books.
[00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:30.860]   Israel has just been brought back from exile.
[00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:34.780]   They've been there for 70 years.
[00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:41.560]   And upon returning, they're resettling the cities, but they're really struggling to find
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:48.000]   their way forward because that time in exile was disorienting.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.040]   Their life was totally shaken up and it also was over such a long time period, you know,
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:58.680]   that they're struggling to find ground underneath their feet.
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:09.380]   And so Zachariah's prophecy comes about 20 years after the exiles have returned.
[00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:14.640]   And while they're still struggling with all of the impact of all of that, and it makes
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:17.100]   me think of Hong Kong here.
[00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:22.380]   For the last three, four years, there's been protests, there's been COVID, there's been
[00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:27.160]   all the economic things happening that have deeply impacted, you know, how we as a city
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.500]   have been feeling.
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:34.240]   And we've been struggling to know how should we navigate the future?
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:37.500]   You know, how should we move forward?
[00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:44.460]   And it's the same situation in Babylon, where they do not know how to face the future.
[00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:47.580]   They do not know how to move forward.
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:52.520]   And into the situation, God speaks through the prophet Zachariah.
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:58.380]   And he speaks into the despair, he speaks into the uncertainty, and he speaks to his
[00:26:58.380 --> 00:26:59.380]   people.
[00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:04.760]   And perhaps today, and I believe today, God wants to speak to us who ourselves are maybe
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:08.320]   feeling some of those feelings.
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:10.740]   And he wants to speak into our situation as well.
[00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:17.180]   So let's turn to Zachariah 8, we're starting in verse 18, it says this, "The word of the
[00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:19.480]   Lord Almighty came to me.
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:25.260]   This is what the Lord Almighty says, the feast of the fourth, fifth, seventh, and tenth months
[00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:31.300]   will become joyful and glad occasions and happy festivals for Judah.
[00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.860]   Therefore love, truth and peace.
[00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:38.320]   This is what the Lord Almighty says, many peoples and the inhabitants of many cities
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:41.380]   will yet come.
[00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:46.060]   And the inhabitants of one city will go to another and say, let us go at once to entreat
[00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:48.540]   the Lord and seek the Lord Almighty.
[00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:55.420]   I myself am going and many peoples and powerful nations will come to Jerusalem to seek the
[00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:58.180]   Lord Almighty and to entreat him.
[00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:00.260]   This is what the Lord Almighty says.
[00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:07.300]   In those days, 10 people from all languages and nations would take a firm hold of one
[00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:15.140]   Jew by the hem of his robe and say, let us go with you because we have heard God is with
[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:18.020]   you."
[00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:23.740]   Now the first thing that I want to highlight from the passage I just read is that God says
[00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:29.500]   through Zachariah to his people that the fast that they've been observing needs to change.
[00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:31.740]   Now let me give you a little bit of background on that.
[00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:37.500]   So during exile, the Israelites, they chose four months where they're fasting, where they're
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:44.940]   mourning, where they're repenting of their sins, but where they're also lamenting their
[00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:45.940]   circumstances.
[00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:49.500]   They're crying out to God, "God, when is this going to change?
[00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:53.280]   When is this going to be different?"
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:29:04.180]   And so God is now saying that these fasts, they're going to turn from these times of
[00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:12.500]   mourning and times of lamenting, they're going to be turned into times of joy and festivals.
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:19.980]   And so in verse 18, he says, "It will become joyful and glad occasions and happy festivals
[00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:20.980]   for Judah."
[00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:25.220]   I mean, that is a 180 turnaround.
[00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:27.620]   That's like one thing that God does.
[00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:32.500]   You know, in Psalms talks about that he turns our mourning into dancing, that God has the
[00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:37.860]   power to meet us in our circumstances and to turn them around.
[00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:43.740]   He doesn't do that just individually, but he also can do that for a people, for a city,
[00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:49.980]   that he can change and turn around the circumstance.
[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:56.060]   So he's shifting the expectations for the future and is wanting to turn lamenting to
[00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:57.060]   joy.
[00:29:57.060 --> 00:30:02.780]   Now, and I believe this is part of God's vision for Hong Kong as well.
[00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:06.780]   What has happened in our city in the past four years has been really hard, but I believe
[00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:11.940]   God is calling us for a shift in our spirit, in our city.
[00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:17.620]   He wants the people of Hong Kong to know what joy is once again.
[00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:21.700]   This doesn't mean we're going to ignore the challenges and the problems that are there
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:24.020]   and that do need addressing.
[00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:25.740]   They do.
[00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:32.500]   But what it means is we face these challenges from a position of expectation and hope, because
[00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:34.740]   God gives us hope.
[00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:42.340]   And with God, we can face these challenges differently and we can have a different outlook.
[00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:48.340]   So God wants to use us, his church in Hong Kong, to restore joy and hope to our city.
[00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:52.660]   Now how might God use the church to help facilitate this shift?
[00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:56.460]   And how is that supposed to work?
[00:30:56.460 --> 00:31:02.420]   Well let's take a look at what God says in Zechariah 8, verse 23.
[00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:07.820]   This is what the Lord Almighty says, "In those days, ten people from all languages and nations
[00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:15.940]   will take a firm hold of one Jew by the hem of his robe and say, 'Let us go with you,
[00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:19.620]   because we have heard that God is with you.'"
[00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:28.380]   Now I love this imagery of grabbing on and taking a hold of the hem of the robe.
[00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:37.180]   And so what God is saying, that there is something about the Jewish people that the others around
[00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:42.620]   them could see that they know God.
[00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:47.380]   There's something that they have to offer that they themselves don't have.
[00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:53.460]   There's a hope that they have that they themselves don't have, that only God can provide.
[00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:59.660]   And so only when you're desperate, when you're in a difficult situation, do you grab onto
[00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:01.660]   the hem of the robe of someone.
[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:07.960]   You don't, I mean, if somebody would just randomly do that, like what are you doing?
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:14.300]   But this is a beautiful image of people just holding on, you know, because they know, they
[00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:16.820]   see hope.
[00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:18.700]   They see that God is with you.
[00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:26.220]   They see that there is something about you, you know, that you can lead them to a place
[00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:28.940]   that is different than the place that they find themselves in.
[00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:35.260]   There is something different in perspective that you have, and they're like, you know,
[00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:36.380]   they want to know what this is about.
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:40.840]   And so they grab a hold of you.
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:42.820]   So what does this mean for us as a church?
[00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:48.940]   Well, if God is calling Hong Kong back to joy and back to hope, then it's the church
[00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:52.940]   that becomes his main vehicle for this message.
[00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:59.540]   Indeed, if the church doesn't rise up in this occasion, who else will?
[00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:03.220]   This is kind of like you can say, this is our time.
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:08.740]   Right now, people are struggling, are hurting, they're disoriented, there's despair.
[00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:13.780]   And we as a people of God, we have hope because we know Jesus.
[00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:18.820]   So we have something to offer.
[00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:26.020]   And by the way, so the church is, it's God's plan.
[00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:30.700]   You know, it's not our idea, but it's always been God's plan to use the church.
[00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:34.420]   And by church doesn't mean, you know, our 1130 AM service.
[00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:35.420]   It means you.
[00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:39.100]   It means all of us.
[00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:44.900]   And he uses us to carry out his redemptive and his healing work.
[00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:48.900]   And that's always been God's plan, you know, biblically and theologically.
[00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:49.900]   And so we are his plan.
[00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:53.620]   Now, sometimes we downplay who we are and we don't embrace our role.
[00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:58.740]   But God has given us a role and it's time for us to rise and embrace our role as a church,
[00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:00.300]   as a people of God.
[00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:03.300]   Last week, Pastor John talked about being salt and light.
[00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:04.300]   It's also identity.
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:06.380]   It's part of identity.
[00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:11.260]   It's time to embrace that identity, to be salt and light as a people.
[00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:14.620]   And that means, it doesn't mean us as an organization.
[00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:20.980]   Of course, we want to do that as an organization, but it means us as people, the people of God.
[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:27.020]   Now, we believe this is a prophetic imagery for us, for the Vininglong and how we can
[00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:30.300]   understand our role as church in the city in the season.
[00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:40.100]   The church is the hem of the robe of Jesus in the city.
[00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:43.540]   That's why I needed to wear a jacket today.
[00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:46.540]   We usually wear one on Sundays, but...
[00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:52.940]   And like the robes of Jewish people in Judaism that needed to be present in the marketplace,
[00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:58.900]   the public places, in the city so people could take a firm hold of them, we as a church,
[00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:02.320]   we need to be present in those spaces as well.
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:05.340]   When I look at you and I just think, "Wow."
[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:08.320]   You know, you work at different places.
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:10.300]   Some of you probably work in Hong Kong Island.
[00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:11.300]   Some of you work here.
[00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:13.920]   Some of you work in your home.
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:15.500]   You live in different locations.
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:23.540]   Just even in this room, we inhabit so many different spheres of influence in Hong Kong.
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:32.100]   We are the hem of the robe of Jesus in the city that people can grab a hold on, and we
[00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:36.260]   are meant to have a presence in the places that God has placed us in.
[00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:39.700]   It's no coincidence that God has you where He has you.
[00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:46.180]   And it's up for us now to embrace this role in the cedars.
[00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:47.180]   It needs to see the church.
[00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:51.940]   It doesn't need to see our 11.30 AM gathering, even though that's nice if they see this.
[00:35:51.940 --> 00:36:02.300]   But what they need to see is our love, our hope, our care, our embrace, our serving in
[00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:06.740]   those spheres of influence, in those places.
[00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:11.980]   This is where the river model vision that Pastor Ivan was introducing and talking about
[00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:12.980]   comes in.
[00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:17.620]   Because instead of understanding ourselves as this building or church, as a building
[00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:24.500]   or a space, we're understanding ourselves as a river flowing all over Hong Kong.
[00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:29.820]   And you are part of that river that is flowing all over the city, watering a weary and a
[00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:36.620]   dry land with a gospel of peace and a gospel of hope.
[00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:42.300]   And that happens whenever we intentionally follow Jesus in the places where He has placed
[00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:43.300]   us.
[00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:51.060]   Wherever we carry His character, the river is flowing.
[00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:58.100]   And people can grab onto the hem of the robe because they can see there is something about
[00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:00.780]   you that you have.
[00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:05.700]   God is with you.
[00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:12.620]   And you can help them and connect them with God and lead them to God.
[00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:14.700]   So think of it this way.
[00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:21.020]   If God's vision for Hong Kong is to turn lament into joy and bring back to the city hope for
[00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:27.780]   a good future, then this is the vision for the Vining Lawn, to be a church present in
[00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:35.260]   every sphere of society, filled with people who know God and who want to make Him known,
[00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:43.740]   who are visible, hopeful, joyful, courageous, and loving.
[00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:48.940]   Now it's important sometimes when I talk about you are the church, you're the salt of the
[00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:54.580]   earth, you're the light, it can be quite intimidating because we're like, well, I'm not, I don't
[00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:55.580]   know what to say.
[00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:56.580]   I'm not perfect.
[00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:58.580]   I know my own life.
[00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:02.340]   I'm not fully who Jesus wants me to be yet.
[00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:07.380]   But know that in this passage from Zachariah, it doesn't say that the Jewish people were
[00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:12.660]   perfect people, but it was people who knew God.
[00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:19.980]   You know God.
[00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:25.540]   So you can be the hem of His robe, of Jesus in the city.
[00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:31.940]   It's not about perfection, but it's about you being available, God, and God using you.
[00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:35.540]   This is also one of the reasons why I've been focusing this year on fresh encounters with
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:40.780]   Jesus, because when you have a fresh encounter with Jesus, people can sense that, they can
[00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:42.320]   feel that.
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:48.580]   When you have intimacy with Jesus, they can tell there's something different about you.
[00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:56.900]   And at one point or another, either you bring it up, they bring it up, it just comes up.
[00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:06.840]   And people will say, you know, we heard God is with you, or I can see God is with you.
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:14.660]   So God will work through His church in the city, through His people.
[00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:21.180]   Now the church is God's chosen instrument, eternal, ament in the joy, fear into faith,
[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:27.220]   despair into hope, darkness into light.
[00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:28.980]   Don't underestimate your role.
[00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:29.980]   We play it down.
[00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:32.640]   The enemy wants us to play it down.
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:35.480]   Don't underestimate your role.
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:36.480]   You are the church.
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:38.540]   You are the people of God.
[00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:40.440]   You are the light.
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:44.820]   You know Jesus.
[00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:49.980]   So it's time for us to embrace our role, so we can be the hem of the robe of Jesus in
[00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:50.980]   the city.
[00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:54.740]   So people can grab a hold of it.
[00:39:54.740 --> 00:40:03.300]   Now it's no accident that God has planted the viney long in this location at this time
[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:06.040]   and has a call for us.
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.260]   And we get to encourage each other.
[00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:10.020]   And thus you don't have to do this journey on your own.
[00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:12.860]   That's why we gather here together and encourage each other to strengthen each other.
[00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:15.780]   That's why you have community groups to encourage each other, strengthen each other.
[00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:27.860]   And what it means to reflect Jesus in these different spheres of influence.
[00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:33.360]   So you and I were the hem of the robe of Jesus in the city.
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:42.080]   So today, on Vision Sunday, I'm asking you to give boldly and courageously because you
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:50.500]   believe the church has a contribution to make, turning lamented joy and despair into hope
[00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:56.580]   for a good future of the city.
[00:40:56.580 --> 00:41:04.860]   And so your offering today, whatever you're giving, goes 100% to what we do in here, but
[00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:08.080]   also what we do through us.
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:12.780]   Our giving goal for Vision Sunday this year is 400,000 Hong Kong dollars.
[00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:14.340]   Now that's a faith and a stretch goal.
[00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:22.220]   Ivan and I were praying and conversing, but it will help us to continue to expand the
[00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:25.460]   work that God has entrusted us with.
[00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:31.180]   And it's also an investment in the future, what God wants to continue to do through us,
[00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:34.060]   through his church, through his people in Hong Kong.
[00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:38.660]   So let me tell you a little bit about how these 400,000 Hong Kong dollars, how they
[00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:40.420]   will be used.
[00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:45.500]   Your giving strengthens the work of Kids for Christ and raising up the next generation
[00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:46.500]   of faith.
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:54.820]   Your offering helps us to serve the wider community by offering our workshops, our parenting
[00:41:54.820 --> 00:42:00.980]   workshops and focus on the mental health of children and equip parents, probably for their
[00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:06.340]   own mental health as well, to learn how to deal and serve and care for the mental health
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:08.500]   of their children.
[00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:12.300]   And so we want to make this available to, and we have made this available to the public.
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:14.820]   We're going to run four of these, two in English, two in Cantonese.
[00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:17.420]   The first one is in Cantonese this Saturday.
[00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:21.920]   If you haven't signed up and you speak Cantonese, I encourage you to sign up for it.
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:25.780]   But that is one way that we want to serve the community.
[00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:32.260]   We want to equip people and just lift people up.
[00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:37.540]   We also will launch a youth group this year to serve the relational, spiritual and emotional
[00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:40.300]   needs of our youth.
[00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:42.140]   Now we have some teenagers in the church.
[00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:45.820]   Some of them come, some of them don't come because right now we don't have a specific
[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:49.600]   space or group for them.
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:58.920]   And our heart is that we can create a safe space for them to explore faith, to be encouraged,
[00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:01.480]   to have peers to journey with.
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:05.640]   And so we're looking to start a youth group this year.
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:09.280]   We also will continue to develop our partnership with Oasis.
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:12.840]   This is the Vine Counseling and Psychotherapy Center.
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:17.600]   We already have them use our space and see clients.
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:20.880]   We want to continue to develop our relationship with them as well.
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:24.320]   They also have workshops and different things they can offer.
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:30.560]   And so we believe that this will allow us to address this mental health crisis, to do
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:36.400]   our part in that in the city through these efforts.
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:39.760]   YouGiving also is about strengthening the work we do through Alpha.
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:45.120]   I just had a lovely conversation about Alpha right before coming up here.
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:49.740]   If you haven't participated in Alpha, it's incredible.
[00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:53.440]   Right now, since I've been sick, I'm not fully updated, so I probably better don't say anything
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:55.960]   specific that's wrong.
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:44:03.160]   But I know there's been, people are just blessed by this space of exploring who Jesus is and
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:08.360]   having a casual time where they can ask questions, share their thoughts, and it's amazing.
[00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:10.760]   So you're continuing to help us do that work.
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:15.480]   You're also helping us to continue to partner with Branches of Hope, develop new partnerships
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:22.440]   to serve the underprivileged, underserved in our city, those who are struggling perhaps
[00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:27.640]   in terms of housing and just providing for the most very basic needs for their families.
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:32.320]   And so we also are expanding that work.
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:39.600]   And the way we're doing that is through having two mission partners as a church this year.
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:42.800]   We want to identify two mission partners, not as a process.
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:50.320]   There has to be vision alignment in that, but that means we support them financially,
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:55.160]   we support them spiritually, and we also want to collaborate with them where that's appropriate.
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:58.820]   Sometimes that's not appropriate, but we want to do it if we can.
[00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:04.480]   And so we're praying over and discerning who we can partner with.
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:09.440]   And that's also a way of reaching further into the city and serving different groups
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:14.880]   of people in powerful ways.
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:20.440]   So we're inviting you now to make an investment in the city you're living in through the church
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:23.840]   that you are planted in.
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:26.360]   And every amount you give today, it counts.
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:31.240]   I don't want anyone to feel ashamed for what they give.
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:34.160]   You know, if it's $10, that's amazing.
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:36.540]   If it's more, that's amazing.
[00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:40.720]   But I just do want to encourage everyone, if you consider this your home church, to
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:41.720]   make an offering.
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:48.200]   And the beauty of it is that we all get to do this together, continue to build what God
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:54.640]   has entrusted us with, seeking the welfare of this city, investing in the city, and seeing
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:56.880]   lament turned into joy.
[00:45:56.880 --> 00:46:00.000]   So right now I want to invite the worship team to come up.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:06.040]   I also want to invite everyone to stand.
[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:14.960]   And so this is how we're going to do our offering time for Vision Sunday offering.
[00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:17.240]   We'll do it during worship.
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:21.280]   So whenever you feel ready, there are different ways you can give.
[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:26.200]   There are envelopes on your seats.
[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:32.800]   There are two tables, one on your right, one on your left, where you can drop off checks
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:33.800]   or cash offerings.
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:37.120]   There's also digital codes for digital giving.
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:38.560]   They're also on your envelope as well.
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:41.960]   So whenever you're ready to do that during worship, you just do it.
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:45.920]   And then at some point in time, we'll close this time of worship.
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:50.000]   But I would like to just pray for us as we enter this time of worship.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:55.080]   Jesus, we thank you for all that you have been doing.
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:47:00.420]   We thank you for speaking to us about investing in the city.
[00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:07.160]   We thank you that you use us, your people, to be the hem of your robe in the city, that
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:10.320]   people can grab hold onto, a lifeline.
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:15.960]   When people are feeling despair and there's a need for hope, when there is deep just pain
[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:20.200]   and sorrow and there's a need for your joy that only you can give, when there's a lack
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:26.160]   of peace and you're the only one who can give us peace.
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:33.840]   And so, Lord, we pray that you use us in the city in this way, that you use this offering
[00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:39.800]   that we are taking up today as part of our worship to you, that it will help us to carry
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:41.560]   out this work.
[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:44.680]   And so we love you, Jesus, and we entrust all this to you.
[00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:47.280]   And I pray this in your name, Jesus.
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:48.280]   Amen.
[00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:48.480]   Let's worship.
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:51.840]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
