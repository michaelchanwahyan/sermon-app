1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,380
 400 years of silence.

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:09,180
 400 years of a people waiting in anticipation

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,480
 and expectation that God would speak,

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,480
 and yet 400 years of nothingness,

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,160
 a dryness, a prophetic wilderness, if you will.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,060
 400 years of the absence of something

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,360
 when something was so needed.

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,960
 This 400 years of silence is the backdrop

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,600
 to the narrative of the New Testament,

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,180
 to the beginning of the story about the birth of Jesus.

11
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,980
 This idea that there was 400 years

12
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,940
 since God had last spoken.

13
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,580
 He had last spoken through his prophet Malachi.

14
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:50,160
 400 years previous, Malachi had gotten the word of God,

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,260
 and Malachi had stood before all of God's people

16
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:57,420
 in that day and said, "Don't worry, a new time is coming."

17
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,280
 Malachi began to say, "Hey, a prophet will come

18
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,680
 "in the future, one who will look like Elijah,

19
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,200
 "and this prophet, he will bring God's word,

20
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,820
 "and it'll be like God will turn the hearts

21
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,300
 "of the children to the father,

22
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,360
 "and the hearts of the father to the children,

23
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,740
 "and there'll be this reconciliation and redemption

24
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:19,500
 "that God will move like he's never moved before."

25
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,800
 And for a group of people who had just come out

26
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,400
 of 70 years of exile in Babylon,

27
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,140
 who had come back into the promised land

28
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,880
 and had realized that their sin had taken them into exile,

29
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,220
 a group of people who were longing and realizing

30
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,760
 that redemption would never be found in themselves,

31
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,620
 but would only be found if God acted again.

32
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:42,320
 Here's Malachi telling them that God is on the move,

33
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,220
 that God is about to bring a word

34
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,640
 that will literally change the hearts

35
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,860
 of everyone in this world.

36
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,000
 You can almost sense at the end of the Old Testament

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,880
 that all of Israel is on its tippy toes,

38
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,020
 leaning forward in excitement and anticipation

39
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,320
 for God to speak.

40
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,320
 And then this.

41
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,320
 (crickets chirping)

42
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,060
 Crickets.

43
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:17,100
 Nothing for 400 years.

44
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:22,960
 400 years of silence.

45
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,140
 I don't know what you're like

46
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,600
 when you're waiting for God to speak.

47
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,300
 I wonder how you are

48
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,020
 when your prayers don't seem to go answered.

49
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,660
 I wonder what it's like for you

50
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,900
 when you wrestle with the reality

51
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,780
 that you've been asking God for something

52
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,700
 and it doesn't seem to be like God is present.

53
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:48,040
 Today we start Advent.

54
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,780
 And Advent is the idea of a season

55
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,120
 of four Sundays before Christmas.

56
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,900
 Advent is the Latin word that means coming.

57
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,740
 And literally what Advent is,

58
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:04,740
 it's a time to prepare ourselves for the coming of Jesus.

59
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,980
 Note that I did not say,

60
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,600
 prepare ourselves for the coming of Christmas.

61
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,700
 Because this is what we often turn Advent into

62
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,140
 in the global church.

63
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,500
 We turn it into four weeks

64
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,700
 to be able to get ready for the celebration of Christmas Day.

65
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,360
 We cover our buildings in Christmas decorations.

66
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,480
 In fact, I wonder if you've been coming to the Vine

67
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,340
 for a while,

68
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,860
 whether you'll notice the distinct lack

69
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,700
 of Christmas decorations today.

70
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,740
 Normally on this first Sunday of Advent,

71
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,400
 we cover this building in fairy lights

72
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,740
 and tinsels and Christmas trees.

73
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,460
 We start to sing carols

74
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,380
 and we celebrate the reality

75
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,920
 that Jesus was born in a stable.

76
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,660
 Now don't worry, we have not canceled Christmas.

77
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,060
 COVID will not take Christmas from us.

78
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,160
 Can I have an amen?

79
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,420
 (congregation cheering)

80
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,460
 We will be open in Jesus name,

81
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,960
 prophetically for Christmas Day.

82
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,800
 We'll see.

83
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:08,160
 But Advent,

84
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,720
 Advent isn't about preparing for tinsels

85
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,400
 and Christmas trees and fairy lights.

86
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,360
 Advent is about preparing your life for more of Jesus.

87
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,040
 Advent sticks itself right in there

88
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,400
 and disrupts us in the most commercial of seasons.

89
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,080
 Advent cries out for us to slow down.

90
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,100
 Advent is like driving a wedge

91
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,160
 between the anticipation we have in our heart

92
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,560
 for all those great gifts on Christmas Day

93
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:45,020
 and the reality that our hearts might need to change.

94
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,080
 Advent is disruptive and difficult,

95
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,700
 hard to grapple with.

96
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,320
 I wonder if you could imagine what it would have been like

97
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,760
 for the Israelites in that moment,

98
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,200
 trying to grapple themselves with the reality

99
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,640
 that they so desperately want God to act

100
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,000
 and yet he seems to be so far away.

101
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,080
 Advent gives us a chance

102
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,640
 to do some work on our hearts

103
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,640
 and to ask ourselves some deep and important questions

104
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:21,420
 even in the middle of the commercialism of Christmas.

105
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,960
 Questions such as these.

106
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,560
 Am I truly ready for Jesus to come again to this world?

107
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,160
 I mean, am I truly desiring for him to return?

108
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:36,160
 And with this, am I ready to hear what he has to say to me,

109
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,560
 to us?

110
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:44,920
 Am I ready to hear what God wants to say to me, to us?

111
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:52,020
 Israel was not ready to hear what God was about to say.

112
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,080
 I mean, could you imagine it?

113
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,160
 400 years of silence, 400 years of waiting

114
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,160
 really can harden your heart, can't it?

115
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,160
 400 years of being then embedded

116
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,560
 in a most oppressive Greco-Roman empire.

117
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,600
 By the time of the start of the narrative

118
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,080
 of the birth of Jesus in the New Testament,

119
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,760
 God's people had been waiting a long time

120
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,480
 and they had changed as a people.

121
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,440
 In fact, in the opening page of the New Testament,

122
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,320
 what you see in Israel is a divided

123
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,760
 and fractured people of God.

124
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,400
 There are essentially four types of people

125
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,320
 at the moment of Jesus's birth in Israel.

126
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,440
 The first were called Essence.

127
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,520
 And the Essence believed that the way to get God

128
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,240
 to speak again was to get themselves

129
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,960
 out of the ugliness of society,

130
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,360
 to retreat into the wilderness and simply pray.

131
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,720
 And if they could pray enough, purify them enough

132
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,440
 outside of the horrors of society, God might speak again.

133
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,680
 Then there were the Zealots.

134
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,280
 The Zealots believed that the way that you get God to speak

135
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,640
 is you blow stuff up.

136
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,000
 I mean, you fight the Romans, you bring revolution.

137
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,160
 That revolution is the thing

138
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,940
 that will get God to say something again.

139
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,140
 The Pharisees were embedded into the heart of society,

140
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,760
 but they believed that when God was to speak,

141
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,800
 it would come only if they could adhere

142
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,200
 to the Mosaic law as best as possible,

143
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,800
 because they realized that it was the absence of the law,

144
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,120
 it was disobedience to the law

145
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,040
 that brought them into exile in Babylon.

146
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,760
 So now if they could just be as perfect

147
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:31,340
 with the law as possible, maybe God would speak again.

148
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,840
 The Sadducees decided that the best way

149
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,240
 to get God to speak would be to integrate

150
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,360
 with the Greek Roman Empire.

151
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,400
 I mean, this empire is here,

152
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,840
 it doesn't seem to be going anywhere.

153
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,400
 If we could just partner with them,

154
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,000
 if we could come alongside of them,

155
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,280
 do some deals with them,

156
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,960
 maybe we'll get better freedoms on ourselves,

157
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,440
 and maybe if we're so nice to everybody,

158
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,980
 God might speak again.

159
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,960
 I wonder what you're like

160
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,040
 when you're waiting for God to speak.

161
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,180
 I wonder if you think the best way

162
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,400
 is just to remove yourself from everybody and pray.

163
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,660
 I wonder if you think it's to fight.

164
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,280
 I wonder if you think it's just

165
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,720
 to try to be a perfect Christian,

166
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,360
 maybe God will answer that prayer.

167
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,120
 I wonder whether it might be some compromise in your life

168
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,400
 when you're waiting for God to speak.

169
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,320
 Here's Israel, crying out, waiting,

170
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,020
 and here's the reality.

171
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:23,320
 They were not prepared for Jesus.

172
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,600
 They did not expect a pregnant virgin.

173
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,600
 They did not expect the manger in a stable

174
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,120
 in a place called Bethlehem.

175
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,280
 They had no idea what was ahead of them.

176
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,120
 With the ministry of Jesus Christ,

177
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,160
 the healings He would do, the miracles He would do,

178
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,400
 they had no concept of the coming kingdom of God.

179
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,080
 They could not understand the reality of a death on a cross

180
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,300
 and the profundity of a resurrection just three days later.

181
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,960
 I mean, Israel was so steeped

182
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,920
 in the hardness of their hearts

183
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,520
 that they could not ever understand

184
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,800
 what was about to happen in the person of Jesus.

185
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,640
 And so what Israel needed was a disruption.

186
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,480
 What Israel needed was a change of heart.

187
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,560
 They needed God to come and do something,

188
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,400
 to drive a wedge in them,

189
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,200
 to rip them out of their complacency

190
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,260
 and help them to begin to think again afresh on God.

191
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,400
 What Israel needed is what I think

192
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:23,400
 we also need here in 2020, and that is Advent.

193
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:31,480
 Advent sits for us in scripture around a particular person.

194
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:35,300
 This person is the epitome of what Advent is all about.

195
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,020
 His name is John the Baptist.

196
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,620
 Now, I don't know what you think about

197
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,740
 when you think of John the Baptist.

198
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,300
 It's probably not this image on the screen right now,

199
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,620
 although this is a beautiful painting

200
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,740
 of John the Baptist from church history.

201
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,220
 But the John the Baptist you're probably aware of

202
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,980
 is the Sunday school version of John the Baptist,

203
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,480
 the one who lives in the desert,

204
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,540
 who has unkempt and long hair, the one who eats locusts.

205
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,740
 I have done all three of those things in my life.

206
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,900
 I just want you to know.

207
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,300
 I've never done them at the same time,

208
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,600
 but I have done all three.

209
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,620
 And here's John the Baptist,

210
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:13,620
 the most unlikely of sources who is about to step in

211
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:18,620
 and bring the disruption that Israel so needed.

212
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,980
 And what we want to do here at the Vine

213
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,420
 over these four Sundays leading up to Christmas

214
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,960
 is we want to show you the life

215
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,020
 and the ministry of John the Baptist.

216
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,340
 In fact, what we want to do is show you

217
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,680
 the four movements of his ministry.

218
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,820
 John actually has four movements as he journeys Israel

219
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,940
 into a place of being prepared to receive Jesus.

220
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,420
 And so as we think about what is it for us

221
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,860
 to be able to receive Jesus from his birth

222
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:45,820
 and also be excited about his return in the second coming,

223
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,420
 I think we need to follow these movements once again

224
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,220
 of John's ministry.

225
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:55,340
 John issues a call to the people to respond.

226
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,460
 He welcomes and invites them into the desert.

227
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:01,380
 And in the desert place, he baptizes them.

228
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,840
 And then he releases them as followers of Jesus.

229
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:09,840
 A cool, a desert, the waters, the release.

230
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,240
 The four movements of John's ministry

231
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,680
 will become the backdrop to these four Sundays for us

232
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,280
 as we get closer and closer to that moment

233
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,680
 where we will celebrate the arrival of Jesus.

234
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,360
 But before we get there,

235
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,360
 may we find ourselves in his footsteps

236
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,860
 and may we step, step by step in getting prepared

237
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,980
 for the coming of Jesus.

238
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:36,880
 Is everybody okay?

239
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,660
 So I wanna take you on this journey today

240
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,300
 with the call that he brings to Israel

241
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,780
 because I believe it is a call

242
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,300
 that resounds afresh for us today.

243
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,660
 I'm gonna start by showing you how Luke presents

244
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,840
 the opening elements of John's ministry

245
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,220
 from Luke chapter three, starting in verse one.

246
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,260
 By the way, I'm having so much fun right now.

247
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,060
 I just want you to know, I really love you all.

248
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,620
 And I really enjoy doing this.

249
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,020
 And I'm so glad you're here.

250
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,280
 And I'm so glad you're online.

251
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,660
 We're one big happy family.

252
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,340
 Amen?

253
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,160
 - Amen.

254
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,860
 - Okay.

255
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:17,060
 Luke chapter three, starting in verse one.

256
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,620
 In the 15th year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar,

257
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,980
 when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea,

258
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,700
 Herod, Tetrarch of Galilee,

259
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,060
 his brother Philip, Tetrarch of Etyria,

260
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,860
 and Trachytonus, and Lysnasus,

261
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,460
 I'm gonna murder all these words, by the way,

262
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,540
 Lynasus, Tetrarch of Abilene,

263
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:38,460
 during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas,

264
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:43,360
 the word of God, after 400 years,

265
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,220
 came to John, son of Zechariah, in the desert.

266
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,100
 He went into all the country around the Jordan,

267
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,780
 preaching a baptism of repentance

268
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,580
 for the forgiveness of sins.

269
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,500
 For as it is written in the book of the words

270
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,740
 of Isaiah the prophet,

271
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,500
 a voice of one calling in the desert,

272
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,580
 prepare the way for the Lord,

273
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,420
 make straight paths for him.

274
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,860
 Every valley should be filled in,

275
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,520
 every mountain and hill made low.

276
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,080
 The crooked roads will be made straight,

277
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,220
 and the rough ways smooth,

278
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:20,140
 so that all people will see God's salvation.

279
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:23,820
 Luke does a fascinating thing here

280
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,620
 when he wants to introduce the ministry of John the Baptist.

281
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:30,620
 He starts by naming no less than seven rulers.

282
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,740
 Now, Luke is a doctor and a historian,

283
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,300
 and he's passionate about making sure

284
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:39,380
 he puts all of his words into the context of history.

285
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,020
 But normally what Luke would do

286
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,580
 is name maybe one leader,

287
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,060
 or one moment of that history

288
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,580
 to help you to understand the time

289
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,940
 that that event took place.

290
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,060
 Nowhere in all of Luke's writings

291
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,820
 does he mention seven leaders back to back

292
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,540
 to help you to understand what Advent,

293
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,820
 what John the Baptist,

294
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,940
 and what this breaking in of God's word

295
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,060
 after 400 years is all about.

296
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:05,260
 These seven rulers are important to understand.

297
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,180
 Now, before we jump into that,

298
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,580
 I think if Luke was writing today,

299
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,500
 he would mention all the important rulers in our lives.

300
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,740
 If you're here from China,

301
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,820
 maybe Xi Jinping would be at the top of the list.

302
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,740
 If you're from the US,

303
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,900
 maybe it would be Donald Trump or Joe Biden,

304
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,060
 depending on whether it's December or January.

305
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,380
 Maybe if you're from the UK,

306
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,380
 it would be Boris Johnson's name at the top of that list.

307
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,660
 If you're a Hong Konger here,

308
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,900
 maybe Carrie Lam's name would be on top of that list.

309
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:34,660
 Luke would put this moment into the context of its history,

310
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:37,060
 and he's doing so because he wants to teach something

311
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,380
 specifically about what Advent is all about.

312
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,860
 So I wanna break down these seven people real quick for you

313
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,740
 to help you to understand what God's doing here.

314
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,860
 Is that okay?

315
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,420
 So the first one is Tiberius Caesar.

316
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,340
 This is the guy right at the top.

317
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,460
 This is the guy who's right at the head

318
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,180
 of the whole Greco-Roman Empire.

319
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,420
 That's where Luke starts.

320
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,940
 And the interesting thing about Tiberius Caesar

321
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,620
 was he was one of the harshest, strongest,

322
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,300
 most oppressive Caesars that there was

323
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,740
 in all of the Greco-Roman Empire.

324
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,620
 And Tiberius Caesar had done something.

325
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:12,060
 He had made Pontius Pilate the governor over Judea.

326
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,860
 In other words, the ruler over all of the Jewish people.

327
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,740
 Now, this name, Pontius Pilate,

328
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,220
 will be relatively familiar to you

329
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,700
 if you know the Christmas story

330
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,860
 or if you know Jesus' story.

331
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,260
 This is the guy who will eventually preside over the trial

332
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,740
 that Jesus is in at the end of his life.

333
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,700
 This is the one who will eventually release Jesus

334
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,100
 to the crowds so that Jesus could be crucified.

335
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,940
 Luke then tells us about two brothers.

336
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,460
 He tells us about Herod, the Tetrarch of Galilee,

337
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,620
 and his brother Philip,

338
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,140
 the Tetrarch of Aetiria and Trachonitis.

339
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,620
 Now, these two brothers are really important

340
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,940
 in the story of Jesus and John's life.

341
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,780
 Herod here is not the Herod the Great

342
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,860
 who was there at the birth of Jesus,

343
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,940
 the one who decreed that every male Jewish son

344
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,740
 under the age of two needed to be killed,

345
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,100
 the one who caused Jesus and Joseph and Mary

346
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:02,980
 to flee to Egypt.

347
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,020
 Not that Herod.

348
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,740
 That Herod was the father of this Herod.

349
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,140
 This is Herod Antipas.

350
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,620
 And Herod Antipas is the one

351
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,020
 who would eventually arrest John and put him in prison.

352
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,140
 This is the one who would eventually write

353
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:20,220
 the decree that would cause the beheading of John.

354
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,060
 Now that happens because of the next guy on the list, Philip.

355
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,220
 Philip is Herod's brother.

356
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,060
 By the way, stick with it.

357
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,940
 This is like "Game of Thrones" in a moment, okay?

358
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,980
 So just stick with this.

359
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,460
 You've got Herod, you've got Philip, his brother.

360
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,380
 Now, Philip's wife is Herodias.

361
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:38,060
 Herodias has an affair with Herod Antipas,

362
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:43,060
 his brother's, yeah, whatever, yeah, with that guy.

363
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,780
 They have an affair and it's not good.

364
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:50,020
 And John the Baptist is willing to speak truth to power.

365
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:53,500
 John the Baptist knows about this affair

366
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,700
 and he confronts Herod about it.

367
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,700
 And he says, "What you're doing with Herodias is wrong.

368
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,340
 "That's your brother's wife."

369
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:04,420
 And his willingness to speak truth to power

370
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,500
 ends up putting John in prison.

371
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,740
 And Herod will be the one who would decree

372
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,420
 that he needs to be beheaded,

373
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,180
 that he needs to die for the reality

374
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,780
 that he was willing to speak up

375
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,500
 for what was wrong in the leadership around him.

376
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,380
 Are you still with me?

377
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,660
 Now, Luke could have just stopped

378
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:23,140
 with the nasty, horrible Romans, but he doesn't.

379
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,900
 He then mentions two Jewish leaders.

380
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,700
 He mentions Annas and Caiaphas.

381
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,740
 These were both high priests

382
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,380
 in the time of John and Jesus' ministry.

383
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,700
 Both of them represent the power

384
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,100
 of the Jewish people at the time.

385
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:41,060
 They represent the rich Jewish elite of the days.

386
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:45,780
 And both Annas and Caiaphas had become incredibly wealthy

387
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,460
 off of the worship that was done in the temple.

388
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,140
 They had personally pocketed that money.

389
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:51,980
 Not only that,

390
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,340
 but they would eventually hold private trials against Jesus

391
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,540
 and they would be there mocking Jesus

392
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,580
 as he sent to the cross.

393
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,660
 Now, Annas and Caiaphas started the marketplace

394
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,060
 in the temple where the poor people would come

395
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,140
 to sell whatever they could

396
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,900
 in order to buy a sacrifice worthy

397
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,820
 to take into the temple to repent of their sins.

398
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,500
 In fact, that whole marketplace

399
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,980
 was known as Annas' Marketplace.

400
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,980
 And Annas and Caiaphas made a lot of money

401
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,140
 out of the profits that the poor people

402
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,500
 were bringing to buy sacrifices.

403
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,740
 This is the backdrop to when Jesus,

404
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,300
 in that last week of his life,

405
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,020
 triumphal entry into Jerusalem,

406
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,340
 goes straight to the temple.

407
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,300
 He makes a whip of cords and he turns over the tables

408
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,340
 and he whips the people.

409
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:39,580
 He spreads out and he busts out that marketplace

410
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,620
 because of the injustice that it stood for.

411
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,140
 Are you with me?

412
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,180
 So Luke wants you to know,

413
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,540
 right at the story of Advent,

414
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:49,140
 here are all the leaders that were in place.

415
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,460
 It's like Luke is laying out for us

416
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:54,100
 what the world's leadership looks like.

417
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,900
 Broken, corrupt, oppressive,

418
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,100
 profiting off the poor and the vulnerable.

419
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,700
 I mean, he just puts it straight out there.

420
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,540
 All the ones that are gonna have an impact on the death,

421
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,500
 both of John the Baptist and Jesus.

422
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,540
 It's like Luke is saying,

423
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:11,820
 this is the reality in which God begins to bring his word.

424
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,740
 Look at where humanity has gotten to,

425
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:17,060
 all of the oppression, all of the injustice,

426
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,260
 all of the corruption,

427
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,820
 both with the Gentiles and with the Jews.

428
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:25,500
 And into that, God brings his word.

429
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,220
 Now, this is the other fascinating thing.

430
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,140
 Notice in verse two.

431
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,820
 During the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas,

432
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,140
 the word of God came to Tiberius Caesar.

433
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,700
 No.

434
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,940
 Sorry, the word of God came to Herod Antipas.

435
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,660
 Okay, maybe the word of God

436
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,860
 would never have come to a Roman.

437
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,860
 Sure, I get that.

438
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,660
 So the word of God comes to Annas and Caiaphas,

439
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,340
 the high priest of the temple.

440
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:54,780
 The word of God comes to John,

441
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,780
 son of Zechariah in the desert.

442
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,860
 The word of God, in other words,

443
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:04,060
 having not spoken for 400 years,

444
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,540
 doesn't come into the corridors of power,

445
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,860
 but comes into the one that society had rejected.

446
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,260
 That the word of God falls upon the very one

447
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,460
 who was living in the wilderness,

448
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,460
 living in the wasteland,

449
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,980
 who had been rejected by his own people.

450
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,620
 The one who had the unkept hair

451
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,580
 and the eating of the locusts.

452
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,420
 The one who had privilege himself

453
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,380
 because he was the son of a priest,

454
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,300
 but who had given up that privilege,

455
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,340
 turned it aside, reversed it,

456
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,660
 was willing to become a servant of his people

457
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,860
 because he had a word to bring them.

458
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:36,020
 And in that place of wilderness, he would speak.

459
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,580
 And what Luke wants you to see

460
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,460
 is something that's so profoundly important about Advent.

461
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:46,780
 That true power and influence and leadership

462
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:50,620
 does not reside in the corridors of prestige

463
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,220
 and privilege and patronage,

464
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:57,500
 but in the less traveled pathways of humility

465
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,700
 and holiness and honor.

466
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:04,740
 That's where the Lord's word comes.

467
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,460
 And maybe that's some good news for all of us.

468
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,500
 As we look at all the things

469
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,500
 that have been happening in the world this year,

470
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,700
 we look at the global reality that we have,

471
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,780
 it's a crisis of global leadership.

472
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,180
 Maybe we shouldn't be looking

473
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,420
 for those in the corridors of power

474
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,140
 to speak a word of God to us.

475
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:24,180
 Maybe that word resides in this room.

476
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:30,780
 Maybe Advent tells us that God speaks to those

477
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:37,620
 that have been rejected, those that are not loved,

478
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:42,180
 those that struggle with the realities of life.

479
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:47,180
 Advent is a welcomed gift to bring us closer to him.

480
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:53,300
 Now, what is the message that John brings

481
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,300
 from the margins to the people?

482
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,560
 Well, it says here in verse three,

483
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:03,060
 it says, "He went into all the country

484
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:07,260
 around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance

485
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,220
 for the forgiveness of sins."

486
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,100
 Stick with this church.

487
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,540
 400 years of silence.

488
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,060
 I don't know if I was God.

489
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,960
 I don't think I would start with this topic.

490
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,460
 Like if I was God, I would wanna come and go,

491
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,860
 yep, I've been silent for 400 years,

492
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,140
 but hey, I'm back and I wanna give you some hope.

493
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,180
 I wanna give you some life.

494
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,700
 I wanna tell you how awesome you are.

495
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,140
 I wanna speak encouragement into you.

496
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,140
 I wanna bring you into the flourishing of life.

497
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,460
 Oh, I've got so much to say to you.

498
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,260
 It's been 400 years, you're awesome.

499
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,780
 Like that's what I would do.

500
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:37,180
 What is it that God does?

501
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,980
 Here comes John from the margins.

502
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:41,460
 Somebody, everybody had cast out and he was forgotten.

503
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,620
 And he says, "Repent."

504
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:47,620
 He says, "There's sin in you,

505
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,580
 and that sin will block you

506
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,820
 from being able to see the arrival of Jesus.

507
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,420
 That sin will cause you not to be able to see

508
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,820
 the beautiful kingdom of God

509
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,060
 that is about to be released in the Messiah.

510
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,060
 That sin will hold you on the outside.

511
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,900
 Repent."

512
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:05,700
 This word repent in the Greek is the word metanoia.

513
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,940
 Metanoia means to turn around

514
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:13,460
 or it means to reorient yourself in a new direction.

515
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,340
 I love that.

516
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:19,100
 See, the repentance that John was bringing to his people

517
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,620
 was not to say sorry to God.

518
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:25,420
 He wasn't coming to his people and saying,

519
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,700
 "Hey, just say sorry to God.

520
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,260
 Just maybe feel a little bit bad about your sin."

521
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,980
 You know, or even he's not even just saying,

522
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,380
 "Confess your sin."

523
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,900
 And we've come as Christians to make those things

524
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,420
 what we think repentance is about.

525
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:42,180
 All of those things are involved in repentance,

526
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,900
 but the sum of them is not what repentance is.

527
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:48,140
 Because if you ask God to forgive you for your sin

528
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:51,060
 and make no effort to try to change your life

529
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:54,260
 away from that sin, in John's eyes, you've not repented.

530
00:23:55,780 --> 00:24:00,460
 'Cause repentance is a reorientation into another direction.

531
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:03,820
 Repentance comes from the lips,

532
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:06,700
 but it is made manifest in the fist,

533
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,580
 in the hand, in the working out,

534
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,420
 in the walking out of our lives.

535
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,540
 That's the repentance we're called to.

536
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,740
 It's not for the faint of heart.

537
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:20,620
 It means that we want to leave behind our life of sin.

538
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:24,020
 It means that we wanna actually live in a different way.

539
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:26,340
 And as Christmas comes in 2020,

540
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:30,540
 I wonder if the cry of Advent is relevant again for you.

541
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:33,900
 I wonder if you could hear this word coming to you

542
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:38,500
 that maybe there's an option right now, a time, a period,

543
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,300
 whereas we long for the coming of Jesus again,

544
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,140
 that we make sure that there's nothing in our lives

545
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,860
 that would cause us to miss Him.

546
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:53,180
 Maybe it's time for us to repent.

547
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,100
 Not just to say sorry,

548
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,540
 but actually to live a different way.

549
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:04,780
 But something I've noticed about this.

550
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:08,780
 See, I've noticed that John the Baptist's call

551
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,700
 of this idea that a Messiah is coming

552
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,580
 who will put an end to all sin forever,

553
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:16,580
 who will judge injustice and unrighteousness

554
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,420
 and call it out for what it will

555
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,380
 and actually change it and turn it and put an end to it.

556
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:25,020
 That message is not so frightening for the poor

557
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,700
 and the vulnerable and the oppressed of the earth

558
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,260
 as it is for those of us who have so much to lose.

559
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:34,180
 Come on, church.

560
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:37,260
 I put it to you that if you're super excited

561
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,700
 about that really nice present

562
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,180
 that your spouse is gonna give you for Christmas,

563
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,780
 that one that you've been asking about for ages

564
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,500
 and dropping hints and maybe writing things on the fridge

565
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,940
 and hoping that they might pay attention,

566
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,660
 that one that you've been talking about for so long

567
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,340
 and you know that they got the money and it's expensive.

568
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,380
 Yes, it's expensive,

569
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,820
 but it will bring you so much joy and you're so excited

570
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,540
 that that little present's gonna be under the tree

571
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,380
 on Christmas day.

572
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,700
 I put it to you that you're probably not that excited

573
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,500
 about the idea of praying for Jesus' return

574
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,900
 before Santa returns.

575
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:09,780
 Or maybe bring it home this way.

576
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:13,420
 Maybe you're in a business and you're running a business

577
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,820
 and your business is profiting

578
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:18,100
 off of some not so legal activities.

579
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,380
 I don't think you're gonna be as excited to hear a message

580
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:24,180
 about repentance of sin if you're profiting

581
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:27,140
 from that very thing we think of as sin.

582
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,820
 But what about this?

583
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:34,740
 What about the Christian who's in prison in China?

584
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:38,820
 What do you think the idea of repentance might mean for them?

585
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,940
 What about for that refugee or asylum seeker

586
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,500
 who's struggling to make ends meet in Yamate?

587
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,860
 What about for the one who's being oppressed or hurt

588
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,380
 or pulled down or discriminated

589
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,100
 because of the color of their skin

590
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,620
 or because of their gender?

591
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:54,780
 Maybe for them, the idea of a coming Messiah

592
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,500
 who will put all things right,

593
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,100
 maybe for them it's like honey on the lips.

594
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:04,100
 The idea of the call of Advent, Maranatha, come Lord Jesus,

595
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:07,460
 might be the difference of life and death for them.

596
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,900
 Maybe it's the poor and the vulnerable and the oppressed

597
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,820
 who need this the most.

598
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:16,740
 I put it to you that those of us who struggle

599
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:21,740
 with the idea of repentance are probably more in love

600
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,980
 with what it is that we have to lose

601
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,340
 than it is to the one that we might lose it to.

602
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,900
 Come on, church.

603
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:33,940
 That the call of Advent might remind us

604
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:41,380
 that we need to put our lives right

605
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,980
 because He is coming again.

606
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,580
 Because yeah, we look forward to that moment in the manger

607
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,300
 and the celebration of the reality

608
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,860
 of Him coming into this world.

609
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,460
 But the scriptures also tell us

610
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,940
 that He's gonna return again.

611
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,260
 And as He returns again, He's gonna put everything right.

612
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,500
 All injustice is changed.

613
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,100
 Everything's structurally moved.

614
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:02,660
 The whole kingdom of God seen for the fullness of its glory.

615
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,180
 And we stand in the middle

616
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,260
 between the first arrival in the manger

617
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,420
 and the coming again in the new Jerusalem.

618
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,940
 And what is on our hearts?

619
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,540
 Are we crying out and saying,

620
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:15,660
 I wanna live in a way that honors the arrival

621
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,820
 of the second coming of Christ?

622
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:22,820
 Or am I going to play myself more towards the very thing

623
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:26,780
 that might cause me to miss Him completely?

624
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:31,380
 This is why Luke then gives us the idea

625
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,820
 of what this change of heart looks like,

626
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:37,300
 of what the renewal of Advent really is

627
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,940
 with this passage from Isaiah, verse four.

628
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,500
 It says, "As it is written in the book

629
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,180
 "of the words of Isaiah the prophet,

630
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,940
 "a voice of one calling in the desert."

631
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,260
 This is John.

632
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,100
 "Prepare the way for the Lord.

633
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,540
 "Make straight paths for Him.

634
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,220
 "Every valley shall be filled in.

635
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,540
 "Every mountain will be made low.

636
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,420
 "The crooked roads become straight.

637
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,100
 "The rough ways made smooth.

638
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,500
 "All people will see God's salvation."

639
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,520
 Isaiah crying out some 700 years

640
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,980
 before John's beginning of his ministry.

641
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,900
 Foretells a time where one will come

642
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,460
 who will prepare the way.

643
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,180
 Prepare the way because the people needed

644
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:17,620
 to be disrupted from the hardness of their hearts.

645
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,260
 Prepare the way because the people needed

646
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,100
 to be changed to be able to see Jesus.

647
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,340
 And this one will come and here's what he will do.

648
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,760
 The way he will prepare the way

649
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,860
 is by making the path straight.

650
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:30,900
 Making those crooked ways now straight again.

651
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,480
 Removing the roughness from the path

652
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,140
 so that the King might come.

653
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:38,420
 See, this imagery is important for Isaiah

654
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:41,060
 because this imagery is some bunch of years

655
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,220
 before the Greco-Roman Empire

656
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,540
 and all the amazing kind of avenues of infrastructure

657
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,860
 that they created.

658
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,120
 In Isaiah's time, if a dignitary,

659
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,860
 if a king came to a town,

660
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,260
 they would send somebody in front of them

661
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,980
 to actually literally clear the path out the way

662
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:59,180
 'cause the roads weren't particularly good in those days.

663
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,080
 And so they would literally take the stones,

664
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,680
 the big stones that might knock the chariot out of the way

665
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,700
 and they'd pick them up and throw them away.

666
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:09,320
 If there were any ridges or kind of mounds like this,

667
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,900
 they would flatten down the mounds

668
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,820
 to make a straight, clear path

669
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:15,140
 so when the dignitary came in his chariot,

670
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:17,220
 he would be able to get to his destination

671
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,960
 where he was supposed to go.

672
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,780
 That's the imagery in Isaiah's mind

673
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,900
 and John picks up on that imagery

674
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,300
 and he says, "This is my calling.

675
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,220
 "This is my ministry.

676
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,460
 "This is what I'm here to do.

677
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,580
 "I'm here to make those crooked paths straight,

678
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,920
 "to take those stones away,

679
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,400
 "not from the physical roads anymore,

680
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,420
 "but from the crookedness,

681
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:37,060
 "the hardness of our hearts."

682
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:40,180
 And this really is John's call.

683
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,900
 This is what Advent is all about.

684
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:45,880
 You see, Advent is a call to personal renewal.

685
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:51,060
 It's a call for you to examine the paths of your heart

686
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,340
 that lead to Jesus.

687
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,180
 It's a call to you to take a look

688
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,520
 at what injustices sit within you,

689
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:03,020
 of what sin is there that you've wrestled with recently.

690
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,380
 It's a call for you, an invitation for you

691
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:09,860
 to make the crooked paths of your heart straight again,

692
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:13,100
 to be able to remove whatever obstacles might be there

693
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:17,940
 for receiving more and more of Jesus at this Christmas time

694
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:20,460
 so that you can come and celebrate him

695
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,980
 with a refresh renewal of your heart.

696
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,940
 Advent is a call for you

697
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:29,380
 to make the paths of your life straight.

698
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,220
 Are you with me?

699
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:34,060
 Now, I want you to do that,

700
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,780
 not by sitting here and listening to this message today.

701
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:37,620
 I want you to do that

702
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,900
 by putting that into practice in your life.

703
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,660
 I want you to take what we're talking about today

704
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:44,260
 and actually reflect in your own spiritual disciplines

705
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,420
 throughout the week on exactly what we're talking about.

706
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,820
 So here's what I want you to do right now.

707
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,780
 I want you to get your camera out, your phone out,

708
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,580
 which it has a camera, most of them.

709
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,940
 So get your phone out.

710
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:55,060
 And I'm gonna show two slides here

711
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,660
 that I want you to take a photo of.

712
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,380
 The reason being is I want you to sit

713
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:01,420
 with these questions in the week ahead.

714
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,420
 I want you to reflect in your own personal time

715
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:07,740
 around these challenging questions.

716
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:10,520
 I'll let you take slide one.

717
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:16,780
 Five, four, three, two, one, slide two.

718
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:22,700
 This is Advent for me, Advent for you.

719
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,380
 It's about the renewal of your person.

720
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,900
 And I believe as you sit with those questions this week,

721
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,540
 the Holy Spirit will challenge you

722
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,580
 about putting some of those crooked ways

723
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,100
 in your life straight.

724
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:33,980
 Is that helpful?

725
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,940
 It's helpful for promise.

726
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:38,060
 Is that helpful for anyone else?

727
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:40,880
 All right, now here's the important thing though.

728
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,240
 Don't ever make Advent only about you.

729
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,260
 Advent is not just about your own personal renewal.

730
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,340
 When John the Baptist began to preach

731
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:54,660
 a message of repentance for the forgiveness of sin,

732
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:57,460
 it was not just directed at personal renewal.

733
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:00,620
 He was also standing before all of the structures

734
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,980
 that Luke had laid out, both the Roman

735
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:06,060
 and the Jewish structures, and all of the injustice

736
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,460
 and the corruption and all the stuff that was happening.

737
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,660
 And he was standing before that and he was saying,

738
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:14,380
 God's kingdom is going to reverse so much

739
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,960
 of what we see here.

740
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,220
 In other words, there is social reversal

741
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,060
 that the kingdom of God brings.

742
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:24,260
 See, Advent is also about social reversal.

743
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:27,380
 It's not just about your own personal renewal.

744
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,820
 As important as that is, that's the first step, absolutely.

745
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,780
 But after that, then the cool comes.

746
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:35,140
 What is it that's broken around us?

747
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,820
 What are the systems and the structures

748
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,660
 that are keeping the people impressed?

749
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,820
 What are some of the things that we see around us

750
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:43,060
 that as Christians we can stand up against?

751
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,620
 We can speak truth to power.

752
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:48,380
 Truth to power like John the Baptist does

753
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:52,260
 in front of Herod that even cost him his head.

754
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:55,060
 Where might we be able to speak truth to power

755
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:58,300
 and act in a proper righteousness

756
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,420
 to stand against injustice like Jesus does in the temple

757
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,940
 with those whips and the cords and the overturning

758
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:07,060
 of all of the profit that was being made from the poor?

759
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:11,900
 Where might we be able to partner with God this Advent

760
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:15,860
 in standing for this social reversal

761
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:19,460
 that we see so often in God's kingdom?

762
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:22,500
 This theme is in the whole of the Christmas story.

763
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,660
 Let me just give you one example from Luke 1,

764
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,180
 starting in verse 51.

765
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:29,180
 This is Mary's song, pregnant with Jesus.

766
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,980
 And she turns before God, filled with the Holy Spirit.

767
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,660
 And she sings these words.

768
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:36,380
 She says, "He has performed mighty deeds with His arm.

769
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,060
 "He has scattered those who are proud

770
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,260
 "in their inmost thoughts.

771
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:42,060
 "He has brought down rulers from their thrones."

772
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,020
 Notice the reversal.

773
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,900
 "But He has lifted up the humble.

774
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:49,440
 "He has filled the hungry with good things,

775
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,860
 "but He sent away the rich empty."

776
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:54,500
 The social reversal that takes place

777
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,220
 in the coming of the kingdom of God.

778
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:59,300
 This is prefiguring Jesus there in the Sermon of the Mount

779
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,140
 with the Beatitudes.

780
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:04,220
 "Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.

781
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:08,820
 "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,

782
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:11,300
 "for they will be filled."

783
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,860
 The kingdom of God that we get invited into,

784
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,780
 the story of Christmas, what Advent is all about,

785
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,260
 is not just a change within me,

786
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:22,840
 but a change within me for the change in the world.

787
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:28,260
 That actually Christ comes to change the world

788
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,380
 to the kingdom of God.

789
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,860
 It's subversive and it's powerful,

790
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:35,260
 and it doesn't shout from the corridors of power,

791
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,420
 but it comes from the broken and the vulnerable,

792
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:40,240
 and it turns everything upside down.

793
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,360
 So get your phones one more time,

794
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,740
 and I want you to take a photo of these two slides,

795
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:50,420
 'cause this is Advent for us, the reversal.

796
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:53,660
 I want you to reflect this week in your quiet time

797
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:57,260
 and in your own personal way on this question,

798
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:02,260
 five, four, three, two, one, and this one.

799
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:09,560
 I want you to sit with these questions,

800
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,080
 because here at the Vine,

801
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,540
 God's speaking is not 90 minutes on a Sunday, amen?

802
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,180
 But what we're talking about here is important,

803
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,940
 and we wanna invite you to take your time

804
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:23,420
 to sit in the reality of the call of Advent,

805
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:28,420
 the call of John the Baptist, renewal and reversal.

806
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:31,960
 That actually every act of God's redemptive power

807
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,980
 and activity in this world sits under these two things

808
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:38,560
 of renewal and reversal, renewal and reversal.

809
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,580
 I believe this Christmas, God wants to renew your heart,

810
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,500
 and I believe He wants to show you

811
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,580
 the things that you could be praying for

812
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:50,220
 to see reversal come in our city and our society.

813
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,300
 This is the heart of God.

814
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:56,780
 The great question that Advent leads us to

815
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:00,800
 is are we willing to clear the paths?

816
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,060
 Are we actually willing to make the way straight?

817
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:08,100
 John the Baptist stood before a people

818
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,680
 who hadn't heard God for 400 years.

819
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,240
 I stand before you today,

820
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:17,100
 not knowing when the last time God spoke to you.

821
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:22,400
 And I issue a call to you this Christmas.

822
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,320
 Repent.

823
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:27,040
 By that I don't mean just say sorry.

824
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,000
 Live a different way.

825
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,440
 I wonder if you could stand with me, I wanna pray.

826
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,780
 (footsteps)

827
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:44,280
 If you're comfortable to, you can open your hands,

828
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,520
 you don't need to, but I'm gonna pray for us.

829
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:50,540
 Father, we thank you that we stand in this moment

830
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:54,640
 in the call of Advent as we prepare our hearts

831
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,760
 for your arrival at Christmas in just a few weeks' time.

832
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,020
 But in the bigger picture of things,

833
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,940
 you're coming again in your second coming.

834
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:08,940
 And as we stand between those two world-changing events,

835
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:13,700
 forgive us, Lord, where we love what it is

836
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,820
 that we might lose more than the one

837
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,120
 that we are to lose it to.

838
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:23,700
 Forgive us, Lord, where we've hardened our hearts

839
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,340
 off the back of such a hard year.

840
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:29,740
 Forgive us, Lord, where our waiting for your voice

841
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:33,860
 in our unanswered prayers has challenged us

842
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:34,960
 to give up on you.

843
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,820
 Father, we stand here in this moment

844
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,460
 as a community of faith.

845
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:45,060
 We thank you for your presence and your word.

846
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,960
 We thank you that after 400 years, you brought a word

847
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,880
 that was not easy to hear and not easy to swallow.

848
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,580
 And we stand together now as a community of faith

849
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,620
 with that same word sitting over us.

850
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,960
 We need that disruption of Advent as well.

851
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,960
 All of us can think of areas in our lives

852
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,720
 that are crooked and not straight,

853
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,440
 areas of our lives that are waiting to be invited

854
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,720
 by your Holy Spirit to you,

855
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,360
 so that yes, we can ask for your forgiveness.

856
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,200
 Yes, we can confess that sin,

857
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,200
 but also that we might begin to live in a new way,

858
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,640
 that we would turn around,

859
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,580
 reorient ourselves in a new direction.

860
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:27,540
 Holy Spirit, I pray for anyone in this room

861
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:30,320
 where that is the cry of their hearts today,

862
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,400
 that over this week and the next coming weeks

863
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,520
 as we unpack the life of John the Baptist,

864
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,300
 they would feel themselves coming alive again,

865
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:42,560
 that they would hear the call and they would respond.

866
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:47,080
 And we thank you for this in your name.
