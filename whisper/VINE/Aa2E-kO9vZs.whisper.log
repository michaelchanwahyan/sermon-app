[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Have a seat, have a seat.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   We're really excited.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   We're continuing our series here at the Vine on the Holy Spirit.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   If you've just joined us or maybe this is your first Sunday with us,
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   we're doing a series right now on the Holy Spirit.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   We're approaching this series by looking at some of the dichotomies
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   and the paradoxes that are found in the Spirit.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Things like He's the one who brings conviction, but also comfort.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   Opens up Scripture to us, but also brings a fresh word.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Comes when we're in a community like this, but also can come when we're on our own.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   This beautiful dichotomy and paradox of the work of the Spirit.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   Today we're continuing that with the idea of worship and how Scripture teaches us
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   out of John chapter 4 that we are to worship in the Spirit and also in truth.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   We're going to be doing something a little bit different today, which is really exciting.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   We want to help you to hear from different voices in our church,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   rather than just those that are often the ones that are preaching.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   We want to make sure that we make space for different voices and different insight
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   and different wisdom. I'm super excited about this.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Pastor Promise is going to come and lead this time.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Can we put our hands together for Promise and for everybody else
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   that's going to be joining him on stage?
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Thank you. Thank you.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Come on, you guys. Come on up. It's all right. Don't be afraid.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Can't back out now. It's too late. This is being recorded.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   All right.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   We'll let the married couple share a mic. It'll be good.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   All right. Well, everyone, I want to introduce myself because you know who I am.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   But I just want to go ahead and introduce some of the people that we have with us,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   and then we're going to jump right in.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   So to my left we have Pastor Emma, which you are used to seeing her here.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   She's been on our team for a while leading worship.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   She is one of our worship pastors.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   To my right we have Juju, who leads worship in the PM.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   So normally if you're here at the 2 o'clock service, you would see her right here about this tall.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   It's quite nice. We love her dearly.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   To her right we have Mr. Smith.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   These two are married, by the way, so give it up for marriage, everyone.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   We love that. In God's house. Amen. Amen.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Mr. Smith Akin is also joining us today to share.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   And then to his right, my favorite Indonesian man in the whole wide world.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   This is Pastor Jethro, and he's taken just for the record.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   But Pastor Jethro, everyone, let's give it up for him.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Engaged man. Man to be married.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Well, let me just tell you guys what we're hoping to do today.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   We would love to just have some conversations around what it means to worship in spirit and in truth.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   And just kind of sit in that space, understanding that in lots of our lives,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   that we can be pulled towards these dichotomous concepts.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   And actually we serve a God who is whole and complete.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   And so as we go through this, we're going to see just how he pulls us into this completion that he has.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   So as Pastor Andrew has shared, we started this series on the Holy Spirit.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   This week, we're looking at John 4, looking at Jesus and the Samaritan woman.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   And the concept and the big idea that we're going to be talking around is around worship.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   So in order for us to actually, I guess, have a common vocabulary and understanding of what worship is,
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   I'm going to pass it to our worship pastor, Emanuela, one of our worship pastors,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   who will be giving us a definition on what worship is for this community.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   So go ahead, Emma.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Yes. So hi. Hi, everyone.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   So I will caveat this by saying this is obviously not an exhaustive definition of what worship is.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   But for the purposes of this conversation and as a community, when we talk about worship,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   how we define it is an adequate and appropriate responding to and revealing of God the Father,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Christ Jesus the Son, and the Spirit that lives within us.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   And so in short, we say revelation and response when we're talking.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   What is worship? Revelation and response.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   So the adequate and appropriate revealing of and responding to God the Father, Christ Jesus the Son,
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   and the Spirit that remains with us.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   So that means worship takes place when God is revealed through the way that we live
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   and when we also respond to that revelation of who God is.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   That means it can take place here in this room, just like we just all experienced,
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   but also means that it's not simply limited to the worship service and the gathering.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   So today we're going to look at John chapter 4.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Let me just give us a little bit of what's happening in John chapter 4.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Jesus is in Samaria, and he's at this well.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   And this lady is there, and he's thirsty. He wants something to drink.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   And he asks her for a drink, and they have this discourse around water and how he's like--
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Jesus always does this when someone asks him a simple question.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   He always gives some profound answer that doesn't really answer the question, right?
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   And so he wants water, and then all of a sudden he's the well that never runs dry,
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   but he's the one asking for water, and she should be asking him for a drink.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   So it feels a little bit confusing, and then it goes into this whole idea of Jesus kind of calling out,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   "Oh, well, you have five husbands," which seems a little bit weird,
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   just kind of out of the blue, Jesus calls her out on her life.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   And then it transitions into this idea of Jews worship on one mountain,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   but Samaritans worship on a different mountain.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   And it's in this space that we get the crux of today's talk around what worship truly looks like.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   So if you could turn your attention to the screen, I'm going to read this for us,
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   starting at verse 19 of John chapter 4.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   It says this, "Sir," the woman said, "I can see that you're a prophet,"
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   which is a good response, given that he's just told her all this stuff about her life.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   "Our ancestors worshipped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem."
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   "Woman," Jesus replied, "believe me, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain or in Jerusalem.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   You Samaritans worship what you do not know.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   We worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Yet a time is coming, and has now come, when true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth,
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   for they are the kind of worshippers the Father seeks."
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Jesus, we thank you this morning for your word.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   And we just ask, Holy Spirit, that you would be with us as we converse around it, as we pull it apart,
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   and as we see the insight that you have for us to live our lives.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   We know that your word is living and active, so would you speak to us now, in Jesus' name. Amen.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Also, I'll just toss a question out.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   The idea of worshipping in spirit and in truth, you can't just do one over the other.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   It's a false dichotomy, but what makes it a false dichotomy in you guys' take?
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Why is it, why can you not worship in spirit or in truth? You have to do both.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Because I think both reveals God, right?
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   So if you understand that, talk about this truth, truth as we know it is the word of God.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   The word of God came in flesh into Jesus.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   And the Spirit, meaning the Holy Spirit that He has given us,
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   the Holy Spirit will bring us to revelation of who Jesus is.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   And Jesus already said Himself that He does not do anything that He doesn't see the Father do.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   So in short, Jesus reveals the Father.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   So the Holy Spirit reveals the Jesus, which is the word, and the truth, and Jesus reveals the Father.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   So three in one.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Trinity thing, right?
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   So if we go back to that description or definition, right?
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   If worship is revealing and responding, and we're worshipping God,
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   then who we're revealing, like our revelation of Him has to be accurate.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   And because to the Christian faith, our God is three in one, our worship of that God,
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   and so the revelation of His nature must align with who He actually is.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   And so in spirit and in truth encompasses, like in that passage is very interesting,
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   it kind of highlights the Trinity without using the word Trinity, right?
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   So it says, "The Father seeks worshippers that worship in the Spirit and in truth."
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   And we know from John 14, 6 later on that Jesus says, "I am the way, the truth, and the life."
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   So you see clearly in that kind of like outline of how worship is to take place,
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   the picture of the full Trinity, and so to separate and choose between spirit or truth
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   would be to separate the Godhead, which would then change--
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   I don't know if it constitutes--it wouldn't constitute worship to the God we worship as believers.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   So I think it's impossible to break them up.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   It's impossible, but it's also dangerous, right?
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   I think none of us go into it saying, "Okay, I'm going to just worship in spirit.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   I'm going to just worship in truth and ignore the others."
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   But I think as humans, we are drawn to extremes sometimes,
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   and if we're not careful, we can find ourselves oversaturated on the other side of the line.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   And so let's talk about the Old Testament.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   We see in the scriptures--not Old Testament, the Pharisees.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   I think someone mentioned the Pharisees.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Akin, this is your point. Go ahead and talk about it. Tell us what happened.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Yeah, it's something we discussed in the 9 a.m. 9.15 service.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   So yes, it's impossible to honestly worship God without doing so in spirit and in truth,
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   but like Promise says, there is the danger of trying to gravitate towards one.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   And if we think of the Pharisees, this is very likely a very good example of a body of people
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   who likely gravitated more towards the Word and almost forgot entirely about the spirit aspect of it.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   So they spent so much time reading the Word, they could actually memorize--
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   if they had memorized it, they could recite it verbatim.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   But Jesus was walking amongst them and they couldn't actually recognize Him
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   because they were so much focused on the Word.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   And I think that is a danger.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   That's something that we definitely want to do our best to actually ensure that does not happen with our lives.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   Because like Promise said, it can be a slippery slope.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   We can very easily sort of just gravitate towards one.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   And I mean, I don't think any one of us here wants to emulate the Pharisees.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   We saw a lot of the mistakes that they made.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   So good thing to keep in mind and keep them as an example.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Jesus is actually kind of a little harsh to them in some extent.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   Like when you see the Pharisees living their lives, right?
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Like they know all the laws, like I said.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   They could pray the best. They were fasting.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   They were doing all the things. They looked the part.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   But the way that Jesus would respond to them, He would call them whitewashed tombs, empty on the inside.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   Their spirits were not actually connecting with Him.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   He would also say that these people worship me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   So it really does seem that if we omit the spirit, we actually miss on what it looks like to biblically worship God.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   I think Jethro made a really good point earlier, and you can expand on this,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   but about how if we decide to lean, so this is on the dangers of leaning more truth,
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   like I'm going to worship in truth.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   And that's a fair response, seeing people worship God in however way they want, which we'll get to.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   But one of the dangers of that becomes self-righteousness,
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   because you start to believe that your worship is acceptable because you have dotted all of the I's and crossed all the T's,
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   which we know is not true, right?
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   Scripture is like your righteousness, at most righteous, is filthy rags before me.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   So like the way that your worship is accepted is never because of how great you've done.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   The Pharisees, again, were people, I had a friend who used to say the Pharisees knew the word and the truth so well
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   that if you rolled up a scroll and you shot through it and they unrolled it, they could tell you what letter.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Like literally, was that a G that was removed?
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   It's an analogy for how well they knew the scripture that they can really recite every iota of it.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   But then that kind of leads to that difficult place where you're leaning on yourself,
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   which is kind of hard because we're not the most consistent people.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   So then if our hope for an acceptable worship is our goodness and our ability to maintain God's level of standards,
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   then we wouldn't have an acceptable worship for very long, if ever.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   I know I wouldn't, I don't know about you guys. Maybe you guys are deeper.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   But as for me, I already know I'm grateful for the Holy Spirit because otherwise there's no way.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   The truth is a person. And I think one of the things that we didn't talk on earlier,
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   but I think is interesting to state is if Jesus is the truth and truth is a person,
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   then you kind of have to get to know the truth.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   Right. Can you maybe, Jet, what does that, when you think about the idea of we have to get to know Jesus,
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   what does that mean? What does that look like?
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   Well, Jesus, this is the next point, but Jesus comes to, he says, comes to fulfill the law.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   He's not come to abolish the law. So, and he's given the word is the word of God is Jesus.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   So getting to know Jesus is also getting to know what he's spoken through the Bible and knowing,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   knowing what he has said and we can understand his character more.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   And so that we know the person, right? If you, if you want to know a person,
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   you don't just observe them from afar. You get to know them. You ask questions and all that.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   Just to jump in on that in terms of, you know, what, what you just said.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   I think it's very possible to, you know, miss out on exactly what Jesus was looking to do,
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   because there were times when what Jesus did seem to contradict the law,
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   even though, like you said, he did not come to abolish the law.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   So laws of like Sabbath and the like, you could sort of mistake that and think that Jesus came to do something otherwise.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   But he makes it clear that that is not the case. So it's more about the actual relationship and the actual spirit of the law,
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   which is why it's important to take both the word and the spirit and not, you know, individually.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   And I think I don't think the Pharisees recognized it, but I think if they were to zoom out and realize,
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   I think the example of like the man who was healed on the Sabbath, like they want to persecute Jesus
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   because he healed someone on the Sabbath because they were so upset.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   They knew the truth, but they missed the spirit of who God was and God's heart for people
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   that they would then try and kill someone who helped somebody because they did it on the wrong day.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   Like, can we talk about missing the big picture altogether?
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   And I think that says something to us that God isn't just calling you to like do all the rules
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   and make sure you're living exactly perfectly right. There is a relationship.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   And that's why the spirit matters so much in this worship.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   Yeah. So that's on what are some of the dangers of leaning too much, right?
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   When we say spirit and truth and leaning on truth.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   Jules, what do you think are some of the pitfalls of leaning,
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   swinging into the other end of the pendulum, where you're like, just by the spirit, no need for truth.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   Well, I grew up in a Pentecostal church. So yeah, it's all, it's all spirit, right?
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   So like, it's very concentrated on like, someone can be rolling on the floor,
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   but then if there's really no truth to it, because truth is also the whole being, right?
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   Like your heart. Is it really showing the heart of God?
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   Then is it really worship that you're rolling on the floor? You're like being slain?
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   Yeah. Sorry to surprise everyone. I didn't want to scare anyone, but that's what I grew up with.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   Yeah. So that can be the danger of that.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   And in this age, I think specifically 2025, like if worship is only in the spirit, I mean,
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   we've heard the phrase my truth so many times, right?
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   Everybody has their own truth, but there's only one real truth, right?
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   There's only Jesus is the truth. So your truth and their truth and his truth and her truth,
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   I think really having the concept of marrying the spirit with the truth, right?
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   The truth being Jesus is super important.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   Yeah. I think something that can be hard to grasp in this day and age is that God is king, like of all things, right?
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   He is God. So like he answers to no one.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   OK. And that and because he is God and he's also a father and all those things, but he is God.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   Our father is God. Right. So like there is that duality to like who he is.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   Completeness. That means he, the recipient of our worship, gets to dictate the method of our worship.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   Right. The way in any loving relationship, you know, for those who are married or like you have siblings or friends,
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   you know, their preferences and what they don't like. Right.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   If your spouse's love language is quality time, buying them the latest like, I don't know, Gucci, whatever,
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   is not going to matter if what they require of you is time. Right.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   So the same goes with God in this relationship with him.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   He dictates how we worship and we learn what he dictates through his word, through the truth. Right.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   So the spirit gives us that affection for God, the desire to worship him.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   But even with good intentions, unless we learn what he wants, it becomes the intentions become wasted. Right.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   All the money a husband could spend on like the latest whatever. And the wife is like, but I asked you to take out the trash.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   And it was a lot cheaper, would have been a lot cheaper to do that. Like it's the same with God.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   I'm reminded of this is this guy's server sound very intense. But there's a story of Uzzah and scripture.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   Uzzah is this man where there is way back in the Old Testament and there's like the children of Israel are at war with the Philistines.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   So the Philistines take the Ark of the Lord. At the time, the Ark of God was symbolic of the presence of God.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   And they thought the presence of God was like Pastor Andrew talked about in the introduction, that it was an energy.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   So like whoever has the energy has the wind. That's not how it works.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   So they stole the Ark thinking the energy was going to be in their favor.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   And then God started smiting them and they all started dying. So they kept playing.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   They started playing hot potato with the Ark and they're like, send it to the next town.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   And like whatever city you don't like, you know, we're shipping it to Singapore, whatever.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   Shots at Singapore. Shots at Singapore. We love you Singapore.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   Easy target. We do love you. But yeah, so sorry.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   So they're playing hot potato with the Ark of God.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   OK, and eventually it lands in the house of an Israelite. They finally get it.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   They send it to one of the people of God and their people stop dying. Right.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   The thing is, though, the Philistines are not the people of God, so they don't have a relationship with God.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   They don't know how God dictates to be worshipped. So they put God, they carry the Ark the way that they would carry their God.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   They carry it in an Ark on top of oxen with like golden idols and stuff.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   And they bring it to the Israelites house because that Israelite wasn't a priest.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   And they weren't they didn't really bother to like find out.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   They just the Ark of God just stayed that way in their house. Right.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   So fast forward, I don't know how many years later, when King David becomes king,
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   one of the first thing he wants to do is restore the presence of God symbolically, the Ark of God to the center of worship in Israel.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   So he goes, he inquires. They tell him, oh, it's at that guy's house.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   They go to that guy house to pick up the Ark. Right.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   But remember, they're carrying the Ark the way the Philistines carry their God.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   God in Deuteronomy and other parts had been specific about how his presence was supposed to be carried.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   It had to be carried on people, which is a precursor to the fact that we would become his temple. Right.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   So people had to carry his presence. It couldn't be animals.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   It couldn't be whatever else. Like you couldn't decide how you wanted to carry his presence.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   You had to carry it his way. But they didn't know that.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   So they pick up the Ark and they're just excited because they're like, oh, yeah, the presence of God is back, which is spirit.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   Like good intentions, excited. Right.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   And I'm sure the spirit of God led that decision that if we're going to be a kingdom after God, we ought to centralize his presence.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   But they didn't. They didn't do the work of finding out. OK, but truthfully, how does God want to be worshipped?
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   So they're carrying this Ark the way the Philistines would carry the Ark.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   They're going, they're going, they're going. And then they find there's like a hole in the ground.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   The oxen, the animals who are carrying the Ark trip and the Ark of God, which was on these animals, start to tip over.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   Right. And so you can imagine my panic. Oh, my God, this is the presence of God. We can't let it fall.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   This guy, Uzzah, is like, no. And he touches the Ark to try to like lean it right and drops dead.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   Go find it. It's in your Bibles. I can give you the coordinates later.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   He touches it and it drops dead. And King David is so distraught. Right.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   So he stops the whole we're going to bring the presence of God. He's like, shoo, what is this? Like, I don't want to die.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   And he's and the scripture says he's actually angry at God. He's like, how? Why would you do that?
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   Like we're bringing your presence back. What? Shouldn't you be happy?
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   But remember, God is king. Right. So we can't carry his presence, even when it's his idea for us to centralize it.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   We can't do it our way. We have to do it his way. I think this is where the strength of the truth comes in.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   Right. So in spirit, like with the right intentions, with the right passion and the movement.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   But we have to do the work of discovering through his word. How do you actually want us to worship you?
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   And the spirit like highlights, you know, what to focus on in every instance.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   But that's that's where the danger could come in. Like good intentions, going straight into the presence of God, not being aware.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   Oh, I'm walking into the presence of someone who's holy, who wants us to be in his presence.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   So, you know, it's it ends happily where I mean, us are still dead, but it ends.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   They go away. David's upset. He goes and finds out. And then they're like, oh, we're not supposed to carry the presence of God on animals.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   Right. And they don't know that it's because in the future, God's presence will live on people.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   So we need to know that. And it needs to be consistent. Right. They learn that.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   And they carry the presence of God properly. And it's a proper party. Right. His presence comes in and dwells like he wants to.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   But it's just we can't do it our way. Deuteronomy gives a good definition of it.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   Deuteronomy 12, 4, he goes, you must not worship the Lord, your God, in their way.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   But you are to seek the place that the Lord will choose from among your tribes.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   God is going to define what worship looks like. And that's what we get here in the New Testament passage in John 4, that true worshipers.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   Like, what does God require for worship to look like? It's this combination of our worship being in spirit and in truth.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   There's a quote from a theologian I want to read to us because I think it really helps us frame it well.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   It says this truth without emotion produces dead orthodoxy and a church full of artificial admirers.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   On the other hand, emotion without truth produces empty frenzy and cultivates shallow people who refuse the discipline of rigorous thought.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   But true worship comes from people who are deeply emotional, who love deep and sound doctrine.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   Strong affections for God rooted in truth are the bone and marrow of biblical worship.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   Our worship must be this coming together, this combination led by his spirit to reveal the truth of who Jesus is.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   And it's a consistent cycle that we then get a chance to reveal and respond to as well.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   I heard earlier that Juju and Emma were hanging out without me and talking about Bible things without me.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   Emma snitched on you, by the way.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   She said that you guys came up with a really cool definition, kind of like summarizing the whole idea of truth and worship and spirit and Jesus and all those things together.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   So maybe you can read it for us so we can all kind of sit with it.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   You want my phone? There you go.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   True worship of God must be led by the spirit and must arrive at a revelation of the person of Christ.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   Just this morning I was kind of like I was praying for today and I was like, oh God, I really I don't want to do it.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   I don't want to do it anymore.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   Like I English is not my first language.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   Like I don't speak as eloquently as my husband.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   But then the Lord said, this is how I want to be worshiped.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   Right. Like today it looks different.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   Like, yeah, last Sunday, yeah, you're worshiping here on the stage with music and with sound.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   But today I want to be worshiped this way.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   And the spirit, you know, the spirit allows us and helps us to things that we can't even do.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   Like true worship. You can never really worship God because it's impossible.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   Because God, like the only way is for the spirit to reveal to you.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   Without the spirit, you cannot. Yeah.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   I think, no, no, you're completely right.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   Like I think it is that combination.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   Like we are dependent on the spirit to lead us and guide us into that space.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   There was something really interesting when we kind of discussed this earlier around the biblical response.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   Emma calls it step zero.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   But Akin, you were actually pulling together just the overall narrative of John 4.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   Looking at how, you know, it's not disconnected.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   We don't just randomly hear about the spirit.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   But actually what Jesus does with this woman kind of sets up this idea of sacrifice and repentance.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   Right. So how would you kind of explain that for us all to understand?
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   Yeah. I don't think we read through the entire passage.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   But at least prior to the bits that we read, we see Jesus call out this lady's sin.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   So he mentioned how she has had five husbands.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   And the person she's with now is actually not her husband.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   So Jesus does something very interesting where I guess it's easy for us as people to sort of gloss over sin.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   And maybe not really call it out, not really speak to it.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   But sin can be seen as sort of the offshoot of something that's wrong within us.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   That could very easily be another idol, another thing that we end up worshipping other than God.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   Which then leads us to express it in different sins.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   So I mean I won't claim to know exactly what was on the lady's mind.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   But it's very likely that she had bought into this lie, this idea that, you know, relationships, partners,
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   would be the way that she can, you know, feel whole and, you know, be whatever she thinks she's meant to be.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   But then that just makes it hard for her to actually worship God,
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   because she's actually worshipping something else within her heart that she may or may not know.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   So it's really cool how Jesus actually calls this out and sets, and actually flashes this out,
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   before the discussion of worship begins.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   Because it's hard to worship if you don't actually, you know, you're not worshipping him.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   You don't want to worship something else within your heart.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   You're going to say something, Emma?
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   I agree.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   So I was reminded of what it was in Ezra, when they came back from Babylon.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   And they were trying to rebuild the temple.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   And then the first thing that they built, they didn't build the outside of the temple.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   What they first built was the altar itself.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   Because in the altar, that's where the sacrifices made,
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   and the slaughter of all the nasty things that like avoids us from connecting to God,
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   is taken away, right?
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   Why do we not have the Spirit?
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   It's because the sin lives within us.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   Well, in the past.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   But now we have the Holy Spirit, right?
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   And the Spirit, and our spirit, matches together, right?
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   And then we get to worship the Lord.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   I think it's neat that when you look at what your husband was saying around approaching Jesus,
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   it seems like there's a clarity that happens.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   And in that clarity of coming close to Jesus, the woman sees herself for who she truly is.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   And it's not like Jesus is dismissing her.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   I think it's good to make clear that even though he calls out the sin, he doesn't dismiss her, right?
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   She's overjoyed. He calls out her sin.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   She's like, "I see clearly. Clearly, sir, you are a prophet."
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   All of a sudden, everything kind of makes sense.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   Emma, you had a whole thing on, like, was it Isaiah and what happens in the present?
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   I was going to say, so the reason when we were discussing, I called repentance step zero,
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   is because I feel like it's a thing that often we're scared of.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   It sounds really like, "Oh no, all the bad things I've ever done are going to be revealed."
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   But actually, it's the first step. It's Jesus coming close, right?
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   So conviction, the conviction of the Spirit, is equivalent to lighting.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   When you turn on a light to a room that's been dark,
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   obviously you're going to start to notice things in the room that are out of place
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   better than you would if it was dark, right?
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   So if as people, we started to be a little bit less afraid of the concept of repentance and conviction,
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   but noticing that God's nearness, because he is light and in him no darkness dwells,
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   his nearness will expose in us things that aren't to set them right.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   That's his intention, right?
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   So we see it in Isaiah 6, we see it in Luke 5, where Isaiah sees the Lord.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   It says, "On the day King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord."
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   And his first response after he sees the Lord, he sees God clearly, then he sees himself.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   And he's like, "Whoa, I'm a man of unclean lips, and I'm going to die."
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   And then the next verse is God sending an angel to actually purify him.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   And then he can hear, and then there's prophecy, and then there's the rest of the 60 chapters of the book of Isaiah, right?
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   Same, when Luke talks about how Peter meets Jesus, he meets Jesus,
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   and once he notices and recognizes, "Oh, this is God," then he sees himself, and he's like, "Oh, get away from me.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   I'm not clean," right?
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   Our tendencies, it's to go, "If I realize I'm not actually as good as I was like, I thought I was, oh no."
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   And God is saying, "No, no, I'm coming near. That's why you noticed this, but I want you closer."
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   "I'm revealing this so that you can have freedom. Now you know that I know. I know that you know that I know."
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   And now you can worship me without the baggage in between us.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   Because often a hindrance to worship is this idea that, "Oh, if only he finds out what I've done,"
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   or, "Surely I can't be good enough."
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   And it's like, it's okay. He sees you fully.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   And so allowing him, as he convicts us, as we talked about a few weeks ago,
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   that leads to his comfort, that leads to his nearness, that allows us freedom to actually know,
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   "Oh yeah, he knows me." That's what the woman ends up telling them at the end, right?
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   "Let me tell you about a man who knows everything I've done," right?
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   And there's still no distance. There is still no rejection.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   And this turns into an element of worship, right?
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   And so the definition that we gave of worship being revelation and response, we're going to do it backwards this time.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   That concept takes place again, not just in the Sunday gathering, but also outside of Sunday.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   And so let's start with what happens outside of a Sunday.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   One of the reasons I had Akin join this panel was because he's the one person who, of the five of us,
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   is not on the worship team, doesn't play any instruments to best of my—is he a good singer?
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   Okay, okay, okay. So worship for him might look—it'll look like how it is for us, right?
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   Like not all of us are on the stage, but you know, Monday to Saturday are still opportunities for us to worship.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   So what does worship in a Monday to Saturday kind of situation look like for you?
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   I really appreciate the definition that Emma gave in terms of what worship is,
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   because that is a pre-course, so that helps us understand that it's not just what we do on Sundays here.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   You know, we can respond to God, we can get revelations from God throughout the entire week.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   So yeah, like Thomas said, I'm not on the worship team. You probably don't want me to be on the worship team.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   I've been in sales and business development for the past 10 or so years of my life.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   And so yeah, most of what—most of the opportunities that I get to actually, you know, worship,
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   they fall outside of this, unlike, you know, the rest of them who work with the church.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   I think one of the things that we hinted at earlier on is one of the things that's very important
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   if you want to worship God the right way, even outside of here.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   So being able to just look at ourselves, like Emma said, that call to, you know, repentance, trying to—
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   there's no one who is perfect. Everyone has one or two things that they are going through,
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   that they are struggling with, and we don't want this to hinder us from being able to worship God.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   So I think that's—it could be challenging, it could be difficult to, you know,
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   look at the not-so-good-looking parts within ourselves, but I think that's a very crucial part.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   That's a very crucial aspect of it. So that, yes, we're able to see ourselves in relation to God,
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   so we have a better idea of how we should actually respond to God.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   Being able to check your heart, for me to be able to check my heart,
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   it helps me sort of figure out why I'm doing what I am doing,
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   because two people can do the same things for different reasons,
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   and God will judge them very differently because he looks at the heart.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   So like I mentioned, I'm in sales. One of the things that you would hear said if you're in sales
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   is that the value ascribed to you is the money that you're able to make.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   That can be very pervasive, not only in sales, but in Hong Kong in general.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   There's this idea that, you know, we are judged based on our financial value,
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   and it's very real in my industry because that is my job. That's exactly what I'm there to do.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   So me waking up in the morning, me going off to work, am I doing that because I've fallen into this lie
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   where the only value that I have is because of the money that I'm able to make?
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   Because in that case, I am not worshipping God. There's no truth to that.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   The Holy Spirit will not lead me to that. I can do the exact same thing,
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   but understand that I'm doing it because it's an opportunity for me to worship God.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   It's an opportunity for me to use the talents and the skills that he has given me
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   in a way that he actually wants me to. It is a blessing from God that, you know,
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   yes, he has helped me speak every once in a while, but there's a story,
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   there's a parable of the talents where, you know, God gives, the master gives talents to different people
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   and he wants them to use it. He doesn't want them to just bury it within the sand.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   So, yeah, being able to do that, that's a much better, yeah, going at it from that perspective
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   is what I'm trying to say, much more easier to worship God as opposed to coming from a fearful
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   or, you know, false value perspective.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   Or you're going to lose your job kind of perspective, right?
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   So I think really holding that place of like the response in that situation is I'm responding to the call of God.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   I'm stewarding the resources that God has given me in a way that would make him proud.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   I'm maximizing my talents. I maximize my potential, not just for me,
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   not because I'm afraid to get laid off, but because this is what God has given me
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   and it's a call of excellence in that. It was really fun. Like for me, a lot of times my worship is,
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   if I'm leading worship, which is like once every six months, or if I'm on stage preaching,
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   that could be a part of my worship. But we had an interesting encounter recently.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   Allison and I have been working with this guy who is dealing with, you know, he's moved here,
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   kind of going to be a refugee and asylum seeker, kind of seeking status from some type of bad situation
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   where he came from. And we're sitting with him and we don't have the answers.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   Like this is way above, like we're pastors, we can pray, but we don't know how to like solve all these issues, right?
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   And I just remember like finding my heart, like at first I was like a bit cold, if I'm being honest.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   I repented afterwards, but I was a bit cold because I was like, how do I know if your story is real?
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   And how do I, we don't have all this money to give away, da, da, da, da, da.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   But as I sat there and I listened and I let God start to soften my heart, my heart changed a bit.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   And I recognized that by just spending time in the conversation, by engaging with him,
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   even though I don't know him from anywhere, by listening, by finding ways,
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   by finding unorthodox ways that we could help work with this guy.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   It was funny, I was telling one of you, I was like, I got the same chill bumps that you get in worship.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   Like I realized it was my worship for that day.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   Like that encounter, responding and bringing God's truth to that person
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   and making time like Jesus would for them was my act of worship.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   And so worship does take place outside of the auditorium, outside of Sundays.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   But on Sundays, Jethro and Emma, I'd love to hear from you guys on how do you kind of balance this spirit and truth thing
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   if we're congregation members sitting here getting ready to worship and sing songs,
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   how do you kind of take spirit and truth into a worship setting musically?
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   Well, one of the thoughts I had of reading this passage initially was when Jesus said,
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   "In truth," was also that in honesty and in integrity.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   And that's what God always speaks to me about, where if I come to worship,
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   am I pretending to be someone else? Am I pretending to be perfect so that God accepts me?
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   Or am I coming with all my pain and my struggle and my questions,
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   and I still come to worship on a Sunday because that's what God asked me to do,
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   and I still lift my hands because that's what the Bible asked me to do,
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   not because I'm feeling like it or I want to be cool and whatever.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   So yeah, one worship leader said, "When we're suffering on earth,
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   that is an opportunity for us to give a sacrifice of praise
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   because when we're in heaven, we don't have suffering."
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   So in your suffering, in our suffering, when we come to worship him,
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   do it out of a place of faith and not out of a place of feeling like it.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   What about for you when you come into this space?
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   I mean, you lead worship like every single week, literally every week.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   You weren't supposed to lead the worship, but I was supposed to lead the worship.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   Okay, her birthday's next week, so she's taking some time off.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   But yeah, when you come into this space for worship,
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   how do you wrestle with spirit and truth?
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   Is it always easy to do both? Is there ever a tension?
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   It's definitely not easy.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   I think unless you were like--if this were a performance,
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   then you could kind of shut off real life.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   But I'm reminded of the psalm that says, "Bless the Lord, O my soul,
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   and all that is within me."
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   And so that's how I come, with all that is within me,
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   and I bring it before him, and I don't leave the crappy parts at the door.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   I bring it in.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   I said, "God, here are my questions, here are my doubts,
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   and here are the struggles I have with health,
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   here are the struggles I have with family.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   But you are faithful." That's true.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   Even if the facts of my life right now are rising against the knowledge of that,
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   what will stand the test of time and eternity is who you say you are.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   So then it's like--I mean, I don't always feel like it,
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   so sometimes I'm telling myself.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   I repeat things a lot, and you might think, "Oh, she's deep."
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   I'm telling myself, "He is good. He is faithful."
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   Until my feelings catch up.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   Sometimes it takes a minute.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   Sometimes, if you've had a good week, your feelings are way ahead,
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   and you got it like, "Oh, okay."
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   But more often than not, it's just being obedient to the call to praise the Lord.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   And I think it's one of the reasons I love the gathering of God's people,
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   because when I don't have the strength, I come into the community of faith,
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   and I'm honest with the community of faith.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   I'm like, "I'm not doing well. I haven't slept."
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   And there have been so many Sundays where we're really held by the grace of God
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   and the presence of people in the community that will check in
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   and we'll all just literally be interceding for one another.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   Everybody's falling apart.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   But God is faithful. God is faithful.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   And I think that's real. That's real life, right?
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   You're not always like, "Woohoo, I feel it,"
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   but reminding, training myself to recite truth so that when I don't, which is a lot,
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   my confession is still truth until I remember, like, "Oh, right.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   So even when I don't feel it, you are good."
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   I mean, that's a good line. I think we wrote that one time.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   That's the perfect place to land, guys.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   Thank you for being a part of this.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   As the worship team gets back up on stage,
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   I'm just going to pray for us.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   But thank you, Jew, and thank you, Akin, for joining us in this space.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   [applause]
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   Well, Church, if you'll go ahead and stand with me,
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   we're going to spend some time stepping back into this space of revelation and response.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   And, you know, I don't know where you are today, where you are this morning.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   Maybe it is hard for you.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   Maybe, like Emma said, maybe the facts of life are telling a different story.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   But when we worship in truth and we worship the truth, we know that He is good,
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   that He is faithful.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   And even if we don't see it yet, He remains true.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   And we worship not just with our words, not just with what we know,
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   but we allow the spirit that dwells within us to speak to our spirits,
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   to encourage our spirits, to speak truth to our spirits.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   There's been so many times that a certain lyric in a song
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   helps me actually get to the place of worshiping God with my whole heart.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   And so, Father, we come before you this morning, and we thank you that you've given us both.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   That you've given us the truth in Jesus.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   We've given us the truth in your Word revealed.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   You've also given us your spirit, a guide, a comfort,
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   someone that goes ahead of us, someone that leads us to truth,
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   that brings things back to memory.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   So as we sit in this moment, Holy Spirit, would you begin to lead us to your truth?
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   Would you begin to push against the lies, push against the false identities that are around,
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   against anything that would separate us from being able to see you clearly
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   and know that your love and that your mercies are abounding,
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   that you are good and that you are faithful and you are kind.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   So we respond to you now in spirit to your truth.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.560]   In Jesus name we pray, Amen.
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:18.140]   (upbeat music)
