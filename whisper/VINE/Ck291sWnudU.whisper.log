[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640]   Well, good morning. It's great to be here with you and great to also be with you online
[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.440]   And when we were having that amazing worship had this image of you Andrew dancing in your hotel room there
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.600]   So as we worship together
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:20.560]   I pray that if you're here in the house or wherever you are worshiping that God would speak to us and
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.880]   Thank you for those prayers Carla. And so I would say this don't stop praying now
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.840]   Okay, keep praying my mom was a saint and she told me once about a time
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.040]   she was in a small town in Florida and
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.040]   She didn't really know where to go to church on a Sunday
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.560]   So she decided just to go to the church closest to her
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:48.080]   She went there and she said the pastor was really struggling. He just couldn't seem to get any point across
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.920]   So she said you know what Steve so I prayed for him and he got much much better
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.600]   So I'm counting on you to keep praying and don't stop praying
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.680]   We're going to talk today about
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.040]   courage
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.040]   courage and challenging times
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:12.320]   But before we do let me just say what a delight what a joy it has been for Marian and I
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:19.640]   to worship here together at the vine over this last year since October and to come every week and to
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.840]   hear God speak to us
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.720]   We have been as Carla said kind of friends of the vine for a long time
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:35.780]   We did a number of justice conferences together and I can tell you that right in that section right over there one justice
[00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.600]   Conference there was a couple of pastors together and we were praying and God through the Holy Spirit just spoke to me in a powerful
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.720]   way
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.440]   Now there is nothing special about that section over there, right?
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.440]   So don't feel like you should move over there, but you do look beautiful over there though
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.640]   So but anywhere in this room
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.880]   God has a word for us. And as Carla said earlier when we were praying that's what we heard
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.040]   We heard that the Holy Spirit wanted to take
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:09.580]   the song to take the prayers to take the welcome to take the message and to
[00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.920]   Individually translate it for you
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.760]   Now that's gonna take humble courage in order for you to receive that
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:24.320]   So wherever you are in your walk or in your relationship with God, whether you feel you're far away or close
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:30.360]   God has something for each one of us and I have found that when he speaks it's actually
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:37.800]   Pretty simple like a child because we are children of God. So it may be as simple as just hold on
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.840]   or it may be as simple as I
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.200]   Love you, or you're beautiful
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.040]   Or I don't know what it is, but God has a word for us. And so we do not want to miss it
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.280]   Now what I have found also is that the Holy Spirit
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.920]   Loves to speak through his word the Word of God and that's one of the primary ways for me that the Holy Spirit
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.560]   Speaks to me is through the word
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.360]   So I love it that every Sunday we come to the vine and we open up the word and we hear what the Spirit is saying
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.520]   For us so today we're gonna do that, but we're gonna have only one verse today
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.480]   So the verse is this Romans 12 12
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.120]   Be joyful in hope
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.160]   patient in affliction
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.760]   Faithful in prayer now, that's a short passage, right?
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.680]   But it's a powerful one if we can receive it if we have that humility to say I need this and that
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.440]   Courage to act on it when we hear what it's saying to us
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.360]   So be joyful and hope patient and affliction faithful in prayer
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.560]   That's the text a little bit of the context and you can see that it comes from Romans Romans 12 12
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.000]   Romans sometimes is called the Himalayas of the New Testament
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.600]   because in Romans Paul reaches these lofty heights of
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.760]   Insights spiritual insights and for me, I'm not sure if it's Romans 8 or Romans 12
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.760]   Which is the the Everest of the Himalayas or maybe the K2 which is which but?
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.400]   Romans 12 is full of power. It starts with these words that we know
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.360]   Therefore I urge you brothers and sisters in
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:26.480]   View of God's mercy to offer your bodies in living sacrifices. In other words, he's saying
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:35.000]   Give it all we're all in that's how he starts this passage and then he goes on and he says this do not
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.680]   conform
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.640]   No longer to the patterns of this world
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.760]   But be transformed by the renewing of your mind
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.520]   Do you remember pastor Andrew when he preached on a different spirit?
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.840]   And that's what this is saying is don't be conformed any longer to the patterns of this world
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.640]   But then he says this be transformed by the renewing of your mind in other words
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.240]   Let's think about how we might do it differently
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.120]   Reframing I believe that's what God has for us this morning
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.160]   Now if you have your Bible in terms of you're looking at it on your iPhone or whatever
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.800]   You might see right above verse 9 in chapter 12. There's a little subtitle
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:24.360]   That's an editors those weren't in the original text, but they're helpful to find the context one of those that I read
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.960]   Said that the following were marks of a true Christian 9 through the end of the book
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.600]   Mine just says love and
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:39.780]   One of the ones I like the most says love in action
[00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.320]   love in action
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.240]   So that's my question for you
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:52.560]   What does love in action look like in your week this week
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.240]   What does love in action look like because Paul in?
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.960]   Philippians 5 6 he said this the only thing that counts is faith
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.080]   Expressing itself through love, you know in this complicated world
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.440]   Sometimes we need to get down to this simple and I what Paul is saying it's about love
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:20.640]   So what does love look like in your life this week now? I believe that Romans 12 12
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:26.080]   Can help us answer that question it can give us some clues of what does that look like?
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.360]   So it's a short
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:35.080]   Verse, but it's a powerful verse and it's so short. I think we should memorize it. What do you think?
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:41.640]   Yeah, I think we should do it right now. Should we do that something a little different? Okay good
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.240]   Some people going. Oh, yeah
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.520]   Okay, let's try this together. This is how it's gonna work. It's really simple
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:53.080]   We've done this in a number of different settings. So what we'll do is first of all, let's just stay it together
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.720]   Say it together be joyful
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.720]   be joyful
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:03.520]   Faithful in prayer, okay, so it's pretty simple, right?
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:09.760]   Okay, so turn to your neighbor and you get to give them a little encouragement by saying this verse to your neighbor
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.280]   Be joyful in hope
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.280]   patient and affliction
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.240]   Faithful in prayer. Okay, your other neighbor is jealous now
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:24.760]   So turn to their other neighbor and say exhort them be joyful in hope
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.400]   patient and affliction
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:33.400]   Faithful in prayer and this may be the last time pastor Andrew lets me preach here, but thank you
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:39.280]   Thank you for working with me on this because this is important and I want to do it one more time
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:45.080]   But this time I want us to think about what we're saying, right the words and and say it to me
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.080]   I need this blessing be
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.680]   All right, you guys did it that's good
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:04.200]   So the heroes in the dark made it hard for you, didn't they they took away your your cue card there, but be joyful in hope
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:09.000]   Patient and affliction
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.160]   faithful in prayer
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:17.560]   We would do this sometimes in the prison ministry that I was working with at Community Church over six years
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:23.880]   every month we would go in first of the month into lychee cock and we would gather with the brothers there and
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:30.680]   Sometimes often we would learn scripture together and I would say to them, you know tonight
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:38.040]   When you're in your cell and it's dark you can't read the scripture, but it'll be there with you
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:40.920]   You can lie there and know
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:47.040]   The calling to be joyful and hope patient and affliction faithful in prayer. I
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:53.400]   Would say to them that when they come to that time where they're in front of the judge and they've got their earthly
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:58.520]   Lawyer advocate on one side and they've got the Holy Spirit advocate on the other side
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:04.720]   They've got the Word of God within them. They can't open their Bible in that setting but they can know
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:10.400]   The Word that is in them be joyful and hope patient and affliction faithful in prayer
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.880]   And you can too
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.320]   so tonight
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:21.680]   when you're in your room and the lights are out and you're having a hard time sleeping and you're thinking about
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.560]   The meeting the next day and you're wondering
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.400]   about God's
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:32.760]   Word for you. You can be joyful and hope patient and affliction
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.960]   Faithful in prayer when you're in that meeting
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:41.000]   Tomorrow morning, you've got your colleague on one side your boss on the other side
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.680]   You can be faithful in prayer
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:50.160]   You can be patient in affliction. You can be joyful and hope because it's in you it's in us
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:55.400]   Okay, but it's here right now, right? And so this often happens I think in
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.680]   With followers of Christ is we have too much head knowledge
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:09:59.840]   Everything's up here
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:05.080]   But it doesn't make that 18 inch journey all the way down to where it counts into our heart, right?
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.680]   Because when it's in our heart, then we live it out
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:14.320]   So that's what we want to focus on now is what does it mean not to memorize this but to know it by heart?
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.960]   if we know it by heart, then
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:23.080]   Then we can live it and it can be love in action for us. So we're gonna need some help for that and
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.920]   as as Carla said earlier
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:30.000]   last year
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.400]   Marian and I felt the Holy Spirit calling us on from Community Church
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:40.600]   Which was a very difficult kind of challenging time to go on because we had poured our love and and there was deep love there
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.600]   but we felt God was calling us on and
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.960]   We didn't know at the time where he was calling us
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.760]   but then we
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:51.800]   We followed God and found that he was calling us to the University of Hong Kong
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:56.440]   And as Carla said right now, I'm there working with character leadership
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:04.960]   With a team that's developing character leadership for the next generation. So first-year students, they'll be there four years in character leadership
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.400]   now
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:11.480]   The point of character leadership is that you know in traditional?
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.760]   Leadership theory there are three C's right? There's your
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:21.640]   Competence there's your commitment in other words how gifted you are how hard you work?
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:27.000]   but there's a third C that we often forget and that is character and
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.440]   just like the others can be taught hard work and
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.320]   Competence character can be taught
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.720]   so
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:40.840]   How how can we teach this one of the key components of teaching character?
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:48.280]   that again and again from all the way back from Socrates to Aristotle and on to today is that a key component of
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:51.560]   learning character is what's called an
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:56.080]   Exemplar an exemplar. Do you know what exemplar is?
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:02.640]   Yeah, good exemplar is basically a fancy word and it just means it's an example
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:07.200]   Of someone who's an example consistently for good in your life
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:13.460]   You have many exemplars in your life if you thought about it, and I'm sure you are an exemplar for many
[00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:18.760]   So I want to introduce you to an exemplar this morning. I met this exemplar
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:22.200]   about 15 years ago in Hungary and
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:26.640]   His name is father Oleson
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:34.760]   Now I believe father Oleson can help us in terms of understanding what Romans 12 12 means in our life
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:40.160]   But also understanding what would it mean to live with humble courage?
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:46.320]   this week a few years ago God laid on my heart these two words humble courage and
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:51.480]   I feel this is what we are called to live out our love in action with
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:55.120]   So let me tell you a little bit about father Oleson father Oleson
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:13:03.680]   The father comes because he's a Benedictine monk. He was in Hungary. I met him at an international pastors conference
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:09.200]   We were there and it was a very informal type thing. Someone just announced would anyone like to meet father Oleson?
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:13.840]   He's gonna come over this afternoon. You can have coffee with them. So there's about five of us that decided
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:18.720]   Yeah, that sounds like a good good deal. So we sat there with them and then father Oleson
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:26.200]   Began to speak he was 90 years old at the time and he began to talk about the time
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.560]   right after World War two
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:35.080]   Where he was put into prison into a Soviet gulag for ten years
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:40.820]   He and his friends were both put or all put into this gulag now
[00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:44.000]   at that time
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.720]   hundreds of
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:50.360]   thousands of people were being put into prison in his country and
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:53.320]   Only hundreds were returning
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:59.160]   But father Oleson and his friends. They basically said we not only want to
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:05.520]   Return but we want to come home stronger. And so they came up with four rules
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.760]   by rules just ways of living and
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.680]   these
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:17.800]   Ways of living help them to live love in action and it helped them to be stronger
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.680]   It helped them to have humble courage
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:26.200]   So I'd like to share those with you would is that okay? Would you like me to share the the four?
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:31.380]   Yeah, okay good because I don't have anything else. So that would be good
[00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:36.600]   All right rule number one
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:43.520]   Rule number one is don't complain. So we're gonna start with the hard one right right off the bat. Don't complain father
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:48.760]   Olson also expressed it in this way. He expressed it don't over dramatize your suffering
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:54.760]   Why because it makes us weaker and he realized when you're facing challenging times
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.720]   None of us in this room is in a Soviet gulag
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:05.400]   All of us in this room and whatever room you're watching from
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.960]   Is facing a battle
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:11.720]   we all have something challenging in our lives and
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:18.560]   So what I believe is these rules these guidelines can help us to face these
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:25.840]   Challenging times now this one what father Olson said is he said we found it made us weaker
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:32.520]   So we made a pact that we would not complain and there's lots to complain about in a Soviet gulag as you can imagine
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.080]   But we would not complain
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:38.800]   But yet what we would do if this one of us started to complain because it's easy to start
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.560]   then the others would say tell us about your job and
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:45.260]   There were people there who had been plumbers. They had been
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.160]   Lawyers, they've been doctors have been all these different jobs
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:54.040]   And he said I discovered more about different vocations in those ten years than in my whole time
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.120]   Don't complain
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:03.400]   Paul who also is in prison also facing a challenging time. He said it like this in Philippians
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.920]   - he said do everything without
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.800]   grumbling or arguing
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.000]   So that you may become
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:19.720]   blameless and pure children of God without fault in a warped and crooked generation and then I
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.840]   Love this then you will shine like
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:25.480]   stars in the sky
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.920]   Amen
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.920]   Okay, so that word
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:35.200]   Grumbling is and maybe some of your translated and translated complaining because it's the same word
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:40.680]   It's also the same word that goes back to the desert with the children of Israel who were
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:46.940]   Grumbling in their tents. Okay. So here's the time of confession. How many of us have been?
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:54.280]   Grumbling in our tents in this last week. My hand is raised. So we're grumbling in our tents. That's what we do, right?
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.480]   but
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.120]   What we hear here is that if we can refrain
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:05.760]   If we can refrain then we can shine like stars here's what I found, you know
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.720]   It's hard to be joyful and complain at the same time
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:16.440]   Right. So when Paul says be joyful and hope we need to not complain to give ourselves a chance, right?
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:19.760]   But that's the first one be joyful
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:28.400]   Do not complain shine like stars. Let's go to the second one the second rule find joy in small things
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.880]   find joy in
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:36.740]   small things and here father Olson basically said this he said
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:42.440]   Don't go looking for trouble trouble will find you right?
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:45.920]   Look for joy
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.520]   Don't go
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:53.840]   Looking for trouble trouble will find you that sounds like Jesus doesn't it? Jesus says in this world you will have trouble
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.440]   Today has enough troubles of its own
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:02.600]   Don't go looking for trouble but go looking for joy now. We just finished here in Hong Kong
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:06.560]   I actually finished around the world but finished the Olympics, right?
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.680]   But here in Hong Kong
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.240]   It was a special Olympics for us because we really did quite well
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:16.640]   As our city in terms of six medals in the Olympics and then in the a pair Olympics which just finished last Sunday
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.720]   five more medals coming in
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.480]   at the time of
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:25.040]   father Ola son's time in the Gulag
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.560]   He said one of the toughest
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:31.200]   Summers was the summers of 1952
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.960]   it was just
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:39.040]   Wretched during that summer, but the same summer
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:41.840]   Was the Helsinki Olympics?
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:46.840]   And so what they decided to do they decided we're gonna make our own Olympics in here
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:52.400]   so they came up with this idea for their own Olympics and the idea was very simple that basically what you would do is you
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.840]   would look during the day for the
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:19:03.400]   Everything that you could be thankful for and then the way the game worked was at in the evening right after the cabbage soup
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.120]   then
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:10.640]   We would share the things that they were thankful for and they had no medals to give right but the one
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.180]   Who had the most for that day?
[00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:18.480]   Then they would ask him what's your favorite song and then they would sing him that song
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:22.040]   Kind of like an anthem but as the honoring of him
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:27.480]   father Olson said that summer the grand champion came up with
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:34.920]   17 things in one day that he was thankful for in that Soviet Gulag and when he was explaining in his victory speech
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:40.520]   He said I was too busy trying to find them and to remember them to actually
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:44.480]   Complain or to actually think about the suffering
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:50.600]   This is the flip side of being joyful if we don't complain in order to be joyful
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:56.880]   We do look for small things to be grateful for on the flip side of being positive
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.640]   And
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:01.640]   This also helps us with hope
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:07.400]   Because after a while when our joy quotient goes down, it's harder to be hopeful
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.120]   But Paul says be joyful in hope
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:18.400]   So I want to I want to share with you a little definition of hope that I hope you find helpful
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.400]   And it's one I came across
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:25.280]   Last year. I was just going through some research and it's one by Thomas Aquinas
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.920]   Thomas Aquinas from the 13th century father of the church a great teacher and he defines hope as this
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:35.680]   He says hope is a future good
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:38.680]   difficult but possible
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:44.580]   Okay. So here's what I would like you to do whatever challenging time you're going through right now
[00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:52.040]   Then take these four parts of the definition and overlay them on your challenging time, right?
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:56.760]   So this is what I did because when I came across this I was going through a very difficult time
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:00.960]   And so when I read it, I thought okay. Yep difficult check. That's true
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:08.240]   And then I came back and I said is it future definitely. I'm not feeling good right now. It's definitely in the future. It's difficult
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:12.640]   It's in the future or it wouldn't be hope but then I thought it's actually
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:16.120]   Possible. I'm not just having a
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:22.240]   like a wishing but it's possible what I'm imagining and it's actually good and
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:29.080]   So Aquinas goes on to say right after this that this is possible in Jesus Christ
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:35.360]   Because Jesus all things are possible and nothing is impossible with God
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:41.880]   And so if you're in a place like this and you do have a lineup with these things, hold on
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:45.120]   Hold on because in Jesus Christ
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:49.720]   It's good and it's possible. What is coming?
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:53.760]   but then you might think okay, that's nice words, but
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:57.560]   can I be joyful in that hope and
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:00.520]   Here, I think we need to redefine
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:06.080]   We need to reframe as we talked about in the beginning what joy is
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:09.560]   Because see joy is
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:15.960]   Not the absence of suffering but joy is the presence of God
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:24.320]   Joy is not the absence of suffering. They're right there in the middle of a Soviet gulag, but it is the presence of God
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:27.760]   When Marian and I
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:32.520]   were living in in London our oldest and our youngest were both born in London and
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:37.480]   When we were living in London at that time, this is obviously pre-covid
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:41.800]   There was lots of travel people would come in and just like we're living here in Hong Kong people come and visit us
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:47.400]   Then they would come and visit and so we would take them on a tour of the town and one of the traditions that we loved
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.400]   Is when we were going around?
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.800]   London, you know in Buckingham Palace
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:56.680]   They have this tradition that when the Queen is in the flag is flying, right?
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:01.580]   So you go by and you kind of take a look is the Queen in oh she's in and I'm not sure what it means in
[00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:05.560]   My life, but it was kind of encouraging right? So you say okay, the Queen is there, right?
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.680]   Now think about joy
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:14.440]   If the flag of joy is waving over our lives the King is in
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:17.160]   the King is in and
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:23.020]   That's actually one of the indicators sometimes for me is if my joy is going then I need to be closer to God
[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:25.200]   but the joy of
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.200]   the Lord
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.200]   Is the presence of God?
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.840]   But how do we do that?
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:39.400]   Okay, and that goes on to the next one in terms of rule number three be humble and be noble
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:43.160]   But let me stop here. So how's this going? Is this is this making sense?
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:46.520]   Yeah, you're with me. Yeah clear enough
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:52.220]   Okay. All right. We'll hand out coffee in a little bit and no, okay
[00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:55.120]   Thank you for your prayers
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:57.280]   rule
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:04.400]   Number three be humble and be noble now at this point in our conversation over coffee with father
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.600]   Olison he struggled a bit and
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:11.360]   He was struggling to put into words. What is rule number three some of it?
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:14.280]   I think was a translation problem from Hungarian to English
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:17.320]   But some of it is he was really struggling with what does this mean?
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:24.480]   And he came up with these four words be humble, but be noble and this is what he said
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.600]   he said
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:28.600]   We don't have
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.880]   the power of the world
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:36.720]   But we are not ants before the mighty
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:43.360]   We don't have the power of the world, but we are not ants before the mighty
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:46.920]   The same power
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:50.480]   That raised Jesus from the dead is in you
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:58.680]   The Holy Spirit his power within you and this is what father Olison was getting at. There's a humble
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:05.200]   Courage that is ours in Jesus Christ who humbled himself
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:11.920]   To the point of death and endured the cross there is this humble courage that we have
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:14.840]   together
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:16.880]   Now he gave us an example
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:25.400]   That some of the guards were helping some of the or excuse me some of the brothers the prisoners were helping the guards
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:31.480]   They didn't have to but it was just a part of their saying we are not ants we can serve
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:34.680]   Now I was thinking
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:37.800]   About two year
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.880]   2018 and in
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:46.400]   2018 as I was preparing the sermon or not wasn't preparing 2018 as I was preparing the sermon thinking about
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:48.080]   2018
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:52.160]   there was a time where kung-sung who runs prison ministries and
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:55.120]   here in Hong Kong and
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:26:00.280]   They had an idea that year that they wanted to bless the guards
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:05.840]   Through the brothers and so they spoke with the brothers talked to the brothers and the brother says yes
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:09.680]   We want to be a part of this and so we would go in as I said every month
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:13.560]   And so the idea was that kung-sung basically came up with a song
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:17.800]   And the song was stand by me and then they came up with a dance
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:21.240]   that we all had to learn or got to learn I guess and
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:26.080]   As we would go there after the teaching time we would all learn this dance together
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:32.960]   And we would learn the song together and then the day came where we were going to honor the guards now
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:37.800]   I'm not sure if my dancing honored the guards or not, but we all
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:40.920]   danced and we sang and
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:46.920]   The guards were moved and they brought in some of the higher-ups and we blessed them
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:49.960]   and
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:57.480]   After everyone had left and it was just the brothers and us then I told them I said what you did today was beautiful
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:00.600]   It's truly love in action
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:04.600]   It's being humble but noble
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:07.400]   It's this humble
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:09.520]   courage coming through
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.040]   You know in humble courage is
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:19.560]   actually, it's meant for hard times because in hard times we are humbled right and in
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:23.600]   Challenging or hard times. We also need courage and
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:29.040]   It may be that you're going through a very challenging time right now in a relationship
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:34.760]   And maybe you need the courage to say something to a person
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:41.560]   But you also need the humility to listen when that person responds
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:46.440]   Or maybe you're in a situation where you have the humility to know that you need some help
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:49.920]   But you also need the courage to act on that
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:54.760]   This humble courage is ours in Jesus Christ
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:59.960]   You know this part now is really talking about
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:05.920]   Be patient and affliction rules number one rule number two was about being joyful and hope
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:11.960]   But this one is what does it mean to be patient and affliction if you were translating word-for-word the original Greek?
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:16.800]   For be patient and affliction. It would basically be in affliction enduring
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:21.840]   Enduring translate patience. It's not a bad translation, but it's this idea of
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.960]   persevering patients holding on
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:31.800]   And it's also this idea. It continues to go on that's humble courage right because don't get me wrong
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:35.800]   Please don't understand me courage does not always roar
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:43.760]   Courage is not this soldier one minute in battle courage. It's the courage which sometimes
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:49.280]   Just where we say at the end of the day. I'm gonna show up tomorrow and
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:55.680]   That's courage where I'm gonna show up in a relationship, or I'm gonna show up in
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:59.360]   This last year at the University of Hong Kong
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:03.400]   There have been many times where I have just felt overwhelmed
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:12.400]   Times where I just felt there was more demanded of me than I could really help out with and so
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:18.960]   Basically on those days. It was just hum just try and say okay. I'm gonna have the courage to show up right
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:29.800]   Let's keep that let's not tell my boss about that okay, so actually my boss might be watching on TV
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:32.320]   but
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:34.320]   That's courage humble courage
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.920]   How do we get that?
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:44.960]   We can teach that we can learn that but there's an essential element of humble courage
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:50.000]   And that is rule number four and our last rule says we go to rule number four
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:56.480]   And that is cling to God cling to God
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:30:00.680]   At this point father Olison said
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:08.240]   He said we found that those who had someone to cling to
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:11.280]   did much better and
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:14.760]   Then he said this he said as Christians
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:20.640]   We all have someone to cling to and we cling to God
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:24.000]   We cling to Jesus Christ
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.640]   If you're here or online and you're not a Christian or Christ follower
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:35.320]   It's open to you as well. It's always open to say with humility
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:40.320]   I need that in the courage to act on that everyone in this room
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:46.760]   Who is a Christian at some point exercise humble courage to become a Christian we had to confess
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:52.200]   I can't do this on my own and we had to have the courage to say am I supposed to give everything that feels like
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:53.200]   a lot
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.560]   Right and so that's what it is
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:00.000]   Is that humble courage all through the summer?
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.080]   Carla started us off
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:05.120]   And then we had promise
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:11.800]   Tim we had John and they were unpacking the Psalms for us in a beautiful way of what does it look like in everyday life?
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:19.680]   Here's a Psalm 63 and Psalm 63 says this my soul clings to you
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:22.360]   your right hand
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:29.640]   Upholds me my soul clings to you your right hand upholds me
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:35.320]   Father Olson
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.720]   Died
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.760]   When he was a hundred years old and
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:48.120]   He when he the day he died there was actually when the book published about him and
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:50.440]   in this book
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:56.960]   It was on his hundredth birthday. It was published says I am aware. This is father Olson speaking
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:04.120]   He says I am aware of the fact that I am a simple man of
[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:08.360]   Average abilities I have no special
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:11.840]   physical or mental skills
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:15.360]   But life
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:23.120]   Always demanded more from me than I was capable of can I hear an amen on this?
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:30.680]   But life always demanded more from me than I was capable of
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:33.800]   God
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:36.960]   Always stood next to me and more than once
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:41.120]   Helped me in miraculous ways
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.480]   Be faithful in prayer
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:53.520]   one of the things that father Olson said is he said in that prison we hung on to the scripture and
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:57.520]   We hung on to prayer and they held us
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:00.560]   So we've been looking at scripture, right? So
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:07.440]   Be joyful in hope patient in affliction
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:10.360]   and faithful in prayer
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:14.280]   But let's do the last part now together. We're gonna go into a time of prayer
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:18.480]   because to cling to God is to just go to him and to say
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.960]   God I need you
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.960]   To have that humble courage
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.840]   So let me do this. We're gonna close
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:36.440]   And sometimes it's nice to stand when we pray so I'm gonna invite you if you're comfortable to stand as we pray
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:42.920]   If you don't feel or if it's easier for you connected God sitting that's fine, too
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:48.440]   But if you stand it's kind of a physical prayer, it's basically say we're standing together
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:53.760]   Remember, it wasn't just father Olson. It was father Olson and his friends
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:59.880]   He gets his name on the rules, but his friends were there as well. It's not any one of us who can do this
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:04.760]   We do it together. We do it together here at the vine and also
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:07.720]   None of us can do it without
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:13.960]   Jesus Christ or with God's help if we go out and try to do these four things in our own that'll last about two weeks
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:18.480]   But if we can start at the end with rule four
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:22.520]   Then what I think we'll find is the others will come
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:28.920]   Supernaturally natural so let's pray for that. Let's pray together
[00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:38.560]   So I want to invite you that if there was anything in this
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:43.960]   Message where you felt
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:47.440]   really connected and I
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:51.800]   Believe God was speaking during that time. So go there and
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:58.760]   Carry on this conversation with God and if you're not a follower of Christ, there may have been something
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:03.800]   That spoke to you go there and reflect and think on that
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:06.200]   And cling to God
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:13.360]   Jesus is open and available and always with us
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:18.680]   And he's ready to answer us as we call out to him
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:26.960]   This last Saturday as I was praying not yesterday, but last week was praying for you
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:32.280]   And I felt the words from Isaiah coming to me to say this
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:38.160]   Before they call I will answer and while they're still speaking I will hear
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:44.560]   So before you even call to him today, he's answering if you're speaking to him right now. He is
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:47.360]   hearing you
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:54.960]   And if there's one area that you want to be stronger in and you realize that's a character you need to grow in to
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:57.640]   To have more humility to have more courage or whatever
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:06.120]   Ask God because we can learn these things and we have the beautiful teacher of the Holy Spirit to teach us
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:09.320]   And we learn together
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:18.000]   And if you're in a challenging time
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:24.920]   Right now
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:29.880]   With humility just say that to God
[00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:36.880]   And with courage say God I will whatever you want. I will do
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:40.240]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
