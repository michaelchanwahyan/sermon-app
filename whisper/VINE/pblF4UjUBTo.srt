00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
 Disclaimer, what I'm about to share,

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,520
 I've obtained the permission

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,020
 of the person I'm gonna mention.

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:15,600
 My family were in Singapore last December.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,720
 I remember this following conversations

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,040
 took place in Singapore because

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,320
 whenever we're in Hong Kong,

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,160
 I'm the one driving and everybody else sit at the back.

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,600
 When we're in Singapore,

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,460
 mommy's driving and I got to sit at the back

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,320
 with the girls, with Megan and Mabel.

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,760
 And so there was one night we were,

13
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,440
 I forgot what we did, we were out for dinner

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,280
 and we were just driving home.

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,200
 I was seated at the back with the girls.

16
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,320
 And Megan, all of a sudden, she asked this question.

17
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,320
 She was asking, "Daddy, why do people die?"

18
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,480
 My daughter just turned four last November.

19
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,400
 So I wasn't quite ready to have this conversation

20
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,200
 with a four-year-old talking about

21
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,120
 the meaning of life and death.

22
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,880
 I wasn't prepared at all.

23
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,680
 And so she asked, "So why do people die?"

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,160
 And I tried to come up with all sorts of science,

25
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,280
 biology, tried to make up something,

26
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,320
 tried to downplay it to like what you tell,

27
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,240
 chat GPT, can you explain why we die to a four-year-old?

28
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,580
 So I tried my best without chat GPT.

29
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,000
 And then she asked, "So am I gonna die?

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,480
 "Is daddy gonna die?

31
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,520
 "Is mommy gonna die?"

32
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,760
 And as we progress in that conversation,

33
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,760
 you could sense the emotion that she's harboring.

34
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,800
 And ultimately she said, "I don't wanna die.

35
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,280
 "I don't want daddy and mommy to die."

36
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,680
 And you can feel that kind of sadness.

37
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,040
 And I'm telling you, I've been a parent

38
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,960
 for about a little bit more than four years

39
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:58,560
 and I was not prepared to have that conversation

40
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,920
 with my daughter.

41
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,880
 I thought they don't ask these kind of questions

42
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,960
 until they're much older.

43
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,560
 I don't know they could understand

44
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,680
 or have the concept of death in their tiny brains,

45
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,200
 but ever like developing brain at the age of four,

46
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,000
 I was totally surprised.

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,560
 But that night I learned one thing,

48
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,120
 that even my daughter was still young,

49
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,080
 she was only four.

50
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,840
 She didn't just catch the idea of death.

51
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,720
 It comes with natural fear.

52
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,640
 She was afraid of the concept of death,

53
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,200
 of dying, of being separated from her parents.

54
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,160
 I could sense fear inside.

55
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,560
 And that night I realized as human beings,

56
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,560
 we perhaps we were born with this kind of fear for death,

57
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,680
 this kind of fear for separation.

58
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,880
 Maybe like we don't even have to prepare ourselves.

59
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,800
 We don't even have to pick it up, learn it somewhere.

60
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,280
 It's kind of inborn in us.

61
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,760
 That's what I realized that night.

62
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,840
 I don't know about you.

63
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,400
 I don't know when was the last time you faced a situation

64
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,320
 like that, not talking to a toddler about death,

65
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,320
 but maybe you were in a situation where you faced death,

66
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,840
 or you faced the death of someone who is very close to you.

67
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,160
 And I don't know what kind of emotions,

68
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,280
 feelings that has brought you.

69
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,960
 Last week we were here for Easter Sunday.

70
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,000
 And if you were here,

71
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,480
 you probably would remember a message from Pastor Tim

72
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,360
 talking about the resurrection of Jesus

73
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,720
 from the narrative of the book of John in chapter 20,

74
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,360
 where John and Peter ran to the tomb

75
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,680
 and they discover something.

76
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,000
 They discover that cloth

77
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,680
 that was supposed to cover Jesus's face.

78
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,080
 It was put very neatly folded.

79
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,840
 It was there.

80
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,240
 And then he brought us all the way back

81
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,280
 to 700 years before Jesus,

82
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,120
 to a prophecy of Isaiah talking about that

83
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,680
 even 700 years before Jesus God had told his people

84
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,160
 that one day he would remove that face cloth,

85
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,280
 that shroud that is covering his people.

86
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,120
 He's going to remove the power of sin and death

87
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,280
 once and for all.

88
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,680
 So what we caught last week was this message

89
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,520
 that Jesus's resurrection means that sin is defeated

90
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:29,320
 and that power of death, it's no longer the final story.

91
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,560
 I see some of you nodding,

92
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,120
 yes, I know you were there last week.

93
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,960
 But as you were listening, or as I was listening,

94
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,560
 I don't know if I was the only one who asked this question,

95
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,400
 that if this were true,

96
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,800
 why are we still attending funerals?

97
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,240
 Why are we still attending Christian funerals regularly?

98
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,640
 Last year, before I came back, like came on full time,

99
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,720
 last year, God gave me some opportunities.

100
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,000
 I've been, one of my side gigs

101
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,560
 were to host funerals for different people

102
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,680
 from different churches

103
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,240
 or people who don't have a home church.

104
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,920
 So I've hosted a lot of funerals

105
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,880
 to a point that I start asking myself,

106
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,560
 I couldn't help but ask myself,

107
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,680
 or I started to realize that one day,

108
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,120
 those people that I love or those people who love me,

109
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,760
 they would inevitably attend my funeral.

110
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:29,240
 And I start to wonder if this was true,

111
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,160
 if God has defeated the power of death,

112
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,080
 why am I still attending funerals after funerals

113
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,800
 after funerals, Christian funerals?

114
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,520
 We were supposed to be sharing the victory

115
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,200
 over sin and death.

116
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,480
 Why am I here?

117
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:49,320
 What am I doing here, seated like at this funeral?

118
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,640
 And then I realized I'm not the only one

119
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,160
 who's been asking these questions

120
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,840
 in the last 2000 years of church history.

121
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,080
 I'm not the only one struggling with this idea.

122
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,960
 I'm not the only one wondering,

123
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,080
 if we share the victory over death,

124
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,360
 then why are we still experiencing physical death

125
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,240
 in our lifetime?

126
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,520
 Why everybody on earth right now

127
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,000
 still have to go through that?

128
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,120
 And I've been asking myself this question.

129
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,880
 And then I slowly realized or remember

130
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,200
 that this is actually one of the questions

131
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,240
 that the early church, the early Christians,

132
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,120
 they struggle with that too.

133
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,760
 So if you open this book, open the Bible

134
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,040
 to the New Testament, look at the letters Paul wrote,

135
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,080
 you will find a number of chapters

136
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,280
 that he was writing on this matter,

137
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,280
 that why Christians, they were asleep

138
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,280
 or why Christians, they died

139
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,400
 even before the coming back of Jesus

140
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,480
 or why Christian died, what does that mean?

141
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,920
 And so today I'm gonna jump into this book called,

142
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,680
 this letter called the First Corinthians.

143
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,840
 I'm gonna look at chapter 15.

144
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,000
 In fact, Paul dedicated the entire chapter to talk about it,

145
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,600
 but I'm gonna read from verse 20.

146
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,560
 And you can read with me.

147
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,040
 Paul says, "But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead

148
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,080
 "and the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.

149
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,560
 "For since death came through a man,

150
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,840
 "the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man.

151
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,440
 "For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive

152
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,380
 "but each in turn, Christ, the first fruits,

153
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,960
 "then when he comes, those who belong to him."

154
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,600
 So here, where is it?

155
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,440
 Those who have fallen asleep over here.

156
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,880
 Those who have fallen asleep,

157
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,520
 it naturally means those people who have died,

158
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,480
 who have passed away, those Christians in the church

159
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,240
 and their physical life ended.

160
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,120
 And this is what Paul meant,

161
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,320
 like when he said those people have fallen asleep.

162
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,000
 And then Paul used a very special

163
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,080
 and theologically rich term to describe Jesus.

164
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,920
 He used this word first fruits.

165
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,160
 And what we need to know that this is not a random word.

166
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,480
 This is not just, oh, okay, this word sounds cool.

167
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,520
 Let me pick this word.

168
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,440
 He chose this word like purposefully.

169
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,240
 And today I just wanna look at this word

170
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,080
 a little bit with us,

171
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,880
 especially let's look at where it came from

172
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,800
 in the Old Testament.

173
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,280
 We're gonna look at some,

174
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,280
 I'm gonna briefly go through the salvation history

175
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,960
 of Israel with us all.

176
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,720
 And maybe we all remember there is this event called Exodus

177
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,320
 where God led his people Israelites out of Egypt,

178
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,240
 out of slavery,

179
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,560
 and he was about to bring them into the promised land.

180
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,680
 And we know that God brought them out

181
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,960
 on this day called the Passover.

182
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,560
 That's around the time we celebrated Easter, right?

183
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,800
 Passover, Jesus is the Passover lamb.

184
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,240
 And we celebrated the fact that,

185
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,240
 the blood of the Passover lamb covered the doors.

186
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,280
 And that's why God didn't kill

187
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,680
 the firstborn of the Israelites,

188
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,240
 but then they were leaving Egypt and God was telling them,

189
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,920
 hey, you guys have to remember Passover

190
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,320
 for generations to come.

191
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,840
 You need to celebrate or remember that every year.

192
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,320
 But then when they were in the wilderness,

193
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,200
 right before they went into the promised land,

194
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,840
 God told them this.

195
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,840
 So I'm gonna read from Leviticus chapter 23.

196
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,680
 It says this,

197
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,080
 "The Lord said to Moses,

198
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,560
 "speak to the Israelites and say to them,

199
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,920
 "when you enter the land,

200
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,360
 "I'm going to give you and you reap its harvest,

201
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,000
 "bring to the priest a sheaf of the first grain

202
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,880
 "you harvest.

203
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,640
 "He's to wave the sheaf before the Lord,

204
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,040
 "so it will be accepted on your behalf.

205
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,440
 "The priest is to wave it on the day after the Sabbath."

206
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,120
 And verse 14 says this,

207
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,000
 "You must not eat any bread or roasted or new grain

208
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,400
 "until the very day you bring this offering to your God.

209
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,480
 "This is to be the lasting ordinance for generations

210
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,760
 "to come wherever you live."

211
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,320
 This day or this ceremony

212
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,640
 is known as the offering of the first fruits

213
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,280
 or it's called the feast of the first fruits.

214
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,280
 It's indeed one of the seven feasts of the Israelites.

215
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,720
 One of the days that they must remember for all generations

216
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,400
 and the feast of first fruits,

217
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,760
 it actually marked the offering of the first portion

218
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,680
 of the barley harvest to the Lord.

219
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,000
 And it symbolizes,

220
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,320
 "Hey guys, come on now,

221
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,680
 "it's the start of the harvest season.

222
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,000
 "It's time to go and take a harvest."

223
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,580
 And the Israelites were to harvest a sheaf

224
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:47,320
 or a bundle of grain of the first ripe barley

225
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,520
 and bring it alongside all the other offerings to the priest

226
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,800
 and the priest would wave it before God

227
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,800
 as a symbolic offering of gratitude and faith.

228
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,960
 It's to say thank you to God

229
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,760
 because we know that even this first grain,

230
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,760
 it came from God, it's provided by God.

231
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,200
 It's a gesture of faith

232
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,280
 because bringing this to God to wave it

233
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,800
 is the declaration that God,

234
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,720
 I know for the rest of the season,

235
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,120
 I know there will be a harvest this year

236
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,680
 and I know this upcoming harvest,

237
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,920
 it's also from you or it's your provision.

238
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,720
 So it's a gesture of gratitude,

239
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,720
 but it's also a gesture of faith,

240
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,160
 saying God, whoever goes bring their offering to God,

241
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,500
 saying, "God, I know what I'm holding in my hand right now,

242
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,720
 "this first grain, it is from you.

243
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,060
 "And I also know that you will provide for me

244
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,220
 "for the rest of the year,

245
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,200
 "for the rest of the harvest season."

246
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,240
 This is gratitude and faith at the same time,

247
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,320
 acknowledging God as the source of provision

248
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,560
 and trusting him for the rest of the harvest.

249
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,200
 This is to say, "God, I trust in you.

250
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,000
 "I know you are my provider."

251
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 So now we know what this feast of first fruit is,

252
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,240
 but I'm telling you that the when, it's equally important.

253
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,520
 Just now we read from that verse,

254
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,800
 it says the priest is to wave it

255
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,840
 on the day after the Sabbath.

256
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,800
 But this is not just any random Sabbath.

257
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,900
 As you know, there are 52 weeks in the year.

258
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:24,280
 So there are 52 Sabbaths in one year, which one it is.

259
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,800
 Just now I said this particular day,

260
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,680
 the feast of first fruit,

261
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,680
 it's actually linked all the way back to the Passover event.

262
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,560
 So for Israelites, every year after Passover,

263
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,080
 they're going to celebrate this,

264
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,840
 also this festival called the Unleavened Bread.

265
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,040
 And also there will be a day

266
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,160
 that is the feast of first fruits.

267
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,360
 It happens all within a week.

268
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:55,280
 So this feast of first fruit, it's actually celebrated

269
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,720
 or this offering, it's done on the day

270
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,960
 following the Sabbath after the Passover.

271
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,000
 Does that ring a bell for anyone?

272
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,680
 Okay, let me ask you this question.

273
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:10,840
 When was Jesus betrayed and captured?

274
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,560
 What was he doing right before he was captured?

275
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,000
 He was praying, what was he doing before he was praying?

276
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,360
 He was having the Passover meal with his disciples.

277
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,440
 Jesus was actually captured and betrayed

278
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,240
 on the night of Passover.

279
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,160
 And then the very next day he was shrouded

280
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,240
 and he was nailed on the cross.

281
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,980
 He was crucified and that was Good Friday, right?

282
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:36,720
 We just remember Good Friday about a week ago.

283
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,220
 And that was Good Friday.

284
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,200
 And the soldiers or whoever the authorities,

285
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,520
 they have to quickly remove his body from the cross

286
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,200
 and put it in the tomb because after Good Friday,

287
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,480
 the very next day was actually Sabbath.

288
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,560
 They were not supposed to do any work on Sabbath.

289
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,520
 So they have to deal with the body as soon as possible.

290
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,160
 And guess what happened the day after Sabbath,

291
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,960
 which is a Sunday, which we now know as Easter.

292
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:07,720
 That was the day when the body of Christ

293
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,180
 was raised from dead to life.

294
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:15,720
 In other words, the resurrection actually happened

295
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,680
 on the feast of the first fruits.

296
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,040
 You see, when God ordained the feast of the first fruits,

297
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,440
 like thousands of years before Jesus even walked on earth,

298
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,840
 he already planned this.

299
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,120
 That after the Passover, after the suffering,

300
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,000
 there was one day that resurrection was gonna take place.

301
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,880
 And church, you know what?

302
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,220
 We always talk about Jesus being the Passover lamb,

303
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,880
 that he sacrificed himself,

304
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,700
 that he took our sin on the cross.

305
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,980
 We talked about Jesus as that lamb,

306
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,780
 on God's lamb.

307
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:55,700
 We talk about his role in the Passover, removing our sins.

308
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,820
 But Paul here, he reminded us one thing,

309
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,420
 that Jesus, the resurrected Jesus,

310
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:04,380
 he was also the first fruit.

311
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,540
 And if you think about the meaning

312
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,220
 of the feast of first fruits,

313
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,860
 it's for people to bring their offering to God

314
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,800
 and wave it to God and offer their first fruit to God

315
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,940
 and say, God, I know you have provided this first fruit,

316
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,460
 and I know in the same way

317
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,900
 you're gonna provide the harvest this year.

318
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,380
 That was what it means.

319
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,580
 It means that God has provided Jesus,

320
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:32,940
 the resurrected body of Jesus, as the first fruit.

321
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,940
 And in the same way, there is a guarantee.

322
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:40,140
 We trust in God that there's gonna be a harvest

323
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,100
 of resurrected body in the age to come.

324
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,720
 And Paul was saying that that was when Jesus comes back.

325
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,500
 Those who belong to him will experience the exact same thing.

326
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,340
 The harvest will be the exact same experience

327
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:59,220
 as the resurrection body of Jesus.

328
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,260
 So Jesus being the first fruit and saying,

329
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,400
 hey, you know what?

330
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,580
 Now, he is our guarantee.

331
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,940
 We know that he was raised in bodily.

332
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,820
 And so we know that one day at the end of time,

333
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,420
 when Jesus comes back again on that day,

334
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:19,820
 we know our bodies, our dead body,

335
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,500
 not just dying, probably very dead,

336
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,140
 our very dead bodies would rise again.

337
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:32,140
 It's this body, this flesh that would rise again.

338
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,420
 And so this is what Paul was trying to communicate

339
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,980
 to us Christ as the first fruit.

340
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:42,920
 He is the guarantee of the full harvest,

341
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,500
 the future bodily resurrection of all

342
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,780
 who belong to him at his coming.

343
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,740
 And just as those who approach the feast of first fruits,

344
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,500
 knowing that God is the one who provided first sheaf

345
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,140
 and he will provide the full harvest now,

346
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:03,060
 we can know for sure that God is the one who gave us Jesus,

347
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,540
 who raised Jesus from the dead

348
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,660
 and he will also raise us from the dead

349
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,500
 like bodily, physically one day.

350
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,020
 And in other words,

351
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:17,020
 God has already raised Jesus from the dead,

352
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,220
 but he's yet to raise you and me

353
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,460
 or whoever we knew that has passed from the dead.

354
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:26,820
 Perhaps you have heard these two phrases

355
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:30,020
 or terms in the same sentence before already,

356
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,160
 but not yet.

357
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:38,380
 This phrase or this terms was used to describe

358
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:41,880
 the tension that Christians are facing

359
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,300
 when the kingdom of God had been inaugurated

360
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,060
 through Jesus's life, death and resurrection

361
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:51,660
 that we already experienced that redemption

362
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,780
 and the renewal in the present

363
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,700
 because of what Jesus has done.

364
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,020
 Last week we celebrated our baptism.

365
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,700
 There are five people getting baptized

366
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,540
 and I've read some of the testimonies.

367
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,340
 It's all beautiful stories of how Jesus came

368
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,860
 and changed their lives,

369
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,820
 turned things upside down for them.

370
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:13,220
 They have experienced the transformative power of Jesus,

371
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,140
 of his cross.

372
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,220
 And this is something because of what Jesus has done

373
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:21,040
 in the past, because of something that has already happened.

374
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,020
 Now we can experience that already.

375
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,100
 We can already experience the power of transformation

376
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,380
 in your life, in my life as well,

377
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:32,540
 but there awaits the ultimate fulfillment

378
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:36,620
 of this future resurrection, this final judgment

379
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,260
 and the restoration of all things.

380
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,740
 This is yet to happen.

381
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:46,100
 This is the not yet of this tension.

382
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,020
 And I do wanna highlight this word tension

383
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,540
 that I mentioned here.

384
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:53,140
 The reality of physical death as human experience,

385
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:56,740
 despite the spiritual born again experience in Jesus

386
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,780
 and the victory that overseen in death that we share in him,

387
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,660
 that's a real tension in life.

388
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,100
 We know we have that power to overcome sin and death,

389
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,180
 but yet we're still experiencing physical death

390
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,780
 in this lifetime.

391
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:16,500
 That reality brings separation between us and our loved ones.

392
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,320
 It creates a tremendous sense of loss,

393
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,180
 even a four year old would understand,

394
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,300
 even a four year old would express

395
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,940
 that kind of sense of loss,

396
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:28,420
 that kind of shock or that kind of sadness.

397
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:33,020
 Yeah, that sense of sadness,

398
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,620
 that sense of frustration,

399
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:39,280
 that sense of shock and even fear,

400
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,580
 it's real in our lives.

401
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,300
 Maybe we have felt that before.

402
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,380
 We experience physical weakness

403
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,120
 and loss of strength and energy as we're aging.

404
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,160
 We become weaker and weaker.

405
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,120
 You can feel that I no longer run as fast as I used to,

406
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,200
 can't finish 10K as fast as I used to.

407
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03,200
 I'm feeling, oh, I can't really push that much of weight

408
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,760
 'cause I'm not training with Benedict and Ivan,

409
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,960
 not training enough, so I'm feeling weak.

410
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,320
 I can feel that.

411
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,680
 But I'm sure some of us,

412
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,640
 we've had the experience of standing next to a deathbed

413
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,260
 and watching life being like sucked out

414
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,280
 of someone we do care a lot about.

415
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:27,920
 The experience of death, physical death, is so real.

416
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,140
 It becomes a tension in a Christian life.

417
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,880
 And we have yet to experience

418
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,380
 or witness any bodily resurrection in our midst.

419
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,360
 We haven't seen it.

420
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,920
 It could be so hard for us to imagine

421
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,760
 what resurrection actually looks like

422
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:49,280
 'cause we haven't seen it, picture it.

423
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,760
 We haven't witnessed it ourselves in our lifetime.

424
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,360
 But on the other hand,

425
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,520
 I think it's easier for us

426
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,680
 to witness spiritual transformation.

427
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,040
 We would understand what it means

428
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,160
 to be spiritually born again.

429
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,440
 We could feel the presence of the Holy Spirit,

430
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,680
 kumbaya, oh God, I feel so warm in my heart.

431
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,080
 I can feel that.

432
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,260
 We could see the fruits of spirit in our lives.

433
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,180
 Wow, Chapman, you look different.

434
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,520
 Not just like (speaks in foreign language)

435
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,480
 but oh, you're more gentle.

436
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,320
 He said, oh yeah,

437
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,680
 because there's the fruit of the spirit in my heart.

438
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,720
 You can experience that.

439
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,560
 You can see literal transformation

440
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,700
 and changes in people's life.

441
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,600
 It's real.

442
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,320
 We can experience that.

443
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,160
 And sometimes, because that's what we can experience

444
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,360
 or understand or feel,

445
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,800
 we gradually focus more on what we can experience

446
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,920
 and witness.

447
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,920
 We focus more on the spiritual aspect of salvation

448
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:44,460
 to a point that we anchor our beliefs of our future

449
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,500
 solely in the spiritual.

450
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,860
 Well, this can lead to a view of death like,

451
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,460
 oh, when I die, I know I'm going to heaven.

452
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:56,400
 Or my soul is going to heaven.

453
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,320
 Or what about your body?

454
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,600
 Oh, I don't know.

455
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,520
 My body will just be burned into ashes.

456
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,480
 And then I don't know what I'm gonna do with my ashes.

457
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,220
 Maybe in a container, maybe in a garden.

458
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,140
 My body will be no more.

459
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:13,720
 But my soul, my soul will be in heaven,

460
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,120
 like with Jesus.

461
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,960
 I'll be with him.

462
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,020
 That's kind of a view of afterlife.

463
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:23,560
 Well, this is a very popular view.

464
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:27,100
 It's even a line to take when we're sharing the gospel

465
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,240
 with people around us,

466
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,760
 maybe with our friends and family.

467
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,480
 Hey, you wanna believe in Jesus?

468
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,960
 If you believe in Jesus, after you die,

469
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,000
 your soul is going to heaven.

470
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,720
 That's what we tell people.

471
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,120
 It's very popular.

472
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,700
 Yet, I would say it's not the most

473
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,060
 biblically accurate statement.

474
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:47,160
 That's what the Corinthian church

475
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,920
 was actually struggling as well.

476
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,720
 Let me tell you this.

477
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,200
 This church, the Corinthian church,

478
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,080
 they were in a part of the world called the Roman Empire.

479
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,360
 And so in Roman Empire,

480
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,920
 they're affected by the Greco-Roman philosophy.

481
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,680
 In the Greco-Roman philosophy,

482
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,700
 they see the world as two parts,

483
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,800
 or they see that there are two worlds,

484
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,280
 bear with me, this is philosophy.

485
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,340
 Are you ready?

486
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,560
 This is Western philosophy.

487
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,840
 Okay, tell the person next to you,

488
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,440
 hey, you're gonna be a philosopher after this.

489
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,280
 No, you're not.

490
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,520
 Right, so there are two parts of the world.

491
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,440
 There is the spiritual world.

492
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,760
 That's the beautiful, that's the perfect world.

493
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,760
 And there's the material world.

494
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,960
 Spiritual, immaterial,

495
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,400
 and then you have the physical world, the material world.

496
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,880
 Or material world, I tell you,

497
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,720
 it's created by the lesser gods.

498
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,000
 It's not as good, it will corrupt.

499
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,880
 See, look at your body.

500
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,800
 That's the best proof.

501
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,200
 You get wrinkles, you get pimples,

502
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,440
 you get, you know, your skin get like bad,

503
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,160
 and you know, you get old,

504
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,120
 and your body decay or deteriorate at first.

505
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,580
 And you know that that's the proof

506
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:59,280
 that the material world is not as good

507
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,840
 as the spiritual world.

508
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,640
 And that's how the Greco-Roman people

509
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,080
 understand their everyday life,

510
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,000
 or their world.

511
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,960
 And so if you tell the Corinthian church

512
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,040
 that you know what, you guys are going

513
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,680
 to have your body resurrected,

514
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,480
 they'll be like, are you kidding me?

515
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,320
 My body?

516
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,280
 I don't need it.

517
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,400
 I just need my spirit.

518
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,720
 Oh, my spirit in heaven with God.

519
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,680
 My body, oh, my body is bad, it's corrupted.

520
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,840
 It's just gonna like decay there.

521
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,440
 I don't need my body anymore.

522
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,040
 They had a hard time believing

523
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:35,040
 that there is actually a bodily resurrection.

524
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,160
 And so if you go back and read Go Home

525
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,440
 and read chapter 15 of 1 Corinthians,

526
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,840
 you will see that Paul tried to,

527
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,600
 he actually spent the first half of the chapter

528
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,720
 arguing, hey, guys, hey, dude,

529
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,680
 there is actually bodily resurrection.

530
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,040
 What else do you think Jesus is doing here?

531
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,900
 He was trying to convince them.

532
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:59,260
 But what is interesting is that after 2,000 years,

533
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:02,760
 our view of body and spirit, body and soul,

534
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,960
 it's not too much of a difference

535
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,220
 from those people 2,000 years ago.

536
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:12,320
 We sometimes, even a church, so popular to say that,

537
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,160
 when we die, our spirit, our soul will go to heaven,

538
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,600
 be with Jesus, and you don't know where your body goes.

539
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,320
 Maybe you will just get burned and died and somewhere.

540
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,200
 We also share a similar view.

541
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,200
 We also have a slightly not very biblical view of afterlife.

542
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,360
 And that's what Paul was trying to tell his church.

543
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:38,920
 One of the theologians of our time in the UK,

544
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,720
 his name is N.T. Wright, he wrote this,

545
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,400
 which is quite on point about this problem.

546
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,360
 He says, "One of the greatest difficulty

547
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,100
 "in preaching the gospel in our days

548
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,900
 "is that everyone assumes that the name of the game,

549
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:56,540
 "it's ultimately to go to heaven when you die,

550
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:59,880
 "as though there were the last act in the drama.

551
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,940
 "But that's wrong.

552
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,200
 "Heaven is important, but it's not the end of the world.

553
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,680
 "God will make new heavens and new earth

554
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,720
 "and give us new bodies to live and work

555
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,520
 "and take delight in his new creation."

556
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,020
 Heaven is important, going to heaven, yes,

557
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:22,820
 that's great, but that's not the end game.

558
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:26,200
 That's not all, not just your soul going somewhere.

559
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,440
 So scripture ultimately promises

560
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,120
 not just a disembodied soul in heaven,

561
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:36,240
 but a resurrected body in a renewed creation.

562
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,660
 Let me say that again.

563
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,560
 Christian scripture, the view of afterlife

564
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,760
 that we actually teach is this,

565
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:47,000
 that is a promise that is not just a disembodied soul

566
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 in heaven, but a resurrected body in a renewed creation.

567
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,760
 This is what God wants for us, what he has planned for us,

568
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:01,320
 what Jesus has died for, when he became the first fruits.

569
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:05,520
 That's the guarantee of what we are going to get.

570
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,200
 We need to know that God was the one

571
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,360
 who created physical bodies for humans in the first place.

572
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,840
 And God saw our bodies, and he said,

573
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,200
 Genesis chapter one says, "It is good."

574
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,960
 When God looked at our body, he says, "It is good."

575
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,520
 Humans, we're not souls trapped in flesh,

576
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,200
 but we're unified beings.

577
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,640
 In Hebrew, there is a word called nefesh.

578
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,280
 Like in Genesis two, I think it's verse seven,

579
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,520
 it says, "It's a living soul."

580
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,480
 God intended for our soul and our flesh

581
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,560
 to be united, to be one.

582
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:49,560
 We are unified being, soul and flesh together.

583
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,200
 But then our body was also corrupted

584
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,160
 by the fall of humanity, and we all know that.

585
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,680
 And because of sin coming into the world

586
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,600
 through the fall of humanity, diseases, death,

587
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,720
 and all the problems came into the world as well.

588
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:08,720
 And we start to experience all the sickness, aging,

589
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,760
 yeah, aging and physical decay, and all chronic illness.

590
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,440
 We experience like disability,

591
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,680
 or experience our bodies get weaker and weaker as we age.

592
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,880
 But that's not the original plan of God.

593
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,360
 That's not his original design for us.

594
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:30,120
 It's the consequences of a fractured world.

595
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,520
 Human bodies are broken because of our sins,

596
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,880
 but human bodies were not evil in its nature.

597
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,960
 Let me say that again.

598
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,680
 Our bodies are broken because of our sin.

599
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:45,160
 So we are experiencing sickness, aging, death,

600
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:49,380
 all these issues, but our bodies are not evil in nature.

601
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,760
 That's not how God sees it.

602
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,240
 He's not here to destroy our body.

603
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,960
 That's not how he sees.

604
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,960
 And when Jesus came into the world, word became flesh.

605
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:05,760
 He took on a bodily form.

606
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,960
 He took on human flesh.

607
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,840
 If human flesh is evil,

608
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,280
 Jesus would definitely not take on human flesh.

609
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,600
 But word became flesh.

610
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,720
 And when Jesus was ministering on earth,

611
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,320
 when he was walking around,

612
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,360
 he started manifesting the kingdom of God

613
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,440
 through one of his ministry called healing,

614
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,240
 restoring bodily or restoring physical health

615
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,400
 for individuals, for people.

616
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,760
 That is to say, that is a sign to say,

617
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,880
 hey, you know what?

618
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,160
 You wanna know when the kingdom of God fully comes to earth?

619
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,480
 You wanna know how it looks?

620
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,420
 It looks like this.

621
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:43,240
 This is a sign when sickness and disease

622
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,280
 and death was reverted.

623
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,680
 When someone is healed,

624
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,600
 when he experienced physical shalom,

625
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,160
 that's the kingdom of God at hand.

626
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,400
 And so Jesus was healing people

627
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,360
 as a sign for them to know that

628
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:02,280
 this is the ultimate reality that God has planned for us.

629
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,240
 And not just that, when Jesus rose from the dead,

630
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,520
 he didn't have a spiritual resurrection.

631
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,160
 He had a bodily resurrection.

632
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,640
 He even asked his disciples, hey, come touch me, touch me.

633
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,440
 It's me in my body.

634
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,400
 It's a bodily resurrection.

635
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,280
 And we need to know this.

636
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,680
 God is not rejecting our bodies.

637
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,840
 He's not rejecting human bodies.

638
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,600
 God's plan was never to reject them.

639
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,760
 God's plan is to redeem our bodies.

640
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,600
 Let me say that again.

641
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,240
 God's plan is not to reject human bodies.

642
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,040
 His plan is to redeem our bodies because he created them

643
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,720
 and he saw that was good.

644
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,280
 And if our body, it's part of God's salvation plans,

645
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:51,040
 if it actually matters to God,

646
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:56,040
 then how we treat our bodies would actually matter as well.

647
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,360
 Don't you agree?

648
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:03,160
 Since our bodies are not disposable or temporary shells

649
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:06,480
 but we're destined for redemption,

650
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,800
 how we treat our bodies today matters.

651
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,240
 I'm going to talk about a few ways

652
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,680
 that we could treat our bodies

653
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:18,320
 or learn from the theology of our body

654
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,720
 that I just spent 15 minutes to unpack.

655
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,480
 I'm going to share a few practical tips for us.

656
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,200
 So number one, we should be honoring God

657
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,320
 with our bodies today.

658
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,600
 That includes like pursuing purity.

659
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,160
 You know, in 1 Corinthians 6, it says that your body,

660
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,040
 don't you know that your body is the temple

661
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,800
 of the Holy Spirit?

662
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:45,280
 Don't you know that, you know, in Romans 12 says this,

663
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:49,600
 do you know that you should give God your body

664
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,280
 to honor him, to worship him?

665
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,880
 Didn't you know that we should honor God

666
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,960
 with our bodies today, pursue purity,

667
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,200
 get away from sexual immorality?

668
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,200
 That is something that hurts us deeply in our flesh

669
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:09,120
 and we should also care for our physical health

670
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,640
 and the sense of stewardship.

671
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,360
 And we're not idolizing health.

672
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,400
 I know there are like many things you can do about health

673
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,600
 and some people, they really,

674
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,400
 oh, I don't care how it's most important.

675
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,960
 Maybe for some people, health or wellbeing,

676
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,400
 it's more important than God, but we're not doing that.

677
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,000
 We're just trying to take good care of our bodies

678
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,520
 as good stewards of what God has given us,

679
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,800
 knowing that this is God's temple, he stays there.

680
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,080
 And so we know we need to rest when we're tired.

681
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,480
 Don't drink soft drinks, drink more water.

682
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,640
 I learned that from Cristiano Ronaldo.

683
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,560
 It's a good motto on that.

684
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,080
 A good nutrition.

685
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,240
 Yeah, these are the basic stuff,

686
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,320
 but these are the things people have forgotten,

687
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,120
 that we are treating our bodies so bad

688
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:59,000
 in a way that we are hurting our bodies.

689
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,120
 We're saying, I don't care what happens to you

690
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,840
 as long as my soul goes to heaven.

691
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,960
 No, we need to treat this.

692
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,880
 We need to know that God is here to redeem our body.

693
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,920
 And so we're not here to worship fitness,

694
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:15,440
 but we're here to honor the Holy Spirit who lives inside.

695
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,440
 So we honor God with our bodies

696
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,480
 and we need to see physical suffering

697
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,120
 with hope and not despair.

698
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:30,360
 Like I know sometimes we ourselves,

699
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,560
 we experience sickness or illness.

700
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:38,120
 Or the painful fact that one day you find out like,

701
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,360
 oh, I'm aging.

702
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,240
 I can see it on my forehead.

703
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,880
 I can see it when I go to gym.

704
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,040
 I can sense it.

705
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,080
 I know my body is deteriorating.

706
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,520
 And sometimes even sickness that we don't wanna face,

707
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,200
 some terminal illness.

708
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,280
 One day you find out, oh, I've got this condition.

709
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,040
 I know it's painful.

710
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,400
 I know it's challenging.

711
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,080
 I know it's not easy.

712
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,040
 And sometimes they feel so real.

713
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,880
 Or most of the time they feel very, very real.

714
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:10,560
 I've had the experience.

715
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,840
 I mean, I had family members who went through that.

716
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,400
 I know what it does to not just the person,

717
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,240
 but the family around them.

718
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:22,840
 But when we are going through physical suffering,

719
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:26,400
 we need to know they're not the end of the story.

720
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,640
 No matter how loud they're speaking to us,

721
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,280
 that's not the end of our story here.

722
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,480
 The world tries to tell us when you die, you die.

723
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,680
 There's nothing else.

724
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,880
 So you better do something,

725
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,160
 make people remember you, make memories.

726
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,520
 These are not bad advice,

727
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,600
 but we also know that that's not the end of the story.

728
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:49,600
 Death and cancer and diseases and a deterioration,

729
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,760
 they don't have the final word in our lives.

730
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:57,040
 I know that even one day we close our eyes and we passed on,

731
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:02,040
 but the day when Jesus, on the day when he returns,

732
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,560
 I know that this body, this dead body,

733
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,280
 very dead body, maybe ash,

734
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,960
 I don't know where my body would be,

735
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,640
 but this body will experience resurrection,

736
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,840
 a bodily resurrection.

737
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:18,320
 And I know that one day we're gonna stand somewhere,

738
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:23,320
 I don't know where, but somewhere in a new bodily form.

739
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,440
 Paul was describing, you know what?

740
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,600
 That old form, it's weak, but the new one is glorious.

741
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,920
 This one is perishable,

742
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,320
 but what you're gonna get is imperishable.

743
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,800
 Paul was trying to tell you, hey,

744
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,520
 that body that Jesus received, that resurrected body,

745
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,600
 that's the same body you're gonna get.

746
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,720
 So whatever you're facing right now,

747
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,680
 maybe you're passing on from this life,

748
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,880
 but you have to know that that's not the end.

749
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,320
 If you're thinking about life

750
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,760
 as though the day that the doctor gave you,

751
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,720
 the amount of time the doctor gave you

752
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,080
 is how much time you have, you need to think larger,

753
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,560
 you need to think eternity,

754
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,240
 you need to know that there is something else there.

755
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,720
 You got a lot more time to spend when Jesus comes back.

756
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,920
 There should be hope and not despair.

757
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,520
 In Romans, Paul was saying like,

758
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,800
 we groan inwardly as we wait eagerly

759
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,680
 for the adoption of a sonship for that glory

760
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,680
 and the redemption of our bodies.

761
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,880
 We are waiting patiently

762
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,400
 for that redemption of our bodies.

763
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,200
 But in the same chapter, Paul was also describing,

764
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,480
 you know what, you guys are not just the only ones

765
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,240
 that is waiting for God's renewal.

766
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,120
 In fact, the entire creation of God

767
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,840
 has been groaning with you.

768
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,280
 They are also waiting for that day

769
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,120
 for God's glory to reveal,

770
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,880
 for the sons, for the children of God to reveal

771
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,320
 so that they would receive that renewal as well.

772
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,360
 We preach a sermon on that,

773
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,160
 on justice and creation last year.

774
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,840
 You can go back to YouTube and check on it.

775
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,400
 But here's the thing that, you know,

776
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,440
 we're not the only ones who are waiting

777
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,600
 for this renewal or resurrection.

778
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,840
 God is going to renew us, resurrect us,

779
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,720
 but God is going to, on that day,

780
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:13,480
 he's going to renew his entire creation as well.

781
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,960
 So if you're on God's team,

782
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,560
 what you should be thinking is,

783
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:21,840
 how am I gonna minister this renewal,

784
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:26,840
 this redemption of God's work over the entire creation,

785
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:30,360
 rather than, oh, you know what,

786
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,880
 this world is gonna end anyway.

787
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,680
 Maybe someone will press a button

788
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,200
 and there will be a nuclear bomb,

789
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,960
 or you know, pollution, you know,

790
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:43,840
 climate change, or this world is doomed,

791
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,440
 so I don't have to do anything,

792
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,080
 or I can just, you know, just do it the same way,

793
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,840
 continue to enjoy my life.

794
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,920
 If you're really on God's side,

795
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,920
 if you take your place at his side,

796
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,680
 you know that his heart is to redeem,

797
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,440
 and his heart is to save that creation.

798
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:07,440
 So if you take your place as the steward of God's family,

799
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,400
 we actually have a place,

800
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,920
 we actually have a role to play in his creation.

801
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,520
 We are waiting for our own bodily resurrection,

802
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,520
 but we also have a role to play

803
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,080
 in the redemption of the creation.

804
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:25,520
 And so you can respect your body,

805
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,080
 you can treat your body better,

806
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,200
 knowing that this is how you honor God.

807
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,720
 You pursue purity, and you know that

808
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:37,720
 even when you're facing sickness, or death, or suffering,

809
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:41,000
 you know that you hold onto that hope

810
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,400
 that one day God is gonna come and make things right,

811
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,760
 but then also you need to know

812
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,600
 that you're not the only one waiting for that day.

813
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:53,240
 The entire creation has been waiting with you.

814
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:56,720
 And so what we can do is to find a place in it.

815
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:03,600
 So in December, when I was in the car,

816
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:07,560
 when my daughter asked me that question,

817
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,200
 are we all gonna die?

818
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,040
 Like, I was just praying,

819
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:16,040
 and I felt like answering her question this way.

820
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,720
 I said, yeah, you know what?

821
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,920
 As human beings, we all die.

822
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,000
 We all leave this earth someday,

823
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,400
 and we'll have to say goodbye, it's gonna be sad.

824
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:32,280
 But that's actually one way of life, if you stick with it.

825
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,200
 There's a person, if you stay with that person

826
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,080
 your entire life, if you try to build relationship

827
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,040
 with him every day, a deeper and deeper relationship,

828
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,640
 if you follow his ways, his name is Jesus,

829
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:47,480
 if you do that, if you dedicate your entire life to do that,

830
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:52,480
 one day when death comes, you'll actually be ready.

831
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,640
 You'll not be afraid.

832
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,360
 You'll know that, yeah, I know today is the day

833
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,680
 that I'm leaving this earth, that I'm passing on,

834
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,240
 but I'm not afraid.

835
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,440
 There's no regret in me.

836
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,160
 I can greet my creator, I can greet my savior

837
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,000
 with a grin on my face.

838
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,780
 I'll tell him, yes, I've been waiting for you.

839
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:21,320
 You are the one I've been longing to see my entire life,

840
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:26,240
 face to face, and I know one day when your time comes,

841
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,680
 when you come back to earth,

842
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,240
 I'll receive the resurrection of my body with you,

843
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:38,120
 and I'll continue to see all my loved ones face to face

844
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,680
 in a new body again.

845
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,120
 That's the day I'm waiting for.

846
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,840
 That's the day I'm preparing my family for,

847
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:52,140
 and that's the day God wants us as his family

848
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,160
 to get ready for.

849
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,580
 If we know what's gonna happen the day when he's coming back,

850
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,960
 if we understand Jesus being the first fruit,

851
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,360
 if we understand what that means,

852
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,600
 a guarantee that we will all experience the same thing

853
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,960
 that he has experienced on Easter Sunday,

854
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,520
 on the feast of first fruits,

855
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,920
 that should affect how we're spending our everyday.

856
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,120
 That should affect how we live our life.

857
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,620
 Don't you agree, church?

858
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:21,000
 Why don't we spend some time to pray together now?

859
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,440
 Father, we come before you.

860
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:37,880
 We thank you for the first fruits.

861
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:44,640
 Father, we thank you that the resurrection of Jesus

862
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,560
 is indeed the first fruits,

863
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,040
 and when we look at that,

864
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,480
 when we look at his resurrection,

865
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,640
 we have the guarantee, we know for sure that one day

866
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,920
 that's exactly the same thing we will experience as well.

867
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:03,380
 And so, Father, today we come before you.

868
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:12,320
 I just feel like praying for some of us in the midst.

869
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:19,920
 Maybe you're struggling with the fear of death,

870
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,740
 fear of a disease, fear of the weakness

871
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:26,520
 that you're experiencing in your body,

872
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,740
 fear of aging, perhaps.

873
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:41,160
 I wanna pray for you that today you know the truth,

874
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:44,480
 you know God's plan, and the truth will set you free

875
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,560
 from the fear you're experiencing.

876
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:52,800
 That when you look at the first fruits,

877
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,800
 when you look at Jesus, you have the assurance

878
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,160
 that you will get a new body,

879
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,760
 you will experience the resurrection,

880
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,280
 and there's life after death.

881
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:10,040
 Not just a spiritual, like, flowing and floating

882
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:13,120
 in the air kind of life, but you will get a new body,

883
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:17,160
 and you will be enjoying life in God's new creation.

884
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:21,480
 There's real hope.

885
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,060

886
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:31,080
 And you don't have to live according to your fears,

887
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,440
 you don't have to be driven

888
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:39,400
 by what you're afraid would happen in the end to you.

889
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:43,240
 You know there is something else waiting for you.

890
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:51,560
 Father, I pray you would come and set us free

891
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:57,420
 from the fear of death, from the fear of disease,

892
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:02,740
 from our illness, weakness,

893
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:07,840
 the fear of being old,

894
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:13,260
 that we know there's an eternity awaits for us.

895
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:16,000
 (gentle music)

896
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,540
 Father, I pray that knowledge of your truth

897
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:25,060
 will transform our lives,

898
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:26,820
 will change the way we think,

899
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:28,980
 change the way we speak,

900
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:30,900
 will change our lifestyle,

901
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:33,460
 will change how we plan our days,

902
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,420
 how we plan our everyday schedule,

903
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:42,060
 change the way we spend time with friends and family,

904
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,020
 (gentle music)

905
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:48,420
 I pray that today you will put your eternity in our hearts.

906
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:52,140
 In Jesus' name I pray, amen.

907
