1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
 Man, well good morning.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,280
 If you're joining us online, good morning as well.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,640
 It's good to see everybody back.

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,560
 We've enjoyed another week of black rainstorms

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,520
 and crazy weather.

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,840
 I know what's going on, seriously.

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,640
 It's craziness in the weather,

8
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,760
 but I'm glad everybody is here this morning.

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,360
 See some old familiar faces, which is good as well, right?

10
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,280
 And so yeah, really good to see friends

11
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,460
 and family gathered together this Sunday.

12
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,840
 And if you've been walking with us through this summer,

13
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,060
 we've come to the end of our sermon series

14
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,900
 in the book of James.

15
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,140
 And the hope and the prayer is that we've been changed

16
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,900
 and moved and challenged to consider our faith seriously.

17
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,180
 Right, that we've not just been walking through a letter,

18
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,060
 but we've been letting the words through scripture

19
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,000
 penetrate our hearts.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,380
 It's a reminder that this life that we claim to live,

21
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,820
 that faith that we came to have,

22
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:59,720
 there is no room in scripture for nominal Christianity.

23
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,360
 Right, there's no room for saying I am a Christian

24
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,900
 and coming on Sunday and worshiping with our hands up,

25
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,740
 all that kind of stuff, without actually living it out.

26
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,500
 Because if we do that, it's just noise.

27
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,460
 It's just a distraction.

28
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,980
 It's almost craziness, right?

29
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:16,020
 There's a lot better places you could spend on a Sunday

30
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,160
 than coming here to this church, if you're not about that.

31
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,500
 But James lets us know, right, that real and pure religion,

32
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,500
 right, that following Christ must make a difference

33
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,440
 in the way we live our lives.

34
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,660
 Right, it has to transform everything that we do.

35
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,140
 It's a transformative kind of faith

36
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,940
 that Jesus calls us to have.

37
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,700
 It's an active kind of faith, right,

38
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,180
 that moves us into deeds and actions and not just words.

39
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,060
 It's a countercultural kind of faith

40
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,760
 where we're not friends with the world,

41
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,280
 but we are standing in our friendship with the Lord.

42
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,680
 Otherwise, like I said, all this is just noise.

43
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,740
 Actually, I got some really cool feedback lately.

44
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,060
 One of our teenagers, as he's been walking

45
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,020
 through the book of James, he's been listening,

46
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,700
 he's been reading the book of James,

47
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,300
 I hope by himself as well, he noticed,

48
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,300
 so in response to what he felt like God's speaking

49
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,020
 to his heart, he said he was walking down the road one day

50
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,100
 and he saw someone in need and so he stopped

51
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,940
 to give some money to this person that was in need.

52
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,440
 And as a result, the person behind him saw

53
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,520
 what he was doing and they too stopped

54
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,720
 and gave a little bit of money.

55
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,120
 And the person in front of him turned around

56
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,560
 and saw what he was doing and also gave

57
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,940
 that person a little bit of money.

58
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,180
 Right, just a small act of kindness, right,

59
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,560
 set off a chain reaction in the people around him.

60
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,640
 You see what difference it makes when we actually

61
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,880
 put some actions behind this faith that we claim to have?

62
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,440
 It's amazing, it's beautiful.

63
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,680
 But there's one more reason why I felt

64
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,320
 or we felt like it was important for us

65
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,640
 to go through this book of James and embrace its challenges.

66
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,960
 And that is because there is an urgency to our faith.

67
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,840
 You see, if you read through the entire letter of James

68
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,400
 in one sitting, which I highly recommend you do,

69
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,640
 right, you'll notice that throughout the letter

70
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,460
 there is a pressing, there's a desperation

71
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:15,400
 to remind everyone that time is short.

72
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,320
 Right, that Jesus is returning soon just as he promised.

73
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,480
 Right, which is why James is strong in his tone, right?

74
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,240
 We've held no punches back throughout this series.

75
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,700
 He is strong in his tone, it's challenging,

76
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,200
 but yet there's a deep and tender pastoral heart

77
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,580
 for the hearers of this letter.

78
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:42,400
 And the urgency and the reminder that we cannot wait

79
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,000
 to act upon this, our faith in Jesus

80
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,080
 must start making an impact right now.

81
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,440
 So once again, read with me as we come

82
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,640
 to the closing words of this letter.

83
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,840
 Yes, it's gonna continue to be challenging,

84
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,240
 but at the same time, I hope you know

85
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,240
 that it's filled by love and the passion

86
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,660
 and the recognition that there is no time to waste,

87
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,960
 that our time for our faith to make an impact

88
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,320
 is indeed right now.

89
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,200
 James chapter five, chapter first one.

90
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,800
 Now, now listen, now listen, you rich people,

91
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:24,160
 weep and wail because of the misery that is coming on you.

92
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,760
 Your wealth has rotted, moths have eaten your clothes,

93
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,500
 your gold and silver are corroded.

94
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,560
 The corrosion will testify against you

95
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,640
 and eat your flesh like fire.

96
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,860
 You have hoarded wealth in the last days.

97
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,480
 Look, the wages you failed to pay the workers

98
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,400
 who mowed your fields are crying out against you.

99
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,800
 The cries of the harvesters have reached the ears

100
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,280
 of the Lord Almighty.

101
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,200
 You have lived on earth in luxury and self-indulgence.

102
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,040
 You have fattened yourselves in the day of slaughter.

103
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,680
 You have condemned and murdered the innocent one

104
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,320
 who was not opposing you.

105
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,680
 Told y'all it's not easy.

106
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,880
 Have you guys ever heard the saying,

107
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,400
 it's a bit funny, but I've heard it around,

108
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,120
 money doesn't solve all your problems,

109
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,560
 but I sure wouldn't mind crying in a Laberghini, right?

110
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,960
 So, I've never been, if you have a Laberghini out there,

111
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,560
 okay, good for you, it'll be fun

112
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,160
 to ride around in one sometime.

113
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,480
 But there is a sense of irony in that saying, right?

114
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,900
 Because we don't usually associate rich people

115
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,040
 with things like weeping and wailing and misery, right?

116
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,400
 Because we feel like they have resources,

117
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,000
 they have everything they need, so why are you sad?

118
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,680
 But when we look throughout scripture,

119
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,480
 throughout the Bible, there is a consistent warning,

120
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,560
 maybe one of the most consistent warnings,

121
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,720
 which goes something along the lines of,

122
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,200
 be careful of how much you focus on money.

123
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,200
 Because God knows it's so easy for our heart

124
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,640
 and our desires to be drawn to money,

125
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,940
 and how quickly the love of money has to rob our ability

126
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:04,600
 of having affections for the Lord and the people around us.

127
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,240
 And once our distraction to money becomes,

128
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,960
 once money becomes an idol, that the risk there

129
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,640
 is that we start to do all kinds of unjust

130
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,160
 and blasphemous acts to the Lord and to each other.

131
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,920
 Right, this is what we talked about in James chapter two.

132
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,320
 When those who have, those who have the resources,

133
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,000
 refuse to pay any kind of attention to those who are in need

134
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,080
 instead of just a good, you know, pat you on the back,

135
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,920
 okay, see you later, you go off on your way.

136
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,360
 But I have the resources, I'm not gonna help you.

137
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,680
 The love of money is truly the root

138
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,920
 of all kinds of evil, scripture tells us.

139
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,680
 So why then are the rich suddenly weeping and wailing?

140
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,320
 Right, it's because they're suddenly seeing the riches

141
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,240
 disappear before their very eyes.

142
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,920
 Your wealth has rotted, James says.

143
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,760
 Moths have eaten your clothes.

144
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,040
 Gold and silver are being corroded.

145
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,720
 The corrosion will testify you

146
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,440
 and eat your flesh like fire.

147
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,880
 You have hoarded wealth in the last days.

148
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,800
 You see, the foolish thing about dedicating ourselves

149
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,800
 to material wealth is because material wealth will not last.

150
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,320
 In the context of James, wealth was often tied

151
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,560
 to the abundance of produce from farming.

152
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,160
 But what happens when you hoard food?

153
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,000
 We've done this before, right?

154
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,920
 You go to the supermarket, ooh, avocados are on sale, right?

155
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,280
 You get like 15 of them and they just sit

156
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,440
 below your microwave and just wilt and die

157
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,240
 before you have a chance to eat them, right?

158
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,280
 When you hoard food, it starts to stink and rot

159
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,720
 and it becomes useless.

160
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,240
 Clothes too, right?

161
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,880
 We know when Hong Kong winter is coming,

162
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,880
 November 5th seems to be the magic date

163
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,560
 when everybody busts out those winter coats, right?

164
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,000
 An entire bus and empty out all the streets,

165
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,640
 suddenly starts smelling like mothballs, okay?

166
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,400
 Because they've been in storage, okay?

167
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,600
 So mothball becomes the scent of the month, okay?

168
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,360
 But even your clothes, right, no matter how fine they are,

169
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,880
 no matter what brand they are,

170
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,400
 one day your clothes are gonna become worthless.

171
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,720
 The moth will eat them, those little silver bugs

172
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,160
 that we get in Hong Kong will chew through them.

173
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,040
 They will become worthless.

174
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,280
 James is saying even gold and silver,

175
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:20,120
 two metals that are associated with being incorrodible,

176
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,280
 always holding their value, right?

177
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:27,160
 Even one day, gold and silver are gonna become worthless.

178
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,840
 They will corrode and disappear.

179
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,040
 And as we look towards the last days,

180
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,200
 we have to keep this in mind.

181
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,360
 And make no mistake, church,

182
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,520
 this is, these are the last days that we're living in.

183
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,560
 Ever since Jesus died and resurrected

184
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,680
 and ascended to heaven,

185
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,880
 he assured us, he has promised to us

186
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,960
 that one day I am going to return.

187
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,080
 And when he returns, yes, it's coming back to love

188
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,200
 and to restore and to redeem,

189
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,320
 to defeat the enemy once and for all, amen,

190
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,520
 to make all things new,

191
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,680
 to judge, to put an end to all injustice.

192
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,920
 He's coming, scripture tells us,

193
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,640
 to judge the living and the dead

194
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,480
 and to gather those who are faithful to him

195
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,360
 and welcome them into his kingdom.

196
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,520
 Now, when we talk about this topic, though,

197
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,320
 it sounds like one of those things

198
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,120
 that's always threatened,

199
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,280
 but it's never going to happen.

200
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,680
 Right, you know like,

201
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,160
 if you go to the big department stores like Wing On, right,

202
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,160
 there's always, they're always doing

203
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,280
 a final promotional sale, right?

204
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,560
 So you go and buy something, it's like,

205
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,640
 (speaking in foreign language)

206
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,920
 Right, and stuff, you know.

207
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,120
 And then next to it you go,

208
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,200
 and then it's suddenly like a super big final sale, okay?

209
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,440
 So you think, okay, this is my last chance, okay?

210
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,840
 And then you go a few weeks later,

211
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,880
 it's the last super big, super promotional sale, right?

212
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,120
 And so, it just keeps going on and on and on.

213
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,960
 It's just a marketing tactic, right?

214
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,480
 It never actually ends, right?

215
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,120
 And you realize it's just a big scam.

216
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,720
 They just want you to buy stuff.

217
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,680
 But church, this is not the case.

218
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,960
 This is not what we're talking about here, right?

219
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,840
 The return of Jesus is not a scam, right?

220
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,240
 It's not some made up story aimed to keep us on our toes.

221
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,400
 Jesus said it himself,

222
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:14,120
 "Keep watch, you do not know on what day or hour even

223
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,680
 "the Lord will come."

224
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,760
 And just as Pastor Carla said last week,

225
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,440
 God's economy is not our economy.

226
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,240
 God's timing is not our timing.

227
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,560
 And so therefore, we are called to live

228
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:32,280
 as if Jesus will really return at any moment.

229
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:36,880
 And in these last days before Jesus comes back,

230
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,400
 in the time where Jesus has already begun the work

231
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,880
 of inaugurating his kingdom here on earth,

232
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,800
 to making things new, to redeeming his creation,

233
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,720
 hoarding wealth is the exact opposite

234
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,720
 of what he has called us to do with our resources.

235
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,520
 When Jesus came back,

236
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:58,040
 didn't he flip this entire approach on its head?

237
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,000
 Instead, didn't he say, "Blessed are the poor,

238
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,360
 "for theirs is a kingdom of heaven."

239
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:09,440
 Didn't Jesus teach us, as hard as it is for us to hear,

240
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,520
 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle

241
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,400
 than it is for someone who is rich

242
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,160
 to enter the kingdom of God?

243
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,440
 Wasn't Jesus' words to the rich young ruler,

244
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,320
 "If you want to be perfect, go, sell all your possessions,

245
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,320
 "give it to the poor, you will have treasure in heaven,

246
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,160
 "and then come follow me."

247
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,480
 So hoarding wealth doesn't make sense,

248
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,200
 but there's something even worse going on here.

249
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,120
 It's not just that the rich have hoarded all this wealth.

250
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,240
 The bigger problem is they have done it

251
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,080
 on the backs, on the expense of other people.

252
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,600
 First 4 says this, "Look, the wages you have failed

253
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,480
 "to pay the workers who mowed your fields

254
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,600
 "are crying out against you.

255
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,760
 "The cries of harvesters have reached the ears

256
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,440
 "of the Lord Almighty.

257
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,280
 "You have lived on earth in luxury and self-indulgence.

258
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,720
 "You have fattened yourselves in the day of slaughter.

259
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,000
 "You have condemned and murdered the innocent one

260
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,360
 "who was not opposing you."

261
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,480
 All this wealth that these people have

262
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,480
 has been created through dishonest and unjust practices.

263
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,440
 Right, and the law, the Levitical law had rules

264
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,560
 addressing this kind of behavior.

265
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,720
 Deuteronomy 24 says this, "Pay them their wages,

266
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,760
 "pay the workers their wages, each day before sunset,

267
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,640
 "because they are poor and they're counting on it.

268
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,880
 "Otherwise, they may cry to the Lord against you,

269
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,360
 "and you will be guilty of sin."

270
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,080
 So James is concerned about the attitude

271
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,880
 and the fact that the rich are not using their resources

272
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,040
 to help others just as the Lord has instructed us to do,

273
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,320
 but rather they would live selfishly,

274
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,840
 in luxury, in self-indulgence.

275
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,560
 And James is condemning the fact that we are hoarding wealth

276
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,400
 where we should use it to help those who are in need.

277
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,440
 And you see, like I said just now,

278
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,920
 this is one of the dangers.

279
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,640
 When we make money and resources and idol,

280
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,600
 the danger is we dehumanize image bearers of God,

281
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,360
 of God's people and his children.

282
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,760
 And while we're enjoying luxury and self-indulgence,

283
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,080
 people aren't even being given what they are due.

284
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,120
 And our eyes and ears become so dull

285
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,280
 that we're blinded and muted for seeing and hearing

286
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:36,280
 those who are crying out, but God sees it all.

287
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:40,440
 Now we enjoy this thinking.

288
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,240
 We're set, things are good for me.

289
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,160
 I don't have a worry in the world.

290
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,960
 And when we live like this, James says,

291
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:51,440
 it's like we're fattening ourselves just to be slaughtered.

292
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,360
 It's almost like a comical picture.

293
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,440
 We are sacrificing ourselves to this worldly God

294
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,600
 of luxury and comfort.

295
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,000
 We're like the fattened calf, we're like Wagyu beef.

296
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,320
 You know how Wagyu beef, they feed the cows,

297
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,600
 all kinds of stuff, fatten it up.

298
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,520
 The end result of that cow,

299
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,360
 while he's enjoying all that stuff, right?

300
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,200
 So, oh, this is great.

301
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,200
 You know, I'm being massaged,

302
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,960
 I'm being fed all this good food.

303
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,200
 In the end, what's the end of that cow?

304
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,520
 To be slaughtered, right?

305
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,560
 And this is exactly what we're doing, James says,

306
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,440
 when we just indulge in ourselves

307
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,200
 and ignore the cries of those around us.

308
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:31,640
 The fate that awaits is slaughter, it's death.

309
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:37,520
 Church, if we make our goal in life,

310
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,800
 if what we want to do with our time in this world

311
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,200
 is just enjoy as many luxuries as possible,

312
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,560
 whilst at the same time ignoring the cries

313
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,920
 of those who are in need,

314
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,480
 Scripture likens it to murdering innocent people.

315
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:58,160
 And we are condemning ourselves.

316
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,280
 And we sit around thinking, you know, there's time for that.

317
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,880
 I'm gonna get to that one day, right?

318
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,840
 Right now, you know, I'm here for a good time,

319
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,360
 not for a long time, so I'm just gonna focus on me

320
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,160
 and do everything what I want to do

321
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:14,400
 when Jesus could literally return at any moment.

322
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:21,120
 Brothers and sisters, part of our pure faith

323
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,080
 means that we cannot live like this.

324
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,440
 We cannot live like we don't want that day to come

325
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,720
 because we've made life so comfortable for ourselves.

326
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,160
 And in living like the Scripture says,

327
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,880
 we are greedy, we are undressed, we are ungodly,

328
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,800
 and it will catch up with us.

329
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,480
 We are condemning ourselves.

330
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,680
 We're preparing our flesh to be eaten like fire.

331
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,560
 But instead, as followers of Jesus,

332
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,480
 we should be hastening the day.

333
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,680
 We should be crying out to the Lord to return,

334
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,920
 to make things right.

335
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,120
 We should be crying out for His justice,

336
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,240
 praying for the restoration of creation,

337
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,360
 joining in in God's work in restoring and repairing

338
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,480
 and redeeming humans to Himself.

339
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:10,960
 We look forward to the day when sin is no more,

340
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,360
 which means we are tirelessly trying to ensure

341
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:19,320
 that we are preparing the way for Jesus' arrival.

342
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,720
 We are preaching the gospel.

343
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,640
 We are reaching out to those in need.

344
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,920
 We are speaking out to those who are facing injustice.

345
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,840
 This is the mission we have at hand.

346
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,880
 And we cannot sit idly by,

347
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,680
 especially when there are people out there being oppressed

348
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,280
 and suffering from injustice.

349
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:44,840
 God's economy is not our economy.

350
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:49,720
 Jesus came to turn the entire system upside down.

351
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,640
 Karl Barth says it this way.

352
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,200
 "Instead of striving for higher position,

353
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,400
 "more power, and more influence,

354
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,200
 "Jesus moves from the heights to the depths,

355
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,840
 "from victory to defeat, from riches to poverty,

356
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,560
 "from triumphs to suffering, from life to death."

357
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:10,480
 Jesus came to say, "Blessed are the poor."

358
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,760
 And His ears are always tuned to hear the voices

359
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,000
 of those crying out for justice.

360
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,480
 So we're reminded today, church,

361
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,800
 that we're here on God's time.

362
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,960
 Just because it hasn't happened yet,

363
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,640
 don't think that it's not going to.

364
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,800
 And Jesus is returning.

365
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,880
 James reminds us of that.

366
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,040
 And so to end this letter,

367
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,040
 He gives us some instructions on how He wants us to live.

368
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:41,160
 Taking care of the poor, the widow, and the orphans,

369
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,560
 doing God's work of justice.

370
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,480
 But there's two more things He wants us to embrace

371
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,360
 as we look into these last days.

372
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,360
 The two things are this, patience and prayer.

373
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,880
 Patience and prayer.

374
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,680
 Let's look at patience for a minute.

375
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,800
 Firstly, James calls us to be patient in the Lord.

376
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,600
 Now again, in our modern day lives,

377
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,000
 it's almost like the entire idea of patience

378
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,320
 is trying to be erased from our vocabulary.

379
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,600
 We don't like waiting for stuff.

380
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,760
 Everything is marketed towards the idea

381
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,480
 that the faster, the more convenient it is,

382
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,840
 the better for us, right?

383
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,680
 [speaking in foreign language]

384
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,640
 Right, that's a Hong Kong motto.

385
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,320
 Right, everything is on demand.

386
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,760
 You can order anything you want at any time

387
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,720
 with the touch of a button.

388
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,000
 You can have food, clothes, anything you want delivered

389
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,400
 right to your doorstep almost immediately.

390
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,440
 Now, I would be a hypocrite to say

391
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,920
 I don't enjoy the conveniences of modern life, right?

392
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:43,000
 It's great sometimes to have those things available to us.

393
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,080
 But again, the danger is that this way of living

394
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,600
 robs us and dulls us of how God wants us to respond

395
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,840
 to how He wants us to live.

396
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,520
 And we forget the value in waiting

397
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,560
 and having patience in the Lord.

398
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:03,000
 Waiting on the Lord will always lead

399
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,120
 to something of great value.

400
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:10,520
 Every time we wait on the Lord, it's not time wasted.

401
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,800
 It's not doing nothing, but it's trusting

402
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,800
 that God is doing something

403
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,960
 and that one day it's going to bear fruit, right?

404
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,600
 This is why patience is part of the fruit of the Spirit

405
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,860
 that Scripture encourages us to grow in.

406
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:29,920
 That's why patience is a key component of love.

407
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,560
 And when we are patiently waiting on our Lord,

408
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:37,240
 it's a sign of the hope and the faith that we have in Jesus.

409
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:41,440
 James uses a illustration of agriculture

410
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,920
 to highlight this to us.

411
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,720
 He says this, "See how the farmer waits for the land

412
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,860
 "to yield its valuable crop, patiently waiting

413
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,040
 "for the autumn and spring rains.

414
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,880
 "You too, be patient and stand firm

415
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,700
 "because the Lord's coming is near."

416
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:02,120
 Again, we go to our wet markets, we go to Welcome,

417
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,160
 we go to Park and Shop, wherever we like to do our shopping,

418
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,320
 and we see the rows and rows of fruits and vegetables,

419
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,560
 the meat, everything is right there ready for us

420
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,320
 just to take to the counter, check out, and take home.

421
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,440
 But next time we go, be mindful.

422
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,360
 The way that produce got there wasn't just magic, right?

423
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,760
 It wasn't just someone just made them appear.

424
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,320
 It's gone through the time of growing, of tilling.

425
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,160
 There was a farmer or a process, right,

426
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,120
 that all that stuff had to go through

427
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:36,260
 in order for it to end up on our supermarket shelves.

428
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:41,080
 And there was a person who planted seed and waited,

429
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,680
 and it seemed like nothing was happening

430
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:46,480
 until that plant begins to break through the soil.

431
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,600
 And this is the same for us.

432
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,560
 Whilst we are waiting, while God is calling us

433
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,320
 to be patient, we're like a farmer.

434
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,720
 We're hard at work, planting seeds, tilling the ground,

435
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,280
 knowing that God is the one who's gonna do the growing,

436
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,080
 and that in due time, we will reap a harvest

437
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,400
 to collect in God's name.

438
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,760
 So we are patient in the Lord.

439
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,200
 But James also tells us this.

440
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,360
 As we do that, we need to be patient with each other.

441
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,320
 Don't grumble against one another, he says,

442
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,480
 brothers and sisters, or you will be judged.

443
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,320
 The judge is standing at the door.

444
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,600
 Another danger we face as a community

445
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,800
 as we wait for God to return

446
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,960
 is that we start to get impatient.

447
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,640
 And when we get impatient, it's easy to start complaining

448
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,440
 and grumbling and attacking each other.

449
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,600
 Remember what Andrew said a couple of weeks ago

450
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,800
 when we need to, the fact that we need to watch our tongues?

451
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,840
 When we get impatient and grumble,

452
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,800
 we tend then to speak words that are unkind, right?

453
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,120
 Words of death rather than words of life.

454
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,080
 And in these last days, this is what Jesus

455
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,360
 is looking after for.

456
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:05,080
 He's especially concerned about his people and his church.

457
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,440
 But when we grumble against each other,

458
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,400
 when we fight and we quarrel,

459
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,480
 we cannot be the unified body of Christ

460
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,080
 that he has called us to be.

461
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,800
 We cannot be the hands and feet that he has called us to be.

462
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,960
 When we're busy attacking each other,

463
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,000
 how can we be that voice that speaks out

464
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,480
 for the innocent and those who are suffering injustice?

465
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,280
 When we're so caught up with the splinter

466
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,880
 in each other's eyes, how can we see the evil

467
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,600
 that is happening around us?

468
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,840
 This is why James reminds us, right?

469
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,600
 Don't think just because we're not like those rich oppressors

470
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,220
 that he was talking about at the beginning,

471
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,060
 that God isn't coming to judge us either.

472
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:47,600
 We should be speaking and acting as if Jesus

473
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,700
 was right at the gates, right at the door.

474
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,360
 Maybe even imagining him putting his ear against the door,

475
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,880
 seeing what's happening inside.

476
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,500
 Any time to open the door.

477
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,560
 And when he does enter, how is he gonna find his church?

478
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,880
 How he's gonna find his people?

479
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:08,600
 Fighting and grumbling or steadfastly and patiently

480
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,940
 doing the work that he has called us to do.

481
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:16,940
 And finally, James calls us to also be patient in suffering.

482
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:23,260
 Because the call to patience here isn't the kind of patience

483
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,920
 just enough just to wait for a few extra minutes

484
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,240
 for a coffee to be made.

485
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,800
 The patience that God is looking for

486
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,220
 is the steadfast kind of patience

487
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:35,720
 that even when things aren't going our way,

488
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,100
 we hold on to his promises.

489
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,480
 Even in the toughest of situations.

490
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:46,240
 And to make his point, James asks us to consider the prophets.

491
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,160
 Consider the prophets and the things they had to go through.

492
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,280
 Now I both love and I'm terrified by the fact

493
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,640
 that James tells us that we need to be patient in suffering

494
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,080
 and then he turns us to the prophets.

495
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,960
 And even though he doesn't mention any prophet

496
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,360
 in particular by name, if you read through

497
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,320
 the Old Testament and the things the prophets

498
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,840
 had to go through, right, they had to suffer

499
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,000
 through all kinds of stuff in God's name.

500
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,420
 And in fact, it was often God himself

501
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,820
 who calls his prophets into seasons

502
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,980
 of perseverance and suffering.

503
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:22,260
 Look at Jeremiah for a second.

504
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,100
 Jeremiah was a man of God.

505
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,760
 But this man of God endured constant persecution,

506
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,500
 ridicule, and death threats all through his ministry.

507
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,200
 Everybody mocked him.

508
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,580
 Everyone was trying to convince him to shut up,

509
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:39,260
 just denounce God, stop talking about it.

510
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:42,920
 But even when he himself tried to shut up,

511
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,540
 he said this, these were his words.

512
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:48,580
 His word in my heart is like a fire,

513
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,980
 a fire shut up in my bones.

514
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,380
 I'm weary of holding it in.

515
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,580
 Indeed, I cannot.

516
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:58,580
 Right, this quote sounds cool and we like it, you know.

517
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,940
 But this was Jeremiah speaking out of a place

518
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,920
 of desperation.

519
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,700
 This was Jeremiah saying, I'd rather be doing anything else.

520
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,900
 Do you know the amount of stuff I've been through

521
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,020
 as I speak God's name?

522
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,460
 I would rather be doing anything else

523
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,920
 than speak God's word that he tells me to.

524
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,840
 But yet he chooses to anyway.

525
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:20,940
 And he patiently suffers and endures

526
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:25,180
 even though he knows the positions it's gonna land him in.

527
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:28,900
 Take Ezekiel, right, doing something

528
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,540
 that made no sense to anyone.

529
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:34,300
 God told him to lay on his side for 390 days

530
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,100
 in an illustration to God calling him

531
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,220
 to demonstrate how many days Israel

532
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,500
 had been lost in their sin, right?

533
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,500
 Lying down on his side, 390 days,

534
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,220
 just lying there like that, right?

535
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,740
 I don't know if you'd be patient enough to suffer that.

536
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:52,620
 Take Hosea, who had to patiently endure his wife

537
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:56,720
 running off to other men time and time and time again.

538
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,320
 Yet God kept telling him, you have to keep loving her.

539
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,100
 You have to keep pursuing her.

540
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,220
 Never, do not leave her side.

541
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:10,360
 God uses us in patient suffering.

542
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,860
 So if you're suffering for Jesus right now,

543
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:17,620
 take heart, you are not alone.

544
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,380
 You are never alone.

545
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:23,860
 And in the meanwhile, know that your character

546
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:27,500
 is being forged through these seasons of difficulty.

547
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,700
 God uses it to transform us.

548
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,860
 Back in chapter one of James, he says this,

549
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:36,180
 blessed is the one who perseveres on the trial

550
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,720
 because he has stood the test.

551
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,500
 That is the person who will receive the crown of life

552
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,700
 that the Lord has promised to those who love him.

553
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:51,300
 As we remember these things, as we practice patience

554
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,520
 in the Lord with each other in our suffering,

555
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,380
 remember this too, that the Lord

556
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,900
 is full of compassion and mercy.

557
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,580
 See, as we look through these things,

558
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:08,340
 it might seem like God is this angry and fiery judge,

559
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:11,140
 itching to come back so he can show everybody what's up.

560
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,800
 That's not his heart, really.

561
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,420
 And time and time again, more often than not,

562
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:20,540
 scripture reminds us that God is full of mercy.

563
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:24,840
 He is full of compassion, that his love is everlasting,

564
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,260
 that his blessings go beyond a thousand generations,

565
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:32,940
 that he sacrificed his son in order to show us his love.

566
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:36,900
 And ultimately, his nature is not to punish and to slaughter

567
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,140
 even though that is a consequence,

568
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:42,620
 but it is to bless and to love.

569
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:46,020
 So when we're patient in the Lord,

570
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:52,500
 the result is always to come into his blessings in our life.

571
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,520
 Now, those might come in all sorts of ways.

572
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,200
 I'm not saying prosperity gospel here,

573
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,140
 don't hear me wrong, okay?

574
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,020
 But what I'm telling you is this,

575
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,160
 in all the suffering that we have to go through

576
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:08,180
 in the name of Jesus, if we persevere,

577
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:12,120
 if we keep our faith in him, he will restore you,

578
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,400
 he will come through for you in his will,

579
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,580
 in his way, and in his time.

580
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:21,480
 So we hold on to patience, church.

581
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,840
 And one thing we cling on to in this journey of patience

582
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:33,000
 is prayer, we have to have prayer.

583
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,420
 Prayer is like one of those immovable building blocks

584
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,760
 of our relationship with Jesus.

585
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,320
 Prayer is one of those amazing privileges

586
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,900
 that we get as the children of God.

587
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:47,480
 But if we're honest, prayer is also a bit of a mystery,

588
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:52,480
 because it's hard to fully understand how it works.

589
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,440
 When you try to explain prayer to someone

590
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,720
 without any kind of faith at all,

591
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,280
 it might sound like some sort of ramblings of a mad person.

592
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,920
 People might think you're crazy.

593
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,160
 You're talking, what are you, talking to a magical sky fairy,

594
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,800
 you just whisper your wishes into the air,

595
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,640
 and you're just hoping that something's gonna happen,

596
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,520
 somehow it's gonna make a difference.

597
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,720
 Well, even in secular culture, so that's one side of it,

598
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,640
 but on the other side of it, for people

599
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,040
 who don't have a faith in Jesus,

600
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,960
 maybe sometimes prayer seems like

601
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,360
 some sort of cosmic slot machine.

602
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,280
 So you launch a prayer into the sky,

603
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,360
 and it's like pulling a wheel and pulling a handle

604
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,040
 to see if you come up with a jackpot.

605
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,880
 Oh, ding, ding, ding, yes, my prayer's got answered

606
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,440
 this time, right?

607
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,600
 Or you just throw a prayer,

608
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,340
 Bon Jovi has a whole song about it, right?

609
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,840
 You're living on a prayer, right?

610
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,600
 You see what happens, I'm just gonna say these words,

611
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,420
 but I don't know who it really is going to,

612
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,660
 I'm just gonna hope for the best.

613
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:50,660
 James gives us no room to doubt the power of prayer

614
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:54,020
 and the absolute essential role it plays

615
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,560
 in our relationship with Jesus.

616
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:00,260
 And we have to pray in all circumstances,

617
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,460
 in all situations.

618
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:04,820
 He says, "As if you are in trouble,

619
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:07,080
 "is there anyone among you in trouble?

620
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,860
 "Let them pray.

621
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:12,680
 "If you are happy, let them sing songs of praise.

622
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,440
 "If anyone among you is sick,

623
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,960
 "let them call the elders of the church to pray over them

624
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,680
 "and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord.

625
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,520
 "And the prayer offered in faith

626
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,100
 "will make the sick person well.

627
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,180
 "The Lord will raise them up.

628
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,380
 "If they have sinned, they will be forgiven."

629
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:32,500
 Right, what a beautiful contrast this is

630
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,980
 from the type of community we started the message with.

631
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,620
 Right, in the beginning, we saw people out for themselves,

632
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,300
 living in indulgence, you know,

633
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,460
 and being unjust to each other.

634
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,380
 But James is letting us know that when we're able

635
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,860
 to put the material things aside,

636
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:51,460
 when our focus and our heart's desire is made right,

637
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:54,020
 not to abuse and take advantage of each other,

638
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,980
 but rather now the focus becomes on ministering

639
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,340
 to each other, to loving each other,

640
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,780
 to praying for each other, to making sure

641
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:04,220
 that we're taking care of the sick,

642
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,620
 of offering prayers of faith.

643
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:10,060
 This is the kind of church Jesus is looking for.

644
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,540
 This is what it looks like when heaven meets earth.

645
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:16,500
 This is what it means to bring hope to this world.

646
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,560
 Because when we pray church,

647
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,520
 we are not talking into thin air.

648
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:24,960
 Prayer is not a cosmic slot machine.

649
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,680
 When we pray church, we are giving our petitions

650
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:32,040
 to the King of Kings, the all-powerful, all-merciful,

651
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,640
 all-loving God who loves everybody,

652
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,120
 the one who is able to do all things.

653
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,740
 This is precisely why prayer works,

654
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,700
 because God is who he says he is,

655
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,760
 because he is close to us.

656
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,740
 And this is why when we pray,

657
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:53,180
 we can have one foot in the mess and the craziness

658
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:56,920
 and the suffering that we all have to face in life,

659
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,340
 but the other foot knowing full well God is who he says he is

660
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:03,340
 and that he is good, he is merciful, he is just,

661
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:06,820
 he is there for us in our time of need.

662
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:11,160
 We stand firm on his promises when we pray,

663
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:14,140
 no matter what we are facing.

664
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,920
 If we're in trouble, we can pray.

665
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,000
 If we're happy, we can pray.

666
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,360
 We sing these songs, we pray this way

667
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,680
 because we know who God is.

668
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:30,720
 But there's one more component about prayer

669
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,900
 that makes it even more beautiful.

670
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,600
 And it's the reason why we're sitting gathered

671
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,620
 here today, it's the reason,

672
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,460
 it should be the reason why you're coming

673
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,980
 every single Sunday to a gathering like this.

674
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,600
 It should be the reason why you're gathering

675
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,540
 in your community groups or your friendship groups.

676
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:49,940
 It's because prayer isn't just you and the Lord.

677
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:52,060
 Prayer is something that God wants us to do

678
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:56,860
 as a community, together, as brothers and sisters,

679
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:59,380
 as family, right?

680
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,020
 And this is one of the wonderful things

681
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:04,100
 about knowing Jesus and being part of his family

682
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,880
 is that we can count on other people

683
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,000
 to pray for us as well.

684
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,740
 James says here, "If you're sick, call the elders,

685
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:16,400
 "the faithful, the righteous people to pray for you."

686
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,600
 And let me tell you, church, that our elders

687
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,780
 here at the Vine are faithful and righteous people.

688
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:26,040
 The colleagues I have the honor to work with

689
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,300
 are faithful and righteous people.

690
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,360
 So this is a part of the Bible we can take literally.

691
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,800
 If you are sick, if you are in need,

692
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,980
 call us, we're here for you, we want to pray for you,

693
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:39,140
 we want to hear what you're going through.

694
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:42,180
 Come and pray in faith with us,

695
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:45,900
 and we will pray, and we will ask God in faith,

696
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,820
 we will bring your petitions before God

697
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,300
 and allow his will to be done.

698
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:54,860
 But I also want us to hear this as well,

699
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,780
 and really hear this, right?

700
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,620
 Praying for each other in this way,

701
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,980
 it's not just reserved for the leaders and the elders

702
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,300
 and the pastors of this church.

703
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:06,840
 But every single person who has a faith in Jesus

704
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,760
 has the right, has the access,

705
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,960
 I would even say has the responsibility

706
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,580
 to do this for each other.

707
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:16,460
 But we saw a beautiful example of this

708
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:19,140
 last week at the 11 a.m. service,

709
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,640
 when Linda came forward in faith to receive prayer,

710
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:26,960
 and in response, we as a church prayed in faith

711
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,480
 for her healing, right?

712
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,740
 I don't know about you, but to me,

713
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,480
 that was a beautiful reflection

714
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,420
 of what the church is for.

715
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,600
 And I'm honest, like last week,

716
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,360
 what happened was not planned at all, right?

717
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,880
 During the 9 a.m. service, I was worshiping,

718
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,000
 and I was praying, and I heard the Lord say to me,

719
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,580
 "You need to give people the opportunity

720
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,000
 "to come forward and receive prayer,

721
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,360
 "'cause there's someone out there

722
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,840
 "who is in need of prayer right now."

723
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,420
 So it was just a simple response of obedience

724
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:58,840
 to call for prayer from the church to someone in the church.

725
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,880
 And it was beautiful.

726
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:07,360
 It was amazing moment in the life of our family.

727
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:11,000
 Now, could you imagine, church,

728
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,040
 how much more would things change

729
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,560
 if everyone in this room was dedicated

730
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,220
 to praying for each other,

731
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,740
 even outside of this space on Sunday,

732
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:22,680
 that constantly we're practicing our faith in this way,

733
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,940
 praying for healing, praying for miracles,

734
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:27,120
 praying for God's power to break through,

735
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,160
 praying for our city, praying for our families,

736
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,520
 praying for the world.

737
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:34,400
 The effect of this would be universe-shaking, church.

738
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,200
 And this is what James is talking about.

739
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,400
 He gives us a little example of Elijah, a man of faith,

740
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,680
 who prayed that it wouldn't rain, and it didn't rain.

741
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,360
 And then he prayed for rain, and then it rained.

742
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:50,520
 James tells us this, you see, prayer really works.

743
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,560
 There is an effect.

744
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,300
 We're not talking to nobody.

745
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:57,740
 We're talking to our all-powerful, loving Creator in heaven.

746
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:02,160
 We are talking to our Savior when we join voices in prayer

747
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,900
 and make our petitions known to Him.

748
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:09,160
 And it's not just physical healing.

749
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,080
 It's also for the healing of souls.

750
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:16,580
 Prayer has the ability to change our destiny,

751
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:19,560
 our situations right here on this earth,

752
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,400
 but also in the life to come as well.

753
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,360
 And there's a kind of healing that takes place

754
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:31,360
 when we pray, because it's able to save us from our sin.

755
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:35,680
 See, above all things,

756
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,900
 sin is the most destructive force in our lives.

757
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:42,040
 And we've all experienced this.

758
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,160
 We go against God's will.

759
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,020
 We take things into our own hands.

760
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:49,680
 We go when God says stop.

761
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,320
 We let the lust of our eyes and the desires of our flesh

762
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,280
 get the better of us.

763
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:58,920
 We use our words to tear down instead of build up.

764
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,440
 And we fight, we quarrel, we gossip.

765
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,840
 We become friends with the world,

766
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,520
 and we turn our backs to God.

767
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,480
 We have envy and selfish ambition.

768
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,280
 We show favoritism to people.

769
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,080
 We ignore the needs of the poor.

770
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:18,020
 Sin will 100% absolutely tear you apart,

771
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,880
 tear your relationship with God apart,

772
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,300
 and tear your relationship with other people apart.

773
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,720
 That is the destructive power of sin.

774
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,100
 So what do we do?

775
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:30,600
 We pray and we confess.

776
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,880
 James says it this way.

777
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:35,760
 Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other

778
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,940
 so that you may be healed.

779
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:41,260
 And confession is one of those things

780
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:44,280
 that's become a bit lost because it's scary.

781
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,340
 It is a bit scary.

782
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,600
 It's hard to confess sin.

783
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,440
 Right, and when we do it,

784
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,320
 we feel like there's a certain shame that comes

785
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,960
 because we don't want people to see the mess we're in.

786
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,300
 And so we hide and we don't allow other people to know.

787
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:04,520
 But I think all of us in this room have also felt this too.

788
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,200
 That every time we hide our sin, right,

789
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,680
 we are actually playing directly

790
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,880
 into what the enemy wants us to do with it.

791
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,060
 And when we don't deal with sin,

792
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:17,040
 we give it the opportunity to grow, right?

793
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,680
 It's like a mold that just festers in the dark

794
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,840
 and the longer you don't deal with it,

795
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,800
 the more it will grow

796
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,960
 and destroy your relationship with God and others.

797
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,280
 Paul describes it as like a web that so easily entangles us

798
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,760
 that it was like we're covered in these webs

799
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,360
 and the more we try to struggle ourselves to get out of it,

800
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,140
 the bigger the mess we find ourselves in.

801
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,460
 That is what sin does to us.

802
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:44,280
 And James lets us know here, there is a way out.

803
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,140
 One of the ways we deal with it,

804
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:49,460
 the way to deal with sin is through confession.

805
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:53,920
 Yes, it's scary, it's hard to do.

806
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,120
 And I've been in those situations

807
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,200
 where I know I've messed up

808
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,860
 and I know I need to open my mouth

809
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:02,000
 and admit what I've done wrong,

810
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,180
 confess my sin to those who I've sinned against.

811
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:07,600
 And I've been in small groups too

812
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,960
 where there's been a group of us people

813
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,320
 that have been walking together.

814
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,600
 And one of the brothers has come up

815
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,600
 and he's confessed things that he's been losing himself to,

816
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,780
 sin that he's been wrestling with.

817
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,540
 And yes, there are consequences.

818
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,540
 This is not like a magic eraser,

819
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:26,100
 everything makes better immediately when we confess our sin.

820
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:30,860
 There are consequences to deal with because sin is messy

821
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:33,000
 and it does take time to figure things out

822
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,380
 and pick up the pieces.

823
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:37,820
 But know this too, church,

824
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:40,480
 the end result when we confess

825
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,640
 is always a step towards restoration and healing.

826
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,300
 And I believe some of us are sitting in this room today

827
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:53,680
 and you are suffering greatly because of your sin.

828
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,220
 And you feel like you're in anguish

829
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:00,160
 because of where your sin has led you to.

830
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,940
 And you're sick and tired of the power

831
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:06,120
 that sin has over you.

832
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:10,300
 Listen to these words.

833
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:13,900
 God can free you if you would allow yourself

834
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,740
 to embrace confession,

835
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:19,440
 come alongside a brother and sister,

836
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,840
 confess your sin with us together in front of the Lord

837
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,380
 so that you can be healed.

838
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,980
 Now I'm not saying everybody come up

839
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,460
 and grab the microphone right now

840
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,640
 and air all your dirty laundry here, okay?

841
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,980
 That's not the point.

842
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:37,240
 But it is being honest about where you are.

843
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,620
 It is asking God to help you.

844
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:42,500
 And it is inviting someone who you trust,

845
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,900
 someone else who loves the Lord to come alongside you,

846
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,180
 to tell them what you're struggling,

847
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,780
 tell them what you're going through.

848
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:53,960
 I've had this addiction that I can't get rid of.

849
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,620
 I've hurt people in this way.

850
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,260
 I've been dishonest with my family.

851
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,940
 I've been dishonest in my practices and business.

852
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,720
 Whatever the sin is,

853
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:05,880
 what would it be like if we had a community

854
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,380
 that was able, honest enough with each other,

855
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:11,060
 that loves the Lord enough, that loves each other enough

856
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:13,460
 that we could confess these things freely

857
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:16,360
 within our community so that we can find healing?

858
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:20,300
 And in fact, I do believe this is something

859
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,240
 that the Lord has been growing us in

860
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,300
 as a church of the vine,

861
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,780
 especially throughout this year, right?

862
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,180
 We have seen beautiful moments

863
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:29,900
 of people gathering together to pray

864
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,860
 for those who are hurting,

865
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:33,180
 to pray for those who are lost in sin.

866
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:35,380
 We have had moments when sin has been confessed

867
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:38,860
 and people have found healing and restoration

868
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,620
 as a part of that process.

869
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:45,280
 So this is the task at Hand Church.

870
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,100
 Are we willing to do these things?

871
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,140
 In the light of Jesus returning,

872
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:53,740
 he has called us to be an active,

873
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:57,660
 a steadfast, a patient community of faith

874
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:04,040
 that looks forward to Jesus coming back.

875
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:09,680
 And is tirelessly working to welcome him when he does.

876
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:14,820
 This is the power of God at work in our lives

877
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:15,880
 and in the church.

878
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:21,140
 So the question is, after these five weeks,

879
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,900
 how should we respond?

880
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,340
 And time is short.

881
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:28,100
 We have no time to lose.

882
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:32,160
 And James has called us to a genuine, active,

883
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,880
 righteous, loyal, and prayer-filled faith.

884
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,200
 Will we respond to this church?

885
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,940
 If you would close your eyes for a second

886
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:46,180
 and just allow the Lord to speak to you right now.

887
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:54,940
 You know, and over the past five weeks,

888
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:57,260
 perhaps God has used different parts

889
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:00,300
 of this series to talk to you.

890
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,660
 Maybe it was in a moment of worship.

891
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:05,720
 Maybe it was in the prayer line.

892
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:09,740
 Maybe it was through one of the messages that we've heard.

893
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:25,320
 And the Lord loves us too much not to leave us

894
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:29,420
 with instructions and his desires for us.

895
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:32,000
 (gentle music)

896
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:40,300
 And so Jesus, I pray that as a community,

897
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:43,120
 that we would encourage each other in this way always.

898
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:48,660
 That you would keep our minds and our hearts fixed on you.

899
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:54,620
 That we would always be a voice that cries out

900
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:56,720
 on behalf of those who have no voice.

901
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,300
 (gentle music)

902
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:03,800
 That we would always be steadfast in our faith.

903
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:09,480
 Not double-minded, not hot and cold,

904
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:17,580
 but fully focused and sold out completely

905
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:21,180
 to your love at work in our lives.

906
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,000
 That the way we speak of each other

907
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,220
 would always be honoring and uplifting.

908
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:34,620
 That our loyalty to you is true,

909
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:38,220
 even when we face the temptations of this world.

910
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:45,560
 And that we are patiently waiting,

911
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:49,920
 actively working towards building your kingdom

912
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,080
 here on this earth.

913
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:55,580
 Jesus, we know you hear our prayer.

914
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:59,420
 And so Father, help us in this journey.

915
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:02,700
 And until we see you again face to face, Lord,

916
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:06,020
 guide us and lead us in your love.

917
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:10,540
 In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

918
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:20,540
