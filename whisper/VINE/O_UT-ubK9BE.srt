1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
 - Well, thank you, Andrew, for that almost kind introduction there.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,280
 That was very nice.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:06,880
 Good morning.

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,840
 It's a great privilege to be with you.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,240
 Thank you all for giving me this opportunity to share this morning with you.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,120
 One of the great privileges of the job that I have is that I get to travel

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:25,960
 around the world and be with the people of God in a variety of churches all

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,840
 around the world.

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,800
 And this morning, I do want to begin by just affirming what social commentators

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:42,120
 and sociologists are observing about our era, which is that it's an extraordinary

11
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:50,400
 era of disorientation, and instability, and confusion.

12
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:56,880
 All over the world, humans are experiencing by far the most accelerated

13
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:03,440
 pace of technological change, cultural upheaval, and data stimuli

14
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,440
 in human history.

15
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,200
 And here in Hong Kong, these years have been especially difficult.

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,520
 I was last here in 2019 as social unrest was mounting.

17
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,920
 Then this shocking pandemic descended, followed by very sharp economic

18
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,560
 uncertainties, growing geopolitical tensions, and then a war in Eastern Europe

19
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,960
 and war in Middle East.

20
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,000
 Globally, it's very easy to sense that an aching confusion, and fear,

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,520
 and grief is growing even more intense.

22
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,520
 And especially in advanced economies like Hong Kong, where sociologists see an

23
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,640
 unprecedented rise in what they now call the statistics of sadness,

24
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:04,320
 anxiety, social isolation, depression, loneliness, addiction, and suicide.

25
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:11,960
 So I think the pressing question is this, in such difficult and disorienting times,

26
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:17,560
 what clarity can the followers of Jesus stand on?

27
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:25,280
 Or are Christians just as confused and disoriented as everybody else?

28
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,760
 Or worse, is Jesus perhaps just as confused and caught off guard

29
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,560
 as everybody else?

30
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,760
 Personally, I don't think He is.

31
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:42,480
 And so maybe the followers of Jesus don't need to be either.

32
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,800
 Especially as you, I think, are emerging out of this conversation you've been

33
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,840
 having with the book of Exodus about our own journeys to freedom.

34
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,960
 A freedom for what?

35
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:02,960
 Because this whole question of disorientation, it does seem to require a

36
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:08,000
 return to our most basic orientation as to our purpose as Christians.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,440
 Why are we here?

38
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,280
 Jesus has an answer to that question, but it's an answer that makes zero sense

39
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,240
 to the instincts of the world or to the intuitions of our human nature.

40
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,520
 But here it is.

41
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:32,320
 The reason that we are here on earth is to be agents of Christ's redemption in

42
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,800
 broken lives and in a fallen world.

43
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:43,600
 Put another way, the people of God are most who they are meant to be precisely

44
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:49,600
 when the world is least as it was meant to be.

45
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:57,600
 Matthew 5 tells us that Jesus calls His followers, you and I, the light of the

46
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,520
 world and the salt of the earth.

47
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:07,560
 Which sounds great until we realize that light finds its purpose and power where?

48
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,240
 In darkness.

49
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:19,400
 And salt, a first century preservative, finds its purpose and power in decay.

50
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:25,760
 Here Jesus is simply trying to help us, I think, find our footing by giving us

51
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:31,800
 clarity about our redemptive purpose in what is a manifestly fallen world.

52
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,840
 Because with clear purpose in mind, why we're here, we have clear expectations

53
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,800
 about the journey.

54
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,320
 Christians are not meant to live grimly, wallowing in all that's dark and decaying

55
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,560
 in the world.

56
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,280
 Quite the opposite.

57
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,280
 For as I'm going to speak to in a moment, the only way to sustain our redemptive

58
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,400
 role in the world is by drinking deeply from life's beauty and goodness and joy

59
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,480
 and abundance.

60
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:06,080
 But Jesus does invite us to experience the chaos, confusion, and heartache of our

61
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:13,480
 world very differently because of two things, an orientation of purpose and a

62
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,600
 supernatural spiritual preparation.

63
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:24,240
 As to the orientation of purpose, it's meant to be singularly redemptive,

64
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:33,840
 which means God has to send us to where things are wrong.

65
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,400
 The people of God are most who they are meant to be when the world is least as it

66
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,440
 was meant to be.

67
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,440
 I was thinking about this the other day, and to me it came to mind as the

68
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:52,920
 difference between an airbag in a car and a cup holder in a car.

69
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,840
 Cup holders serve their highest purpose, and it's a great purpose.

70
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,080
 It's amazing it took humans so long to invent the cup holder, but we have.

71
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,720
 And cup holders serve their highest purpose when everything is going just right

72
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,560
 in the car.

73
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,120
 You and your best friends are on a holiday and you're driving in your rental car down

74
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,360
 the highway, and amazingly there's no traffic.

75
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:21,760
 And the right song on your playlist has come on, and right there by your side is

76
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:28,600
 your perfect beverage, right there in the cup holder.

77
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:36,280
 In that perfect moment, the cup holder is everything it was meant to be.

78
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:42,200
 Now the airbag, by contrast, serves its highest and best purpose when everything

79
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,280
 is going desperately wrong in the car.

80
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:53,040
 At the point of high-speed collision when steel is crushing in and chaos is hurling

81
00:06:53,040 --> 00:07:01,720
 soft bodies into hard objects, this is the moment the airbag lives for,

82
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:10,160
 to rush into, not away from the chaos, to place itself between the violence

83
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,960
 and the vulnerable, and to save lives.

84
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:22,080
 And I think in a fallen and broken world, Jesus says we're meant to be more the

85
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,000
 airbag than the cup holder.

86
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,320
 Because if you think about it, in a fallen world, what is God's plan for making

87
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,080
 it believable that He is good?

88
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,240
 Jesus says to His people, "We're the plan."

89
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:44,120
 And He doesn't have another plan.

90
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:50,840
 He says to us, "You are the light of the world."

91
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,600
 But how fallen should we expect the world to be?

92
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:01,200
 Well, when Jesus tells His iconic Good Samaritan story, His example of the

93
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,800
 neighbor in need, what does that look like?

94
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:11,000
 It's a man who's grabbed by robbers, stripped naked, beaten, and left for dead.

95
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,120
 This is our neighbor.

96
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,560
 The Good Samaritan story is our central calling to love others.

97
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,840
 But notice it's not a cute story, actually.

98
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:28,320
 Jesus is setting an expectation about the kind of world into which He's sending us

99
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,560
 to love.

100
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,840
 Second, Jesus is expressing an expectation about the kind of love that we are

101
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,720
 actually capable of.

102
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:47,600
 Jesus believes you and I are capable of supernatural love.

103
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:54,960
 He thinks we're capable of heroic airbag love, love that moves into pain and

104
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,120
 into peril.

105
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:04,360
 Now, that kind of sounds inspiring, but also kind of terrible.

106
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:10,120
 But this is what makes the love of Jesus supernatural, supernatural.

107
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:15,240
 It's a love that is above and beyond our human nature, a love that only comes

108
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:21,840
 through a spiritual transformation of us by the power of the Holy Spirit.

109
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,520
 In the story of the Good Samaritan, Jesus gives us a really vivid example of

110
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,320
 natural love in the priest and the Levite.

111
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,200
 What do they do?

112
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,600
 They walk on the other side of the road.

113
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,680
 They're looking for their purpose in Jericho, where everything is going quite

114
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,520
 well.

115
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:45,440
 The Samaritan, by contrast, manifests supernatural love that moves into the

116
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,240
 pain of the man who is left along the road.

117
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:57,080
 But why is this supernatural love so important to Jesus?

118
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:03,160
 Because it is supernatural acts of love that end up pointing to God and giving

119
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,880
 Him glory.

120
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,240
 Because the quality of love is so manifestly beyond what humans are

121
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,760
 naturally capable of.

122
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,960
 So let's make this practical.

123
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,400
 What does this kind of supernatural love look like?

124
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,120
 Well, as Andrew was saying, I work for International Justice Mission, and many

125
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,320
 of you have been wonderful supporters and encouragers of that work here at this

126
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,000
 church for many, many years.

127
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,480
 And IJM now consists about 1,500 IJM staff who are local indigenous Christians who

128
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,800
 live and work in some of the poorest communities around the world.

129
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,640
 And as the body of Christ, they lean into some of the darkest and most evil

130
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,560
 violence in the world.

131
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,440
 In the Philippines, for example, our local teams are taking on the nasty scourge of

132
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,520
 online sexual exploitation of children.

133
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,960
 Yes, there is such a thing, and it is as horrible as you could imagine.

134
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:04,160
 And it's the sickness that's gone viral in the poorest neighborhoods since the

135
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,720
 pandemic.

136
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,240
 Basically, sexual predators in London or New York or Moscow, they pay criminals in

137
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:18,080
 the Philippines to be able to direct live the sexual abuse of children online.

138
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,960
 Children like this eight-year-old boy, Marco, who lives in a slum under the

139
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,000
 control of an abusive relative.

140
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,480
 Now, this crime has exploded during the pandemic.

141
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,080
 And Philippine authorities, they get thousands of case referrals every month

142
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:38,160
 from around the world about Filipino children who are being abused.

143
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:44,040
 Another example of leaning into the darkness, at a time when many countries,

144
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:49,400
 including my own, are faced with problems of police abuse, Christians in Kenya are

145
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,960
 facing a particularly terrifying plague of police violence.

146
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:59,600
 Police routinely just round up people who are poor and throw them in jail as a way

147
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,120
 of extracting bribes from them.

148
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:07,520
 During the first few months of the COVID pandemic, the Kenyan police killed three

149
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:14,080
 times as many citizens from enforcing the COVID quarantine than actually died from

150
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,240
 the disease itself.

151
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:22,360
 Some of you friends might remember that three of IJM's own were murdered by

152
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,120
 police in Kenya.

153
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,120
 That's leaning into the darkness.

154
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,040
 Third example of leaning into the darkness, in South Asia, Christians are

155
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,000
 trying to address the suffering of millions who are trafficked illegally

156
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,320
 into slavery.

157
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:42,600
 Pachiama, for example, is a young woman who was trafficked into a rock quarry as a

158
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,960
 young teenager, and she's forced to work seven days a week, 12 to 14 hours,

159
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,160
 breaking rocks with a hammer.

160
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,760
 The owners used terror and sexual assault to enforce their will upon scores of

161
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,720
 enslaved people.

162
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,440
 Pachiama herself had to watch a young child die in the quarry because the owner

163
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,560
 wouldn't allow the child to be taken to a doctor.

164
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,480
 And as the world knows, and as you probably know, millions of the world's poor are

165
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,360
 being crushed under the cruelty of modern slavery like Pachiama.

166
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,960
 And of course, in advanced economies, the body of Christ is also facing challenges.

167
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,800
 We all face them.

168
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,360
 The global Me Too movement some years ago surfaced this reality of abusive sexual

169
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,840
 misconduct that women and girls face in all kinds of socioeconomic circles.

170
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:40,160
 And human trafficking exploits immigrants, refugees, and vulnerable populations in

171
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,720
 every country.

172
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,800
 Altogether, the pain and upheaval at home and abroad is daunting, and it can feel

173
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,880
 pretty overwhelming.

174
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,360
 So where do we begin?

175
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,600
 I suggest that we can begin by returning to the clarity the scriptures provide

176
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,160
 about why we exist.

177
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:08,680
 As the Apostle Paul wrote in Ephesians 2.10, we're God's handiwork,

178
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:15,040
 created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to

179
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,600
 do.

180
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,920
 We know, of course, that these works don't save us, but we know those works bring

181
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:27,520
 glory to our Father who is in heaven when they manifest His supernatural love in

182
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,640
 the world.

183
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:36,000
 This is why we're here, to manifest a supernatural love.

184
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,360
 So where would that supernatural love come from?

185
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,960
 I have seen Christians in the poorest communities in the world battling

186
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:48,760
 incredible darkness and evil, and I see three qualities to their supernatural

187
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,440
 love.

188
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:58,040
 The first is a supernatural courage in their compassion, a supernatural

189
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:05,280
 willingness to draw near to the suffering and to be actually touched by it.

190
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,400
 When IJM's undercover investigations in the Philippines first exposed that

191
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:15,760
 children in the slums were being sexually abused online to paying customers around

192
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,680
 the world, no one wanted to look at that.

193
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:24,000
 Who wants to watch that video and get close to that pain?

194
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,200
 It was too grotesque and shameful.

195
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,600
 But soon, over time, IJM found some churches and church leaders in the

196
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,280
 Philippines who were willing to sound the alarm.

197
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:41,080
 They spoke about it from their pulpits, began to pray together about it by the

198
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,560
 thousands.

199
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,200
 And here at the Vine Church, you came alongside some of our Philippine and

200
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:52,840
 South Asian teams and provided prayers and partnership that then led to this

201
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:58,920
 second quality that I see, not just the courageous capacity for compassion,

202
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,720
 but also a supernatural generosity.

203
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,660
 Because after IJM worked with the authorities to conduct operations,

204
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,960
 we've done almost 1,500 operations rescuing kids out of these places.

205
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,920
 Here's the problem.

206
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,240
 There's nowhere for the kids to go.

207
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,680
 No one wanted to take care of the kids.

208
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,880
 It's not that they didn't want to, it's just it was too messy.

209
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,600
 Because many times, the victims are actually babies or boys,

210
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,640
 and those weren't usual categories for this kind of care.

211
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:34,080
 And so no one knew who to deal with it.

212
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,120
 But there were several church communities in the Philippines that stepped forward

213
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,120
 into the mess.

214
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,720
 And they had meager resources, but they opened up assessment centers

215
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,400
 and care facilities for a totally unfamiliar form of abuse.

216
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:55,840
 They took great risks in saying yes to the need before they had all the resources or

217
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,440
 all the know-how to meet it.

218
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:04,640
 Reminds me of the story of getting to know the needs of asylum seekers here.

219
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,520
 But now, due to the generosity of this community here in Hong Kong,

220
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:13,680
 and hundreds of children have been rescued by IJM and the authorities,

221
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:17,080
 and the Christian community in the Philippines is actually pioneering

222
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:23,560
 aftercare facilities and programs that are now a model in the rest of the world.

223
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:27,880
 We have a lot of hope for the fight against this evil of online sexual

224
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,160
 exploitation in the Philippines, because we've already seen other forms

225
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,600
 of child commercial sexual abuse reduced by between 75% and 85% over the last

226
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,480
 decade in the Philippines.

227
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,800
 Turns out that Jesus takes these very small offerings, like loaves and fish,

228
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:51,360
 and multiplies them to this extraordinary impact.

229
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,400
 Likewise, in South Asia, where you've been supporting our work,

230
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,680
 Christians have brought hope by manifesting this super generosity in providing a pathway

231
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:05,680
 of dignity and independence for people who are otherwise in places of slavery.

232
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:10,160
 When IJM and local authorities were able to actually help Pachiamma and dozens

233
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,840
 of other victims get out of that slavery in the rock quarry,

234
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,920
 Pachiamma and the others faced terrible destitution because floods had destroyed

235
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:23,760
 their mud homes and swept away all their meager possessions.

236
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,880
 Then, coalition of local churches and Christian students rallied their own

237
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:35,240
 resources with community and government to support, to provide permanent housing,

238
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:40,040
 running water, electricity, road works.

239
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:45,320
 And now, not only are Pachiamma and her family thriving, but Pachiamma has now

240
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,720
 become the general secretary of the local Released Bonded Laborers Association,

241
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,160
 which has more than 1,500 members.

242
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:57,760
 And Pachiamma and her team, they rescue hundreds from slavery.

243
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,600
 For Pachiamma and her community, this is the legacy of what?

244
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:09,640
 Of Christians responding to brokenness and pain with supernatural generosity.

245
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:16,400
 The third quality of love I see in this is supernatural persistence.

246
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,680
 These Christians manifest a love that doesn't go away.

247
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:27,240
 Children, imagine this, children healing from online sexual abuse need love

248
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,920
 for a long time.

249
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,960
 Typically for us, for five to 10 years.

250
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,080
 Now, who can do that?

251
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,440
 The local church can do that.

252
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,640
 They're a permanent presence in that community.

253
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:46,400
 Churches in the Philippines commit to these children's care and healing for years,

254
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,960
 taking care of trauma therapy, spiritual nurture, schooling, medical needs,

255
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,640
 therapy for families, livelihood training.

256
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:00,440
 And here's the real test of supernatural persistence in love.

257
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:07,080
 They stick with it even when it's not appreciated, even when the traumatized

258
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:12,760
 children lash out at them, even when all the efforts seem to fail,

259
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:17,200
 because sometimes they absolutely do.

260
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,440
 What does not fail is the persistence of the love.

261
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,640
 This is supernatural.

262
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,600
 Likewise in Kenya, churches in the slums have signed up to advocate for men

263
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,280
 who've been illegally detained.

264
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:38,560
 They do the scary work of confronting the authorities about the abuse,

265
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,800
 but they also do the long-term work of supporting families who are thrown

266
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:47,760
 into destitution when the breadwinner is thrown into jail.

267
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:53,280
 It's followers of Jesus who make sure that these families are seen,

268
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,400
 that they don't go hungry, that they're not alone,

269
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:02,720
 that they're prayed for for as long as it takes.

270
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,360
 So where does this capacity for supernatural love come from?

271
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:14,960
 It's clearly the work of the Holy Spirit transforming humans.

272
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,480
 But I also notice three things that Christians do to allow the Holy Spirit

273
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,760
 to get started in that transformation.

274
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,400
 And when they do it over and over again, the transformation becomes powerful

275
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,600
 and unstoppable.

276
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,000
 These believers do three things, I think.

277
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,360
 Number one, they take scary baby steps of love.

278
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,320
 They pray and they chase joy.

279
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,960
 First, scary baby steps.

280
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,400
 Because you and I were made for redemptive purposes,

281
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,600
 when you and I draw near to broken lives and the fallen world,

282
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,240
 what's going to happen?

283
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,760
 The Holy Spirit will suggest a scary baby step of love.

284
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,600
 And the trick is to take it.

285
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,000
 This is not easy, however, because you will have other voices as well.

286
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,240
 Our fallen nature will always suggest all the things we can't do.

287
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,760
 And our spiritual adversary will also suggest all the amazing things

288
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:24,320
 that we could do later when we're better prepared.

289
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:31,120
 But the Holy Spirit will suggest some baby step of love you can do now.

290
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:36,680
 But it will be a scary baby step because it's meant to be,

291
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:41,520
 because it takes you to a place where you actually will need God.

292
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,360
 This is necessary for us to authentically experience His power

293
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,400
 and His trustworthiness because that experience of Him

294
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,800
 will then give us the courage for the next scary baby step.

295
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,240
 What's important to understand about our brothers and sisters

296
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,000
 in the Philippines and Kenya and South Asia when I share their stories

297
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,360
 is how scary every little baby step of love was for them.

298
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,680
 Overwhelmingly, these are actually churches in poor communities,

299
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,960
 serving with deep dignity on thin margins, thin resources,

300
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,800
 thin training, and a thin line of survival, actually.

301
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:26,600
 But lots of consecutive scary baby steps have turned them into giants of faith.

302
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:32,680
 And as they take their scary baby steps, they pray.

303
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,960
 They talk to God about it.

304
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:41,160
 Because the baby steps are scary, they actually need Him.

305
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,360
 And instead of feeling like, "Oh, we are scared and need God,

306
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:50,720
 so we must be in the wrong place," they sense, "Oh, this is the right place."

307
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,600
 And then God shows up.

308
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,120
 He pours out His presence and power.

309
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,920
 And so then they pray more because they're thankful

310
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,920
 and because they need His help for the next scary step.

311
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,320
 And then they pray a lot.

312
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:10,160
 At IJM, we've learned a lot from this, which is why all of our teams

313
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:15,400
 all around the world stop all of our work twice a day, every day.

314
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,400
 Stop the work, pray for a half hour.

315
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,840
 Do a little more work, pray for a half hour every day.

316
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,560
 We tell our God we're scared, that we need help with the latest baby step.

317
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:34,600
 And we thank Him earnestly for how He carried us through the last one.

318
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:43,280
 Finally, we've learned from these believers of supernatural love to chase joy.

319
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,720
 This is sometimes the thing that gets missed.

320
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,040
 Because these followers of Jesus are able to love for the long haul

321
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:56,680
 because they continually come up for air and to chase joy.

322
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,920
 The Bible says the joy of the Lord is our strength.

323
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:05,040
 And so in ways that might surprise you, I find that my IJM colleagues

324
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:09,640
 laugh louder and harder than just about any Christians I know.

325
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:15,080
 They dance and sing in celebration of beauty and life.

326
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:20,000
 They play and joke and they get rid of all pretension.

327
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:27,320
 They worship with passion and authenticity the God who has proven Himself to be good.

328
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,280
 Then they go back to work.

329
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:36,440
 In chasing joy, you and I too can be refreshed with the Spirit

330
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:41,600
 for the next scary baby step of supernatural love.

331
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,040
 I think we have so much to learn from these Christians

332
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,520
 who are serving in these very difficult places.

333
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,240
 And I can tell you, they have loved and would continue to love

334
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,680
 your companionship with them.

335
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,280
 Many of you have experienced that companionship as you've connected

336
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:04,200
 with IJM and these teams around the world.

337
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,600
 And thanks to many of you, more than 88,000 individual victims of abuse

338
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,840
 and slavery have come to see freedom and wholeness.

339
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,720
 And now, as I mentioned, outside experts are studying these programs

340
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,240
 and find that they consistently produce reductions in violence of slavery

341
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:23,960
 by between 50 and 85%.

342
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:29,000
 And now we've identified scores of jurisdictions around the world

343
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,720
 that are ripe for that kind of transformation.

344
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,520
 This is a miracle of scale that Jesus seems to be preparing

345
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:42,000
 after all these decades of offering just small little offerings.

346
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,320
 And if you'd like to join that fight, please know that your brothers

347
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,120
 and sisters around the world would love your companionship in it.

348
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,120
 These teams around the world would love for you to join them

349
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,280
 in helping them protect some of the poorest communities

350
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,440
 in the world from violence.

351
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,240
 And please just know that this work proceeds because of the companionship

352
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,160
 of the body of Christ around the world.

353
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:09,200
 So take the time as you're able, IJM has a little table or booth outside

354
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,640
 to get to know the work and explore ways of connecting with us

355
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,960
 as a prayer partner, as a freedom partner,

356
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,680
 someone who regularly supports the work, to make this rescue

357
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,720
 and restoration possible.

358
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,280
 Please feel very warmly invited into all of that.

359
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:31,080
 These are difficult, disorienting times indeed.

360
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:36,360
 I have not been in a church around the world that isn't experiencing that.

361
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:42,560
 But Jesus is not disoriented or confused.

362
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:51,560
 He's crystal clear and unyielding about His sovereign purposes.

363
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:56,040
 And He's utterly determined to joyfully pursue those redemptive purposes

364
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,920
 through you and through me.

365
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,880
 Because the people of God are most what they are meant to be

366
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:12,040
 precisely, precisely when the world is least as it was meant to be.

367
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,160
 You are the light of the world.

368
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:20,760
 Let your light so shine among men and women that they'll see your good works

369
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,680
 and then give glory to your Father who is in heaven.

370
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:32,000
 Let's pray together.

371
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,920
 Kind Father, thank you that you love us so much,

372
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:41,840
 that you've given us life, that you've rescued our lives.

373
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,120
 And now you want to rescue your world through us.

374
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,840
 Father, will you take some word of truth that may be from you this morning

375
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:57,280
 and allow it to enter our hearts, to take root and to bear fruit

376
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,040
 for the glory of your name, Jesus.

377
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:00,960
 Amen.

378
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,540
 (gentle music)
