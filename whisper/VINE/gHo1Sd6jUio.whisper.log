[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920]   Amen, amen, amen.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.340]   Have a seat, have a seat.
[00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.820]   At the beginning of this year, in the very first devotional of the year, back in our
[00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.580]   fasting time in January, I wrote to you of a heart that I have for this year.
[00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.600]   And that heart, the desire that I have, is that the Holy Spirit would come and manifest
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.140]   itself more and more in our midst than ever before, and that we would see the ministry
[00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.300]   of the Holy Spirit amongst us like never before.
[00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.560]   You know, history will tell you that in a time where the Lord calls His people to uncharted
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.660]   waters, the season that we believe that the Lord is calling the vine into right now, when
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.500]   the Lord does that, what He's talking about is moving His people into a time where they're
[00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.000]   out of their comfort zone, a time where it's uncomfortable for them, a time where there
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.720]   is no strategy or roadmap for what might happen ahead.
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:00.800]   So it's a time where we have to be heightened to the witness and the work of the Holy Spirit
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.800]   amongst us.
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.140]   I would say now more than ever, we are in need here at the Vine of the manifest power
[00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.480]   and the glory of the Holy Spirit.
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.540]   And one of the things that I can testify to the joy that is inside of me over this year
[00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.400]   has been that I've seen an increase in the work of the ministry of the Spirit amongst
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.400]   us.
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.300]   And not just in the moment like we just shared together just now in our worship, as well
[00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.560]   as in our prayer and the ministry out of worship.
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.560]   Although we have seen, I think we can all witness an increase in the work of the Holy
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.740]   Spirit that way.
[00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.140]   But I think particularly in what happens often behind the scenes, in the transformed and
[00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.860]   changed marriages that we've seen transformed this year, into some of the relationships
[00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.180]   that we know were established that were broken before the reconciliation of some personal
[00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.180]   relationships.
[00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.380]   We've seen people physically healed this year, people coming to physical healing through
[00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.020]   the power of prayer and the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.500]   And then last week, in the testimony of the death and resurrection of Jesus on Easter
[00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.620]   Sunday, we saw 28 people go down to the waters of baptism and come up because the Holy Spirit
[00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.940]   has done something significant in their lives in bringing them into a place of faith.
[00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.180]   And I believe the things that we're already seeing at the beginning of this year are just
[00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.020]   the tip of the iceberg.
[00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.540]   It's just the first fruits of what the Holy Spirit wants to continue to do and how He
[00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.620]   wants to continue to manifest Himself amongst us in this season of unchartened.
[00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.580]   And here's a thing that I'm convinced of.
[00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:32.180]   I'm convinced that the greatest manifestations and expressions of the Spirit of God on earth
[00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.620]   are not behind us, they're ahead of us.
[00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.100]   Come on church.
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.380]   Let me just say this one more time.
[00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.340]   But listen to this because I know it sounds like a grand statement, but let me unpack
[00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.820]   this a little bit for you.
[00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.180]   It's so easy, I think, for us as Christians, when we open the Scriptures and we see the
[00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.860]   incredible things that the Holy Spirit did back then in the days when the Old Testament
[00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.260]   was there and the days of the life and the death and resurrection of Jesus, we can look
[00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.940]   back on that and we can go, "Oh man, those were the days."
[00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.500]   Like those were the days when the Spirit was at work, when the Spirit was moving.
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.460]   Oh man, if you could take me back to any moment in history, I want to go back to the time
[00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.100]   where the Spirit of God was manifesting like that.
[00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.620]   I want to see Jesus and Peter walking on the waters.
[00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.340]   I want to see dead people rise to life.
[00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.460]   I want to see handkerchiefs that are just in the presence of Paul being placed on other
[00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.260]   people so that they would come to life.
[00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.020]   And we can have, I think as Christians, our posture towards the Holy Spirit can primarily
[00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.020]   be one of nostalgia.
[00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:37.380]   Like, "Oh wow, wasn't it great back then?"
[00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.100]   And it was great back then, amen?
[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.660]   But actually what the Spirit teaches us, what the Scriptures teach us is that our expectation
[00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.980]   should not be, "Wow, wasn't that great back then?
[00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.420]   And if only we could have a little bit of that now."
[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.220]   No, actually Scriptures teach us that our expectation should be for even more now.
[00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.980]   That actually what is ahead of us is even greater than what is behind us.
[00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.700]   Paul writing to the church just after the death and resurrection of Jesus, he writes
[00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.140]   to the church and he says, "Get your head around this, that the same Spirit that raised
[00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.860]   Jesus from the dead," in other words, up until that point in history, the greatest
[00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:23.860]   manifestation of the Spirit ever, he said, "That same Spirit now lives in you."
[00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.300]   He was saying back then when Jesus was doing His ministry, that Spirit was at work in the
[00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.380]   world.
[00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.420]   It was at work externally to us, but the same power that raised Jesus from the dead.
[00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.340]   Here's the crazy thing, church, it's now in you.
[00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.060]   It's not only reserved out now to some external thing, but it is found in the indwelling power
[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.660]   of the Holy Spirit inside of you.
[00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.740]   And Paul's writing to his church and he's like, "Broaden your expectations, that if
[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.700]   you believe that that Spirit can raise Jesus from the dead, imagine what it can do to the
[00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.740]   dead things in you."
[00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.020]   Jesus Himself taught this way.
[00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.300]   Jesus wrote and spoke this to the disciples, it's so beautiful.
[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.700]   He says, "Man, you need this thing that I'm about to send you.
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.340]   I'm promising to send you something."
[00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.140]   And He says this, "You're going to do even greater things than I will do."
[00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:16.500]   In other words, Jesus is like, "Don't think about the Holy Spirit in terms of nostalgia.
[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.820]   The best is ahead, not behind.
[00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.020]   You're going to do even greater things," He says to the church.
[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.180]   "You're going to see my Spirit move in ways that you have never seen Him move."
[00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.140]   And this is the hunger that is inside of us here at the Vine.
[00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.940]   This is the thing that drives us, that we would see what's ahead of us.
[00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.140]   The greatest things of the Spirit are not behind you in your life, they're ahead of
[00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.140]   you.
[00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.540]   And some of you in this room need to hear that.
[00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.860]   You can forget everything else I'm about to say, remember that, okay?
[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.940]   For some of you who came in today, you thought the best moments of your relationship with
[00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.140]   Jesus are in the rearview mirror.
[00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.140]   You think the best moments of the Spirit's manifestation in your life are behind you.
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.920]   They're not, they're ahead of you.
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.100]   This is why we're doing a new series here at the Vine today over the next seven weeks.
[00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:07.580]   We're doing a series on the Holy Spirit, because we want to raise the expectation in us.
[00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.660]   In uncharted times, where we're going to be out of our comfort zone and we're going to
[00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.300]   be in a place where we're not sure always what's happening, we're going to raise our
[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:21.740]   expectations and the understanding and the knowledge and our holistic view of who the
[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.300]   Holy Spirit is.
[00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.180]   Because I don't know about you, but if you're anything like me, it's very easy as Christians,
[00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.860]   I think, to pigeonhole our understanding of the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.380]   To actually begin to think of the Holy Spirit specifically as maybe one type of expression
[00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:37.380]   of that Spirit.
[00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:41.580]   And often for us Christians, that comes out of our own personal experience with the Holy
[00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:42.860]   Spirit.
[00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.680]   So maybe we've experienced the Spirit in some way, and we begin to build a whole theology
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.000]   around the Spirit just based on maybe one way in which we've experienced Him, when actually
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.020]   the Scriptures present a much broader and a bigger understanding of who the Spirit is.
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:00.500]   And I think it's easy for us as Christians to hold on to just one aspect of the Spirit
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.540]   when there's so much more of the Spirit to be discovered.
[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:08.580]   I remember the very first time I encountered the Holy Spirit.
[00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.580]   I was four years old.
[00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:15.060]   And as a four-year-old, my parents at those days were attending a very charismatic church
[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.220]   in the south of England.
[00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:21.500]   And on this one particular Sunday, my father had wanted to respond to the word that had
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.500]   been preached.
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.900]   And he walks forward, and I saw this with a four-year-old's eyes, right?
[00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:31.460]   I see the pastor come forward, and the pastor places his hand just gently on my father's
[00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:32.460]   forehead.
[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:37.300]   My father collapses on the floor and just lies dead on the ground.
[00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:41.940]   Now when you're a four-year-old, here's how you understand that moment.
[00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:46.580]   I thought the pastor had killed my father.
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.700]   And so I start wailing.
[00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.580]   I start wailing and crying.
[00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:51.580]   And I'm like, "Ah!"
[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.060]   My mom comes over to me.
[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:54.940]   She's like, "Andrew, why are you crying?"
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:58.540]   I said, "The pastor's killed my father!"
[00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.620]   And my mom, she says this.
[00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.540]   She looks over and sees her husband on the floor, right?
[00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.940]   And she turns back and she says, "Oh, no, no, no, Andrew.
[00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:06.940]   No, no, no, no.
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:07.940]   He's not dead.
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:08.940]   He's fine.
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:09.940]   He's alive."
[00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:10.940]   She said, "No, that's just God.
[00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:11.940]   God is speaking to him."
[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:16.900]   And I remember as a four-year-old thinking this, "If that is how God speaks to people,
[00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:22.780]   I hope he never speaks to me for the rest of my life."
[00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:27.020]   But it's these dramatic moments of the Holy Spirit, right, that I think we can so often
[00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:32.380]   hold on to, that can so often frame and shape everything that we think about the Holy Spirit.
[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.980]   Which is why when we're thinking about the Spirit, we have the nostalgia in us because
[00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:40.380]   we see the dramatic things that are mentioned in Scripture, and maybe we haven't seen them
[00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:44.100]   or encountered them for our own lives, or we've seen them much in the world today, and
[00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:47.900]   we can begin to think that maybe the Spirit's not manifesting as much, or the Spirit's not
[00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:48.900]   here as much.
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:54.100]   And actually, Scripture presents a much broader and bigger view than just the manifestations.
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:59.460]   Those external experiences, the dramatic things are awesome, but here's what the Bible says.
[00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:04.740]   The primary work that the Spirit does is not just external in the things of this world,
[00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.100]   but internal within us.
[00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:08.580]   And guess what?
[00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:14.820]   Those things are less perceptible at times, and we crave the dramatic because that's the
[00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:19.400]   sudden change that we can point to and see and celebrate, and oftentimes I think we shy
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:25.820]   away from the long-term stuff, from the stuff that the Spirit is actually always doing inside
[00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:30.540]   of us, and we pray for the miracle, and God's like, "There's many miracles happening in
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:31.540]   your life right now."
[00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:35.940]   I mean, I can stand before you today as somebody who's been a Christian for 30 years, and I
[00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:40.540]   can tell you, man, I've seen some of the powerful manifestations of the Holy Spirit externally.
[00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.020]   I was in the Philippines once.
[00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:47.120]   I saw a blind man receive sight through the prayer of a 14-year-old girl.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.420]   In my own life, I have prayed for and have experienced healings.
[00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:53.780]   I prayed for Chris once when we were dating just before we got married, and she had a
[00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:58.220]   pain in her side, and I saw a picture of a dagger in her side, and I just removed the
[00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:59.220]   dagger.
[00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.220]   Well, she told me, she's like, "Just remove the dagger."
[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.820]   I'm like, "That's weird."
[00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:05.180]   And I did, and her pain stopped immediately, and it's never returned.
[00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:12.140]   I have actually spoken in other human languages under the power of the Holy Spirit, just like
[00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:13.940]   it's read about in Acts.
[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.740]   That's a crazy story I'll save for another week.
[00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:22.540]   I have experienced the manifestations of God, but I can stand before you proudly today and
[00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:26.260]   tell you that the greatest things that the Spirit has done are the things that you probably
[00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.940]   have never noticed in me.
[00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:33.040]   I can stand before you after 30 years and tell you I am far more patient today than
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.460]   I have ever been.
[00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:41.060]   I have more self-control over the temptations in my life today than I did when I was 25.
[00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.300]   Trust me.
[00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.260]   I am someone who is more kind than I think I've ever been.
[00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:51.380]   I have a deeper love for people than I've ever had at any period of my life.
[00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:54.820]   These are the greater, if you will, works of the Spirit.
[00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.740]   They are also works of the Spirit.
[00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:00.220]   And the problem we can have, I think, as Christians is that we can kind of play one off of the
[00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.680]   other as if it's and/or.
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:07.780]   It's either this or it's that, and we either find ourselves as Christians, we're charismatics,
[00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:11.880]   which means we're this, or we're not so charismatic, which means we're like this.
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:15.740]   And God stands back from all of that and goes, "It doesn't have to be and/or.
[00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:17.700]   It's both/and."
[00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.180]   Like it's this and that.
[00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:22.460]   Like it is the dramatic, powerful manifestations of the Holy Spirit.
[00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:23.600]   Yes, I do that.
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.820]   I want to continue to do that.
[00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.300]   And you may see some of that in your life.
[00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:30.700]   But it's also the quiet, almost imperceptible, long-term healing and changes that happen
[00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:31.700]   in your life.
[00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:36.140]   The Spirit is at work in both, and your expectation shouldn't be and/or.
[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:38.080]   It should be both/and.
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.820]   It should be a hunger to see the work of the Spirit manifested in that way.
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:46.460]   He works corporately, but He also works individually.
[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:51.340]   He brings comfort and peace, but He also challenges with conviction, which is uncomfortable at
[00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:53.560]   times.
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:57.260]   He opens up the Scriptures by His Spirit so we can understand the written Word that was
[00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:02.020]   thousands of years ago given to us, but He also gives us a reima Word, a fresh Word for
[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:04.300]   today in this moment in history.
[00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:06.200]   He does both.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:10.860]   And as we begin to understand the glory that there is in the both/and aspect of the Holy
[00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:13.220]   Spirit, we deepen our understanding of Him.
[00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:14.220]   Are you with me?
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:18.780]   So, what we're going to do over this series is bring some of these both/and pieces to
[00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:24.580]   you so that you can understand maybe a bigger concept of who the Holy Spirit is for your
[00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:31.580]   life so that your expectations might shift from nostalgia to future.
[00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:35.540]   And I want to start that today by doing a teaching with you, a little bit different
[00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:39.420]   perhaps to how I often am preaching with you and telling a funny story and a great thing
[00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:40.420]   here and there.
[00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:43.300]   I want to actually unpack some things for you, teach you a little bit today, because
[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:47.700]   I want to debunk a myth that I think we hold on to about the Holy Spirit that's really
[00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.140]   important that we get right in week one.
[00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:54.020]   And then I want to teach you a little bit about what the primary purpose of the Holy
[00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.940]   Spirit is in the world and for you personally.
[00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:00.380]   Because all of these both/ands that we're going to be looking at throughout the series,
[00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:06.380]   all of them feed up under this primary overarching purpose that the Spirit is here in our world
[00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:07.380]   to do.
[00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:10.420]   So, first of all, let me debunk a myth, and it's this.
[00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:18.120]   The primary way that the Scripture speaks of the Holy Spirit is as a person, not a force
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.120]   or an energy.
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:23.660]   Oh, I'm going to unpack this one for a moment, because I think we need to understand this
[00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:24.660]   a little bit more.
[00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:29.820]   See, the primary way that Scripture speaks of the Holy Spirit is as a person, coexistent
[00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:33.700]   and coeternal with the Father and the Son.
[00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:37.860]   And the problem for us Christians is that we so often think of the Holy Spirit primarily
[00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:40.980]   as something out of Star Wars.
[00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:41.980]   We do.
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:45.540]   You know, we suddenly think that as Christians, we're like Alec Guinness, you know, kind of
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:48.140]   going, "These are not the droids that you are looking for."
[00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:49.140]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:56.140]   We think of the Spirit as this kind of disembodied sort of feeling or energy or life force that's
[00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:59.940]   out there in the world, but actually, Scriptures don't teach at all that the Spirit of God
[00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:00.940]   is like that.
[00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:05.940]   Now, this is challenging, because the Scriptures do present a picture of how the Spirit moves
[00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:06.940]   in similar way.
[00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:08.340]   It describes it as breath.
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:09.900]   It describes it as wind.
[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:14.980]   We get pictures of the Holy Spirit as fire, as a cloud, as tongues of fire that we see
[00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:16.180]   in Acts chapter 2.
[00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:21.860]   So there are ways in which the Spirit is described in Scripture that lends us to this kind of
[00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:26.260]   side thinking of, "Well, maybe He's more like a force, more like an energy."
[00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:30.980]   But we have to understand that the primary way He's described is as a person.
[00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:35.820]   And that is very important, because there are things that you can do with a person that
[00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:39.260]   you can never do with a force or an energy.
[00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:45.700]   And if you keep thinking of the Spirit primarily as a force or an energy, your idea is more
[00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:51.940]   to access something, to tap into a flow of something, rather than actually to be submitted
[00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:55.740]   to the service and the worship of a person.
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:15:00.780]   And so getting this together and understanding that it's not this, but it's this, dramatically
[00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:05.860]   changes your expectations and your thinking and your involvement with the Holy Spirit
[00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:06.860]   in your life.
[00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:11.340]   Paul, who's perhaps the person in the New Testament that speaks about the Holy Spirit
[00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:14.220]   the most, unpacks this so profoundly.
[00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.820]   Throughout all of his books, he writes about the Holy Spirit.
[00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:23.420]   Let me just give you an overview of some of the things that he says about the Spirit.
[00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:25.480]   He counsels us to know the mind of Christ.
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.220]   He strengthens us in our weakness.
[00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:28.620]   He teaches us the gospel.
[00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:30.580]   He intercedes on our behalf.
[00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:32.260]   He's grieved by our sinfulness.
[00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:33.860]   He leads us in the ways of God.
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:36.100]   He bears witness with our own spirit.
[00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:40.740]   All of these words, notice this, all that Paul's teaching about the Spirit is all about
[00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.780]   what a person does.
[00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:47.940]   Teaching, counseling, grieving, having emotions, feeling something.
[00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:51.160]   This is not some disembodied sort of energy in the world.
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.620]   This is an actual person.
[00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:54.040]   Is that making sense?
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:58.880]   And because Paul's beginning to teach that the Spirit of God is a person, he's welcoming
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:02.100]   us into a relationship.
[00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:03.540]   That's the powerful thing here.
[00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:06.860]   This is a relationship we get entered into.
[00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:12.420]   This is why when Jesus promises the Holy Spirit in John 16, 7, he writes it like this.
[00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:14.460]   Let me explain it to you.
[00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:15.460]   But I tell you the truth.
[00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:20.740]   "It is better that I go, for if I do not go, the advocate, Holy Spirit, will not come to
[00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:21.740]   you.
[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:24.780]   But if I go, I will send," notice, "him to you."
[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:27.100]   He doesn't say, "I'll send it to you."
[00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:29.500]   He doesn't say, "Hey, I'm going to give you a prayer that if you pray, you'll be able
[00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:32.540]   to tap into the energy of the universe."
[00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:35.020]   He says, "I'm going to send a person, him."
[00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:38.020]   He has a personhood to you, right?
[00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:41.140]   Now this crazy, I mean, just think about that for a sec.
[00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:42.940]   He has a person, but think about this also.
[00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:49.380]   Jesus says, "It's better for you that you," follow this, "that you don't have my bodily
[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:50.600]   form on earth.
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:54.620]   It's actually better for you that you have the indwelling of the person of the Holy Spirit
[00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:56.620]   inside of you."
[00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:57.620]   That blows my mind.
[00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:01.100]   Because I don't know about you, but I would love Jesus to be standing right here, right
[00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:02.740]   now, bodily form with me.
[00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:03.740]   Would you not?
[00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:05.940]   But he says, "It's better.
[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:10.380]   It's better that I go to my father and give you the person that is going to stay with
[00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:14.820]   you, walk with you, be with you, the person of the Holy Spirit."
[00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:16.940]   Why is it better to have the person of the Holy Spirit?
[00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:19.980]   I'm going to answer that right towards the end of the message, which means you have to
[00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:21.940]   keep listening.
[00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:27.820]   But for now, what it means is that it is an invitation to relationship.
[00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:32.740]   In fact, Paul, when he's trying to summarize the Trinity in one verse, he does this so
[00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:35.140]   beautifully in 2 Corinthians 13, 14.
[00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:36.140]   He says it this.
[00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:40.500]   He says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the
[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:43.200]   Holy Spirit be with you all."
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.780]   One of the most beautiful verses of Paul.
[00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:50.100]   Notice how he chooses one word to describe each person of the Trinity.
[00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.060]   He chooses grace for Jesus.
[00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:53.340]   That makes sense, doesn't it?
[00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:57.620]   Because it's in Jesus that we have the ultimate expression of grace in the forgiveness of
[00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:58.620]   our sin.
[00:17:58.620 --> 00:17:59.920]   He chooses love for the Father.
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:05.220]   That makes a lot of sense too, because God so loved the world that he gave his only son,
[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:06.220]   Jesus.
[00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:07.540]   What word does he choose for the Spirit?
[00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.900]   Well, it's not a random word.
[00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:14.540]   He's trying to choose something that would express the significance of what the Spirit
[00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:16.420]   does and how the Spirit works with us.
[00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:19.060]   He says, "The fellowship of the Holy Spirit."
[00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:23.900]   In other words, the one that we have deep abiding relationship with, connection with.
[00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:25.140]   The Greek word is koinonia.
[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:31.260]   It literally means togetherness or communion, connection with the Holy Spirit.
[00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:35.300]   He's saying when you understand the Spirit as a person rather than some life force or
[00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:38.140]   energy, you can actually have fellowship.
[00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:39.820]   You're in relationship.
[00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:41.260]   There is structure to that.
[00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:42.700]   There is feeling in that.
[00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:43.700]   There's communion.
[00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:47.820]   And not only that, but when the people of God are in fellowship with the person of the
[00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:52.220]   Holy Spirit, they find koinonia amongst themselves.
[00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:57.740]   There is an overflow of our connection to the Spirit that then connects us all to one
[00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:58.740]   another.
[00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.700]   We may know we're from different cultures, different backgrounds.
[00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:02.860]   We have different theological perspectives sometimes.
[00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:04.620]   We might have different life experiences.
[00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:09.940]   The one thing that connects us is the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus and the indwelling
[00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:15.300]   person of the Holy Spirit that is in all of us at the confession of salvation.
[00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:20.700]   And that creates a unity that can not be broken.
[00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:24.560]   The fellowship of the Holy Spirit.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:29.280]   So here's just in summary how I want you to begin to shift in your thinking from one
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:30.280]   to the other.
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:33.300]   Let me show you this slide I'm putting up here.
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:36.700]   So on the left side, we're going to have a look at what happens when we think of the
[00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:40.580]   Holy Spirit primarily as a force or an energy.
[00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:45.440]   We have this, how can I access the Spirit more so I can use it, right?
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:50.180]   We want to tap into the Spirit so that the Spirit can do something for us, heal us, restore
[00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:51.400]   us, renew us, whatever.
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.480]   Or maybe we can pray for someone and we can do...
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:58.000]   We want to tap into some energy in the universe in order for us to use it.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   Follow that?
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.360]   Here's how you think when it's the person of the Holy Spirit.
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:06.120]   How can I get to know the Holy Spirit more so he can use me?
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:08.020]   It's a relationship with a person.
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:13.000]   How can I get to know that person more so that I can understand how he wants to use
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.160]   me in this world?
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.520]   See the difference?
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:18.640]   Or let me give you like an even more obvious one.
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.840]   How can I get a hold of the Spirit more?
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.760]   Unless if he's an energy, I want to get more.
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.320]   I want to be filled more.
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:28.680]   I want to try to gain more to my bucket, if you will.
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.200]   Flip that to this.
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.520]   How can the Spirit get a hold of me more?
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:36.320]   Oh, church, we don't want to preach on that.
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.320]   Like we all want, like, "Oh, I want more of the Holy Spirit."
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.400]   And the Holy Spirit's like, "I want more of you."
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.520]   Because it's a person.
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:46.480]   And he's like, "I'm here for you and I'm here with you.
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:49.360]   And I will fill you and restore you and renew you, all the things that you desire."
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:51.360]   But it's not like some Santa Claus just like gifting.
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:53.960]   It's not like tapping into the vein of an energy in the universe.
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:55.240]   It's a relationship.
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:59.560]   And your primary way of thinking about the Spirit should be, "How do I get to know the
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:00.880]   Spirit more?
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:05.640]   Like, how do I develop and deepen a fellowship with the Spirit so that I would understand
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.680]   who I am better?
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.640]   So I can understand how he wants to use me in this world better?
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:15.360]   How do I give more of myself to him rather than always expecting him to give more of
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:20.480]   himself to me?"
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.480]   Now let me take this a step deeper now.
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:28.160]   Now that we've debunked a myth, let me now unpack the theology behind this a little bit
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.280]   more for us.
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:35.360]   The primary purpose that the Bible describes the Holy Spirit having in this world is that
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:39.280]   he is, the way it's described, he is the giver of life.
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:42.160]   Or in other translations, he's the bringer of life.
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:48.680]   Our creed that we have, the apostolic creed that the church holds to, the global Orthodox
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:54.960]   church holds to, describes the Holy Spirit as the giver or the bringer of life.
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:58.840]   Now to understand what that really means, you actually have to understand the Hebrew
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:01.360]   understanding of life.
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:05.000]   Because when the Bible says that the Holy Spirit is the one who brings life, it's not
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.560]   saying he's the one that helps your heart to beat and to put breath in your mouth, although
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.640]   that is part of what he does.
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:14.380]   But when we, in our Western kind of modern context, think of life, we think of literally
[00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:19.000]   like the ability to just be alive, but the Hebrews thought of life very differently.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.840]   For them, life was not just about the fact that your heart beats and you can breathe,
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:27.600]   life was living as you were fully intended to be.
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:31.520]   Life in other words was wrapped up to this concept of shalom, particularly in the first
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:33.640]   couple of chapters of the Old Testament.
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:38.940]   That God's heart was that his people would be the wholeness of what they've been created
[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:45.760]   to be, that they would experience the fullness of his creative intent on their lives.
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:50.000]   And because there is this sense of this wholeness and this creative intent, what it meant for
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.120]   the Hebrews to say, "We have life by the Spirit," is not that we can breathe, it's that we are
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:23:01.480]   fully the people that God had always designed and always intended us to be.
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.960]   So for Hebrews, I'll just give it a definition.
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:09.740]   Being alive is living to the best of your created intent.
[00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:12.940]   Some of you might want to write that down.
[00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:22.540]   Being alive, living to the best of our created intent, which means that the closer you are
[00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:27.420]   to living in such a way that you are intended or always intended to be means the closer
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:28.980]   you are to actually being alive.
[00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:29.980]   Follow this.
[00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:30.980]   I'll say that again.
[00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:31.980]   I didn't say it particularly well.
[00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:32.980]   Let me say it again.
[00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:37.260]   The closer that you are to living as you were always intended to be means the closer you
[00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:39.060]   are to being fully alive.
[00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:44.780]   That's the Hebrew understanding of the bringer and the giver of life, not just helping you
[00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:49.540]   to be literally sustained in life, but bringing you towards the fullness of the way you were
[00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:50.540]   created to be.
[00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:51.540]   Does that make sense to you?
[00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:55.820]   So I want to show this to you in Scripture, and we're going to dig into a couple of really
[00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:59.620]   important passages here to lay a foundation for the rest of the series.
[00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:03.940]   I'm going to start in Genesis 1, verses 1 and 2, the very, very beginning of the biblical
[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:04.940]   story.
[00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:05.940]   Notice this.
[00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:09.420]   It says, "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
[00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:13.300]   Now the earth was formless and empty, and darkness was over the surface of the deep,
[00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:16.620]   and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters."
[00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:20.100]   This is the first time in all of Scripture, of course, that we are introduced to the person
[00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:21.100]   of the Spirit.
[00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:26.260]   And I want you specifically to see how the Bible introduces you to the concept for the
[00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:27.260]   first time.
[00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:29.040]   He says, "Look, there's this creation.
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:33.620]   God has created everything, but there is a chaos in that creation.
[00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:37.180]   It's dark, it's formless, and there's a void."
[00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:41.740]   But the intent of the first two verses is not to say, "Oh my gosh, the world sucks and
[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:42.860]   everything's terrible."
[00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:47.980]   The purpose of the first two verses is to say, "Okay, there's formlessness, there's darkness,
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:55.380]   there's chaos, there's disorder, but we are not without hope because the Spirit is hovering
[00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:59.120]   over what is currently dark and chaotic and disordered."
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:04.440]   So the intent of these verses is to give you a sense of the already purpose of the person
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:05.800]   of the Holy Spirit.
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:10.680]   The picture of Him hovering here is a beautiful metaphorical picture, and it's repeated again
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:11.680]   in Deuteronomy.
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:17.040]   It's the picture of an eagle hovering or a bird hovering over its nest, hoping that the
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:20.520]   eaglets, the little ones in the nest, will take flight.
[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:26.500]   So here's the Holy Spirit hovering over the disorder, the chaos of the world, hoping that
[00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:28.720]   the world will come alive.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:32.340]   And by that meaning, into the fullness of what it was intended to be.
[00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:35.920]   Right now there is chaos and darkness and formlessness.
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:38.660]   In the future, because of the Spirit, that will change.
[00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:40.040]   Does that make sense?
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:46.860]   So the Spirit is hovering over disorder, longing to bring it into order.
[00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:52.620]   So being alive is being fully as we were intended to be, and the way that the Spirit does this
[00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:58.660]   is He takes what is currently disordered and He brings it into order.
[00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:01.740]   This is what you actually see in the creation narrative itself.
[00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:08.580]   A formlessness of something that gains form, then because of the Spirit becomes the fullness
[00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:11.380]   of what it was intended to be.
[00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:14.860]   We actually see this happen in the first of human creation.
[00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:20.020]   Let me jump forward here just to chapter 2 of Genesis and verse 7.
[00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:24.820]   It says, "The Lord God formed the man from," this is Adam, "from the dust of the ground."
[00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:25.820]   So there was formlessness.
[00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:27.680]   Are you with me?
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:33.860]   But notice it says, "God formed him," so there's a formlessness that goes into form, "and then
[00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:37.700]   he breathes into him," to the nostrils, "the breath of life."
[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:42.620]   There's the Spirit, "into him, and the man becomes a living being."
[00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:49.620]   So Adam literally goes from a chaotic disorder, the ground, to a form without life, and then
[00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:54.220]   the Spirit comes and brings the thing that was form without life into its fullness as
[00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:56.660]   a living being.
[00:26:56.660 --> 00:27:01.100]   So the Bible describes this right at the start of all things, this incredible work that the
[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:07.380]   Spirit has to take what is disordered in our lives and in this world and bring it into
[00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:08.660]   order.
[00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:12.220]   That's its primary purpose.
[00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:16.420]   Now of course, this is ultimately manifested to us in the scriptural story through Jesus
[00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:17.900]   Christ himself.
[00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:22.620]   Jesus in his life, death, and resurrection is the one who steps in and actually takes
[00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:27.660]   a world that is disordered in sin and brings it into the new order of redeemed life.
[00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:32.500]   And I want to show you, if we jump forward just in the story here, to the moment where
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:37.700]   Jesus begins his public ministry, the moment where he comes out of being just a normal
[00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:43.020]   citizen, if you will, to actually then beginning a journey as a prophet, a rabbi, and the Son
[00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:46.700]   of God at his baptism is the turning point for him.
[00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:49.780]   And I want you to notice this in Luke 3 verse 21.
[00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:53.480]   "When all the people were being baptized, Jesus was baptized too.
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:58.700]   And as he was praying, heavens opened, and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily
[00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:01.260]   form like a dove.
[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:04.560]   And the voice from heaven said, 'You are my Son, whom I love.
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:05.980]   With you I am well pleased.'"
[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:12.140]   I want you to see the connection here between the original creation moment in Genesis 1
[00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:16.740]   and the moment of Jesus' beginning of his ministry in Luke chapter 3.
[00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:19.140]   These two things come together.
[00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:25.960]   Where the Spirit was hovering like a bird over the chaos of disordered world, wanting
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:32.140]   to bring it into its order, so now the Spirit hovers over Jesus, recognizing that it will
[00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:37.740]   be in and through Jesus that the disorder of this world will ultimately be brought into
[00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:39.260]   the fullness of its order.
[00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:44.420]   That because of the Spirit's work within Christ, he will be able to go to the cross, pay the
[00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:49.040]   price for the sin, and be raised from the death to life so that we would know the fullness
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:52.100]   of reconciliation with God and the forgiveness of our sins ourselves.
[00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:57.640]   So the whole world's disorder to order is going to happen through Christ.
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:03.020]   And there's a new creation moment in his baptism, literally saying that there's a new creation
[00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:06.980]   that's at work because of the power of the Spirit for this man in this moment.
[00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:09.180]   Does that make sense to you?
[00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:12.080]   Now here's the other interesting thing.
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:17.040]   Last week in Easter Sunday, I took us to John chapter 20, where Jesus is not found in the
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:20.400]   tomb anymore, and he shows himself to his disciples.
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:23.280]   I want to show you what actually happens in the moment.
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:24.460]   We didn't read this last week.
[00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:25.540]   Let me pick up the story.
[00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:28.660]   This is John 20, and it's starting in verse 21.
[00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:32.220]   "Jesus said to him," this is the first time he's appeared to them in his resurrection,
[00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:34.240]   he says, "Peace be with you.
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:37.520]   As the Father has sent me, I am sending you."
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:44.020]   And with that, "He breathed on them and said, 'Receive the Holy Spirit.'"
[00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:47.960]   This is perhaps the most significant moment in all of human history.
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:51.460]   Jesus' death on the cross is a significant moment in all history.
[00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:54.840]   This is probably the most significant moment in our human history.
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:59.200]   Because in the power of the resurrection, Christ turns up to the disciples, and he goes,
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.400]   "I'm going to breathe on you."
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:03.600]   Now that should automatically connect you right back there to the creation narrative
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:04.680]   again.
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:09.760]   In the same way that Adam was formless, had a form, and the Spirit breathed on him to
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:13.920]   bring him into his fullness, now Jesus, in the power of the resurrection, and the Spirit
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:19.200]   at work in him, looks at his disciples, and he says, "What's disordered in you will no
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.720]   longer be disordered.
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:26.840]   For I will breathe on you to receive the Holy Spirit."
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:32.560]   And that Holy Spirit will have the primary purpose of taking what is disordered in you
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:35.080]   and bring it into order.
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:38.520]   What the Holy Spirit has done in the death and resurrection of Christ through the cross
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:43.160]   of Jesus to bring all of the disordered world into order, now is going to take place, Jesus
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:46.480]   is basically saying, in you.
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:50.740]   He breathes on these people to bring them into the newness of life.
[00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:52.640]   So I want you to think of it this way.
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:55.760]   This is the theological thing we're trying to get to here.
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:56.760]   Notice this.
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:58.320]   Follow with this.
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:06.320]   In the incarnation, God steps into the disorder of this world and through the person of Jesus
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:10.200]   Christ brings it to how it was always intended to be.
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:14.200]   Does that make sense?
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:20.900]   In the same way, Jesus Christ steps into the disorder of our internal worlds through the
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:26.620]   person of the Holy Spirit to bring us into the place where we were always intended to
[00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:27.620]   be.
[00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:29.100]   You follow that?
[00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:33.940]   So what Christ has done in the incarnation in this world, now Christ does through the
[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:36.700]   incarnation of the Spirit in us.
[00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:39.980]   And where there was a disorder in the world that has been brought into order, where there's
[00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:46.200]   disorder in us, the primary work of the Spirit is to bring a new order within us.
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.900]   This is the joy.
[00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:50.000]   This is what we're welcomed into.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.080]   This is why the Spirit is a person and not some energy or some life force out there that
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:56.620]   can't do much for us.
[00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:01.260]   This is the resurrection power of Christ within us so that whatever might be distorted in
[00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:05.460]   me, whatever is broken in me, whatever is not quite right in me, can now be brought
[00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:09.140]   into a new order, brought into the fullness of life through the gifts of the Spirit, the
[00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:12.020]   fruit of the Spirit, the work of the Spirit, all of these things that we're going to be
[00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:16.100]   teaching on over the next number of weeks here, all of that is to bring my disorder
[00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:17.100]   into order.
[00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:21.900]   Oh, the beauty and the wonder of a God who doesn't just step in to save the world but
[00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:28.420]   steps in to save you through the person of the Holy Spirit.
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:35.940]   And this work of the Spirit inside of our broken internal world changes us dramatically.
[00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:39.660]   Let me just summarize that change with this really incredible diagram that I'm going to
[00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:41.020]   throw up here.
[00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:46.700]   The work of the Spirit, the disorder to order work of the Spirit brings us into faith in
[00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:51.760]   Jesus, helps us to know Jesus better, restores our relationship with the Father, drives us
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:56.760]   into mission and justice, binds us together in unity, empowers our living and worship
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:57.880]   and discipleship.
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:02.460]   The disorder that was there is brought into order through the beauty of the work of the
[00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:03.460]   Spirit.
[00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:04.460]   And I want you to see this.
[00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:05.460]   The work is cyclical.
[00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:08.260]   It's like there's this circle motion that's happening.
[00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:11.660]   It's not like it's like a linear thing where it's like step one, step two, step three,
[00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:15.940]   step four, and you can get a certificate as a great Christian.
[00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:17.580]   Come on, Hong Kong, we know that, don't we?
[00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:18.580]   We know that.
[00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:19.740]   No, it doesn't work that way.
[00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:24.580]   This is the ongoing regenerative work of the person of the Holy Spirit bringing disorder
[00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:27.860]   into order in our lives over a period of time.
[00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:31.740]   And we long for those dramatic manifestations and they still happen.
[00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:37.220]   And yet the primary work that takes place is the long-term regeneration of the darkness
[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:40.460]   of me.
[00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:45.940]   And so over our series, each week is going to unpack each one of these.
[00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:48.260]   So you can take a photo of that slide if you like.
[00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:50.060]   That's the last thing I'm going to do with the slide, okay?
[00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:54.020]   So you can take a photo of that one and it will get you a sense of kind of where we're
[00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:58.540]   going in this series and why we're unpacking this series for you today.
[00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:01.140]   But here's how I want to close.
[00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:06.100]   I think there are two very important questions that we want to invite you as the leadership
[00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:07.980]   here to wrestle with in the week ahead.
[00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:11.140]   Let me throw up these questions for you.
[00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:15.020]   Number one, if the person of the Holy Spirit is someone to be in fellowship with, am I
[00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:18.940]   actively cultivating a vibrant and personal connection with him?
[00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:25.420]   Do I see him still more as a force or energy to tap into rather than a person to walk with?
[00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:30.020]   Okay, I want you to ask yourself that honestly and do some honest reflection on that.
[00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:34.100]   Number two, if the work of the Holy Spirit is primarily to take things that are in disorder
[00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:38.820]   and bring them into order, what is currently still in disorder in my life?
[00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:43.100]   Where do I need to invite the Holy Spirit to enter and reorder?
[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:44.540]   Amen?
[00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:47.220]   Who's excited?
[00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:49.220]   I can really tell.
[00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:53.220]   I can really tell.
[00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:55.380]   I'm excited and I know you're excited too.
[00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:58.940]   This is what we're going to be doing in this series and I believe that this could be profoundly
[00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:01.220]   a completely regenerative time for you.
[00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:02.220]   I wonder whether you could stand.
[00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:08.460]   I want to pray for us this morning.
[00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:18.660]   Father, we are deeply grateful that there are three persons of the Trinity that you
[00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:25.620]   desire to express yourself in three different persons but one God.
[00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:29.900]   And Lord, we probably confess here that we know the Father and the Son better at times
[00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:32.340]   than we know the Holy Spirit.
[00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:38.740]   Father, for those of us in this room where we primarily think of the Spirit like an energy,
[00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:46.300]   Lord, I want to pray that the person of the Holy Spirit would become their best friend.
[00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:51.660]   I want to pray as Paul prayed for the church that the grace of Christ Jesus and the love
[00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:57.100]   of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.
[00:35:57.100 --> 00:36:02.940]   So Lord, I pray for that fellowship, the koinonia, the communion, the togetherness of your Spirit
[00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:05.460]   to be with each person in this room.
[00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:10.720]   And I pray that as they enter into knowing you more, they would be in a posture of submission
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:13.220]   and humility rather than control.
[00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:19.900]   So often, Lord, our starting point with the Holy Spirit is how do I control this thing?
[00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:22.060]   How do I use this thing for my gain?
[00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:23.780]   How do I use it for my business' gain?
[00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:25.380]   How do I use it for my family's gain?
[00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:28.540]   And we become like Simon the sorcerer in the book of Acts.
[00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:31.140]   Lord, would you forgive us?
[00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:34.600]   You're not one to be manipulated for our own power or good.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:40.240]   You're a person we are to get to know, who we are to worship, who we are to submit ourselves
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:43.300]   to as one of the Godhead.
[00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:49.320]   And so Lord, would you manifest that to each one of us, Lord, in the weeks ahead?
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:54.700]   And Father, I wanna pray for whatever disorder might be known in the hearts and lives of
[00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:56.140]   every person in this room.
[00:36:56.140 --> 00:37:02.400]   Lord, every single one of us is still carrying some form of disorder, something that is not
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:05.020]   fully the way it's intended to be.
[00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:10.340]   Lord, we thank you that the work of the Spirit is a lifelong regenerative work.
[00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:13.020]   But Lord, we don't wanna be people walking around with disorder.
[00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:18.460]   Lord, we wanna be people who walk around with the order of the Holy Spirit upon us.
[00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:22.640]   And so Lord, I wanna pray over this sermon series that you would do a deep work in people
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:24.480]   in this room, Lord.
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:28.920]   That Lord, things that are disordered would come to order in the name of Jesus.
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:31.640]   That sin would be repented of.
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:33.400]   That healing would come.
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:36.920]   That trauma would be healed and restored.
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:41.840]   Lord, that the deep brokenness that can be within some of our spirits would be made new
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:45.040]   and made in the Spirit of God like new.
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:51.960]   Father, would you do what your Spirit does best in us, that the person of the Holy Spirit
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:56.840]   manifesting us to bring us into a place of new order in Him.
[00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:59.680]   Lord, I pray that you would do this for your glory.
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:02.800]   And I wanna pray for freedom and life.
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:07.860]   For the Bible says where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
[00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:13.000]   And so I wanna pray for a freshness and a freedom to be over every person in this room
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.640]   to the newness of life.
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:18.120]   And we pray this in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:21.700]   (congregation applauding)
[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:24.280]   (gentle music)
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:34.280]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
