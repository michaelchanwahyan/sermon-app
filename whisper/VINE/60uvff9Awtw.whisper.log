[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   but a church in the plural, united across a nation,
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   joined in purpose, focused on building up God's kingdom
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   one life at a time.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   It is a church that has at the heart of its DNA
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   the grand narrative of the redemptive story of Jesus Christ,
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   and that celebrates in the freedom and grace
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   that such a story brings.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   This church is not constricted by the walls of a building,
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   but actively engaged in the community it is planted in,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   desiring for God's kingdom to take root and bear fruit in local soil.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   A church that sees salvation as holistic,
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   transforming God's people for God's work,
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   and equipping a generation to represent God's heart
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   to the poor, the weak, the oppressed, and the persecuted.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   Imagine this church,
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   committed to seeing the family as integral
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   to all that it's called to be and do,
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   involving intentional, committed, and authentic relationships
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   across all levels.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   It is the sort of place where both the young and the old
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   feel cared for, supported and equipped.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   A church where people of all backgrounds and traditions
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   come to feel at home,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   a cultural mosaic that honors and embraces
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   a richness and diversity that marks us as the body of Christ.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   It is a church that is willing to innovate and express faith creatively,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   reflecting the boundless limits of God's creativity as glory to Him.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   A place where people gather, hungry for the presence of God,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   and passionate to see this invade all aspects of their lives,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   where they seek to develop an intelligent, spiritual faith
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   rooted in God's word and driven with prayer.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   A church that does not make its Sunday services
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   the exclamation mark of its existence,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   but instead the comma in its ongoing sentence,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   a time of service, love, and engagement
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   that inspires and emboldens all equally
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   for the conversation that lies ahead.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   A church that cares, disciples,
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   rebuilds, renews.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   This is our city.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   This is our church.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   This is our home.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Happy Sunday, church! Hello, everybody!
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Yeah, welcome to the Vine Yuen Long!
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   It's so great to see all of your beautiful faces today.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   It's only been a week, but it feels like yesterday.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   So it's just so great that we get to come here today on a Sunday
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   and we've all made a choice.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   We could have slept in. We could have, you know, do anything else,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   but we decided to be here because our God is worthy of our praise.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Can I just invite all of you to stand?
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   As we enter into worship, let us pray together, everybody.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank you.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   We thank you for your goodness.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   We thank you for your love for all of us.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   As we come here today, I just pray that
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   you open our hearts as we enter in this time of worship,
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   that all of us will be able to just dwell in your presence.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   As we come here to worship, we praise your name because you're good.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   And you deserve our praise, Lord.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Everybody, let us worship our God.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   I was buried beneath my shame.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Who could carry that kind of weight?
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   It was my tomb, 'til I met you.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   I was breathing, but not alive.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   All my failures I tried to hide.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   It was my tomb, 'til I met you.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   You called.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   You called my name, and I ran out of that grave.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Out of the darkness, into your glorious day.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   You called my name, and I ran out of that grave.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Out of the darkness, into your glorious day.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Now your mercy.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Now your mercy has saved my soul.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Now your freedom is all that I know.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   If we all may knew, yeah.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   'Cause when I met you, yeah.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   You called my name, and I ran out of that grave.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Out of the darkness, into your glorious day.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   You called my name, and I ran out of that grave.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Out of the darkness, into your glorious day.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Let's sing, "I Needed Rescue."
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   I needed rescue.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   My sin was heavy.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   But chains break at the weight of your glory.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   I needed shelter.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   I was an orphan.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Now you call me a sinner.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Let's sing that again.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   I needed rescue.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   I needed rescue.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   My sin was heavy.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   But chains break at the weight of your glory.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   I needed shelter.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   I was an orphan.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Now you call me a sinner.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   When I was broken.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   When I was broken, you were my healing.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Now your love is the air that I'm breathing.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   I have a future.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   I have a hope.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   When you called my name, I ran out of that grave.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Out of the darkness, into your glorious day.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   You called my name, and I ran out of that grave.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Out of the darkness, into your glorious day.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   Come on, lift up a shout of praise.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   What a glorious day.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   That the saints can gather to worship our God.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   He truly is worthy of all praise.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   And God, we just, in the midst of worship, we just want to give our lives completely to you.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   Because you are worthy.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   And you are trustworthy.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   And God, we give you all the glory.

[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Jesus is mine.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   He's been my fourth man in the fire, time after time.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Born of His Spirit.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Washed in His blood.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   And what He did for me in Calvary is more than enough.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   Let's sing that again.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Blessed assurance.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Jesus is mine.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   He's been my fourth man in the fire, time after time.

[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   And what He did for me in Calvary is more than enough.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   Let's sing that again.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Blessed assurance.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   Jesus is mine.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Washed in His blood.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   And what He did for me in Calvary is more than enough.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   And I trust in God, my Savior, the one who will never fail.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   He will never fail.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   I trust.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   I trust in God, my Savior, the one who will never fail.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   He will never fail.

[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   I know the author of tomorrow has folded my steps.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   So this is my story.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   This is my song.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   I'm praising my risen King and Savior all the day long.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   I trust in God, my Savior, the one who will never fail.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   He will never fail.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   No, He won't.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   And I trust in God, my Savior, the one who will never fail.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   He will never fail.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   Yes, God, we trust in You.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   You'll never let us down.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   We put our hope and our faith in You.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   Sing it out.

[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   God reminded me and us that we come to worship and praise him
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   not only when there are good things for us to praise.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   It's because God is good and he deserves our praise,
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   regardless if we're in the highs or in the lows.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   And our praise are more powerful than we think.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   Our praise can take down walls.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   Walls of fears and walls of doubts and walls of anxieties and depression.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   His name comes in power.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   When we say the name Jesus, Jesus, and Jesus,
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   these are more than just words.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   It's our faith, it's our confidence in him,
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   and it's what this name is going to do in the city.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   Our praise can turn this city upside down.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   Revival is going to happen.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   Things are going to change because we come and worship him together.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   And can we just sing the chorus again with faith and with confidence?
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   Jesus, his name will bring all strongholds.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   He will heal all depression.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   He will bring all the slave out of slavery because our God is good.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   Your name is power.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   Your name is healing.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   Your name is life.

[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   Make every stronghold shine through the shadows.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   Burn like a fire.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   Sing shout Jesus.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   Shout Jesus from the mountains.

[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   Let's give our praise to our God.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   And big hands to our worship team as well.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   Thank you.

[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   It's called K4C, Kids for Christ.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   It's a time for them to learn about the Word of God and receive love and worship together,
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   you know, with their friends.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   So shall I just reach out our hands and bless them?
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   Yeah, dear God, we thank you so much for these children.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   You love them.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   You love them so much.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   And Lord, I just pray that in the time in K4C that they would just be able to experience
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   your love and your goodness and that the words that's from you that they will be,
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   it will be their foundation of their life, Lord.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   And I pray that you help them to receive your love and enjoy, have a great time.

[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   Don't raise your hand, don't worry.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   I'm not going to put you on the spot like that.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   But I just want to say we had our first week of fasting, and it's actually a total of three
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   weeks, 21 days.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   So that means we got 14 days more.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   It is never too late to join.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   So I would like to, you know, invite all of you to consider and pray about it and see
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   if you want to join our fasting.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   And if you would like to learn more about the meaning of fasting, why we're doing fasting,
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   and how we can do fasting, you can scan our QR code, which is going to be right here soon.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   Yeah, perfect timing.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   You can scan our QR code, join our WhatsApp channel, and we'll have all the fasting prayer
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   guideline to share with you.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   And also, we'll have a guideline of how do I fast.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   So it's really clear and detailed.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   It's not too wordy.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   It's really good.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   If you can, for some reason, cannot scan the QR code here, just on the way out later, there's
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   two amazing technology information board, the signage, right?
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   It's beautiful.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   So use it.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   So we're going to have all the information on that as well.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   So you can go there and have a scan and to know what's going on in our church.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   I'm not sure what's your experience with fasting.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   Actually, this year, it's my first time taking this seriously because I've never really understood.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   So I thought fasting is like, okay, sacrifice something, not eating something that I really
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   like or like coffee, chips or something, you know, as an act of love.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   But then this year, as the pastors, as they were talking about fasting and the meaning
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   of fasting, then I realized I've done it completely wrong.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   Not wrong, but it's not complete, right?
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   You have fasting.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   In Chinese, it's fasting prayer, gamsak togo.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   But I always just do the first two words, but not the prayer, right?
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   So this year, I was like, okay, God, what can I fast that I can create more space like
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   the song, Make Room for You.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   So then I was like, okay, I got to think.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   I don't spend much time eating really because I eat fast.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   And then I was like, oh, oh, no.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   I'm quite ashamed to share, but I'm not ashamed because this is who I am.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   Social media.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   I spend, I was just calculating.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   I would spend at least average three hours every day on social media.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   I'm sure some of you can relate.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   Don't pretend you're not.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   Like five minutes here and five minutes there.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   When you add up, it is three hours.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   So I was like, okay, God, I'm going to fast social media.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   And on last Sunday, I deleted all my apps, Instagram and Facebook.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   And I was like, whew, I felt a bit of lightness in me.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   There is not something that is constantly seeking for my attention.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   But my hand is still doing this all the time.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   But the apps are not even there.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   And then I realized, you know, not only I make room for God to spend time
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   with him intentionally, even like my physical and my heart has been changing.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   So I don't usually wake up that early.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   People know me, I wake up late because I sleep late.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   But for the past week, seven days, I have been able to just wake up really
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   early, like six or seven.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   Waking up not feeling groggy or not feeling like, ugh, but like literally
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   feeling, oh, wow, I'm ready to start the day just in the time in quietness
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   and with God.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   And then I can see, you know, the change in me started to come.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   And then as I was on the way here today, I was like, okay, what do I want to
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   share with you about my experience in fasting?
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   And then God gave me this analogy.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   And I really want to share with you.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   I realized I have been spending time with God, you know, as like God and I, I
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   would go out and have food with him, going to fast food, you know, going to
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   McDonald's, KFC, all right, maybe a little bit better, Shake Shack or, you
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   know, other fast food restaurants.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   I would spend time with him, quickly have a meal and go because I'm so busy
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   with work, social media, friends, and scrolling on all the reels and having
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   relationships.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   But then I realized I'm always in a rush.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   But God was like, do you want to have fast food with me or do you want to go to
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   a French restaurant and have a three-course dining meal with me, spending
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   quality time with him?
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   Then I was like, oh, right, I've been spending time eating fast food.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   It's great, it's delicious, but is it enough?
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   Maybe not.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   So I was like, I do enjoy the seven days of French dining with God, with a
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   person that I love, and just really enjoy, you know, take time to enjoy the
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   appetizer and have a chat with him.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   What is it made of?
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   Why do you make this?
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   You know, have that conversation.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   And that is the meaning of fasting, not just to sacrifice something that we
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   love and just, oh, I love you, God, that's why I do this.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   But God wants us to spend time with him.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   French dining, if you don't like French, it's fine.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   You can do Chinese cuisine in three hours, too, you know.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   So I just hope that this could encourage you like how it encouraged me as well.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   I'm sure all of you have a lot of testimony and sharing throughout this
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   time of fasting.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   So if you have any testimony, please send your email to our -- the Vine email
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   here, so then we could, you know, be able to encourage one another.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   But of course, we would not share with the public without your permission.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   So please don't be shy, and if you have any good things that God is doing in
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   your life, do share because that's how we experience and witness God's goodness
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   and his work in us.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   Yes.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   And now if we talk about fasting, of course we're going to, you know,
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   incorporate prayer, right?
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   We cannot miss out on that.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   It's really important.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   So at church we have prepared three-day prayer meetings starting tomorrow,
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   So Monday, it's more like an individual prayer time with God.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   We're going to turn this into a prayer room.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   We welcome you to come in any time as you like between 6 to 930.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   So you can come just and pray and go out for food and come back,
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   however you want.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   We want to encourage you to just come and have this space to worship God
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   and to pray.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   And, you know, this is the temple of prayers.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   And the second day, Tuesday, it is our monthly prayer meeting.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   But this day, like this month, we're going to have fasting as our theme.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   So we want to get into a time of worship and prayers just to receive what God
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   is speaking to us as a church and, you know,
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   how the direction and the vision we have for the Vine Yuen Long here.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   So we encourage you to come.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   Do come on time so we can all start worship and prayers together.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   And the last day, the Wednesday, it's the prayer walk.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   So prayer walk, of course, we have individual and we spend time praying
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   with brother, sister.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   Of course, it's important for us to go out and pray in the community that God
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   called us to be in.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   So we encourage you to come at 8.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   We will have a quick debrief, and then we'll probably go out in small groups
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   or pairs around our neighborhood, not too far, just around here,
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   and see where God leads us and what God wants to speak to us.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   And we'll come back here and have a bit of sharing,
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   and that will be the end of the three-day prayer meeting.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   So, of course, no pressure.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   You don't have to feel obligated to come all three.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   It's never out of obligation.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   If you feel called, if you love, and you just really want to be part of
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   these prayer meetings, I encourage you to come.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   Come with your friends, come with your families, and come and just see what
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   God is speaking to you and us as a church.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   But for the second day, especially the third day, we do encourage you to come
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   on time so that we can all start together.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   All right?
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   Perfect.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   I think that's all for announcement today.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   Now is the time of offering.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   I just want to have our welcome team be ready.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   Offering, it's an act of worship and show our gratitude to God.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   And also, it's saying to God, "God, you're above money and everything that I
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   possess because you are a God."
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   And if you're not sure the meaning of offering, please don't worry.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   Don't feel pressure.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   You can just pass the bucket along.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   And apart from the physical bucket, we also have all these online digital
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   methods to do offering as well.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   For those, if you feel called, if you feel like after prayers, you feel called to do
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   so, we really encourage you to do join our monthly offering program so that it's
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   easier for church to do our budgeting as well.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   All right.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   If we could just, you know, bow our heads and let's pray for our offering.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   Yeah, Father, we thank you.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   You're our God, you're our Savior, and you're our life provider, and you're this
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   church provider.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   And all that we have, they're all from you, Lord.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   And Lord, I just pray that you soften our hearts and speak to us that we'll offer
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   not just the money but ourselves and our heart to you for you to use us to be in
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   the work in your kingdom, Lord.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   I just pray that you bless this offering so that it can turn to other blessings,
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   to all ministries and our neighbors and the city, Lord.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   We thank you and we love you.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   Amen.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   Thank you.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   All right.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   So now let us invite our preacher today, Tim.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   Let's give him a warm welcome.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   How are you?
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   I am good, thank you.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   You're good?
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   Great.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   All right.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   All right.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   Shall we just pray for Tim together?
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   Yeah, Heavenly Father, we thank you so much.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   We thank you for Tim, and I thank you for his family and his heart for you, Lord.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   And I just pray that you would anoint his lips as he share your words, as you share
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   the things you want us to hear today, Lord.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   May you just open our hearts and ears to listen and to hear.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   And may you use Tim as a vessel to just speak to us and share with us, Lord.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   Yeah, may you protect him, give him strength and courage and boldness to share.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   Amen.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   Amen.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   Thank you, Francesca.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   Let's give Francesca a hand.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   I loved the analogy of, you know, fasting and sort of fast food, actually having a quality
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   meal with God and spending time with God.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   And that's really what we believe God is calling us into inter-season, you know, is to commune
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   with him and to experience him and just to sit with him, hear from him.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   And so, yeah, that was great.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   Of course, it made me hungry, but that's okay.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   Well, today we're continuing in our sermon series, Fresh Encounters.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   And so, as we were preparing for this, for 2024, as a church family, one of the themes
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   that came up was that need for intimacy, that God wants to do something new, something fresh
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   in our relationship with him.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   And so, we designed a sermon series around the fasting.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   And there is, for every Sunday, we have a topic, a spiritual practice that can help
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   us draw close to God, that can help us encounter him in fresh ways.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   And so, I want to share with you what we have planned.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   So, we've already talked about fasting last week.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   Today, we're going to look at prayer, then next week, personal worship, then there'll
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   be confession and repentance and God's word and how God uses all those five things that
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   draw us near to him.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   Now, I also want to say, for those of you who perhaps have been a Christian for a while,
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   sometimes you're like, "Oh, I know all this.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   You know, I know how to read God's word.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   I know how to pray."
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   And you might say those things.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   But there is a sense that we want to challenge each other to break out of our ruts and out
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   of our routines, because it's easy to have this routine and do the same thing.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   But Jesus wants to meet us in new ways.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   He wants to meet us in fresh ways.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   And so, even though we might be familiar with some of these things or some of these practices,
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   Jesus wants to do something new and something fresh.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   So, let's ask him for that and let's keep challenging each other as we're going through
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   this.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   You know, we want to encounter him in fresh ways.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   Now, today we're looking at the spiritual practice of prayer.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   And there have been, for myself, there's been powerful seasons of prayer where prayer flows
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   for me easily.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   And there is just a sense of communing with God and God's presence and God speaking to
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   me and me having clarity on what he's saying and having clarity about his love.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   And, you know, that's awesome.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   But if I'm honest, there's also a lot of seasons and they do come and go.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   It's not a, you know, you settle this one time and then you're good and you just have
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   easy prayer and easy communing with God.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   There's been a lot of seasons for me where it's been difficult to pray.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   Maybe something difficult was going on in my life and I felt like I was done with words.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   I already had told God everything.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   You know, I didn't know how to, what else to say.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   Can be many different reasons.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   For whatever reason, prayer did not flow easily.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   So I don't know where you are on this topic.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   Maybe your prayer life right now is alive and is amazing.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   I mean, Francesca was sharing that she's experiencing a deeper communion with God in this fasting season.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   That is awesome. Praise God.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   But maybe there's actually right now you're experiencing challenges and it's hard for you to just to commune with Jesus,
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   to hear from him, to experience him.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   Now on a topic like today, it's of course in some way I'm going to encourage you to pray more.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   But if that's the only thing that I'm doing, you already know that.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   So what I want to do today is actually take a little bit of a different angle.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   I want to look with you at how Jesus encourages his disciples to pray.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   How he encourages them to come to the Father.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   And my prayer is that you're encouraged and inspired and moved by the Holy Spirit
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   because of what Jesus is saying to draw closer to him and to commune with him more in prayer.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   Now, before we move further, I actually want to also spend a little bit of time defining what prayer is.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   So let's look at a definition.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   If you're familiar with Pete Gregg, he is the founder of 24/7 Prayer.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   If you've ever done the prayer course, that's the guy who came up with that.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   And he defines prayer the following way.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   He says this, "Prayer is a living conversation with a loving God, which means that we must listen as well as talk."
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   So prayer, when we spend time with God in prayer, we're not just talking.
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   Prayer is not just asking, even though that is an important part of prayer.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   But it's sitting with God quietly.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   It's hearing from him.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   It's talking to him about what's going on.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   It's doing that throughout the day.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   We can do that when we're busy, when we're at work.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   We can pray silently in our hearts.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   But then it's also important to carve out that extra time where we can have this privacy
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   to really listen.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   And so prayer is a huge topic.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   And today I'm not going to be able to cover everything or say everything on that.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   But what I want to do with you is explore how does Jesus encourage his disciples to pray
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   and how might he encourage us through that as well.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   So we're in the Gospel of Matthew.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   We're one of the most famous sections of Scripture, which is known as the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   And we're in Chapter 7, and starting in verse 7, it says this, "Ask, and it will be given to you.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   Seek, and you will find.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   Knock, and the door will be opened to you.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   For everyone who asks receives.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   The one who seeks finds.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   And the one who knocks, the door will be opened.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   Which of you, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone?
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   Or if he asks for fish, will give him a snake?
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children,
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him?"
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   So first, Jesus here, he encourages us to pray by reminding us of the power of prayer.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   And in verse 7 and 8, he repeats twice, "Ask, seek, knock."
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   He's emphasizing that.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   Our prayers really make a difference.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   They really matter.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   God loves when his people come to him and ask.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   He loves responding to our prayers and working through them.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   He loves it.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   And we have a tendency to underestimate that.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   I mean, otherwise, why does Jesus need to encourage the disciples to ask, to seek, to knock?
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   And if we wouldn't underestimate it, we would actually ask more,
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   knock more, seek more.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   Now, for us during the church plan process, we had to ask,
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   because there was no way this could happen.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   And God provided in incredible ways.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   For me, one of the most amazing -- and I know I've shared this several times,
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   but we were still in one tribe.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   We were figuring out what to do.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   We had a barbecue and a one-off Sunday service, and we just really felt God speaking to us
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   and showing us that it was time to move to Yuen Long.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   It was time to go to EIS, even though this building was not ready.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   It was not part of our plan, but God spoke, and so we went.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   It was so good.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   We needed that time.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   It was amazing.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   Then we had the venue here.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   Sometimes you wait until it's quite late to ask.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   So we suddenly hit a dead end here where we were not able to move forward with this place.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   You know, I wrote that speech that I was going to present to the church,
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   and the implications, oh, my gosh, they were weighing on us.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   It had serious financial implications.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   So we're asking God for a provision.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   And then he provided a way forward, even though we were told before
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   that there was no way we could move forward.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   God provided.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   And so this has been part of our journey.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   Right now in this fasting season, we're asking God personally.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   We're asking the Holy Spirit about what he wants to do in our lives.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   You know, is there a pattern of sin that needs to be broken?
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   Do we need some guidance?
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   Is there a decision that we need to make?
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   We're coming before God in prayer.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   We're asking, Lord, speak to us.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   We want to hear from you.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   We need you to work in our lives.
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   But we're not just asking for ourselves.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   I think this is really important.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   We're also asking for the community.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   That's why we're fasting corporately, because we want to see the kingdom of God break into here and now.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   Our heart's prayer is, your kingdom come.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   We want to see God's kingdom manifested in you long, in the present.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   Earlier when we were worshipping, I was like, I'm going to sing.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   You know, there's power in the name of Jesus.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   You know, Jesus in the streets.
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   I'm getting the lyrics wrong.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   It's okay.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   But I was like, that's what we're praying for.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   We're praying for Jesus.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   His name is life.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   We're praying for people's lives to be turned around, for those who don't know that they're loved, that they're valuable, that they're worth.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   I was prayer walking out there by the schools.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   And I just felt led to pray for the students who don't know that they are loved, that they are valuable, that they are worthy.
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   And the Holy Spirit wants to mobilize us and send us out and encourage and speak these truths and love people.
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   And so we're crying out.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   We're asking, your kingdom come.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   That's our heart's cry.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   We're asking God for that.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   We're knocking.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   We're seeking.
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   We're saying not by our own strength, not by our own wisdom, but by your power, by your spirit.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   So this is part of what we're doing because we know we cannot do it.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   We cannot do it.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   So Jesus' encouragement to ask, seek, and knock highlights our temptation not to ask, not to seek, not to knock, and to rely on our own strength and our own resources.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   And we do that all the time.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   I do it all the time.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   I felt as I was preparing this semester, I felt really challenged in that.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   A problem, you know, if something comes up, we go into action mode.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   I like to tackle things.
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   I'm proactive and I try to resolve it.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   And then it doesn't work and I try harder.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   And then I try harder.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   And then finally I realize, oh, I could -- maybe I should pray.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   Anyone do this?
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   Yeah?
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   Okay, I'm not the only one.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   Good.
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   So then I pray, and it's amazing how many times God provides.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   It's amazing.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   Quite a while ago I lost a watch that my father gave me for my 18th birthday.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   And it was somewhere in my apartment.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   So I was searching for my watch.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   And what makes this more special was that he actually had passed away just a little bit less than a year prior.
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   And so this was like a way I'm trying to remember my dad.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   And I'm searching like a madman in my house.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   And I'm searching in places where it doesn't even make sense that the watch could possibly be there.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   I mean, I literally looked at every inch of my house, and I could not find it.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   And I was freaked out because it was so special to me.
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   And so then I prayed and asked Jesus, can you help me find my dad's watch?
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   And as I was praying, I remembered that in one of my drawers there was a crack that was quite wide.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   And so I thought, well, maybe it slipped out there.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   So I took the drawer out, and there was my father's watch.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   And I know this was the Holy Spirit's guidance.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   Why would I think of a crack in my drawer?
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   And so God, when we ask, when we seek, He loves providing.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   He loves providing.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   But truth be told, our prayers don't always have that quick of an answer or a resolution or a provision.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   More times than not, but more times than not, I've experienced God provide.
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   This watch, it was so precious to me.
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   And it was not too small of a thing for God to care about.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   He cares about your details, your personal details in your life.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   And so we can ask Him.
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   We can ask.
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   I'm also reminded of Archbishop William Temple.
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   He said this, when I pray, coincidences happen.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   When I stop praying, the coincidences stop happening.
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   In other words, when I ask, seek, and knock, there's receiving, there's answers.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   When I don't ask, seek, and knock, nothing happens.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   Now, of course, God is good.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   He blesses us in a lot of ways.
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:46.000]   But there are some things He only does when His children come to Him and ask.
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   Now, you might think, well, that's great for you.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   That's your experience, Tim.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   This is not for me.
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:03.000]   In verse 8, it says this, "For everyone who asks, receives."
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   This is not just for pastors.
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   This is not for especially spiritual people.
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   This is not for people who didn't sin last week.
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   Everyone who asks, receives.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   God loves you.
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   He loves when His children come to Him and ask.
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   He loves giving you things, good things.
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   And I wonder, who of us here today has been intimidated or hesitant to ask God, ask our Heavenly Father?
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   Who here has felt disqualified or not addressed when Jesus says that everyone who asks, receives?
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   Who here feels right now disqualified or not addressed?
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   You're not disqualified.
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   Jesus loves you.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.000]   Your Heavenly Father loves you.
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:24.000]   This is for every one of us, not just for some, for every one of us.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:27.000]   He loves when His children come to Him.
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:36.000]   Now, at this point, you might be wondering, is it really true that God answers every request we make?
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   And this is based on our experience because we've prayed.
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   And it seems like there has been no answer, right?
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:47.000]   Come on, let's be honest.
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   While it is true that everyone who asks, receives, it is not true that everyone receives exactly what they ask for.
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   That's a big difference.
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   Sometimes God gives us exactly what we request, you know, on the time when we need it, in that moment.
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   Amazing, like with my watch, praise God, praise God.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:18.000]   And other times He gives us something even better because we don't even sometimes know how to ask for good things for us.
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   He gives us better things.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:30.000]   But then sometimes we also don't receive what we ask for.
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   But we still receive.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:33.000]   Think of Jesus.
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:42.000]   Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane, He prayed that this cup can pass, which means He was praying that He didn't have to go through the suffering of the cross.
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   He prayed to the Father three times.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   Now, the Heavenly Father didn't answer Jesus' prayer by removing the suffering.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   But Jesus did receive from His Father.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   He gave Him the grace and the strength to go through the cross and to rise from the dead.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   So everyone who asks, receives.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   But we need to come.
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   We need to ask.
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   We need to knock.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   We need to search.
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:27.000]   So Jesus encourages us to ask, knock, and seek.
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   He encourages us, He encourages His disciples by saying everyone who asks, receives.
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   And this encouragement is really rooted in God's goodness and who God is.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.000]   That He loves you.
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:45.000]   That He's for you.
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   He's not against you.
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:51.000]   That's why we can come.
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:55.000]   That's why we know He will be good to us because our Father is good.
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   That's how Jesus is encouraging us.
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000]   Because God is good.
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.000]   He is faithful.
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   And He loves you.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:14.000]   But let's continue looking at our passage.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   In verse 9, starting verse 9, it says this.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:22.000]   Which of you, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone?
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   Or if he asks for fish, will give him a snake?
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children,
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:40.000]   how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask Him?
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   So Jesus draws on this everyday experience that we have.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   And you can even have this experience here because there's lots of children here that come to their parents and ask for things.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:57.000]   Parents love giving good things to their children.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:03.000]   It says, though while we are evil, this is talking about our sinfulness, our brokenness of all humanity.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000]   You know, we're selfish.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   There's just things in our hearts.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.000]   And even as parents, we're broken parents.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:19.000]   But despite of that, we still give good things to our children.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   And then Jesus says, how much more?
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   Because God is perfect.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000]   Our heavenly Father is perfect.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   How much more will He give you good things to those who ask?
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:42.000]   How much more?
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   I was thinking of, when I was a child, if I would have had the option with my parent in a superstore,
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   it might have been a superstore or supermarket, and I could have picked what's for dinner.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:06.000]   Chances are, I would have picked like ten Snickers or something that's not good for me.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000]   Or whatever I was in the mood for at the time.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:14.000]   So good parents, maybe they let you have one of those candy bars.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000]   But then there's a point where they're going to say no.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   But they give good things.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   You know, our Father in heaven, we come to Him, He has the big picture.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.000]   We don't have the big picture of our lives in mind.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000]   We don't.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000]   But God knows everything.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:36.000]   And so when we come to Him and ask, we have the promise that He will give us good things.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   That things are in line with His will, in line with His purpose.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:49.000]   And one of the things that I love right now is that we're praying for a community.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000]   God loves that.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.000]   Because we're praying for good things.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:05.000]   We're praying for God to just pour out His love, to pour out His provision on the people around us.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.000]   God loves answering those prayers.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   And God loves also answering our prayers when we as children come to our Heavenly Father.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   Now I want to highlight that Jesus refers to God as your Father in heaven.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   Your Father.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   And since God is our Father, that means that we have been adopted as His children into His family.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:41.000]   And He's already made us the greatest gift of all.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   Which is the gift of salvation.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000]   He has forgiven us our sins.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:51.000]   He has brought us in as His sons, as daughters, as children.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:59.000]   And if He's already made you the greatest gift, and you come to your Father and you ask Him,
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:10.000]   He is for you, He loves you, He's not going to withhold good things from you.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   And Jesus wants His disciples to know this.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:19.000]   And so He encourages them to come to their loving Heavenly Father.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:23.000]   He loves you, He loves you.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:28.000]   And so we come as children to our Father in prayer.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:33.000]   Now one thing, this passage does focus a lot on asking.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:42.000]   But I really, as I was preparing for this message, I did have a strong sense that some of our fresh encounter
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:48.000]   is really just growing in this father-child relationship for us.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:52.000]   Of getting to know God as our loving, perfect Father.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:58.000]   I know our human fathers, a lot of times, Bernard, are not perfect.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000]   But God is perfect.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:06.000]   And He wants us to learn to relate to Him as a child relates to the Father.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:12.000]   Bernard, you don't have to be hesitant when you're a child to come to your dad.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:24.000]   You can just come and be and ask and spend time and tell your father about the day and what has happened.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:36.000]   Now for me, when I was a young adult, there was a lot of guilt, shame, pain in my life.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:42.000]   And even though I was a Christian, my relationship with God was not one of a child with a father.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000]   With a loving Heavenly Father.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:56.000]   It felt maybe a little bit more like coming to your business manager, your boss or something.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:05.000]   I didn't feel like I was adequate because I knew my life.
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:11.000]   It was so much just shame and sin.
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:16.000]   I felt like I could not come to my Heavenly Father.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.000]   I didn't feel like I always had access.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:26.000]   And then I had this powerful experience where somebody was teaching on who God is and how He loves us.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000]   And then there was a prayer time afterwards.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:35.000]   At first I was sitting and later on I was on the floor weeping.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:46.000]   But it's been one of the most healing moments of my life where God revealed Himself to me as the loving Father.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:55.000]   And this pain, this shame, this guilt, it started melting away in the presence of God.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:02.000]   I was communing with my loving Dad.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000]   Now this is revelation.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:12.000]   This is the Holy Spirit's work revealing God to us in this way.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:17.000]   But I have a sense that some of us need this revelation.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:27.000]   God wants to reveal Himself as the Father who loves you.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:33.000]   So Jesus encourages us to come to Him.
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:41.000]   Come to our Heavenly Father to bring anything that's going on in our lives to Him.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:50.000]   To open our hearts to Him, to receive His love, His care, His goodness, His provision.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:08:01.000]   To bring our requests and experience how He meets us.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:06.000]   So we've seen that Jesus encourages His disciples to ask, not seek.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:11.000]   We've seen that He encourages us to come like a child, to come to the Father.
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:18.000]   And I wonder how is Jesus encouraging us here today for a fresh encounter with Him in prayer?
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:27.000]   How is He inviting you to experience Him in a new way?
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:31.000]   What is the rut He might be inviting you to break out of?
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000]   Or what routine is He calling you to break out?
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:43.000]   So perhaps for some of us, this means instead of relying on our own resources and our own strengths,
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:49.000]   and that being our first thing that we do, we get into action mode, we try to resolve things.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000]   That's my default.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:58.000]   But actually, I wonder what would happen if we bring more of our daily life
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000]   in the conversation with our Heavenly Father?
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.000]   If we just start by bringing those things to God,
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:10.000]   instead of first just trying to resolve everything until we hit a wall and then come to Him.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000]   I really felt Jesus challenged me to flip this around,
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:18.000]   to not only come when I'm at a dead end, but already beforehand be talking to Him,
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000]   and asking and seeking and knocking.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:26.000]   So perhaps that is a fresh way that God is also inviting you to relate to Him.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:33.000]   Or for others of us, God is inviting us to come to Him in prayer as a child comes to the Father.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:38.000]   We're children of God, but often relate to God as a business manager
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:45.000]   who does not have time for us, who's too busy, who doesn't want to be bothered.
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.000]   You have His attention.
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000]   He has time for you to spare.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.000]   He loves when you come to Him.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.000]   He delights in you.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:04.000]   And when we get to know God as our loving Father,
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:11.000]   we start to experience wholeness, peace, security.
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:20.000]   So how is God inviting you to renew, to refresh your prayer life?
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.000]   I want to invite the worship team to come up right now.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:31.000]   And what I want to invite you to do is actually something we do quite often at the Vine,
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:36.000]   Brother and Monsignor here, is we want to pray with each other.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000]   So whether you pray with somebody you came with, you know,
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000]   maybe there's somebody close to you and you just ask,
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.000]   "Hey, would you be cool that we can pray together?"
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000]   I want to encourage you to pray with each other,
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:54.000]   to pray for your prayer life, to pray--you can share how you need prayer
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.000]   and just to minister to each other, just to come to our Heavenly Father in prayer.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:03.000]   So we're going to do this for five to seven minutes,
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:06.000]   and then I'll bring us back together.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000]   So let's--yeah, let's do that right now.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.000]   So let's turn to each other. Let's pray for each other.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000]   The prayer team will also be up here.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000]   If you would like somebody to minister to you in prayer, you can come to them.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.000]   We would love to pray with you as well.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000]   Let's do this now.

[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:17.000]   Heavenly Father, thank you that you love us.
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:24.000]   Thank you for all the prayers being lifted up to you,
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.000]   that you hear us, that you love answering our prayers,
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:33.000]   that you love meeting us, providing for us, caring for us.
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:39.000]   Lord, I pray for deeper revelations of who you are.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:45.000]   When we feel like we're distant from you or we don't belong,
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:50.000]   when you feel like we don't deserve to be close to you,
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:53.000]   I pray that you remove those lies,
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.000]   that your love breaks through whatever walls have been built up.
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:01.000]   Whatever walls have been built up, I pray right now in Jesus' name
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:04.000]   that you tear them down.
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.000]   Jesus, through your sacrifice, we have access.
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:14.000]   We have access to the Father anywhere, anytime.
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:23.000]   And so, Lord, I ask that this year
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000]   that you would do something new in us,
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:29.000]   in us as a community, in our personal lives,
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:33.000]   that you grow us deeper in prayer,
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.000]   deeper in communing with you.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:41.000]   I pray for a new work, and we know that's you.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:44.000]   We can't force that, we can do it. It's your work.
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:47.000]   In the Holy Spirit, we ask for you to work in this way.
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:50.000]   I pray this in your name, Jesus. Amen.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:54.000]   Why don't we all stand and let's worship.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.000]   Let's stand and let's worship.
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:11.000]   This is a very simple song,
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:17.000]   but I just wanted to sing this and just shout it out to Jesus,
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:21.000]   the one who loves us,
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.000]   the one who cares for us,
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.000]   the one who hears every single prayer that we have.
