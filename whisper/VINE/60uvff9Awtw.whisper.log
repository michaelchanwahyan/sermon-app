[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   Amen. Thank you, Francesca. Let's give Francesca a hand.
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.800]   I loved the analogy of, you know, fasting and instead of fast food,
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.600]   actually having a quality meal with God and spending time with God.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.600]   And that's really what we believe God is calling us into inter-season.
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:26.560]   You know, it's the commune with Him and to experience Him and just to sit with Him, hear from Him.
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.840]   And so, yeah, that was great. Of course, it made me hungry, but that's okay.
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.200]   Well, today we're continuing in our sermon series, Fresh Encounters.
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:44.640]   And so, as we were preparing for this, for 2024, as a church family,
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.040]   one of the themes that came up was that need for intimacy,
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:56.480]   that God wants to do something new, something fresh in our relationship with Him.
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.320]   And so, we designed a sermon series around the fasting.
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:12.480]   And there is for every Sunday, we have a topic, a spiritual practice that can help us draw close to God,
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.320]   that can help us encounter Him in fresh ways.
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.760]   And so, I want to share with you what we have planned.
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.520]   So, we've already talked about fasting last week.
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.160]   Today, we're going to look at prayer, then next week, personal worship,
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.680]   then there'll be confession and repentance and God's Word,
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.720]   and how God uses all those five things to draw us near to Him.
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.280]   Now, I also want to say for those of you who perhaps have been a Christian for a while,
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.480]   sometimes you're like, "Oh, I know all this. I know how to read God's Word.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.440]   I know how to pray." And you might say those things.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:02:00.800]   But there is a sense that we want to challenge each other to break out of our ruts and out of our routines.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.800]   Because it's easy to have this routine and do the same thing.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.160]   But Jesus wants to meet us in new ways. He wants to meet us in fresh ways.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.480]   And so, even though we might be familiar with some of these things or some of these practices,
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.280]   Jesus wants to do something new and something fresh.
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.280]   So, let's ask Him for that, and let's keep challenging each other as we're going through this.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.360]   You know, we want to encounter Him in fresh ways.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.520]   Now, today, we're looking at the spiritual practice of prayer.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.760]   And there have been, for myself, there's been powerful seasons of prayer,
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.200]   where prayer flows for me easily.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:49.040]   And there is just a sense of communing with God and God's presence and God speaking to me,
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:56.720]   and me having clarity on what He's saying and having clarity about His love.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.400]   And, you know, that's awesome.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.240]   But if I'm honest, there's also a lot of seasons, and they do come and go.
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.240]   It's not a, you know, you settle this one time, and then you're good,
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.480]   and you just have easy prayer and easy communion with God.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.080]   There's been a lot of seasons for me where it's been difficult to pray.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:26.240]   Maybe something difficult was going on in my life, and I felt like I was done with words.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.120]   I already had told God everything.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.400]   You know, I didn't know what else to say.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.840]   Can be many different reasons.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.440]   For whatever reason, prayer did not flow easily.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.840]   So I don't know where you are on this topic.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.920]   Maybe your prayer life right now is alive and is amazing.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.400]   I mean, Francesca was sharing that she's experiencing a deeper communion with God
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.160]   in this fasting season.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.040]   That is awesome.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.360]   Praise God.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.720]   But maybe there's actually, right now, you're experiencing challenges,
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:10.240]   and it's hard for you to just to commune with Jesus, to hear from Him, to experience Him.
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:17.360]   Now, on a topic like today, it's, of course, in some way, I'm going to encourage you to pray more.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.680]   But if that's the only thing that I'm doing, you already know that.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.480]   So what I want to do today is actually take a little bit of a different angle.
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:33.920]   I want to look with you at how Jesus encourages His disciples to pray,
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:40.880]   how He encourages them to come to the Father.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:50.800]   And my prayer is that you're encouraged and inspired and moved by the Holy Spirit
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.240]   because of what Jesus is saying to draw closer to Him.
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.720]   And to commune with Him more in prayer.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:09.360]   Now, before we move further, I actually want to also spend a little bit of time defining what prayer is.
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.960]   So let's look at a definition.
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.880]   If you're familiar with Pete Gregg, he is the founder of 24/7 Prayer.
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.280]   If you've ever done the prayer course, that's the guy who came up with that.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.680]   And he defines prayer the following way.
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.400]   He says this, "Prayer is a living conversation with a loving God,
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.680]   which means that we must listen as well as talk."
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:40.960]   So prayer, when we spend time with God in prayer, we're not just talking.
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.120]   Prayer is not just asking, even though that is an important part of prayer.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.240]   But it's sitting with God quietly.
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.560]   It's hearing from Him.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.000]   It's talking to Him about what's going on.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.240]   It's doing that throughout the day.
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.800]   We can do that when we're busy, when we're at work.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.720]   We can pray silently in our hearts.
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:14.880]   But then it's also important to carve out that extra time where we can have this privacy to really listen.
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.600]   And so prayer is a huge topic.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.040]   And today I'm not going to be able to cover everything or say everything on that.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:31.760]   But what I want to do with you is explore how does Jesus encourage His disciples to pray,
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.160]   and how might He encourage us through that as well.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.760]   So we're in the Gospel of Matthew.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:45.200]   We're one of the most famous sections of Scripture, which is known as the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.440]   And we're in chapter 7, and starting in verse 7, it says this,
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.400]   "Ask, and it will be given to you.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.720]   Seek, and you will find.
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.160]   Knock, and the door will be opened to you.
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.280]   For everyone who asks receives.
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.280]   The one who seeks finds.
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.560]   And the one who knocks, the door will be opened.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:11.120]   Which of you, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone?
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:16.160]   Or if he asks for fish, will give him a snake?
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:22.000]   If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children,
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.480]   how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask Him?"
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:38.960]   So first, Jesus here, He encourages us to pray by reminding us of the power of prayer.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:47.120]   And in verse 7 and 8, He repeats twice, "Ask, seek, knock."
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.600]   He's emphasizing that.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.680]   Our prayers really make a difference.
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.720]   They really matter.
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.240]   God loves when His people come to Him and ask.
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.840]   He loves responding to our prayers and working through them.
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.360]   He loves it.
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:11.280]   And we have a tendency to underestimate that.
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:17.360]   I mean, otherwise, why does Jesus need to encourage the disciples to ask, to seek, to knock?
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:26.800]   And if we wouldn't underestimate it, we would actually ask more, knock more, seek more.
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:38.960]   Now, for us during the church plan process, we had to ask, because there was no way this could happen.
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.800]   And God provided in incredible ways.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:46.320]   For me, one of the most amazing, and I know I've shared this several times,
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.280]   but we were still in one tribe.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.960]   We were figuring out what to do.
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:58.320]   We had a barbecue and a one-off Sunday service, and we just really felt God speaking to us
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.480]   and showing us that it was time to move to Yuen Long.
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:06.240]   It was time to go to EIS, even though this building was not ready.
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:12.880]   It was not part of our plan, but God spoke, and so we went.
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.160]   And it was so good.
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.440]   We needed a time.
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.400]   It was amazing.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.600]   Then we had the venue here.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.040]   Sometimes you wait until it's quite late to ask.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:31.600]   So we suddenly hit a dead end here, where we were not able to move forward with this place.
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:35.280]   You know, I wrote that speech that I was going to present to the church,
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.000]   and the implications, oh my gosh, they were weighing on us.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.160]   I go, it's had serious financial implications.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.800]   So we're asking God for a provision.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:48.960]   And then he provided a way forward, even though we were told before
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.600]   that there was no way we could move forward.
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.360]   God provided.
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.720]   And so this has been part of our journey.
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.760]   Right now in this fasting season, we're asking God personally.
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:04.480]   We're asking the Holy Spirit about what he wants to do in our lives.
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:08.240]   You know, is there a pattern of sin that needs to be broken?
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.920]   Do we need some guidance?
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.760]   Is there a decision that we need to make?
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.880]   We're coming before God and praying, asking, Lord, speak to us.
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.720]   We want to hear from you.
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.720]   We need you to work in our lives.
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.920]   Then, but we're not just asking for ourselves.
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.280]   I think this is really important.
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:26.240]   We're also asking for the community.
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:31.280]   That's why we're fasting corporately, because we want to see the kingdom of God
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:32.640]   break into here and now.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:39.680]   Our heart's prayer is your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:47.840]   We want to see God's kingdom manifested in you long in the present.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:58.880]   Earlier when we were worshipping, I'm like going to sing, you know, there's power in the name of Jesus.
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.440]   You know, Jesus in the streets, I'm getting the lyrics wrong, it's okay.
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:07.600]   But I was like, that's what we're praying for.
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.880]   We're praying for Jesus.
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.480]   His name is life.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:19.600]   We're praying for people's lives to be turned around, for those who don't know that their
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.000]   love, that their valuable, that their worth.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:29.200]   I was prayer walking out there by the schools, and I just thought, I'm going to pray for
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:34.240]   people, and I just felt led to pray for the students who don't know that they are loved,
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.760]   that they are valuable, that they are worthy.
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:50.480]   And the Holy Spirit wants to mobilize us and send us out and encourage and speak these
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.080]   truths and love people.
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:58.240]   And so we're crying out, we're asking your kingdom come, your will be done.
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:03.040]   And earth as it is in heaven, that's our hearts cry.
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.040]   We're asking God for that.
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.720]   We're knocking, we're seeking.
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:14.240]   We're saying not by our own strength, not by our own wisdom, but by your power, by your
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:14.800]   spirit.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:22.080]   So this is part of what we're doing because we know we cannot do it.
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.840]   We cannot do it.
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:37.680]   So Jesus's encouragement to ask, seek, and knock highlights our temptation not to ask,
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:46.160]   not to seek, not to knock, and to rely on our own strength and our own resources.
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.560]   And we do that all the time.
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.520]   I do it all the time.
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:54.480]   I felt as I was preparing this semester, I felt really challenged in that.
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:58.320]   A problem, you know, if something comes up, we go into action mode.
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.640]   I like to tackle things.
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.600]   I'm proactive and I try to resolve it.
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:08.480]   And then it doesn't work and I try harder and then I try harder.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.440]   And then finally I realized, oh, I could, maybe I should pray.
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.880]   Anyone do this?
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.160]   Yeah?
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.120]   Okay, I'm not the only one.
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:15.360]   Good.
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:19.920]   So then I pray and it's amazing how many times God provides.
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.720]   It's amazing.
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:32.560]   I, quite a while ago, I lost a watch that my father gave me for my 18th birthday.
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.840]   And it was somewhere in my apartment.
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.080]   So I was searching for my watch.
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:44.880]   And what makes us more special was that he actually had passed away just a little bit
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:45.920]   less than a year prior.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:50.800]   And so this had, it was like a way I'm trying to remember my dad.
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.600]   And I'm searching like a madman in my house.
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:58.240]   And I'm searching in places where it doesn't even make sense that the watch could possibly
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.120]   be there.
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:04.320]   I mean, I literally looked at every inch of my house and I could not find it.
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:09.440]   And I was freaked out because this was so special to me.
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:17.680]   And then I prayed and asked Jesus, can you help me find my dad's watch?
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:24.560]   And as I was praying, I remembered that in one of my drawers, there was a crack that
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:25.520]   was quite wide.
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.880]   And so I thought, well, maybe it slipped out there.
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:32.480]   So I took the drawer out and there was my father's watch.
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:36.320]   And I know this was the Holy Spirit's guidance.
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.800]   I would, why would I think of a crack in my drawer?
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.640]   You know?
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:45.600]   And so God, when we ask, when we seek, he loves providing.
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.440]   He loves providing.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:53.680]   But truth be told, our prayers don't always have that quick of an answer or a resolution
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:54.480]   or a provision.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:15:01.680]   More times than not, but more times than not, I've experienced God provide.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:07.200]   This, this watch, it was so precious to me.
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:11.280]   And it was not too small of a thing for God to care about.
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:17.680]   He cares about your details, your personal details in your life.
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:21.680]   And so we can ask him, we can ask.
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:26.800]   I'm also reminded of Archbishop William Temple.
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:30.800]   He said this, when I pray, coincidences happen.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:34.640]   When I stop praying, the coincidences stop happening.
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:41.200]   In other words, when I ask, seek, and knock, I'm not asking for anything.
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:47.920]   Because when I ask, seek, and knock, there's receiving, there's answers.
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:52.960]   When I don't ask, seek, and knock, nothing happens.
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.680]   Now, of course, God is good.
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:16:00.800]   He blesses us in a lot of ways, but there's certain things he only does when his children
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:01.760]   come to him and ask.
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:07.360]   Now, you might think, well, that's, that's great for you.
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.720]   That, that's, that's your experience, Tim.
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:14.800]   This is not for me.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:21.360]   In verse eight, it says this, for everyone who asks, receives.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.600]   This is not just for pastors.
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.960]   This is not for especially spiritual people.
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:30.080]   This is not for people who didn't sin last week.
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:38.240]   Everyone who asks, receives.
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.200]   God loves you.
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:43.040]   He loves when his children come to him and ask.
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:50.560]   He loves giving you things, good things.
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:17:00.880]   And I wonder, whoever's here today has been intimidated or hesitant to ask God,
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:05.440]   to ask our Heavenly Father, who here has felt this love?
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:15.360]   Who here has felt disqualified or not addressed when Jesus says that everyone who asks, receives?
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:23.360]   Who here feels right now disqualified or not addressed?
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:31.760]   You're not disqualified.
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.680]   Jesus loves you.
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.680]   Your Heavenly Father loves you.
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:42.640]   This is for every one of us, not just for some, for every one of us.
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:45.760]   He loves when his children come to him.
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:53.920]   Now, at this point, you might be wondering, is it really true that God answers every request we make?
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:57.840]   And this is based on our experience because we've prayed.
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:02.080]   And it seems like there has been no answer, right?
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:04.560]   Come on, let's, let's be honest.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:08.800]   While it is true that everyone who asks, receives,
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:12.880]   it is not true that everyone receives exactly what they ask for.
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.600]   That's a big difference.
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:23.120]   Sometimes God gives us exactly what we request, you know, in the time when we need it, in that moment.
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:27.440]   Amazing, like with my watch, praise God, praise God.
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:30.160]   And other times he gives us something even better.
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:35.200]   Because we don't even sometimes know how to ask for good things for us.
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.200]   He gives us better things.
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:44.960]   But then sometimes we also don't receive what we ask for.
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:49.280]   What we still receive.
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:50.080]   Think of Jesus.
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:55.360]   Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane, he prayed that this cup can pass,
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:58.960]   which means he was praying that he didn't have to go through the suffering of the cross.
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:03.200]   He prayed to the Father three times.
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:13.440]   Now, the Heavenly Father didn't answer Jesus's prayer in by removing the suffering.
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.800]   But Jesus did receive from his Father.
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:22.800]   He gave him the grace and the strength to go through the cross and the rise from the dead.
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.240]   So everyone who asks receives.
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.440]   But we need to come.
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.600]   We need to ask.
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:34.400]   We need to knock.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.960]   We need to search.
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:43.600]   So Jesus encourages us to ask, knock and seek.
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:50.240]   He encourages us, he encourages the disciples by saying everyone who asks receives.
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:59.120]   And this encouragement is really rooted in God's goodness and who God is.
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.200]   That he loves you.
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.800]   That he's for you, he's not against you.
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:08.160]   That's why we can come.
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:13.840]   That's why we know he will be good to us because our Father is good.
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:15.840]   That's how Jesus is encouraging us.
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:19.200]   Because God is good.
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.520]   He is faithful.
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.640]   And he loves you.
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:29.680]   But let's continue looking at our passage.
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:37.840]   In verse 9, starting verse 9 says this, "Which of you, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone?
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:42.480]   Or if he asks for fish, will give him a snake?
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:48.400]   If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children,
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:54.960]   how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him?"
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:21:02.160]   So Jesus draws on this everyday experience that we have.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:05.040]   And you can even have this experience here because there's lots of children here
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.200]   that come to their parents and they ask for things.
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:12.480]   Parents love giving good things to their children.
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:21.520]   And it says, "Though while we are evil," this is talking about our sinfulness, our brokenness of all humanity.
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.400]   You know, we're selfish, there's just things in our hearts.
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.920]   And even as parents, we're broken parents.
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:32.320]   But despite of that, we still give good things to our children.
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:40.960]   And then Jesus says, "How much more?"
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.960]   Because God is perfect, our Heavenly Father is perfect.
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:50.080]   How much more will he give you good things to those who ask?
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:53.760]   How much more?
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:22:05.360]   Now I was thinking of, if when I was a child, if I would have had the option
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:11.120]   with my parent in a superstore, not super, it might have been a superstore, a supermarket,
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.960]   and I could have picked what's for dinner.
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:22.800]   Chances are, I would have picked like 10 Snickers or something that's not good for me.
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.880]   Or whatever I was in the mood for at the time.
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:33.040]   Now good parents, maybe they let you have one of those candy bars,
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.040]   but then there's a point where they're going to say no.
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:38.640]   But they give good things.
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.640]   You know, our Father in heaven, we come to him,
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.440]   he has the big picture.
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.440]   We don't have the big picture of our lives in mind.
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:46.880]   We don't.
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.960]   But God knows everything.
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:55.840]   And so when we come to him and ask, we have the promise that he will give us good things.
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:58.960]   The things that are in line with his will, align with his purpose.
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:05.920]   And one of the things that I love right now is that we're praying for our community.
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:12.160]   God loves that because we're praying for good things.
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:23.440]   We're praying for God to just pour out his love, to pour his provision on the people around us.
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.400]   God loves answering those prayers.
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:33.440]   God loves also answering our prayers when we as children come to our heavenly Father.
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:41.440]   Now I want to highlight that Jesus refers to God as your Father in heaven, your Father.
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:49.680]   And since God is our Father, it means that we have been adopted as his children into his family.
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:57.520]   And he's already made us the greatest gift of all,
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:02.320]   which is the gift of salvation.
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:09.840]   He has forgiven us our sins, he has brought us in as his sons, his daughters, his children.
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:16.720]   And if he's already made you the greatest gift, and you come to your Father and you ask him,
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:23.920]   he is for you, he loves you, he's not going to withhold good things from you.
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.280]   And Jesus wants his disciples to know this.
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:36.400]   And so he encourages them to come to their loving heavenly Father.
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:39.920]   He loves you, he loves you.
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:46.000]   And so we come as children to our Father in prayer.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.520]   Now one thing, this passage does focus a lot on asking.
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:58.320]   But I really, as I was preparing for this message, I did have a strong sense that some of our fresh
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:09.360]   encounter is really just growing in this father-child relationship for us, of getting to know
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.600]   God as our loving, perfect Father.
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:16.880]   I know our human fathers, a lot of times, were not, are not perfect.
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.720]   But God is perfect.
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:24.880]   And he wants us to learn to relate to him as a child relates to the Father.
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:28.400]   You don't have to be hesitant when you're a child to come to your dad.
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:40.240]   You can just come and be and ask and spend time and tell your father about the day and what has
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:40.640]   happened.
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:54.240]   Now for me, when I was a young adult, there was a lot of guilt, shame, pain in my life.
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:58.720]   And my, even though I was a Christian, my relationship with God was not one of a child
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:01.600]   with a father, with a loving heavenly Father.
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:10.640]   Felt maybe a little bit more like coming to your business manager, your boss or something.
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:21.840]   I didn't, I didn't feel like I was adequate because I knew, I knew my life.
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:25.920]   It was so much just shame and sin.
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:33.120]   And I felt like I could not come to my heavenly Father.
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:36.320]   I didn't feel like I always had access.
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:42.720]   And then I had this powerful experience where somebody was teaching on who God is and how
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:43.920]   he loves us.
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.920]   And then there was a prayer time afterwards.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:51.680]   And first I was sitting and later on I was on the floor weeping.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:27:00.720]   But it's been one of the most healing moments of my life where God revealed himself to me
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.560]   as the loving Father.
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:12.400]   And this pain, this shame, this guilt, it started melting away in the presence of God.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.160]   I was communing with my loving dad.
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:22.320]   Now this is revelation.
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:27.600]   This is the Holy Spirit's work revealing God to us in this way.
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:33.120]   But I have a sense that some of us need this revelation.
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:39.040]   God wants to reveal himself as the Father who loves you.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:50.160]   So Jesus encourages us to come to him, to come to our heavenly Father, to bring anything
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:59.360]   that's going on in our lives to him, pour our hearts to him, to receive his love, his
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.760]   care, his goodness, his provision.
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:07.760]   To bring our requests and experience how he meets us.
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:19.120]   So we've seen that Jesus encourages his disciples to ask, not seek.
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:23.120]   We've seen that he encourages us to come like a child, to come to the Father.
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:29.040]   And I wonder how is Jesus encouraging us here today to come to him?
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:37.120]   How is Jesus encouraging us here today for a fresh encounter with him in prayer?
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:42.960]   How is he inviting you to experiencing him a new way?
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:49.440]   What is the rut he might be inviting you to break out of?
[00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:53.360]   Out of what routine is he calling you to break out?
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:59.760]   Well, perhaps for some of us, this means instead of relying on our own resources and our own
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:06.800]   strengths, and that being our first thing that we do, we get in the action mode, we
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:07.920]   try to resolve things.
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:09.920]   That's my default.
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:18.240]   But actually, I wonder what would happen if we bring more of our daily life in the conversation
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:19.040]   with our heavenly Father?
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:25.040]   What if we just start by bringing those things to God instead of first just trying to resolve
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:27.120]   everything and until we hit a wall and then come to him?
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:34.240]   I really felt Jesus challenged me to flip this around, to not only come when I'm at
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:39.520]   a dead end, but already beforehand be talking to him and asking and seeking and knocking.
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:44.320]   So perhaps that is a fresh way that God is also inviting you to relate to him.
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:51.280]   Or for others of us, God is inviting us to come to him in prayer as a child comes to
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:51.920]   the Father.
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:58.960]   We're children of God, but often relate to God as a business manager who does not have
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:03.280]   time for us, who's too busy, who doesn't want to be bothered.
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.160]   You have his attention.
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:10.960]   He has time for you to spare.
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:13.840]   He loves when you come to him.
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:17.440]   He delights in you.
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:25.200]   And when we get to know God as our loving Father, we start to experience wholeness,
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:27.840]   peace, security.
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:38.320]   So how is God inviting you to renew, to refresh your prayer life?
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:42.000]   Now I want to invite the worship team to come up right now.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:49.920]   And what I want to invite you to do is actually it's something we do quite often at the Vine,
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:53.360]   whether in Monshire here, is we want to pray with each other.
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:58.720]   So whether you pray with somebody you came with, you know, maybe there's somebody close
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:02.720]   to you and you just ask, "Hey, would you be cool that we can pray together?"
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:09.520]   I want to encourage you to pray with each other, to pray for your prayer life, to pray
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:15.440]   you can share how you need prayer and just to minister to each other, just to come to
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.960]   our heavenly Father in prayer.
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:24.160]   So we're going to do this for five to seven minutes, and then I'll bring us back together.
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:27.360]   So let's, yeah, let's do that right now.
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:28.720]   So let's turn to each other.
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:29.760]   Let's pray for each other.
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:32.560]   The prayer team will also be up here.
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:35.680]   If you would like somebody to minister to you in prayer, you can come to them.
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:37.120]   We would love to pray with you as well.
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:39.360]   [Prayer]
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:40.400]   Now.
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.400]   [Prayer]
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.400]   [Prayer]

[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:50.400]   [Prayer]
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.400]   [Prayer]
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.400]   [Prayer]
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.400]   [Prayer]
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.400]   [Prayer]
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.400]   [Prayer]
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:02.400]   [Prayer]

[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:12.400]   [Prayer]
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:14.400]   [Prayer]
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.400]   [Prayer]

[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:30.400]   [Prayer]

[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:32.560]   - Heavenly Father,
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:35.480]   (soft piano music)
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:37.480]   thank you that you love us.
[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:40.480]   (soft piano music)
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:43.480]   Thank you for all the prayers being lifted up to you,
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:45.480]   that you hear us,
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:47.480]   that you love answering our prayers,
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:52.480]   that you love meeting us, providing for us, caring for us.
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:58.480]   Lord, I pray for deeper revelations of who you are.
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:01.480]   (soft piano music)
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:06.400]   When we feel like we're distant from you or we don't belong,
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:11.400]   when you feel like we don't deserve to be close to you,
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:14.400]   I pray that you remove those lies,
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:18.400]   that your love breaks through whatever walls have been built up.
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:20.400]   Whatever walls have been built up,
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:23.400]   I pray right now in Jesus' name that you tear them down.
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:31.400]   Jesus, through your sacrifice, we have access.
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:34.320]   We have access to the Father anywhere, anytime.
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:44.320]   And so, Lord, I ask that this year
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.320]   that you would do something new in us,
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:50.320]   in us as a community, in our personal lives,
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:54.320]   that you grow us deeper in prayer,
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:56.320]   deeper in communing with you.
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:00.320]   I pray for a new work,
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:01.320]   and we know that's you.
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:03.320]   We can't force that. We can do it.
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:04.320]   It's your work.
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:07.320]   It's the Holy Spirit we ask for you to work in this way.
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:10.320]   I pray this in your name, Jesus. Amen.
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:11.320]   (congregation murmurs)
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:14.320]   Why don't we all stand and let's worship?
