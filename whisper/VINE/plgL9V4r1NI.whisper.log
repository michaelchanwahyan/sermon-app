[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700]   Have a seat.
[00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.780]   Well, I wanna continue our conversation today on intimacy,
[00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.440]   this theme that we've been having over us
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.600]   as a church community for this past year.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.100]   And I wanna talk about what I would consider
[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.600]   perhaps one of the most critical things that is involved,
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.040]   not just in your intimacy with God,
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.100]   but in particular, your intimacy with one another.
[00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.980]   I wanna talk a little bit today
[00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.520]   about what that intimacy can look like with one another.
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.600]   And the topic that I'm talking about,
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.160]   I think has probably the greatest power
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.180]   to impact a church community
[00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.060]   with the community in which it's planted in.
[00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.320]   So what we're talking about today
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.640]   has a significant impact into what it is to serve
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.320]   and to bless Hong Kong and the society around it.
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.320]   And not only that,
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.220]   but when you do what I'm talking about today well,
[00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.020]   when you do it well in your own life,
[00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.960]   it also has the power to bring you
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.480]   into deeper moments of freedom and joy
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.480]   that you perhaps can't experience in anything else.
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.780]   This topic is really important.
[00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.360]   The topic is what I would call
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.420]   the subversive act of generosity.
[00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.300]   Now I call generosity a subversive act
[00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.720]   because I think that's exactly what generosity does.
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.400]   When we're generous,
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.200]   whether that's with our resources like our time,
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.320]   with the resources like our emotions,
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.600]   resources like our possessions, our material goods,
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.200]   our resources like our finances,
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.040]   whatever those resources might be,
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.480]   when we're generous with them,
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.480]   that has the power to basically subvert, uproot, overturn,
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.200]   what I think is our natural human tendency
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.480]   to hold on to what we have
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.920]   at the expense of what others do not have.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.240]   Are you following this?
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.800]   That generosity has this characteristic to it
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.840]   where it has the power to subvert this tendency
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.100]   that I think all of us humans struggle with
[00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.960]   to hold on to the things that we have
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.240]   at the expense of what others do not have.
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.860]   And when we move in the spirit
[00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.200]   and in the movement of generosity,
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.960]   what we're doing is we're subverting
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.440]   that tendency in our lives
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.640]   and we're then opening ourselves and those around us
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.040]   to some of the most profound and beautiful encounters
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.320]   and moments with the character of God
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.360]   that they can experience
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.880]   'cause God's character is to be generous.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.480]   So when his people are generous,
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.040]   they're revealing something of the nature
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.320]   and the character of God to the world.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.200]   And that can happen
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.960]   through some of the smallest acts of generosity
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.760]   as well as some of the largest.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.600]   Give me an example.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.220]   About 30 years ago, I became a Christian.
[00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.640]   So about 30 years ago, I gave my life to Jesus.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.000]   And then shortly after that,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.320]   about a year into being a Christian,
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.200]   I was mentored by somebody
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.080]   who was a part of our youth ministry at that time.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.680]   The youth ministry was called Saturday Night Alive.
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.960]   And I was being mentored by a guy called Doggan.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.080]   And Doggan, for me in those days, and he still is today,
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.200]   he's like one of the most radical Christians
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.640]   I have ever met, okay?
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.000]   Doggan like lives, eats, sleeps, drinks, and breathes Jesus.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.960]   There's Jesus and there's Doggan.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.140]   And Andrew in those days was like way down the list, okay?
[00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.340]   I was a new Christian, didn't really know too much.
[00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.340]   One day he reached out to me.
[00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.420]   He said, "Hey, let's hang out.
[00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.580]   "Let's get together and hang out."
[00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.740]   And I thought that'd be great.
[00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.860]   I met him in one chai, MTR.
[00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:29.700]   And as I met him, he said,
[00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.220]   "Okay, we're gonna go into Southern Playground
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.860]   "and we're going to actually minister
[00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.540]   "to the drug addicts and the street sleepers
[00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.700]   "that hang out in Southern Playground.
[00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.780]   "I'm a new Christian, I'm freaking out.
[00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.260]   "I don't know how to do that.
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.420]   "I've never gone out and done something like that."
[00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.820]   He's like, "Don't worry, it's fine.
[00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.260]   "Everybody will speak Cantonese.
[00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.640]   "So I will speak to everybody in Cantonese."
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:49.480]   He's Chinese.
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.640]   He's like, "I'm gonna speak to everybody in Cantonese.
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.520]   "Andrew, your role is just to pray."
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.600]   I'm like, "Cool, I can pray."
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.480]   He's like, "Pray in tongues, pray in the spirit, whatever.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.760]   "Just pray whilst I share in Cantonese."
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.140]   So we go out to Southern Playground just along here.
[00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.440]   And sure enough, we meet a couple of these guys.
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.000]   And it's quite obvious that they're either street sleepers
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.960]   or they're drug addicts just by the way they looked
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.920]   and the way they were dressed and their face and everything.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.380]   It was quite a sad situation.
[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.520]   Doggan begins to share in Cantonese
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.820]   the good hope of Jesus with these people.
[00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.420]   And I'm there, I'm praying.
[00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:22.940]   And as soon as I start to pray,
[00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.580]   I hear God say something very specifically to me.
[00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.380]   He said, "Andrew, I want you to take off the cross
[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.580]   "that you're wearing,
[00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.260]   "and I want you to give it to this man."
[00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.580]   Now this is way before I had any idea
[00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.940]   that he knows anything about Jesus,
[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.440]   is a Christian or anything like that.
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.280]   I feel like God is saying,
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.220]   "Take off your cross and give it to this man."
[00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.660]   Now that might sound like a small thing,
[00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.920]   but this cross had been given to me by Chris.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.260]   We weren't even married at the time.
[00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.980]   I think we were engaged at the time.
[00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.660]   And she'd given me this cross
[00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.780]   as like a gift of our engagement.
[00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.020]   I had given her a ring.
[00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.900]   She'd given me a cross.
[00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.540]   This was a very, very beautiful thing.
[00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.500]   It was a very precious, personal thing for me.
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.000]   And I was feeling like God was saying,
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.680]   "Give this to this man, this random man,
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.960]   "who I don't even think knows
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.620]   "or has accepted Jesus into his life."
[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.940]   And I'm like, I don't know if I can give up
[00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.140]   something that is so sentimental and so precious to me
[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.820]   to some random drug addict.
[00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.240]   I don't think that's what I'm gonna do.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.080]   But as I'm praying,
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.220]   God is compressing this on my heart over and over again.
[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.500]   And so eventually I'm kinda like,
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.960]   "Okay, well, I'm a new Christian.
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.780]   "I guess I better be obedient to God."
[00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:27.700]   And I said, "Okay, I'll do this."
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.420]   So now Dorgan's been speaking to this guy over this time
[00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:31.440]   for about five minutes.
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.020]   And after about five minutes, he turns to me and he says,
[00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.860]   "Have you been sensing anything in prayer?"
[00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.460]   And so I said to him, "Well, actually, funnily enough, yes.
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.060]   "I feel like God wants me to give this man my cross."
[00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.980]   Now, as soon as I said that, Dorgan's face goes white.
[00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.340]   And he's like, "Oh, dude," he goes,
[00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.580]   "you'll never guess what's happened.
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.000]   "I'm speaking to this guy in Cantonese.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   "I'm preaching the gospel.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.140]   "I'm sharing Jesus with him.
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.180]   "But the whole time, God's been speaking to me
[00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.940]   "about giving my cross to him."
[00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.380]   And he said, "You don't understand, Andrew,
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.860]   "but my wife gave me this cross.
[00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.380]   "And this cross means a lot to me."
[00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.460]   And he's like, "I said to God,
[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.820]   "no, I'm not gonna give him my cross.
[00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:09.780]   "And now you're telling me
[00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.200]   "that God told you to give your cross.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.300]   "You should give your cross to this man."
[00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.340]   (audience laughing)
[00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.060]   I'm like, "That's so generous of you, Dorgan.
[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.680]   "What a giver."
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.700]   So I figured I better be obedient.
[00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.300]   So I took off my cross, my precious cross
[00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.420]   that my wife had given me, or fiance.
[00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.180]   And as I held it out to this man,
[00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.780]   Dorgan's explaining what this is.
[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.540]   The man unbuttons his shirt and he's wearing this,
[00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.180]   one of those kind of jade and gold Buddha,
[00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.780]   a big Buddha around his neck.
[00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:44.960]   And as the man decides to take off the Buddha from his neck,
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.140]   as he gets literally over his head like this,
[00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.340]   he starts to shake.
[00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.700]   And this was the first time
[00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.900]   that I'd ever seen anyone do a demonic manifestation.
[00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.700]   And he starts to shake and he starts to shout in Cantonese.
[00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.940]   And Dorgan begins to gently talk back with him.
[00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.300]   And then Dorgan takes my cross
[00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.700]   and puts it over this guy's neck.
[00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.780]   And honestly, as it went over his neck,
[00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.460]   almost at the same place that the medallion came off,
[00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.580]   as the cross went over, peace came over him.
[00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.020]   It was one of the most profoundly beautiful things
[00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.020]   I had ever witnessed.
[00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:20.780]   And Dorgan begins to pray for this man.
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.900]   And the man's in tears, I'm in tears, Dorgan's in tears.
[00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.180]   Dorgan's feeling slightly guilty
[00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.300]   'cause he didn't give up his cross,
[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:31.340]   but I was the good Christian in that moment.
[00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:32.880]   So I was in tears.
[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.820]   And I learned that day that there's a subversive act
[00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.140]   that happens when we're generous.
[00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:42.300]   That there's something that gets dislodged in us
[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.740]   when we do it.
[00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:47.100]   And I think it's this tendency of moving against idolatry.
[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.740]   It's this tendency of, I think we all have,
[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.260]   with the things that we have in our lives,
[00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.340]   the resources we have, we wanna hold onto those things
[00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.900]   and we wanna grasp a hold of them really tightly.
[00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:57.140]   And when we release them,
[00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:00.300]   we release the grasp that those things have over us.
[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.540]   Sometimes we don't realise that when we grasp a hold
[00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.460]   of our possessions really tightly,
[00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.500]   what's really grasping is not us with them,
[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.100]   it's them with us.
[00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:11.500]   That's the idolatrous nature of these things on our lives.
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.860]   And our act of generosity is a way of doing two things.
[00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.740]   It releases that idolatry from us.
[00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:20.900]   It releases that grip that those things can have on us,
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:24.340]   but it also releases the gospel outwards into the world.
[00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:25.460]   Does that make sense?
[00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:28.540]   So I wanna talk to you about generosity a little bit today
[00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:31.860]   and link that a bit to our intimacy with God.
[00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.860]   And I wanna start by telling you that there's no surprise
[00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:38.180]   that I'm doing this after Chinese New Year last week.
[00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:41.380]   Chinese New Year, where Ellison so eloquently told us
[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.580]   that the main thing that we say at Chinese New Year,
[00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:47.180]   Gong Hei Fa Chui, is actually hope you get rich.
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:48.780]   Are you with me, church?
[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.620]   It's not a surprise, therefore, that God would say,
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.660]   "Let's talk about generosity the next Sunday.
[00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:56.340]   "I hope you get rich if it means you'll be more generous."
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.500]   Amen?
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:58.540]   Here's something I've noticed, though.
[00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:01.820]   Oftentimes when we get richer, we get less generous.
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.260]   And I wanna talk a little bit about that
[00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.700]   with you here today as well.
[00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.420]   Let me give you some thoughts, biblically,
[00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:09.940]   a theology of generosity to start with.
[00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.340]   The Bible's very, very clear
[00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:15.100]   that every single resource in this world
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.860]   comes and flows from the same source, and that is God.
[00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.420]   In other words, everything that we have ever received,
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:24.700]   creation itself, all the way down to every dollar
[00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:25.980]   that is in your bank account,
[00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.100]   every time that you have the emotions that you have,
[00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.740]   everything that you have in your life,
[00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:30.740]   the Bible's very clear,
[00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:32.500]   that all comes from the same source.
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:33.700]   It all comes from God.
[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:36.340]   Now, I want you to think about that this way.
[00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.340]   If God, if everything that you have,
[00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.820]   all the resources in your life have come from God,
[00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:44.980]   then God is the most generous being there has ever been.
[00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:46.580]   If all of our resources are from God,
[00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:50.780]   then God, in his very nature, is generous, right?
[00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:53.060]   His heart is to give.
[00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:53.940]   This is a really important thing.
[00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:56.340]   His heart is not to consume and hoard.
[00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:59.260]   His heart is to release and give.
[00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.220]   That's the very nature of who God is.
[00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:04.100]   If everything comes from him and we have received,
[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.540]   that means God has released and he has given.
[00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:10.460]   His generosity means that we have something
[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:13.220]   that we can therefore be generous with.
[00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:16.220]   This is really important because a lot of Christians think
[00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:20.140]   that generosity is a moral imperative.
[00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:22.100]   What I mean by that is moral imperative means
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:23.700]   it's an ethically good thing to do.
[00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.300]   We think as Christians, we should be generous,
[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.380]   whether that's to a charity, whether that's to our church,
[00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:30.860]   with our tithes and our giving.
[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:32.460]   We think generosity is linked
[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.060]   to some morally good thing to do.
[00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:38.660]   It's morally right or ethically right to give stuff
[00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.180]   to the people who are in need.
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.220]   The Bible never says that that is at the heart
[00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:44.060]   of what generosity is.
[00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.300]   The Bible talks about that,
[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:46.860]   but it's not the heart of generosity.
[00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.100]   The heart of generosity doesn't flow
[00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:50.820]   from some moral imperative.
[00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.900]   It flows from the nature and the character of God.
[00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:58.900]   In other words, we are generous because God is generous,
[00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:02.140]   not because it's some ethically right thing to do.
[00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:05.020]   We are generous because as Christians,
[00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:08.460]   we want to be and live and reveal the nature
[00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.340]   and character of Jesus to the world.
[00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:13.740]   Our generosity is part of our revealing
[00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.740]   and understanding the character and the nature of God.
[00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:21.700]   Therefore, generosity is not an act, it is a response.
[00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.300]   Think of it this way, generosity is worship.
[00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:28.980]   'Cause worship is a response out of what God has done for us.
[00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.140]   So when we are generous,
[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.620]   we're not just fulfilling some moral imperative
[00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:34.900]   in the world, although of course,
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.060]   it's good to give to those in need.
[00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:42.060]   We are actually worshiping in a response to who God is.
[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:47.540]   In this way, generosity is never an act.
[00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.420]   It is always a response.
[00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:53.660]   Therefore, generosity is a lifestyle.
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:57.580]   It should be something that flows out of us all the time.
[00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:00.060]   But again, what happens so often for us Christians
[00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:02.900]   is that we think about generosity as an act,
[00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:04.260]   a one-off moment.
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.020]   We think that generosity is a mission,
[00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:08.220]   one thing we should do,
[00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:12.060]   rather than a mindset, something of who we are.
[00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:14.660]   And if you keep generosity as a mission,
[00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:16.560]   a one-off moment, an act,
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.500]   there's always gonna be a beginning and an end
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:19.660]   to your generosity.
[00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:22.940]   But if we flip that and think that generosity
[00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:26.500]   instead is a mindset out of the response of the character
[00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:27.900]   and the mindset of God,
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.780]   then generosity can begin to flow
[00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.420]   in every aspect of our lives.
[00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:35.300]   We're not thinking, oh, I haven't given my tithe this month.
[00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:38.100]   We're thinking, how do I give of everything that I have
[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.140]   to flourish what God has given around me?
[00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.660]   Whether that's my time, my energy, my resources,
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.020]   my talent, my possessions,
[00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:45.820]   and yes, of course, my tithe to the church,
[00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.860]   whatever it is, I want to give
[00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.980]   out of an overflow of a mindset
[00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.900]   that is committed to revealing the nature
[00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:55.300]   and the character of God in this world.
[00:12:55.300 --> 00:13:00.300]   In this way, God calls us to be a generous people,
[00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:02.100]   not a people who are generous.
[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:05.940]   There's a big difference between those two things.
[00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:08.780]   The call is to be a generous people,
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:13.500]   not a people who are occasionally, sometimes generous.
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:14.860]   There are too many Christians in this world
[00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:17.140]   who are occasionally generous.
[00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:19.940]   When the kind of church that I think Christ died for
[00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:23.420]   is a generous church, a generous people,
[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.140]   a people who have made that part of their lifestyle
[00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:26.460]   and part of their mindset
[00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:29.380]   and are living out of the overflow of everything being,
[00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:33.020]   how can I be generous in this moment?
[00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:36.980]   Whatever that moment might be, are you tracking with this?
[00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:37.980]   Now, if this is all true,
[00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:41.100]   if that's a theology of generosity,
[00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:44.300]   what is the thing that enables us to do this?
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:45.820]   Or perhaps a better way of saying that is,
[00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:47.660]   what is the thing that stops us
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.380]   from actually being generous?
[00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:53.060]   Well, I think to understand
[00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.860]   how we live out a lifestyle of generosity
[00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:58.220]   rather than just moments of generosity,
[00:13:58.220 --> 00:13:59.980]   we have to understand the role that we have
[00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:02.100]   in the resources God has given us.
[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:03.140]   I've already said, haven't I,
[00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:05.900]   that God has everything in His hands
[00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:07.500]   and God is the one who gives.
[00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:10.100]   Everything is flowing from the source of God.
[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:13.500]   Therefore, God's role is ownership.
[00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:14.900]   That is not our role.
[00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:17.660]   But here's the number one mistake Christians make.
[00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.460]   We think we're owners of the things that God has given us.
[00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.140]   You are not an owner of it.
[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:23.820]   I'm gonna say that one more time.
[00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:27.060]   You are not an owner of what God has given you.
[00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:28.340]   Your role is not ownership.
[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:29.180]   That's God's role.
[00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:30.980]   And as soon as you take ownership
[00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:34.380]   of the things that God has given you, you're playing God.
[00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:36.420]   That's a very dangerous thing.
[00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:38.940]   What will happen is you will end up controlling
[00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:41.220]   what you have 'cause you think you're an owner of it.
[00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:42.100]   You're not an owner.
[00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:43.180]   God is very clear.
[00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:45.700]   The very first thing He says to humanity
[00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.820]   after He creates them, I talked about this two weeks ago
[00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:48.860]   when we talked about sex.
[00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:50.780]   In Genesis 1 and 2, He creates humanity
[00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:52.340]   and He gives them His creation.
[00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:53.620]   And He says, "Go and do what?
[00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:55.980]   "Go and steward what I have given you."
[00:14:55.980 --> 00:15:00.060]   So our role is not owner of all the things
[00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:02.180]   that God has created, all the resources at His disposal.
[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.060]   Our role is steward.
[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:08.420]   You are to be a steward of God's resources.
[00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:09.460]   That's your role.
[00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:11.460]   That's what you've been called to.
[00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:15.500]   And stewardship is really, really important.
[00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.300]   Stewardship, it's funny, we think ownership is important
[00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:20.740]   and stewardship is, stewardship is actually
[00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:22.300]   a huge responsibility.
[00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:23.620]   Think about this.
[00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:26.180]   If you are a steward of all of God's resources,
[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:27.560]   here's the crazy thing.
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:31.860]   Your stewardship will either release more generosity
[00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.260]   into this world, the overabundant flow of God's resources,
[00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.300]   or it'll release more poverty in this world,
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.320]   the inequitable distribution of God's resources.
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.080]   - Yeah.
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:44.200]   - I'm gonna say that one more time
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.800]   'cause I don't think anybody's getting it in this room.
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.400]   It's really important.
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:51.160]   Your stewardship, how you think about yourself as a steward,
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.640]   will either release more generosity into this world,
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.200]   i.e. the flow of God's resources,
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.480]   or you will create more poverty in this world
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.840]   because there will be more inequitable distribution
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.440]   of God's resources.
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:04.880]   So that stewardship is an incredibly important thing.
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:08.240]   How we steward will release or withhold.
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.320]   How we steward will mean that people
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.160]   have an equitable distribution or not.
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.120]   How we steward will mean that things flourish around us
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:15.960]   or they won't.
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.080]   That's all around us,
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:20.460]   and so stewardship is the gateway to generosity.
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:24.240]   And if you think that your role as owner,
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.760]   you're gonna be way more frugal
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.160]   because here's what you'll think if you're an owner.
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.640]   If you're an owner, you'll think,
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.640]   what should I do with this?
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.920]   If you're a steward, you'll say,
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.580]   what would God do with this?
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.400]   Come on, church.
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:42.720]   If you're an owner, you're like,
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.080]   okay, what do I do with this?
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.840]   'Cause this is my resource to do what I want to do with it.
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.300]   If you're a steward, you're like,
[00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.760]   everything I have is not mine, it's God's.
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:51.800]   What is God's heart?
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:52.880]   What is God's character?
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:53.840]   What is his nature?
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.000]   How should I spend?
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.080]   How should I save?
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.660]   How should I provide for my family?
[00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:58.500]   That's a good thing.
[00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.400]   God wants me to do that.
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.120]   How do I provide for my family?
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.800]   How do I put money away for savings?
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.160]   How do I have nice holidays?
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.040]   That's all fine.
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.160]   There's no problems with that.
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.820]   But then equally, what does God say about those things?
[00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:10.240]   What does God say about my possession?
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.740]   What does God say about my spending habits?
[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:15.200]   'Cause everything I'm doing here is on behalf of him.
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.380]   This is the parable of the talents.
[00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:19.720]   This is God, Jesus, describing this thing.
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.280]   Oh, there's this wealthy landowner,
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:24.680]   and he gives talent to his individual servants,
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.320]   and those that know him well take those talents
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:29.880]   and put them to good use and produce an abundance.
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.300]   Those that don't know him well and are afraid of him,
[00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:33.320]   they bury it.
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:34.160]   Are you with me?
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:34.980]   And he comes and he says,
[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.520]   you who stewarded well 'cause you knew me well,
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.120]   you get to enjoy my kingdom.
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.700]   You who stewarded poorly 'cause you don't know me very well,
[00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:42.560]   you bury it.
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:46.760]   And this is the connection between intimacy and generosity.
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:51.500]   The more intimate we are with God,
[00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:54.000]   the better stewards of his resources you'll become.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.420]   When we understand his nature and his character
[00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:58.980]   and who he is, the better it is
[00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.820]   that we are to release those things into the world.
[00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:04.320]   We begin to understand how God would treat
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.260]   the money in my bank account,
[00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:09.380]   how God would treat the time that I have each week,
[00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.840]   how God would treat the talents
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.400]   and the gifts God's given me,
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.960]   how God would treat my emotional capacity
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.540]   that I have towards those around me.
[00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:21.980]   When I understand that I'm a steward,
[00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:24.800]   God resources can flow,
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:28.060]   and my relationship with him, my intimacy with him
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:31.660]   is the gateway to whether that's gonna flow well
[00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:32.980]   or whether it's not.
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:36.800]   Intimacy and generosity are linked.
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:37.820]   Helpful so far?
[00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:40.840]   All right, I've got about five minutes left,
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.440]   which is really bad,
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.860]   'cause I have about 15 minutes more.
[00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:45.700]   Is that okay?
[00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:47.220]   Can you hang with me for a few more minutes?
[00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:48.620]   'Cause I want you to wanna go to scripture
[00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:49.460]   'cause you're probably thinking like,
[00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:52.380]   is Andrew ever gonna talk about scripture ever?
[00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:54.480]   So let me open up the word of God,
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.980]   and this will just take about 15 minutes,
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.340]   but I want you to see here from Ecclesiastes
[00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:01.580]   something that is really important about stewardship.
[00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:04.700]   It says here in Ecclesiastes 4, verses five and six,
[00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:09.080]   "The fool folds his hands and ruins himself.
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.320]   "But a one-handful with tranquility,
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:14.740]   "than two handfuls with toil and chasing after the wind."
[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:16.340]   Ecclesiastes is this beautiful writing.
[00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:18.660]   It's a wisdom literature in the Hebrew scriptures,
[00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:20.260]   and it's a wisdom tradition
[00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.620]   where it provides provocative imagery
[00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:26.140]   and very extreme ways of talking
[00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:28.700]   to be able to explain or to understand
[00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.340]   the character and the nature of God.
[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:31.380]   Let me read this to you again.
[00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:35.140]   "The fool folds his hands and ruins himself.
[00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:37.440]   "But a one-handful with tranquility,
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.880]   "than two handfuls with toil and chasing after the wind."
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.380]   When we read this in the English,
[00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:44.380]   we see that there are three mentions
[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:47.100]   of the word hand in this passage.
[00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:49.700]   There is the fool who folds their hands,
[00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.380]   there is the one handful with tranquility,
[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:54.120]   there are the two handfuls with toil
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.280]   and chasing after the wind.
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:58.500]   In the English, we only have one word for hand,
[00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:01.300]   and that's hand, and so the translators translate it
[00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:03.940]   as, funnily enough, hand, okay?
[00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:06.500]   In the Hebrew, though, what's going on here
[00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:07.780]   is really powerful, because in the Hebrew,
[00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:09.740]   there's about five different words
[00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:11.740]   for the word hand in English.
[00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:13.260]   In the Hebrew, three of those words
[00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:14.580]   are being used in this passage,
[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:16.300]   and each of them is trying to communicate
[00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.500]   something really important about stewardship.
[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.860]   So let me show you this in the Hebrew,
[00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:24.540]   and I want you, I've highlighted the three words there
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:26.700]   in the Hebrew that are used here
[00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.900]   and translated in the English hands,
[00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:30.860]   but each of those words, as you can just tell
[00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:33.380]   by looking at them, are very different words,
[00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:35.100]   they have very different meanings,
[00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.380]   and they help us to unpack
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.820]   what is being said here about stewardship.
[00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:41.660]   So let me unpack each of these really quickly.
[00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:42.980]   The first thing, oh, and by the way,
[00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:44.140]   to help you illustrate this,
[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:47.060]   I've got this little box full of rice here,
[00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:49.260]   but I want you to assume that this box
[00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:52.940]   is like a picture of all the generous resources
[00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:55.340]   and all of the things that God has at His disposal.
[00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:59.380]   They're all the resources that are exposed for us at life,
[00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:01.740]   all the things that we could have in this life
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:03.020]   out of the generosity of God.
[00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:04.460]   That's what this represents.
[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:07.020]   Now, the wisdom writer says this,
[00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:10.360]   first of all, "The fool folds his hands."
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:13.340]   The word there for hand is the word yad,
[00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:16.460]   and the word yad is used throughout the Old Testament
[00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:20.040]   as the word that means the mighty right hand.
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:24.200]   The word yad means might or power or energy.
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.820]   It's the word used throughout the Old Testament
[00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:29.100]   to talk about God's right hand at work for His people,
[00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:31.980]   His mighty right hand to save us.
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:35.580]   So the wisdom writer takes that idea of might and power,
[00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:40.020]   and he says, "If you have might and power and resource
[00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:42.860]   "and energy and gifts and talents,
[00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:47.340]   "and you fold yourself and don't do anything with it,
[00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:50.520]   "you're a fool," he says.
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:53.780]   So the fool takes the yad that they have.
[00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:55.900]   Let's say this is all of their resources,
[00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:57.900]   all of your talent, all of your gifts,
[00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.220]   all the things that God has given you,
[00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:02.020]   the great stuff, the energy that God has put inside of you,
[00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.780]   and you just decide to check out of life,
[00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:07.300]   that is a fool, the Bible says.
[00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:08.380]   You've been given so much,
[00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:10.740]   and yet your posture is to fold your hands,
[00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:13.420]   and he says here, "You will ruin yourself."
[00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:15.060]   And I think, although it doesn't say it here,
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:15.900]   I think what he's also saying is
[00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:18.340]   you will ruin those around you as well,
[00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:20.860]   'cause you're not flowing any of that equitable distribution
[00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:21.740]   of God's resource.
[00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:24.580]   You have yad your hands.
[00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:28.100]   You've folded them and given up on being generous,
[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:29.460]   given up on anything.
[00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:32.100]   Maybe the modern term for this is the idea of lying flat.
[00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:33.980]   Have you heard about that recently?
[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:35.240]   It's like, "I got this great education,
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:36.860]   "I've got all this stuff going on, blah, blah, blah,
[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:39.920]   "but I'm just not gonna bother.
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.500]   "I'm just gonna kinda check out of life.
[00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:44.060]   "I'm gonna fold my yad."
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:45.560]   Now, you might be sitting there thinking,
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:47.420]   "I never do that.
[00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:49.880]   "I work really hard, I'm exhausted all the time.
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:50.720]   "I'm working really hard.
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.020]   "I'm using my talents and my gifts,"
[00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:54.460]   and you're thinking, "I don't really do this very often.
[00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:56.180]   "I tell you what, every single one of us,
[00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:58.360]   "at some point, we will do this
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:01.940]   "to the opportunities that are around us to be generous."
[00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:03.020]   And I think there's a couple of reasons
[00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:05.100]   why we fold our yad.
[00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:09.460]   The first is that I think maybe we've taken a step out
[00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:11.740]   in faith in the past with our yad,
[00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:15.220]   with our power or our talent or our gift
[00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:17.040]   or the energy God has given us.
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.340]   We've taken a step out in faith with it
[00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:23.500]   and it's not worked out, or maybe people laughed at us.
[00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.100]   Maybe we tried that talent
[00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:26.980]   or we tried to be generous with a gift
[00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:29.180]   and people didn't accept it.
[00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:31.140]   Maybe they laughed at it, maybe they turned away from it,
[00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:32.180]   maybe they didn't embrace it
[00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:34.420]   how we thought they were gonna embrace it,
[00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:37.340]   and we felt shame for that, we felt some embarrassment.
[00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:39.180]   Or maybe we gifted somebody with something
[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:42.940]   and they just treated it like anything and that hurt us.
[00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:44.460]   Don't you know how much I prepared that gift?
[00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:46.380]   Don't you know how much I slaved for that gift
[00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:47.920]   and I gave that to you and you didn't want it
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:48.860]   or you just didn't treat it
[00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:50.040]   how I thought you were gonna treat it?
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.900]   I'm hurt by that, are you with me?
[00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:55.140]   Hurt, pain, disillusionment,
[00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:56.700]   that's gonna cause you to fold your yard.
[00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:57.940]   It's like, well, I tried that before,
[00:23:57.940 --> 00:23:59.860]   I'm not trying that again.
[00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:02.020]   Well, I gave to that person, but they didn't say thank you,
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:05.220]   so I'm never giving to them again, are you with me?
[00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:07.860]   So hurt and disappointment and failure
[00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:09.180]   will cause us to fold our yard.
[00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:11.260]   I think here's the other thing that we'll often do it,
[00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:13.100]   and I struggle with this one.
[00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:16.180]   We think that what we have is not worth giving.
[00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:18.580]   We think like, well, I mean,
[00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:20.940]   if you compare me to these other people,
[00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:22.580]   if you looked at my bank compared to their bank,
[00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:24.580]   I mean, they're the ones that should be giving.
[00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:27.740]   God knows how much I've got,
[00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:29.820]   and God knows I can't give.
[00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:32.020]   They should give, but not me.
[00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:33.700]   Or we maybe think, you know,
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:36.540]   like their talent is way better than my talent.
[00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:37.900]   I'm not gonna sign up to worship,
[00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:39.400]   have you heard Emma sing?
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:42.600]   I can't sing like Emma.
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:45.980]   I'm just gonna fold my arms and sit in the chairs.
[00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:47.580]   By the way, I'm now recruiting for the worship team.
[00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:50.420]   Just saying, I'm just gonna sit in the pew
[00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:52.980]   and fold my arms because have you heard her?
[00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:54.300]   Are you with me?
[00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:55.980]   So not only do we fold our hands
[00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:58.060]   because of pain and disillusionment and hurt,
[00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:00.300]   we fold our hands because we compare ourselves to others
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:01.140]   and we have insecurity
[00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:03.460]   and we think we have nothing to offer,
[00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:05.020]   and we fold our yard.
[00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:06.380]   Following this?
[00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:07.900]   Then the Bible says this.
[00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:10.940]   It says, "Better to have one handful with tranquility
[00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:14.300]   than two handfuls with toil and chasing after wind."
[00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:17.420]   Two handfuls here is the word kofen,
[00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:22.420]   and kofen basically means to grasp as to a fist.
[00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:23.900]   The idea would be like,
[00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:26.300]   this is all of God's resources that God has,
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:30.060]   and we as his people in the stewardship of kofen,
[00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:33.660]   we grab a hold of what God has given us.
[00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:38.020]   Now, on the surface, kofen looks great
[00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:40.300]   because we've taken responsibility.
[00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:43.620]   God has, we've not laid flat and crossed our arms
[00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:44.980]   and gone, "Who cares?"
[00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:47.180]   We've taken as much as we could,
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:49.460]   and we're holding on for dear life.
[00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:52.140]   I mean, we've got God's resources in our hands,
[00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:54.340]   and occasionally those resources come out
[00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.980]   through those moments of generosity,
[00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:59.140]   but we've got a lot still in our hands.
[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:00.100]   And we've got a lot in our hands
[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:02.260]   because we wanna make sure that we keep it in our hands,
[00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:04.580]   'cause we think that it's a good steward
[00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:07.220]   to grasp a hold of what God's given us,
[00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:09.100]   and we think that this is the right way to go.
[00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:10.100]   Let me tell you this.
[00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:13.380]   We think that this is an abundance mentality, kofen,
[00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:16.460]   but kofen is actually a poverty mentality.
[00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:17.700]   It's a poverty mentality
[00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:19.180]   because although we think we've got a lot,
[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:20.740]   and theoretically we do have a lot,
[00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:24.020]   we've got two fistfuls of all of those resources.
[00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:26.660]   The problem is we don't want to let go
[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:29.140]   of those resources very much.
[00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:33.180]   And second of all, we can't really put more resources in.
[00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:34.740]   If you keep your hands fisted,
[00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:38.460]   it's really hard to get more rice in the hand.
[00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:39.780]   Are you with me?
[00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:42.460]   And we think that this is actually the right thing.
[00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:44.860]   God's blessed me, and I need to take responsibility
[00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:46.420]   for the things that God's blessed me with.
[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:47.580]   Absolutely we should.
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:50.020]   But when we're kofen, when our stewardship posture
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:52.020]   is this gripping and this grasping,
[00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:54.020]   all it really does is cause us
[00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:56.580]   to become owners and not stewards.
[00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:58.660]   It causes us to control the things.
[00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:00.940]   And every once in a while, we go to that event and we give,
[00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:02.780]   or every once in a while, we put something in the offering,
[00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:05.300]   and there's a little bit of generosity that comes out,
[00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:08.820]   but we've still got most of it for us.
[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:10.740]   The wisdom writer says,
[00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:15.260]   "This is toil and chasing after the wind.
[00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:18.580]   "This is exhausting," the wisdom writer is saying.
[00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:21.820]   He said, "This is what 21st century life is like.
[00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:24.420]   "This is like the grasping and the getting hold of more
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:26.860]   "and trying to achieve more and getting more,
[00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:30.380]   "because we're actually afraid that we won't have enough.
[00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:33.860]   "And our fear of poverty drives us to grasp holder
[00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:37.580]   "and tighter and more upon the resources that we've got."
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:38.820]   And the Bible says,
[00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:41.660]   "That's just gonna cause stress and anxiety.
[00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:44.060]   "You're gonna be even more stressed than you ever were."
[00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:46.380]   And I tell you, this is interesting.
[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:49.380]   My experience is the more money I've gotten in my life,
[00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:50.880]   the more stressed I've become.
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:54.020]   And we often think that if we had more,
[00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:55.260]   we'd be less stressed.
[00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:56.340]   And the Bible says,
[00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:59.220]   "Two handfuls is toil and chasing after wind.
[00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:03.020]   "If your posture and your attitude is kofen,
[00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:05.380]   "to grasp a hold."
[00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:06.220]   You with me?
[00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:10.140]   So if it's foolish,
[00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:15.540]   if it's foolish to fold your yard
[00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:17.700]   when you've been given all this great opportunity,
[00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:19.980]   but it's also foolish to grab a hold of it
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:21.220]   as tightly as possible,
[00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:22.740]   and that's just stress and anxiety.
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:24.140]   Is there a better way?
[00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:25.820]   Well, the Bible says this.
[00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:26.740]   It says,
[00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:31.020]   that's like one of those miracles,
[00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:32.660]   mercy is coming out of the Bible.
[00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:35.740]   It says here,
[00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:38.820]   "Better one handful with tranquility."
[00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:39.640]   I love this.
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.460]   "Better one rather than two.
[00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:44.220]   "Better less than more and have tranquility,"
[00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:45.540]   the Bible says.
[00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:49.060]   Now, the one handful here is the word kof.
[00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:52.460]   And kof is the picture of a hand open
[00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:54.820]   and palm facing upwards.
[00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:55.700]   The idea is this.
[00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:59.040]   The idea is that you have the resource of God in your hands,
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:00.340]   but that resource,
[00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:02.340]   because it's in an open palm like this,
[00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:05.420]   can flow out really, really, really easily.
[00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:08.320]   Now, if you're anything like me,
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:09.180]   if that's your posture,
[00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:10.980]   you're worried because if it keeps flowing,
[00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:13.700]   I'm not gonna be able to have much left to flow with.
[00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:14.780]   But here's the amazing thing.
[00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:16.180]   When you're postured like this,
[00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:17.900]   God can come along and add more.
[00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:20.300]   And look at this.
[00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:21.760]   There's the flow that happens.
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.900]   We're gonna have to vacuum between services.
[00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:26.180]   There's a flow that happens.
[00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:27.500]   Are you with me?
[00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:30.680]   The Bible says this is peace and tranquility.
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:33.920]   This is what it's like to have inner peace
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:36.620]   when you are kof with the resources God has given you.
[00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:37.820]   Your palm is open,
[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:39.660]   and God will keep blessing you.
[00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:41.060]   And as God pours into you
[00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:43.260]   and your hand posture remains open,
[00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:45.460]   you will continue to pour out.
[00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:47.360]   This is a river.
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:50.700]   This is a lake.
[00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:53.100]   This becomes stagnant and doesn't flow.
[00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:57.260]   But the Bible says this is what generosity looks like
[00:29:57.260 --> 00:30:00.580]   through the stewardship of kof.
[00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:03.820]   Better to have one hand open than two
[00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:06.380]   with toil and grasping after the wind.
[00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:08.580]   So as I bring it all to a close,
[00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:11.420]   here's the question for you.
[00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:13.720]   Which of those postures is you?
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:16.900]   And if you're anything like me,
[00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:19.540]   you're saying all three.
[00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:24.380]   That there are moments where you know you've just given up.
[00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:27.940]   And you've just folded your hands and said,
[00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:29.240]   can't be bothered anymore.
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:32.900]   And there are moments where you have grasped tightly
[00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:34.380]   and you're holding on
[00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:37.300]   and you feel that stress and that anxiety.
[00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:39.900]   And there are moments perhaps where you are open-handed
[00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:42.140]   and you feel the inner peace and the beauty
[00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:44.060]   and the wonder of God when you're doing so.
[00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:46.820]   And yet you find yourself just going back and forth
[00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:47.660]   between the two.
[00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:49.980]   Are you folded?
[00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:51.460]   Are you fist?
[00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:52.500]   Or are you free?
[00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:55.380]   If you find yourself folded,
[00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:57.900]   here's what I wanna encourage you to think about.
[00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:02.180]   What areas of pain or hurt or insecurities
[00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:03.580]   are there for you that would cause you
[00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:05.420]   to fold your hands so often?
[00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:10.260]   If you're fist, the question you should ask yourself is,
[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:13.300]   why don't I trust God enough?
[00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.540]   That I feel like I need to hold onto all these resources
[00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:16.420]   as tightly as possible
[00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:18.620]   'cause I don't think I'm going to get again.
[00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:21.620]   Why is trust an issue for me?
[00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:25.460]   And if you're open-handed and beautiful before Him
[00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:27.420]   and you're seeing the flow of resources,
[00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:30.420]   perhaps for you it's just to be grateful and thankful
[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:32.700]   that God is using you and can use you
[00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:36.500]   and continue to use you to bless those around you.
[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:40.380]   Are you Yad, Kofen, or Kof?
[00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:43.380]   'Cause either or any of those
[00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:45.500]   will be whether you're a generous person
[00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:50.180]   or just simply a person who is occasionally generous.
[00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:51.540]   Helpful?
[00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:52.780]   Can I pray for you?
[00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:53.980]   Let's pray.
[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:56.540]   Father, I'm so grateful for each person here
[00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:59.820]   and Lord for what you're doing in their lives
[00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:03.980]   and for the generosity that is flowing from them.
[00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:06.180]   Lord, I just really wanna honor the vine
[00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:09.420]   'cause as the senior pastor here over the last 10 years
[00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:10.780]   and been on staff for 15,
[00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:12.780]   I've seen the generosity of this church.
[00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:15.660]   I've seen this church be generous people
[00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:17.580]   time and time again.
[00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:19.940]   And Lord, it is an incredible thing to see.
[00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:24.860]   And so Lord, I just honor each person here
[00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:27.980]   who has faithfully given to this church over so many years.
[00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:31.700]   Maybe those who are faithfully giving in this season.
[00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:34.300]   Lord, we are grateful for that.
[00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:37.340]   And Lord, we recognize that generosity
[00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:38.780]   that is already flowing here.
[00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:42.820]   Father, we also recognize that in our own lives,
[00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:45.340]   we have a tendency to move
[00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:47.420]   between different forms of stewardship.
[00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:52.740]   Lord, I know that I have the tendency to fold my hand,
[00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:54.940]   I have the tendency to clench, hold tightly.
[00:32:54.940 --> 00:33:00.180]   And so Father, I wanna pray that as we reflect
[00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:03.420]   around generosity in our lives,
[00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:05.660]   we would first remember, as I've spoken about earlier,
[00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:08.380]   that it starts with you, that intimacy with you
[00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:11.820]   has a direct impact on our work of stewardship and generosity
[00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:15.740]   and that as the wisdom writer in Ecclesiastes shows us
[00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:20.700]   that it's better to have less but be open
[00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:24.180]   than to have more and be closed.
[00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:27.820]   That the path of peace is found in being open and generous.
[00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:31.980]   The path of stress is when we shift
[00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:33.380]   from a steward to an owner.
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:36.860]   And Father, I wanna pray for people here
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:38.420]   where that resonates with them.
[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:41.660]   Perhaps there are some people here this morning
[00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:44.100]   where their posture has largely been one of folding
[00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:44.980]   in this season.
[00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:48.580]   Maybe there's been some hurt there.
[00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:51.820]   Maybe they've given and not been thanked.
[00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:53.900]   Maybe they've done something generous
[00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:55.300]   and it hasn't produced the fruit
[00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:57.860]   that they were hoping it would produce.
[00:33:57.860 --> 00:33:59.580]   Maybe they've even given to the church
[00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:01.100]   because they thought that that would mean
[00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:03.100]   that you would answer their prayer and you didn't do that
[00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:06.100]   and they've folded their hands.
[00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:08.620]   Father, would you just come for any of us
[00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:09.740]   where that's the case?
[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:13.060]   Would you comfort us and speak to us and heal us?
[00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:16.860]   For those of us that have compared our gifts
[00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:19.740]   or our bank accounts or what we have to others
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:22.260]   and thought that's their responsibility, not mine.
[00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:26.460]   Father, I pray you would shake us out of our complacency.
[00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:30.900]   Father, for those that are clenching tightly
[00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:33.100]   and you of course want us to be sensible
[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:34.860]   and sensible with our money,
[00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:36.580]   sensible with our spending, of course,
[00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:39.980]   but Father, for those that are perhaps clenching too tightly
[00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:41.860]   and there's stress.
[00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:46.420]   Lord, I wanna pray that your inner peace would flow,
[00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:50.060]   the tranquility that the writer speaks about here would flow.
[00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:54.420]   Father, I pray that you would give us the strength
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:56.620]   to be able to be more open to the Lord.
[00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:58.540]   I pray that you would give us the strength
[00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:00.980]   to be able to be more open to the Lord.
[00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:04.300]   Father, I pray that you would shake us out of our complacency
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:05.540]   and comfort us.
[00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:08.940]   Lord, I pray that you would shake us out of our complacency
[00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:09.780]   and comfort us.
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:13.140]   Father, I pray that you would shake us out of our complacency
[00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:13.980]   and comfort us.
[00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:17.140]   Lord, I pray that you would shake us out of our complacency
[00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:17.980]   and comfort us.
[00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:20.820]   Lord, I pray that you would shake us out of our complacency
[00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:21.660]   and comfort us.
[00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:24.580]   Lord, I pray that you would shake us out of our complacency
[00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:25.420]   and comfort us.
[00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:28.220]   Lord, I pray that you would shake us out of our complacency
