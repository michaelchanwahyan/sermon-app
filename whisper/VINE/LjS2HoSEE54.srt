1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
 And I'd love to invite up one of our elders, Susannah Lynham,

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,500
 and she's gonna be with us today.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,700
 And she's bringing the word, which we're excited about.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,600
 We're considering our series, A Different Spirit,

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,080
 This is Your First Time to the Vine,

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,360
 or This is Your First Time Into the Series,

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,520
 particularly if you're watching online as well.

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,000
 We started the series three weeks ago.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,540
 We wanna encourage you to go onto our YouTube,

10
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,760
 connect and catch up on this.

11
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,760
 We're looking at such an important topic today,

12
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,340
 and one that I know is gonna be both challenging,

13
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,460
 but also healing for you.

14
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,960
 So why don't we stretch out our hands

15
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,240
 as we pray for Susannah.

16
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,160
 Holy Spirit, we're grateful.

17
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,440
 Grateful for what your word does,

18
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,260
 that scripture comes and uproots,

19
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,000
 tears down, destroys, overthrows,

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,580
 and yet also builds and plants in us.

21
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,000
 And so as Susannah comes with this word in her heart,

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,780
 as we get to look afresh at Caleb and Joshua's journey,

23
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,360
 Lord, I pray that you would just really uplift

24
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,940
 and uproot the things in us

25
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,040
 that you want us to be free of, Lord.

26
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,040
 May we be a church that literally does walk

27
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,520
 in this time with a different spirit.

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,960
 We thank you for this in your name, amen.

29
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,560
 - Good morning.

30
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:25,280
 A Different Spirit, this is a series we've been looking at.

31
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,760
 And I remember when Andrew first sent me the email,

32
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,600
 inviting me to be a part of this series.

33
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,320
 And I opened it excitedly and ran my finger down the topics.

34
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,760
 Where's my name, where's my name?

35
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,600
 And beside my name, a different spirit, will we repent?

36
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,240
 I was thinking, did I draw a short straw

37
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,680
 that I didn't know about?

38
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,800
 But you know, sometimes the sermons

39
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,400
 that are the hardest to prepare,

40
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,640
 sometimes the sermons that are the hardest to hear

41
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,680
 are the ones we need the most.

42
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,640
 I just want to welcome all the people

43
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,340
 joining us online today.

44
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,560
 You're not here by accident,

45
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,840
 and neither is anyone else in this room.

46
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,520
 God knows us all.

47
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,840
 A Different Spirit, will we repent?

48
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,120
 You know, the world has become indifferent to sin.

49
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:31,640
 In fact, many have erased the concept altogether.

50
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:38,200
 What people feel is right to do, to say, to think,

51
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,760
 that has become right.

52
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:46,260
 I would say this indifference has crept into the church,

53
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,120
 but I don't think that's true.

54
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,780
 I think it has boldly marched in and taken up residence.

55
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:00,600
 We are indifferent because we've forgotten

56
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,400
 what sin invites into our lives,

57
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,560
 what sin invites into our homes,

58
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,080
 our communities, our world.

59
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,440
 Sin invites death.

60
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,600
 In the story we've been looking at in this series,

61
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,760
 A Different Spirit, we pick up the story

62
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,600
 from Numbers 14, verses 10 to 23.

63
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:31,080
 And all the congregation said to stone them with stones,

64
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,960
 referring to Caleb and Joshua.

65
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,480
 Now the glory of the Lord appeared

66
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,120
 in the tabernacle of meeting

67
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,800
 before all the children of Israel.

68
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,560
 Then the Lord said to Moses,

69
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,940
 how long will these people reject me?

70
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,620
 And how long will they not believe me

71
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,480
 with all the signs which I have performed among them?

72
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,520
 I will strike them with the pestilence and disinherit them,

73
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,880
 and I will make of you a nation greater

74
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,560
 and mightier than they.

75
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,320
 Moses said to the Lord,

76
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,840
 then the Egyptians will hear it,

77
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,280
 for by your might you brought these people up

78
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,160
 from among them,

79
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,340
 and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land.

80
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,160
 They have heard that you, Lord, are among this people,

81
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,240
 that you, Lord, are seen face to face,

82
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,160
 and your cloud stands above them.

83
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,000
 And you go before them in a pillar of cloud by day

84
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,600
 and in a pillar of fire by night.

85
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,000
 Now if you kill these people as one man,

86
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 then the nations which have heard of your fame

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,600
 will speak, saying,

88
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,960
 because the Lord was not able to bring this people

89
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,820
 to the land which he swore to them,

90
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,600
 therefore he killed them in the wilderness.

91
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,680
 And now I pray,

92
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,960
 let the power of my Lord be great,

93
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,920
 just as you have spoken,

94
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,880
 saying the Lord is long-suffering and abundant in mercy,

95
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,260
 forgiving iniquity and transgression,

96
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:10,220
 but he by no means clears the guilty,

97
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,120
 visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children

98
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,120
 to the third and fourth generation.

99
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,220
 Pardon the iniquity of this people,

100
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,100
 I pray according to the greatness of your mercy,

101
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,880
 just as you have forgiven this people from Egypt

102
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,480
 even until now.

103
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,060
 Then the Lord said,

104
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,040
 I have pardoned according to your word,

105
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,660
 but truly as I live,

106
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,260
 all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord,

107
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,660
 because all these men who have seen my glory

108
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:50,700
 and the signs which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness

109
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:55,000
 and have put me to the test now these 10 times

110
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,260
 and have not heeded my voice,

111
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:01,060
 they certainly shall not see the land

112
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,560
 of which I swore to their fathers,

113
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,540
 nor shall any of those who rejected me see it.

114
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,580
 The Israelite sin ultimately caused them to die trapped

115
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,900
 and wandering in a desert.

116
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,700
 It also brought death to their promises,

117
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,380
 their dreams, their hopes.

118
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:26,980
 Today many of us are wandering in a desert,

119
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:33,080
 stuck, frustrated, experiencing lost dreams,

120
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,380
 because we've invited sin into our lives.

121
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,780
 We've not turned away from it,

122
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,580
 but instead have made room for it.

123
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:48,660
 We've also become indifferent to the consequences of sin.

124
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,240
 We say to ourselves, God will forgive me.

125
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:57,740
 We go back to the same sin a second, a third, a fourth,

126
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,040
 a fifth time.

127
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,860
 We tell ourselves, God will understand.

128
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,800
 You know, the irony is, he does understand.

129
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:15,040
 But what we often forget is that there are always

130
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,560
 consequences to sin, which we bear in our bodies,

131
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,560
 our minds, our homes, our communities, and our world.

132
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,040
 God forgave the children of Israel,

133
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,920
 but the consequences of their sin

134
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,880
 was that they lost their intended future.

135
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,680
 They were literally on the doorstep of it,

136
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,560
 but couldn't inherit it.

137
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,040
 In Numbers 13, two, God says,

138
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,960
 "Send men to spy out the land of Canaan,

139
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,300
 "which I am giving to the children of Israel."

140
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,960
 He says, "Which I am giving,"

141
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,920
 not that I'm thinking about giving.

142
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:04,380
 He said that I am giving.

143
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,380
 You know, when God first asked Moses

144
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,660
 to liberate the nation of Israel

145
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,660
 from the oppression of slavery in Egypt,

146
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,180
 God, Moses asked God,

147
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:21,300
 "What is your name?"

148
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,840
 He said to God, "Suppose I go to the Israelites

149
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,800
 "and say to them, the God of your fathers

150
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,200
 "has sent me to you, and they ask me, what is your name?

151
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,880
 "Then what shall I tell them?"

152
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,960
 God says to Moses, "Ihir asher ihir,"

153
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,960
 I am who I am.

154
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,120
 This is what you are to say to the Israelites,

155
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,000
 I am has sent me to you.

156
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,520
 The Hebrew alphabet gives a clue to the meaning.

157
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,920
 This name begins with the first letter

158
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,320
 of the Hebrew alphabet, Aleph,

159
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,960
 which speaks of the future tense.

160
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,880
 Therefore, this name can be translated,

161
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,300
 I will be who I will be.

162
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,700
 God is saying he's not only with us right now,

163
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,800
 but he goes ahead of us into our future,

164
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,560
 which may be unknown to us,

165
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,660
 but is completely known to God.

166
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:20,680
 God is saying, I will be whatever I choose to be

167
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,280
 in the circumstances you face in life,

168
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,640
 your healer, your deliverer, your provider, your protector,

169
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,080
 I will be that for you.

170
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,600
 When God said, I am giving this land

171
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,200
 to the children of Israel,

172
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,720
 he was backing up his promise with his name,

173
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,120
 with the essence of who he was, with his character.

174
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,040
 This is significant.

175
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,920
 Let's look at what happens when the spies return

176
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,380
 from spying out the promised land.

177
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:56,940
 They share, we went to the land where you sent us,

178
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,420
 it truly flows with milk and honey.

179
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,940
 But the people who dwell in the land are strong,

180
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:08,220
 the cities are fortified, and there's giants.

181
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,020
 We are not able to go up against the people,

182
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,620
 they are stronger than us.

183
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,980
 These spies give the children of Israel

184
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,460
 a bad report of the land,

185
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:22,100
 saying that the land devours its inhabitants,

186
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,300
 and we were like grasshoppers.

187
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,420
 What just happened here?

188
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,580
 God said, I am giving this land to you.

189
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:39,500
 The 10 spies say, we are not able, they are stronger.

190
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,220
 These men were denying the word of God,

191
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:47,380
 the promises of God, they were denying God himself,

192
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,180
 his strength and his power.

193
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,900
 They were saying, these people are stronger than us

194
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,820
 and our God.

195
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,380
 God is not able to give us this land.

196
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:02,300
 They lost sight of their own identity

197
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,980
 as the children of God,

198
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:08,420
 and they lost sight of God's identity.

199
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,900
 I am.

200
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:14,600
 They not only lost sight of it, they denied it.

201
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,940
 They sinned by not trusting God's vision

202
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,340
 and rebelling against it.

203
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,160
 When Caleb and Joshua tried to remind them

204
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,400
 of who they are and who God is,

205
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,260
 the Israelites don't even want to listen.

206
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,480
 Numbers 14, 10 to 11.

207
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,720
 And all the congregation said to stone them.

208
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,620
 Now the glory of the Lord appeared

209
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,540
 in the tabernacle of meeting

210
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,260
 before all the children of Israel.

211
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,880
 Then the Lord said to Moses,

212
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,980
 how long will these people reject me?

213
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,560
 How long will they not believe me

214
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:55,480
 with all the signs which I've performed among them?

215
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,220
 Furthermore, the 10 spies sin

216
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,520
 because they sway the whole community

217
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,880
 to reject God's words.

218
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,620
 They sway them to lose sight of the grapes

219
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,380
 and only see the giants.

220
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:17,540
 How much sin enters our lives

221
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,900
 because we lose sight of our identity and God?

222
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,800
 And distrust God's words and deny his very character.

223
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:32,100
 The other day I was going to catch the E41,

224
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,120
 which is the bus I take every morning to get to my school.

225
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,460
 And if somebody had said to me that morning,

226
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,600
 look, when you get to your bus line,

227
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,360
 you're going to be second or third in line.

228
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,020
 I would have said, great.

229
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,560
 Because actually it doesn't matter

230
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,480
 where you are in the bus line,

231
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,100
 you always get a seat on that bus.

232
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:56,320
 It's never full, there's always empty seats left over.

233
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,200
 So as I approached the bus line that morning,

234
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,480
 I noticed that there was one man lined up.

235
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,660
 I was about five metres away from him,

236
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,640
 walking down the street towards him.

237
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,200
 At the same time, I noticed that across the road

238
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,040
 on the other side of the road,

239
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,300
 there was a woman who was heading to the bus line as well.

240
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,560
 I recognised her as a regular traveller.

241
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,240
 She was there every morning.

242
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:27,140
 She was about 15 metres away from the bus line.

243
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,600
 Now, if we continued as we were,

244
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,960
 I would have ended up second in the bus line

245
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,760
 and she would have ended up third in the bus line.

246
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,900
 All good, right?

247
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,400
 Apparently not.

248
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:45,560
 As she caught my eye, she began to run.

249
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,000
 Now, she wasn't running to catch the bus,

250
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,320
 it hadn't come yet.

251
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,720
 She was running to be second in line.

252
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:00,000
 Now, remember I said that if someone had told me

253
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,640
 that morning that I would be second or third in line,

254
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,920
 I would have said, "Great."

255
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,900
 But all of a sudden it mattered.

256
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:13,000
 These were the strange thoughts that ran through my head.

257
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,660
 She's trying to take second place from me.

258
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,120
 Can't she see me?

259
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,600
 I'm right here.

260
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,000
 Oh my goodness, she's running.

261
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,180
 And then I thought, "Oh no you don't.

262
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,180
 Not on my watch."

263
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,980
 Now, thankfully I didn't break into a run.

264
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,960
 I didn't want to be that obvious,

265
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,000
 but I hastened my pace.

266
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,180
 The result was that at the exact same moment

267
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:46,160
 that this woman launched herself over the curb

268
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,960
 like she was finishing the 100 meter dash

269
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,760
 to take second place, I stepped around the man

270
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,280
 and slotted myself into second place,

271
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,320
 forcing the woman into third place.

272
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,660
 It was a very uncomfortable moment.

273
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:07,620
 There we were, the man, me, and the woman,

274
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,840
 shoulder to shoulder.

275
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,200
 No social distancing.

276
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,400
 I could feel the heat from her stare.

277
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,080
 And I do what everyone does,

278
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,380
 I buried myself in my iPhone.

279
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,640
 When I boarded the bus and sat down,

280
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,680
 I started to think about what had just happened.

281
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,560
 I hadn't cared about my order in the bus line,

282
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,600
 and then I had cared, so much so that I'd acted

283
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,040
 irrationally and embarrassed myself.

284
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,560
 What had happened?

285
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,960
 I realized that I'd interpreted this woman's motivations.

286
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:53,860
 I felt like she was saying, "I'm more important than you.

287
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,760
 "You aren't valuable.

288
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,300
 "I'm choosing to place myself ahead of you."

289
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:04,760
 Did the woman really think these things about me?

290
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,680
 Probably not.

291
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,240
 She just really wanted to be second that day.

292
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,620
 What drove her to it, I have no idea.

293
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:19,620
 But then I examined myself, why had I reacted this way?

294
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,900
 The woman didn't know it,

295
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,720
 but her actions attacked my identity.

296
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,600
 Instead of me realizing that her actions said nothing

297
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,700
 about my true worth and value,

298
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,060
 I lost sight of my true identity in God,

299
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:41,060
 and I reverted to my past one.

300
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:44,340
 Put up for adoption, unwanted,

301
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:47,700
 not valuable enough to be kept.

302
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:52,360
 In that moment at the bus line, I was proving myself,

303
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:57,280
 showing that I was good enough to be in second place,

304
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,820
 shouting loudly inside, "I am valuable."

305
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:04,540
 In that moment, my actions denied

306
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,340
 everything God has spoken over my life.

307
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:14,420
 God has already shown me who I truly am.

308
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,800
 I didn't need to prove my worth.

309
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:24,100
 He's already shown me who I truly am in his eyes.

310
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:29,380
 I sinned against that woman that day.

311
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,840
 I didn't love her as myself.

312
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,020
 I placed myself above her,

313
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,440
 and in my thoughts, I judged her.

314
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,020
 I also dishonored God.

315
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:45,520
 How do you see yourself?

316
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,840
 Do you believe what God says about you?

317
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,580
 God called the Israelites conquerors.

318
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,620
 He said, "I am giving you this land.

319
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,140
 "You will conquer it."

320
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:04,020
 When the Israelites lost sight of who they were in God

321
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:09,020
 and who God was, they saw themselves as grasshoppers.

322
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,100
 They saw themselves as grasshoppers.

323
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,620
 They saw themselves as grasshoppers.

324
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,820
 They saw themselves as grasshoppers.

325
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,420
 They saw themselves as grasshoppers.

326
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,620
 They saw themselves as grasshoppers.

327
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,660
 They saw themselves as grasshoppers.

328
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,620
 They saw themselves as grasshoppers.

329
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,060
 They saw themselves as grasshoppers.

330
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,580
 They saw themselves as grasshoppers.

331
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,780
 They saw themselves as grasshoppers.

332
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,220
 They saw themselves as grasshoppers.

333
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,420
 They saw themselves as grasshoppers.

334
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,260
 I'm not a good enough Christian.

335
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:43,680
 You know, who would really miss me if I wasn't here?

336
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,580
 I'm a failure.

337
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:51,780
 God doesn't show up for me.

338
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,300
 He shows up for them.

339
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:57,340
 He doesn't show up for me.

340
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,140
 I don't think he cares about me.

341
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:05,700
 In this area of identity, the way we see ourselves,

342
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,420
 the way we see God, I believe many of us

343
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,580
 need to seek repentance and healing.

344
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:16,860
 Trusting in God's character,

345
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,620
 trusting in the truth of his words,

346
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,920
 and knowing your identity in God

347
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,560
 is vital to living with a different spirit.

348
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:33,820
 If we don't, if we aren't secure in our identity,

349
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:37,940
 or we don't truly know who God is and trust him,

350
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,220
 we will act irrationally.

351
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,660
 We will fight to be seen.

352
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:49,300
 We will prove ourselves over and over again.

353
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,860
 We will push ourselves in front of others.

354
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,940
 We will hurt ourselves,

355
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,100
 and we will hurt the people around us.

356
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:01,540
 Not only do the 10 spies sin

357
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,580
 by allowing the fear of the giants

358
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,540
 to determine how they saw themselves,

359
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:10,900
 and ultimately disbelieve the promised provision of God,

360
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,860
 they cause the whole congregation of Israelites

361
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,760
 to follow them in their sin.

362
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:20,580
 They sway them with their words.

363
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,840
 You see, words are powerful.

364
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,820
 There are people sitting here today,

365
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:30,980
 and you have been damaged by words.

366
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,140
 They still come back into your memory,

367
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,380
 things that have been said over you.

368
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:43,800
 Words are powerful.

369
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,540
 The 10 spies' words shift the Israelites' gaze

370
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:51,020
 from a land flowing with milk and honey

371
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:55,040
 to a land flowing with oppression and slavery.

372
00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:00,280
 Sin invites death.

373
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,960
 Look at what the people begin to say.

374
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,640
 If only we had died in the land of Egypt,

375
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,100
 or if only we had died in this wilderness,

376
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,600
 why has the Lord brought us to the land

377
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,340
 to fall by the sword,

378
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,500
 that our wives and children should become victims?

379
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:22,300
 Would it not be better for us to return to Egypt?

380
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,000
 They start speaking about death.

381
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,340
 They start speaking of returning to a place

382
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,700
 where they were oppressed,

383
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:32,320
 where many of them had suffered and died.

384
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,400
 They begin speaking the very opposite of God's promise.

385
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,860
 Why has the Lord brought us to this land,

386
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,520
 not to give it to us,

387
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,980
 but that we would fall by the sword?

388
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:51,180
 How are we using our words?

389
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:54,840
 A person with a different spirit

390
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:59,020
 will always use their words to help people see God

391
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,580
 and their future with Him.

392
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,760
 A person with a different spirit

393
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,080
 will use their words to build people up,

394
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,720
 to encourage,

395
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,800
 to strengthen.

396
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,560
 Caleb and Joshua say,

397
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:21,560
 "The land we pass through and explored is exceedingly good.

398
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,200
 "If the Lord is pleased with us,

399
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,720
 "He will lead us into this land,

400
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,080
 "a land flowing with milk and honey,

401
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,380
 "and He will give it to us."

402
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:36,160
 In this season of your life, this season in Hong Kong,

403
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,880
 what are your words bringing?

404
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,040
 Are they bringing life?

405
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,600
 Or are they bringing death?

406
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:50,260
 Are your words swaying people to give in to fear?

407
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,600
 Or are they encouraging people to lean into their faith

408
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,500
 and trust in God's presence?

409
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:05,000
 The Israelites were doubting God's love for them.

410
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,360
 They were doubting that He would protect them.

411
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,700
 They lost sight of their future.

412
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,800
 They lost sight of their future in God,

413
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,700
 and they were staring back at their past.

414
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:20,880
 Are we doubting our future?

415
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,080
 Are we doubting our identity, our value in God?

416
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,800
 The landscape of Hong Kong has changed, and it is changing.

417
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:37,040
 Are we looking at the future with a trust in who God is,

418
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,840
 remembering His great love for us,

419
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:45,120
 or have the giants got us longing for the past?

420
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,540
 Do we need to repent?

421
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:55,380
 If sin invites death, repentance invites life.

422
00:23:55,380 --> 00:24:01,900
 In the Bible, God calls us to repent and live.

423
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:06,380
 Repentance is the key to life.

424
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:10,500
 It unlocks the door to fullness of life.

425
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:15,220
 So what is repentance?

426
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,940
 Repentance.

427
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,940
 If the wages of sin is death,

428
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:24,960
 but repentance can undo this, what is it?

429
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:32,400
 Repentance is a personal, between you and God.

430
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,760
 It's a personal and absolute, unconditional surrender

431
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,700
 to God as sovereign.

432
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:46,420
 Though it includes asking for forgiveness

433
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:51,340
 and having genuine sorrow and regret,

434
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,300
 it is more than that.

435
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:59,180
 In repenting, one makes a complete change of direction,

436
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:04,820
 180-degree turn toward God.

437
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:10,780
 It is choosing to follow after God with all your heart.

438
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,120
 Repentance is an act of faith.

439
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,620
 Caleb had a different spirit.

440
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,840
 Look at what God says about him.

441
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,500
 But my servant Caleb,

442
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,860
 because he has a different spirit in him

443
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,820
 and has followed me fully,

444
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,860
 I will bring him to the land where he went

445
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:34,120
 and his descendants shall inherit it.

446
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:39,120
 He has followed me fully.

447
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:44,640
 True repentance is not a one-time thing.

448
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,140
 It is a daily following after Jesus.

449
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:55,020
 I would say that we need to adopt a lifestyle of repentance,

450
00:25:55,020 --> 00:26:01,200
 a lifestyle of turning back to God fully every day,

451
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,140
 a lifestyle of complete surrender,

452
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:11,060
 and a lifestyle of heeding God's voice.

453
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:17,060
 To have a different spirit, we have to follow God fully.

454
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:22,720
 This starts with an awakening to the sin in our life

455
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,880
 that we've become indifferent to.

456
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:30,140
 We then surrender to God

457
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:35,480
 and turn completely away from the sin.

458
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,900
 We need to understand what it costs God

459
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,940
 to be able to forgive us.

460
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:48,100
 It costs him watching his son be nailed to a tree.

461
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:53,740
 This was not the first time the people of Israel

462
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:56,580
 had sinned and disobeyed God's voice.

463
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:01,020
 God says 10 times they've not heeded my voice.

464
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:07,820
 When we like the Israelites keep returning to sin,

465
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:10,820
 keep inviting the same sin into our lives,

466
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:15,260
 turning our back on the plans that God has for us,

467
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:19,620
 the Bible describes it like this.

468
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:25,420
 They again nail the Son of God on the cross.

469
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:29,440
 For as far as they are concerned,

470
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,860
 they are treating the death of Christ

471
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,140
 as if they were not saved by it

472
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:40,820
 and are holding him up again to public disgrace.

473
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:46,360
 When I read that, I started to cry.

474
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,840
 I was really convicted by it.

475
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:56,080
 And I asked myself, have I been picking up

476
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,660
 those nine inch long nails,

477
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:02,300
 pushing Jesus back onto the cross

478
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:07,460
 and banging the nails in with my thoughts and my actions?

479
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:19,300
 As I was preparing the sermon, I felt God say,

480
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,500
 following, not walking.

481
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,840
 I didn't understand.

482
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,060
 So I asked him to explain what it was

483
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,460
 he was trying to tell me.

484
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:36,540
 He said, generally walking in a direction

485
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:39,780
 is different to intentionally following

486
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,340
 in someone's footsteps.

487
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:45,700
 Jesus said, follow me.

488
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:50,060
 To follow someone, you have to see them.

489
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,740
 You have to stay close.

490
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:54,980
 Caleb had a different spirit.

491
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:58,060
 He was following God fully.

492
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,860
 Too many of us have been following

493
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:04,700
 in the general direction of Christ

494
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,620
 and we've lost sight of him.

495
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:11,460
 We are no longer close to him.

496
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:17,520
 Repentance keeps us close.

497
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,480
 True repentance is turning away from sin

498
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,940
 and turning towards God's words for our life,

499
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:31,300
 aligning ourselves with what God says about us,

500
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:35,000
 choosing to trust in the nature and character of God.

501
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,300
 Repentance isn't just seeking forgiveness,

502
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,300
 but it is that as well.

503
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:44,180
 It's not just turning away from sin,

504
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,740
 but it is that as well.

505
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:50,380
 It is then choosing to move in Jesus' direction,

506
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:53,140
 following in his footsteps.

507
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,140
 Will we repent?

508
00:29:55,140 --> 00:30:02,420
 I'd like to invite the musicians back.

509
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,800
 Would you stand with me?

510
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,600
 We're just gonna take some time at the end of this service

511
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,560
 to heed God's voice,

512
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:36,300
 to listen, to hear what he wants us to repent of.

513
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:42,740
 We have all fallen short.

514
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:47,020
 There is no one in this room

515
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:50,140
 who isn't in need of repentance.

516
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,400
 There's just not one.

517
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,920
 We have all fallen short.

518
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:59,880
 I just wanna remind people here today

519
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,080
 that sin isn't just the things that we do.

520
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:07,060
 Sin is also the things that we don't do,

521
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:10,960
 the things that we know to be right,

522
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,960
 the things God has called us to, but we don't.

523
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,480
 Just close your eyes

524
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:26,360
 and open your hands in front of you.

525
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:33,440
 On the way here, I heard a beautiful song,

526
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,440
 and it said, "I don't wanna miss one word you speak,

527
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,040
 "'cause everything you say is life to me.

528
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:47,620
 "I don't want to miss one word you speak.

529
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,840
 "Quiet my heart, I'm listening."

530
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,940
 I wanna encourage you to listen.

531
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:00,880
 God is speaking to you.

532
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,900
 He's speaking to me.

533
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,720
 Listen.

534
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:10,420
 Still the noise in your head.

535
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:16,280
 Take this moment to be still in his presence.

536
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,920
 (gentle music)

537
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,760
 Listen.

538
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,440
 Hear what he is saying to you.

539
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,840
 Some of you today, you know

540
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,160
 that how you think about yourself

541
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,640
 and some of the things you think about God,

542
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,480
 you know they're not right,

543
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,520
 and God is challenging you to repent.

544
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:42,440
 Some of you today,

545
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,920
 you know the words that have been coming out

546
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:49,360
 of your mouth have not been bringing life,

547
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,640
 not to you, not to the people who hear you,

548
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,080
 not to the people in your workplace,

549
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,040
 not to the people in your family,

550
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:03,280
 and God is challenging you to repent.

551
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:08,680
 Some of you today, you're so fearful of the future.

552
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:14,120
 You've lost sight of the hugeness of God,

553
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,200
 of his power and his strength.

554
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,600
 You've lost sight of your own future,

555
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:23,920
 and God would say, "Come, come close.

556
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:27,440
 "Let me restore you.

557
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,720
 "Let me help you to see again."

558
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:38,600
 Some of you today, you know you've been inviting sin

559
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,440
 into your life.

560
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,040
 You've gone back a second, a third, a fourth, a fifth time.

561
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,000
 God's heart is breaking.

562
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:52,440
 He says, "Come, come, let me help you to turn away from it,

563
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:58,800
 "to walk away from it."

564
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,400
 (gentle music)

565
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,980
 (gentle music)
