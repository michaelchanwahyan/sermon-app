1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Good morning, everybody.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 You guys are a little asleep, but that's okay.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Okay, so I have a question for you.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 You know those people, those people with kids,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 those people with kids who can do the smallest, most insignificant thing,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 and they'll freak out about how their kid's a genius.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 Like their kid could pick their nose and show it to mom and dad,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 and mom and dad will be like, "Oh my God, he's going to Harvard!"

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 You guys know those people?

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Ugh.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 I've become one of those people.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 My son, Elias James Armstrong, is one year, three months.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 I want to clarify, he's not 15 months.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 When you hit the one-year mark, we start saying one year in certain months.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 He's not 15 months. He's one year and three months.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 And actually, recently, I've become convinced that little Elias is also a genius.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 And I post about it all over my social media,

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 so I'm sorry if you feel like I'm spamming you.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 But this is what he's done recently.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 I've asked him, I said, "You can literally ask him any question in the world."

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Kind of.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 "You can ask him any question that has to do with animals and what sounds they'll make."

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 And he'll give you the right answer.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 So you can go up to Elias and you'll say, "Elias, what sound does a lion make?"

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 And Elias will like, kind of curl up a little bit,

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 he'll put his arms up and he'll go, "Ahh!"

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 And it's pretty cute.

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Second one, you can ask him, "Elias, what sound does a puppy make?"

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Now, not a dog, what sound does a puppy make?

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 And he won't, kind of like, bark, bark.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 He'll put his hands up and go, "Arf, arf!"

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 And he literally sounds like a puppy. It's absolutely adorable.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 And there's one animal that he just hasn't gotten quite down yet.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 You can ask him, "Elias, what sound does a cow make?"

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 Now, we read all these books about cows and cows jumping over the moon,

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 and we even say the moon word, "moon."

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 He doesn't get it.

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 If you ask him, "What sound does a cow make?"

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Elias will look at you and he'll make a sound that I like to describe

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 as a vacuum cleaner crossed over with helium.

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 And it sounds a little bit like, "Ahh!"

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 And the crazy thing is that he does it every single sound.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Like, he's committed to that sound being what sound a cow makes.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Recently, I decided to push my luck a little bit.

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 I said, "I want to see if Elias knew what Daddy said."

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 So I asked him the question, "Elias, what does Dada say?"

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Now, clarification, my wife did carry this baby for nine months,

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 and she wakes up in the middle of the night, and she feeds him,

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 and she prays for him, and does all the great things.

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 But I'm the fun parent at home.

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 I'm the one doing all the crazy things, breaking all the rules,

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 doing the things you shouldn't do, feeding him cake when he shouldn't have cake,

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 all the fun things.

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 So, you know, we dance together, we listen to BTS together,

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 we do hand motions together, we do all of it.

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 For that reason, I expected him to give a very fun, lively,

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 something that reflected me kind of answer.

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 So we asked Elias, "Elias, what does Dada say?"

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 He looks at me, and he goes, "Ffff, ffff, ffff, ffff, ffff."

60
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Not really the sound I was going for.

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 So fun fact, I have the worst allergies in the world.

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Every morning when I wake up, I go straight to the bathroom,

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 and I blow my nose, and I make that horrible, terrible sound,

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 trying to get all the nastiness out.

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 And my son has somehow attributed that to what sound Daddy makes.

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 I've somehow become an influencer, y'all.

67
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 My kid gets it. Daddy makes the ffff sound.

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 I'm pretty frustrated by that. I don't like it. I don't like it at all.

69
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 But it has shown me that in like the small, simple ways,

70
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 I've been able to influence him.

71
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 I've been able to have some kind of impact on his life.

72
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Not the impact I want. Hopefully I'll have better impact in the future.

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 But my silly little nose-blowing moment every single morning

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 has somehow influenced him, and it's taught me a little bit about the power of influence.

75
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 It wasn't something grand that I did. It's something subtle.

76
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 It wasn't even for him. It was in the bathroom away from him.

77
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 But somehow he's been influenced.

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 He's been impacted by just that little small thing.

79
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 I've learned that influence is very similar to that.

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 It's not about status in society or even your social media followers.

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 We feel a little blue tick.

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Does anyone here have a blue tick, by the way?

83
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Influencers? Okay, cool.

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 Influence is measured differently than the way that we might think.

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 It's actually about the impact that can take place

86
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 in the small ways that we engage with one another.

87
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Our little decisions, what we stand for, what we do or perhaps what we don't do.

88
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 It's our little decisions and how we interact.

89
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 That's the kind of stuff that will affect people indirectly and in tangible ways.

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 Without being forceful, without commanding it,

91
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 we can produce an effect on others all around us.

92
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 This is influence.

93
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 It's something simple.

94
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 It happens every single day of your life and we're just not aware of it.

95
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 Look at it this way.

96
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 Our impact is a direct byproduct of our influence.

97
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 I'll say that again.

98
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 The impact that you're making is a direct byproduct of our influence.

99
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 Let me tell you something else about influence.

100
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 There's more.

101
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 Influence is potentially bigger than we might recognize for something so small.

102
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 The word that's most commonly used when you ask the top leadership gurus

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 define leadership, they'll break it down to one word.

104
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 That word is influence.

105
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 See, what we see as small moments of impact is influence.

106
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 And influence is leadership.

107
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 So in these small moments every day, the things that we do,

108
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 actually it's leadership.

109
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 Leadership is not just for chief executives or presidents on some geopolitical level.

110
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 Leadership happens here in this room, in our homes, on the grassroot levels.

111
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 Leadership is in the little stuff.

112
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 Now I do understand, everybody is not a leader.

113
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 As I was writing this I was like, I could think of a few people that came to mind

114
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 that would say, but everyone's not a leader.

115
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 I get it, everyone is not a leader.

116
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 But everyone does impact, does make an impact on others in small ways.

117
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 If me blowing my nose can impact my son, something tells me that in the spaces that you live and work

118
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 and do what you do, your life probably has an impact that you might be unaware of.

119
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 And the thing about great leaders is this, they use their influence,

120
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 they use their impact to better those who are around them for their good.

121
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 Leadership, when done wrong or actually we examine it, it affects our relationships with one another.

122
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 Think about it this way, in Hong Kong we do live in a society where sometimes our leadership looks like racing to the top.

123
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 And it can be a challenge to genuinely, authentically celebrate the success of someone else

124
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 because we oftentimes view our neighbor as our competition.

125
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 We focus on our growth and on our own progression and we can lose sight that the reality of me first sends a message.

126
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 It feeds a cycle.

127
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 It can propagate a culture that's actually incompatible with the faith we hold,

128
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 unless we decide to stick to a deep compartmentalization of our faith in our life.

129
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 There's a broken system in leadership when individual gain is the motivation.

130
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 Where leadership can become transactional, our relationships feel like we just use one another,

131
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 what can this person do for me and once they're done doing that for me,

132
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 or once I've gotten whatever advantage I need, I discard or no longer really care about them and their well-being.

133
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 That's not really the model that our scriptures show us about relationships or about leadership.

134
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 It's not the Jesus way.

135
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 Leadership done according to Jesus' model will allow us to impact those in our world and our lives for their own good.

136
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 So whether you're leading in your schools or in your workplace or in your communities or in your families or wherever,

137
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 I believe that as we examine Jesus' model of leadership,

138
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 there's some things we can take away that will impact the way that we impact others.

139
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 So how does it work? How do we position ourselves to follow this Jesus' model of leadership?

140
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 And what is Jesus' model of leadership?

141
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 The gospel of Mark is a fun gospel.

142
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Across two chapters, and actually it's also in Luke and Matthew,

143
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 but specifically in Mark, across chapters 9 and 10,

144
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 we have this overall examination of greatness.

145
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 So what's happening, let's look at starting with Mark 9.

146
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 You've got the disciples and you're sitting with Jesus and they're asking the question,

147
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 "Who will be the greatest?"

148
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 And greatness is good. No one really wants to be mediocre. I get that. It's a genuine question.

149
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 How do you define the greatness? Who is the greatest?

150
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 And Jesus looks at them and he answers them with one of these answers that isn't really an answer.

151
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 It's one of those Jesus answers that doesn't really clarify anything, but he says it and then moves on.

152
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 So what he says is this, "Whoever wants to be first should be last and the servant of all."

153
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 No explanation after that.

154
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 He just picks up a kid and starts talking about a completely different topic.

155
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 And then you have Mark chapter 10, where a very famous story that we've all heard,

156
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 or most of us have heard if you've been here, about a rich young ruler,

157
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 a guy who's gotten all his affairs in order, comes to Jesus and he says,

158
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 "Jesus, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"

159
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 Now if you were here last week, you would have heard Pastor Ellison talk about this question,

160
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 "What can I do to inherit eternal life?"

161
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 This guy is asking the exact same question.

162
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 And Jesus, he looks at Jesus and he tells him,

163
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 "Alright, so of all the things I can think of, I've done all the commandments.

164
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 I know what they are and I've followed them. I've checked them off my list.

165
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 So how do I get eternal life?"

166
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 Jesus looks at him and gives him an answer that probably isn't what he's expecting.

167
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 He goes, "Sell all your possessions, give it to the poor, then come follow me."

168
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 Which, if we think about it practically, that answer doesn't make a lot of sense.

169
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 This guy is a little frustrated and disheartened.

170
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 Like, what does my neighbor's well-being and their progress,

171
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 what does that have to do with my piety, with my faith journey, with my relationship with God?

172
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 But this is the answer Jesus gives him.

173
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 And he ends this entire thing in chapter 10 and says another one of his famous one-liners.

174
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 He says, "Whoever wants to be first must be last."

175
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 It was the second time in two chapters he's saying this exact same thing.

176
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 And when we push further and looking towards verse 35 of the same chapter,

177
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 we have a third example.

178
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 Thinking about greatness and examining leadership.

179
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 You have James and John, they come up to Jesus.

180
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 And as you look at the slide, we'll read Mark 10, verse 35.

181
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 It reads like this.

182
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 "Then James and John, sons of Zebedee, came to him.

183
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 'Teacher,' they said, 'we want you to do for us whatever we ask.'"

184
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 Pause.

185
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 If anyone ever comes up to you and just asks that question,

186
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 maybe ask them what they want, because that's a bit of a slightly dodgy question.

187
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 Whatever we're going to ask you, just say yes.

188
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 It's how they're approaching this.

189
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 So you can kind of infer that something shady is about to go down.

190
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 "So what do you want me to do for you?" he asked.

191
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 "They replied, 'Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory.'"

192
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 And I can imagine at this point, Jesus hears this,

193
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 and he does that like face to palm, palm to face emoji thing, hand on the head.

194
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 He's like, "Oh, they don't get it."

195
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 He goes, "You don't know what you're asking.

196
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 But can you drink the cup that I drink or be baptized with the baptism I'm baptized with?"

197
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 To which, slightly rhetorical question, they say, "Yes, we can.

198
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 We're very confident. Yes, we can."

199
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 Again, Jesus probably puts his palm to his face.

200
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 He's like, "They're not getting it."

201
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 He goes, "Well, you will drink the cup I drink,

202
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 and you will be baptized with the baptism I'm baptized with.

203
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 But to sit at my right or my left is not for me to grant.

204
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared."

205
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 And when the other guys heard about it, the other 10, they became indignant.

206
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 Fancy word for pretty mad.

207
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Where James and John.

208
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 So here again, we have James and John, two of Jesus' close disciples

209
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 who've been walking with him for some time.

210
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 And what they're doing is they're approaching him for some shady business.

211
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 They're probably, I imagine, whispering it to him so that the other 10 can't hear it.

212
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 They're coming to Jesus first, and they're like, "Jesus, when you reign,"

213
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 because their expectation is that Jesus is going to reign over all the world as king.

214
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 "When that day comes, can we get a place?

215
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Can we be up top? Can we be some of your chosen people?

216
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Can we have a place of leadership, of influence, of impact?

217
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 Can we be in a position that shows others that we are great?

218
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 We want a seat at the table."

219
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 And I think they're operating from the concept of the early bird gets the worm.

220
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 When I was in the US, we played this game.

221
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 Well, it wasn't really a game. It was more of a lifestyle,

222
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 where if you're driving in a car or you're going to the car,

223
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 the first person to say, "Shotgun," gets to sit up front,

224
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 and everybody else is cramming the back.

225
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 If you're the first one there, you get the prize.

226
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 And I feel like these disciples are operating from the same place.

227
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 They're asking Jesus this early on so that they can be in a position of power.

228
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 And Jesus responds, not answering their question, of course.

229
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 He gives them--he's one of those guys, one of those friends,

230
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 where you ask him a question, and then he gives you another question.

231
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 Somebody did that to me this week, and I didn't like it.

232
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 You know who you are.

233
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 Anyways, he answers them by asking them a question.

234
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 "Can you drink from the cup that I am going to drink,

235
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 or be baptized with the baptism that I will be baptized with?"

236
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 Which is a very confusing sentence.

237
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 These two things, what do cups and baptism have to do with what Jesus--

238
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 what leadership is about?

239
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 Well, it's not really anything about leadership.

240
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 Jesus is actually using these two things symbolically

241
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 to talk about the journey he's about to go on to the cross.

242
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 And actually, in this same passage, Jesus has clearly--

243
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 and given a clear, detailed play-by-play, almost,

244
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 of what's going to happen to him when he reaches Jerusalem.

245
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 He tells him that he will be condemned to death,

246
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 he will be beaten, he will be spit on, he will be flogged,

247
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 and then they'll actually kill him.

248
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 And then he will be raised to life again on the third day.

249
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 So James and John have just heard this, and Jesus says,

250
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 "Can you do all these things?"

251
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 And they're like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're good, we got it. We can do it."

252
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 These two are, one, either terrible listeners,

253
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 and completely missed what he said,

254
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 or two, they're grossly overconfident in their own ability.

255
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 Or three, actually.

256
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 James and John have the wrong expectation of the coming Messiah,

257
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 much like everybody else in that time would have.

258
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 See, they are expecting Jesus to come and rule and reign

259
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 and be some all-conquering king,

260
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 and they want a seat at that table.

261
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 They don't understand that the kingdom of God

262
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 is nothing like the culture of the day,

263
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 the Greco-Roman way of power and leadership.

264
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Jesus is literally about to turn their understanding

265
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 of ruling and leadership and greatness on its head,

266
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 give them a completely different understanding

267
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 of what that is to look like.

268
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 Before he does, I love that Mark writes this gospel.

269
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 He adds a little bit that the other disciples are pretty mad

270
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 when they hear about what James and John are doing.

271
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 And, you know, I get it.

272
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 To be fair, the other ten were probably just a little frustrated

273
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 that they weren't the first ones to ask,

274
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 'cause maybe they would have gotten it.

275
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 But that's because they knew that's how relationships work.

276
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 They knew that's how leadership and greatness operated.

277
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 Greatness was about getting ahead.

278
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 If you can get the before the other person, even better.

279
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 That was the way of operating.

280
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 Does it remind us of anything in our world and in our culture today?

281
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 I love that Jesus turns this into a proper teaching moment.

282
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 He didn't just give them a one-liner.

283
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 He actually expands on this.

284
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 In verse 42, he says this,

285
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 "You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles

286
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 lord it over them," important phrase, "lord it over them,

287
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 and their high officials exercise authority over them."

288
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 In this statement, Jesus calls his disciples,

289
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 and I think us, to examine our understanding

290
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 and the norms of leadership and of greatness,

291
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 and the characteristics that we would attribute

292
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 to greatness and leadership.

293
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 See, the Greco-Roman leaders were the ones who were at the top

294
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 of a top-down system, a largely militaristic, authoritative system

295
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 that was drenched in deep prejudice and racial undertones.

296
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 See, these kinds of leaders were the ones who were the wealthiest of the wealthy.

297
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 They were the ones who had the best reach and the best network

298
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 and had earned the most and had achieved the most.

299
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 These guys had learned everything.

300
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 They had all the achievements for personal success.

301
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 They were the privileged individuals, the ones who would be served.

302
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 Funny how things from then to now hasn't necessarily changed all that much.

303
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 Greatness can still often today be defined by,

304
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 I don't know, how much is in your bank account,

305
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 or a position of power,

306
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 or what tier job do you have in the city,

307
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 your personal income, how big your business is.

308
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 The right people in your specific network somehow gives you worth.

309
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 Those are the people, those are the things that we look at

310
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 to understand leadership today.

311
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 And when we do that, we run the risk of pretending that

312
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 because someone has accomplished more, because they have studied more,

313
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 because they know more people,

314
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 somehow they have a different and better worth than someone else.

315
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 In that, we end up neglecting the poor and live in a cycle that is driven,

316
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 I heard someone refer to it as like a bit of a rat race,

317
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 by personal progress and self-gain.

318
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Jesus would look at this in the Greco-Roman culture,

319
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 and us today, he would look at the way that we operate,

320
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 the norms of our day, and he would say four very powerful words.

321
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 He would say this, "Not so with you."

322
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 Like, that could be them, but not you guys.

323
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 That's not how you are to live.

324
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 Don't carry the same broken system as everyone else.

325
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 Don't build yourself after a leadership model

326
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 that oppresses those who have less.

327
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Don't model yourself after leadership that hurts others.

328
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 That may be the way of the world, but not in my house.

329
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 In other words, my kingdom is different.

330
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 I do want to be clear, Jesus,

331
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 I want to talk about what Jesus isn't saying.

332
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 Jesus is not saying that because you're excellent,

333
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 and you've achieved a lot, or you've earned a lot,

334
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 or you know the right people, or you have a high degree,

335
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 that all of a sudden you're anti-kingdom of God.

336
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 He's not pointing to that.

337
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 He's actually pointing to something a bit deeper.

338
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 Excellent and achievement and all these things aren't bad things.

339
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 He's not condemning it.

340
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 Actually, over the years of church history,

341
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 theologians have looked at the idea of sin,

342
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 and this is a really interesting thought, so dial in here.

343
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 They say this, that sin is simply virtue running wild,

344
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 because God has planted in the hearts of every creature

345
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 an aspiration for significance.

346
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 It's how he's made us.

347
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 But unchecked, we tend to bend that good aspiration

348
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 into a desire to dominate others.

349
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 We can sometimes get so intoxicated with greatness and succeeding

350
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 and being the best and being number one,

351
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 that we only see our value through our progress alone,

352
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 absent of how others are doing, absent of our neighbors.

353
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 And then so we diminish the value of others.

354
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 We look at it as my value comes from not being at the very bottom.

355
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 And in our desire to make sure we get to the top

356
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 or somewhere of significance,

357
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 we accidentally end up pushing down, neglecting, ignoring

358
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 those who are in need of us.

359
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 And this happens in church too.

360
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 I'll give you a fun example.

361
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 I was listening to a podcast.

362
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 And in this podcast, the person who's talking

363
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 is a spoken word kind of rapper artist.

364
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 And she and her friend are both spoken word rapper people.

365
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 And they rap and they speak words and they do it in really cool ways.

366
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 And people really love it.

367
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 And so they are hoping one day that they'll get signed.

368
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 They're doing all these big performances.

369
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 They're performing in church.

370
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 They love Jesus.

371
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 They're good church people.

372
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 And her friend ends up getting a record deal.

373
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 And I love how honest she is

374
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 because the reality is that if we were as honest,

375
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 we might realize we're in the same boat.

376
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 Her friend got the record deal.

377
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 And even though all the things we church people do is for God's glory,

378
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 it made her feel some kind of way.

379
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 She was bothered.

380
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 Jealousy and comparison kind of snuck in.

381
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 And what should be something worth celebrating for another

382
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 because it's all for the kingdom of God

383
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 ends up being something that divides friendship

384
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 from neighbor to competition.

385
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 Jesus would look at our church and our world today

386
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 and he would say, "Not so with you."

387
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 And as followers of Jesus,

388
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 we are meant to live in a way that's not even just a little bit different,

389
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 like fully different, like a full 180.

390
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 Like contrary, opposite to this method.

391
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 His kingdom is different.

392
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 It's not just different, it's upside down.

393
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 It's a great word people use to describe it.

394
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 So if we look at verse 43, you'll see on the screen,

395
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 he starts off by saying this word, "Instead."

396
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 Just kind of showing us how serious, like unlike this,

397
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 you can substitute,

398
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 unlike what we see in leaders who exercise their authorities over others

399
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 and lord over them.

400
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 Instead of being that way, unlike that,

401
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant.

402
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 And whoever wants to be first must be a slave of all.

403
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 For the son of man, which the king, God himself,

404
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 did not come into the world to be served by people,

405
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 but to serve and not just serve,

406
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 to give his life as a ransom for many.

407
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 Greatness means becoming a servant.

408
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 To get ahead means becoming a slave.

409
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 Great leaders are those who focus on others.

410
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 They are slaves of all.

411
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 This is again opposite to what we see, what we experience as a norm.

412
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 Leadership isn't about running to the front.

413
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 I heard a pastor say this,

414
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 "Leadership is actually a race to the back of the line."

415
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 I want us to look at the words that Jesus uses in this passage

416
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 because he used some pretty strong words,

417
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 words that we probably would never want to refer to ourselves as in regular context.

418
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 So the first word he uses here is servant, which is the word diakonos.

419
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 And it means a couple of things.

420
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 Servant can refer to the house servant that actually brings the meal

421
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 and prepares the table and sets things up for the other person's benefit

422
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 with no actual progress of their own.

423
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 That's one definition.

424
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 It's probably an easy definition.

425
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 We all know that.

426
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 You didn't need to see it in Greek to understand what a servant is.

427
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 But a servant, the reason I put this word up there

428
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 is because there's another word that's somewhat common to the Christian folk.

429
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 We use the word deacon a lot.

430
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 And deacon is derivative of this word, diakonos.

431
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 That's the word that Paul would use when he would define leadership in God's kingdom,

432
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 in God's people, in God's eyes.

433
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 What it looks like to lead isn't the people who have achieved the most,

434
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 the people who have separated themselves from the crowd.

435
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 No, it's the people who are racing to the back of the line,

436
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 the people who are bringing the food and making sure that everybody else has what they need,

437
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 whose focus is the other.

438
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 That's what leadership through God's eyes would look like.

439
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 Nothing about personal progress or me being elevated.

440
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 It's a display of humility to work towards the needs of another.

441
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 Second word that Mark would use here, that Jesus would use, that Mark would write,

442
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 is the word doulos.

443
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 This word speaks of the slave, someone whose entire livelihood and purpose

444
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 is determined for them by another.

445
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 Jesus says, "Whoever wants to be the first must be a slave of all people."

446
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 That word never has a positive connotation.

447
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 I've never heard anyone like, "Yeah, I'm a slave,"

448
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 except for Paul later on, but he was very spiritual.

449
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 But that's just not our natural position, is it?

450
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 Our posture is not to forget what I need to get accomplished.

451
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 They matter.

452
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 Ask yourself when was the last time you genuinely felt--

453
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 I ask myself when was the last time I genuinely felt that.

454
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 But these are the two words Jesus uses.

455
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 To be a slave is about attributing all this worth and attention and value to the other.

456
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 And slave and servant have a very beautiful connection,

457
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 where to be a servant would speak of the work that we do,

458
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 to be a slave would speak of our posture, our status, our position.

459
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 And Jesus' model is calling leadership to assume a status

460
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 and to do a work that involves-- that is primarily focused on the other.

461
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 It's strong language.

462
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 And I think Jesus knew that when he said it.

463
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 He was trying to make a strong point.

464
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 He uses slave and servant to communicate the mark of humble relationships.

465
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 Keyword, humble relationships.

466
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 He's helping his disciples see that greatness and leadership

467
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 look a lot more like positioning oneself in a way that serves the good of the other

468
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 and less like the early bird gets the worm,

469
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 running to the front of the line or calling shotgun.

470
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 And I love that we have this story right after the rich, young ruler.

471
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 Pastor Ellison hit on a point last week about how we want to inherit eternal life.

472
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 We want to enter into that greatness that God has waiting for us.

473
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 And Jesus confuses this guy by talking about how eternal life

474
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 is built off of your relationship with the others.

475
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 Somehow that's just as important.

476
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 And it makes me think that Jesus' whole idea of us becoming Christian

477
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 and us getting saved, it doesn't make a lot of sense if it's about us,

478
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 if it's all about us and our personal journey.

479
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 It's actually incompatible.

480
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 Why would we get saved and then we're still here?

481
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 Why are we still here if we're already believers?

482
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 If our future is already secure, what's the point of being here?

483
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 It's not by accident. He didn't forget.

484
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 No, He's left us here with a bunch of other people,

485
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 with a bunch of neighbors, with a bunch of one another's to serve,

486
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 to become the slave of, to elevate, to push forward,

487
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 to work for their well-being.

488
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 He's got a reason for you existing with other people.

489
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 It's not by accident.

490
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 And it makes me wonder, like, we have to get to a place where our eyes are on the other.

491
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 Because a lot of times our eyes aren't, they're on us.

492
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 They're on me and my close friends or me and my people or me and my family.

493
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 We really care about the well-being of us and our family.

494
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 I really believe Jesus would look at us and say, "Not so with you."

495
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 It's not just about you and your family, you and your kingdom.

496
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 In His kingdom, we are wired, we are created to be a people

497
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 whose posture and work prefers the other,

498
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 whose position and whose work benefit those out there more than me.

499
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 He's called us to be humble leaders, to be in humble relationships.

500
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 And humility is that key.

501
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 So when we think about how do we take this concept of being a slave

502
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 and being a servant and all that stuff and apply it into our worlds,

503
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 all right, two things for us.

504
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 The first thing starts like this, choosing humility.

505
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 Just choose to be humble.

506
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 Humble is a hard thing to do.

507
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 But the humble leadership is the type of leadership

508
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 that actually has the deeper life-changing impact.

509
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 Jesus knew about that when He called us to the posture,

510
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 that we would have a drive to want to succeed

511
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 and really care about us and our people and really--

512
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 And it's not even that we're doing it because we're mean people.

513
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 Like, I want to clarify something.

514
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 It's not just like, "Oh, we just hate other people."

515
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 No, we just get so focused on us and us and us.

516
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 Jesus is like, "Look out. There's other people around.

517
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 Think about them. Consider where they are."

518
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 That's the kind of leadership He's called us to be,

519
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 and that's Jesus' model.

520
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 And His way can only be done if we're secure in who we are in Christ,

521
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 when we have nothing to prove.

522
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 There's this quote I want to read to us that I found just very beautiful.

523
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 It'll show up again at some other point in the sermon.

524
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 It says this, "Blessed is the man or the woman

525
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 who can sincerely and gladly rejoice when others are exalted,

526
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 but they themselves is overlooked and passed by."

527
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 I'll read it one more time.

528
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 "Blessed is the man or woman who can sincerely and gladly rejoice

529
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 when others are exalted,

530
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 though they themselves be overlooked and passed by."

531
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 That kind of leadership is cross-carrying leadership,

532
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 putting the needs of others as priority.

533
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 That's only possible when you choose the humble path.

534
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 And our leadership will have the ability to go down this counter-cultural road

535
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 of others focused, others first, by choosing humility.

536
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 I think the temptation is that when we end up focusing on ourselves

537
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 and measuring up to a metric that's ever-changing in our world,

538
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 and I think that's what actually perpetuates the rat race.

539
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 Like we're trying to become the best at this,

540
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 but awesome in 2011 is different than awesome in 2015,

541
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 which is different than awesome in 2022.

542
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 Like greatness keeps changing.

543
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 It's not in our favor to chase those things.

544
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 It keeps moving.

545
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 It indeed becomes an actual rat race.

546
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 And God is calling us out of that mentality,

547
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 out of chasing the ever-changing system.

548
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 Instead, by choosing humility,

549
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 He's calling us to look at the other people,

550
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 look at their worth.

551
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 You know, He died for you, but He also died for them.

552
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 The life, death, and resurrection of Jesus,

553
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 His blood being spilled is for the person next to you,

554
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 as well as you.

555
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 That's something we have to remember.

556
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 That gives our neighbor and those around us

557
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 an inherent, limitless worth and value.

558
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 The image of God is breathed into them

559
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 as much as it's breathed into us.

560
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 And I think by changing,

561
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 by seeing things through this perspective,

562
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 Jesus' model will change the way that we see people.

563
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 It will no longer have that distorted,

564
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 "What can they do for me?

565
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 "How do they potentially help me progress?

566
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 "What ways does this benefit me?"

567
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 And it can just be about them.

568
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 Just be about their good.

569
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 This is the change that His model takes us through.

570
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 This is where influence has a maximum impact.

571
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 Jesus' model is just as much about influence

572
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 as the world's model.

573
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 But He approaches it from a completely different angle.

574
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 See, true influence is not lording it over others.

575
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 It's not viewing our neighbors as our competitor.

576
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 It's not just looking out for me

577
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 and my best friends and my family.

578
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 No, true influence is serving others

579
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 so that they might become more.

580
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 I love that Jesus, in this passage,

581
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 gives us this great theoretical concept,

582
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 and then He ends it really beautifully

583
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 by giving us a good example.

584
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 He says, "The Son of Man, the King, God,

585
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 "the One who created everything,

586
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 "the One who everything belongs to,

587
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 "the Christ who was preeminent above everything,

588
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 "the firstborn of all creation,

589
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 "that guy came to serve and not to be served."

590
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 He gives us a beautiful example

591
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 of what humility in servant leadership looks like.

592
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 And Paul would actually echo,

593
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 and not just echo, he would expand this concept

594
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 in Philippians 2, where he would say

595
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 that Jesus did not see His godness,

596
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 His divine right.

597
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 He did not look at Himself in this space

598
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 of I'm equal with God.

599
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 He actually put that stuff to the side.

600
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 He did not take, I think the very words,

601
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 He did not take equality with God

602
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 as something to be grasped.

603
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 He wasn't looking for advantages for Him.

604
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 He was looking for advantages for you.

605
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 So instead, He emptied Himself.

606
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 He put it to the side

607
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 and He took on the form of a servant,

608
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 and then Paul pushes it forward.

609
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 He humbled Himself even to the point

610
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 of death on a cross.

611
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 For what?

612
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 To make a point?

613
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 But so that we might be reconciled to God.

614
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 Like His leadership, His servanthood,

615
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 and His slavery impacts you.

616
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 It's the reason that we can be here

617
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 and be close and near to God.

618
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 It's the reason that we can have eternal life.

619
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 It's the reason for our whole faith.

620
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 What He did, assuming the lowest position possible,

621
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 is how we were able to make it forward.

622
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 That's His example of leadership.

623
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 Counting the neighbor as more important.

624
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 Paul would continue in Philippians.

625
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 He would say, He would challenge us

626
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 to do nothing out of selfish ambition,

627
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 to not just focus on ourselves,

628
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 but to look at the interest of others,

629
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 not just our own,

630
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 to take that mindset that Christ had in His humility.

631
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 And we should use that in how we engage with others

632
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 in leadership and in serving roles,

633
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 becoming a servant to others.

634
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 Jesus is changing.

635
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 He's not changing leadership.

636
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 He's just showing us how to do it the right way.

637
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 And actually the most impactful way

638
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 that the world's ever seen.

639
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 And in Him, we have a model of humble leadership,

640
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 a posture of humble relationships,

641
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 a leader who serves the growth of others

642
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 and the betterment of them and chooses humility.

643
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 And there's a second way that I want to encourage us.

644
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 So we choose humility as the first thing.

645
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 The second thing is,

646
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 I want us to see how we can embrace

647
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 this Jesus model in our prayer lives.

648
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 Now I pray, a pastor, I pray.

649
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 And I would say I'm not like the best prayer.

650
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 Like I can't just pray for like five hours straight,

651
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 like the super, super, super spiritual people.

652
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 But I have realized, I have noticed

653
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 that when life throws everything at me,

654
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 in those moments where, yeah, it's hard,

655
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 where I hurt, where I don't know my way out,

656
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 where I'm at a breaking point,

657
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 I can pray, y'all.

658
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 I can pray real good.

659
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 Pray for a long time.

660
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 And I can fervently, hands and knees,

661
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 like God, I can call out to God.

662
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 I can cry out to God.

663
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 I can get real serious in my prayer.

664
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 It is passionate.

665
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 It is continuous.

666
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 It is that praying without ceasing that Paul talks about.

667
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 I think we can all find ourselves in that situation as well.

668
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 When the moment is right,

669
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 when something isn't going right,

670
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 when it's dire, when it's life or death,

671
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 man, we can pray that God will heal us,

672
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 that he will help us,

673
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 that he will help our best interest move forward.

674
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 So here's my challenge.

675
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 This week, pray, pray,

676
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 for something that doesn't impact you at all.

677
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 Try that.

678
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 Pray fervently.

679
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 Pray passionately.

680
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 Pray without ceasing.

681
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 For someone that's not in your circle.

682
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 I'll push it further.

683
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 Pray for someone that's not in your family.

684
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 Pray for something that doesn't actually benefit you at all.

685
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 I mean, imagine what a week of God's people doing that would look like.

686
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 Imagine what our perspective would look like.

687
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 I wonder if we challenge ourselves to pray for others,

688
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 we probably would talk to others,

689
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 we'd actually know what's going on in their lives.

690
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 It would domino into us actually being a good neighbor.

691
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 Oh, the Bible's connected.

692
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 It's beautiful.

693
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 But challenge yourself.

694
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 It's gonna be a challenge for me too.

695
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 It's not just, I'm not just saying you guys do it.

696
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 I'm gonna be doing this as well.

697
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 Pray for something that doesn't directly benefit me,

698
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 that gives me no profit.

699
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 Man, then I can begin seeing the value in people

700
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 with a love that prefers the other.

701
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 And I think this is the way that we actually bring about change in our city.

702
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 After what we experienced over the past few years,

703
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 blue, yellow, COVID and like,

704
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 don't talk to people and being scared of everybody,

705
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 and still just the natural tendency of Hong Kong's rat race to the top

706
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 and to more and more and more.

707
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 The way we heal is not by looking at individual interests.

708
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 The way we heal is by healing together.

709
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 I am an African American.

710
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 This is not in my notes, I apologize.

711
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 I just wanna give an example because this is really big.

712
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 There's something in black American culture that is pretty dominant.

713
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 You'll hear people talk about the idea that you haven't made it

714
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 until you brought everybody else with you.

715
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 And it's this idea that maybe you started rags to riches

716
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 or started in rags and you made it to riches,

717
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 but just 'cause you made it to riches and they aren't also being elevated,

718
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 you've not made it to anything.

719
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 Like, could we seek the betterment of Hong Kong as a whole,

720
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 of our neighbors and not just us?

721
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 Can we want them to make it just as far as we make it?

722
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 Like, man, that would be something if the church is full of people

723
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 who really, really wanna see the better for the others.

724
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 I think the healing that God's gonna bring in our city is gonna look like that.

725
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 Again, not by everyone looking at their own interests,

726
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 but looking towards the interests of one another.

727
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 The healing God will bring will come in the humility of God's people.

728
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 And so, church, may we never forget, based off of Mark 9 and 10,

729
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 what greatness looks like.

730
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 It doesn't consist about being an admiral or a general or a statesman

731
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 or having certain things or an artist.

732
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 It consists of devoting ourselves, body, soul, and spirit,

733
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 to the blessed work of making our fellow men and women more holy and more happy.

734
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 So may we mourn with those who mourn.

735
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 May we celebrate with those who are actually celebrating.

736
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 In humility, may we bear one another's burdens.

737
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 As Galatians says, may we outdo each other in serving one another.

738
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 May the greatness we seek be the progress of our neighbor.

739
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:09,000
 And may this be how we live, influencing the relationships, impacting one another.

740
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 And I wanna take the next couple of minutes just to reflect a little bit.

741
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 So the band's gonna come up and get up on stage,

742
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 and I know the usual run of things.

743
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 The band comes up, we start getting like, okay, time to go.

744
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 Please don't just run out.

745
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 Like, they're gonna come up, they're not gonna sing,

746
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 they're just gonna play for a minute,

747
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 but we're gonna have a little reflection time.

748
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 And when I finish, I'll pray, and I want you to just stay seated.

749
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 Don't get up and sing, don't raise your hand yet, just sit and think and ask God.

750
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
 Like, I just wanna go through the motions of, okay, sermon's over, let's sing,

751
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 and let's go home.

752
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 And I think God has much more for us than that.

753
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,000
 Maybe you're here today and the Holy Spirit is pointing at something in your life.

754
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 I want us to reflect on that.

755
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 Maybe God is calling you to consider your relationships,

756
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 not just the ones with your friends, but with everybody else.

757
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 He's asking you whether or not your relationships are transactional.

758
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 Have you positioned yourself in any degree as a servant or a slave?

759
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 I know those are hard words.

760
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 It's convicting, not just for you, it's convicting for me.

761
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
 It's my second time preaching it, it's still convicting to me.

762
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
 And conviction really isn't known to feel good,

763
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 but conviction does lead us to growth.

764
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 And that's exactly what I think God wants to do.

765
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
 He's putting His finger on these things, and in that,

766
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 He's calling us to bring it to Him.

767
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 Bring Him the relationships where you feel you weren't cared for.

768
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
 The leadership spaces where you felt like you were just used for your talent

769
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 and then, meh, discarded.

770
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 Or where you felt like the other person's life and success

771
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 was of more value than yours.

772
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 Where you've been personally impacted and hurt by that.

773
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 I wanna create a time where we can actually reflect and bring that to God.

774
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 Bring Him the times where you have felt hurt from leaders

775
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,000
 having their own interests at heart.

776
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 And I believe that as we do that, He will speak life, value,

777
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 limitless worth back into who you are.

778
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 I think there's a second side of this coin.

779
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 There are those of us who, uncomfortably,

780
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 but if we were to be even more honest with ourselves,

781
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 we'd say maybe we were the ones that made another feel that way.

782
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
 Maybe our leadership has done that to people.

783
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
 Maybe we've lorded it over those that we lead,

784
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
 those that we're just in relationship with.

785
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
 We somehow see ourselves because of what we've accomplished as,

786
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 we never say it out loud, but a bit more important, more special, more valuable.

787
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 Our management styles only benefit ourselves.

788
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 And we're only working for our own progress.

789
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 The way we lead our families might be for our own interest.

790
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
 God doesn't come to condemn us.

791
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
 There's still no shame in this house.

792
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 That wasn't just true before the sermon.

793
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
 It's still now.

794
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
 There is no shame in this.

795
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 Probably a lot of us that can identify in certain ways with that.

796
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
 But this is the thing about God.

797
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 He points his finger there and he draws you close if you'll let him.

798
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
 He's not drawing to condemn you.

799
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 God's gentle.

800
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
 God's forgiving.

801
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
 Just ask.

802
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
 This is easy.

803
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 How great is that?

804
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 Just ask.

805
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
 And in his gentleness, as he draws you,

806
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
 his spirit will start to speak, will start to reveal,

807
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 will start to clean out some of the things that we need to get removed from us

808
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 in order to live like he's called us to live.

809
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 God is loving, guys.

810
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
 He's gentle.

811
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
 And in this response, I just challenge you to focus on that.

812
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 Let him do what he wants to do.

813
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
 Let his spirit speak where it wants to speak.

814
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 And so I'm going to pray, but stay seated.

815
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 Don't get up.

816
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
 Don't leave.

817
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 Don't start worshiping.

818
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
 Reflect.

819
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 Give yourself some time.

820
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 Sit with this.

821
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 Jesus, you are, as Carla said, you are the best shepherd.

822
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
 You are the perfect example.

823
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
 And we're grateful for who you are.

824
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:40,000
 We're also grateful that you are gentle, that you love us, that you're not--

825
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,000
 that you don't condemn us, God, that there's no shame in you,

826
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
 but there is reconciliation to be found in you.

827
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 There is restoration and wholeness and a making of us becoming new.

828
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
 And so, God, we come before you this morning acknowledging where we have

829
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:03,000
 fallen short as your people, where our focus has been on us so much more

830
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:09,000
 than it's been on those around us, where our lives and direction is all

831
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
 based on our success and our progress.

832
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:19,000
 God, we ask you to remove from us the things that make us self-centered,

833
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
 that make us seek our own greatness, God, and replace it.

834
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:28,000
 Give us a pure heart, a heart that sees value in our neighbor,

835
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
 a heart that will allow us to look towards the interest of the other,

836
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
 that will care for the other, the way that you did through the example

837
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
 of Jesus on the cross.

838
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
 And Holy Spirit, we invite you to come and speak in this moment

839
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
 while we make space for you.

840
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
 Amen.

841
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
