[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.020]   As you sit down, say hi to the person sitting next to you.
[00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:02.520]   Say hi.
[00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.560]   Nice to see you.
[00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:04.880]   Wow.
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.440]   It's great to be here.
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.720]   Oh my goodness.
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.800]   Well, welcome to The Vine.
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.520]   If you're relatively new, my name's Andrew.
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.560]   I'm one of the pastors here.
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.200]   So glad you're here.
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.320]   If you're watching us online, if you're joining us for the first time online or regularly,
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.360]   we're glad that you're a part of our church online experience.
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.280]   It's great to have you here.
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.200]   Who's enjoyed the Psalm 23 series so far?
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.200]   People enjoying that one?
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.600]   Yeah.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.000]   Awesome.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.320]   Great.
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.320]   Great.
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.640]   Good.
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.640]   That'll stop today.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.640]   It stops today.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:40.840]   Because today, we enter into verse 5 of Psalm 23, the most challenging and the most critical
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.880]   of the verses of the Psalm.
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:49.280]   In fact, in verse 5 of Psalm 23, David changes everything.
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:56.600]   And he changes everything because he has something so important to say to God's people if they
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.800]   want to be a non-anxious presence in the chaos of this world.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.760]   And he changes the imagery in verse 5 from a shepherd imagery that verses 1 to 4 has
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.320]   been kind of obsessed with to a completely new imagery, that of a king.
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:19.720]   And not just a king, but a king who has a table and is hosting people at the table.
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.080]   Now this is completely different from the idea of God being a shepherd, kind of a lowly,
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.240]   meek shepherd who's leading his sheep in green pastures and quiet waters, restoring our souls.
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.360]   And even when we go through dark valleys, his presence is with us.
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.360]   And all that imagery has been kind of calm and gentle and challenging, but welcoming.
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.200]   And we want God to be our shepherd.
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.400]   But now he flips it and says, "We're going to go from this meek and humble image to a
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.840]   powerful image, the image of God as a king."
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.040]   And not just a king, but a king who provides lavish generosity on his people, who gives
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.760]   oil to his people, anoints them, and wants them to experience the greatest part of life,
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:08.240]   who takes the cup, a wine, the wine of his grace and his goodness, and it's like free
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:15.560]   flow, not for 90 minutes for brunch on a Saturday, but like your cup overflows, free flow for
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.240]   life, for eternity.
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.520]   And David does this because he has something critical to say.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.200]   He wants to change the imagery to sort of jar you, maybe out of a slight slumberness
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.280]   into the soberness that if you don't grasp a hold of this one particular issue, you can
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.280]   never be a non-anxious presence amid the chaos of this world.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.360]   In fact, the issue David's about to speak about is the issue that causes the most anxiety
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.860]   for us.
[00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.960]   The most fear-inducing issue is the one that he now turns to.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:55.400]   And it's like he's saying, "We cannot go further unless we soberly realize that unless
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.080]   we're doing something about this issue in our lives, there's no chance.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.320]   Even if we know that God is our shepherd, there's still no chance that we'll find ourselves
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.520]   in such deep peace that people will want to follow Jesus."
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:19.440]   In fact, if the church gets this issue wrong, it has the power to repel people from Jesus
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.200]   rather than draw them in.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.200]   What is the issue?
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:30.120]   Well, let me introduce it to you by reading you Psalm 23, verse 5.
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:36.560]   You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.560]   You anoint my head with oil, my cup overflows.
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.720]   On the surface, this is an amazing verse.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.320]   I mean, I wonder if you can just soak for a moment in the kingly imagery.
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.720]   You prepare a table for me.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.680]   And this table is a place of abundance and generosity.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.280]   It's a table that symbolizes a blessing.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.200]   God pouring his oil out on me.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.200]   It's a table of joy, a table of restoration, a table of life abundant.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.760]   It's a table of safety and security and peace.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.880]   And David is saying, "God provides this table for us, and we think this is the most amazing
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:13.880]   thing."
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.280]   And then we read, "In the presence of my enemies."
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.920]   And we think for ourselves, "That doesn't sound like a table of joy and abundance."
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.560]   In the presence of my enemies?
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.400]   I mean, if I was writing this verse, and I wanted to communicate to you joy and abundance
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.640]   and generosity, and how God just does that for us, here's what I would say.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:45.080]   You prepare a table before me in the place where you've extinguished all my enemies.
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.080]   Now that's joyful.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:53.560]   I mean, stop for a moment and think about a world where you do not have any enemies.
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.700]   Can you imagine what it would feel like to be in a place where no one hated you?
[00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.960]   No one disliked you?
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.200]   No one said anything about you behind your back?
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.100]   You had no social media trolls, Ellison.
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.400]   Could you imagine that?
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.640]   Could you imagine it, Ellison?
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.040]   Where no one says anything bad about you online?
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.440]   No one ever does anything harm to you.
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.640]   You live a peaceful, free life.
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.000]   Now that sounds like joy.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   That sounds like abundance and generosity, but David did not write that.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.840]   Or maybe David could have said it like this, "You prepare a table before me in your presence,
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:33.840]   O Lord."
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:34.840]   Oh, yes!
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.120]   Now that would be joy.
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.160]   Could you imagine if you had a table in the presence of God?
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.360]   Imagine if you had a table where you sat one side and God sat the other side, and you just
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.040]   spent your life feasting with the free flow of His grace.
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.480]   I mean, how amazing would it be if no one else was around other than you and God?
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.040]   That intimacy we just talked about, the holy ground that we all long for, it would be like
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.460]   that 24/7.
[00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.720]   Could you imagine the joy and the abundance in that?
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:04.360]   If I was to try to communicate to you joy, I would say, "It's a table in God's presence."
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.600]   But David doesn't write that.
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:16.080]   David writes, "This table is in the presence of your enemies, the ones you hate, the ones
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:22.680]   who hate you, the ones who can't stand you, the ones who want to tear you apart, the ones
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:28.480]   who want to pull you down, smear your reputation, make everything bad possible about you, the
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.960]   ones who would like to end your life.
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.840]   It's that table.
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.560]   You have those people in your life.
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.480]   God has prepared a table for you before those people."
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.520]   And David is trying to twist this imagery and make it seem strange.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.400]   Generosity, joy, oil flowing, this free flow of God's love and grace, and yet the presence
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.680]   of my enemies, what does this all mean?
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:59.480]   And David's designing it so that you would ask one simple question, "Why?
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.960]   Why do I have this table?
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.760]   What is this table actually for?
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.000]   What does this mean?
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.600]   Why is David saying this?"
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:14.360]   Well, there's a traditional answer to that question.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:19.760]   And the traditional answer has been loved and celebrated for so many years, hundreds
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.440]   and hundreds of years.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.640]   In the traditional answer to the "Why?" about David's verse, the traditional answer will
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:26.640]   tell you this.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.680]   It will say, "Here's what it's about.
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.160]   David is picking up on Old Testament imagery, and it's beautiful imagery, the imagery of
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.800]   Israel and their enemies.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.240]   In fact, if you read the Old Testament, you'll see that Israel constantly was surrounded
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.240]   by enemies.
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.320]   They were almost constantly at war with the people around them.
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.400]   There was always this battle going on.
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.040]   And if you look through the Psalms, and if you look through the Old Testament prophets,
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:54.080]   you'll see time and time again passages of, "We are victorious over our enemies," passages
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.640]   of, "Lord, smite our enemies," passages about pulling down the enemies, sending them to
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:03.200]   the pits of hell so God's chosen people can live a glorious life.
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.920]   To the traditional point of view, the perspective of it, it's like this.
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:14.840]   God prepares a table for me in the presence of my enemies.
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:19.560]   The idea is that we are having a constant party in the presence of all the people that
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.560]   we hate.
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.560]   Could you imagine what that would be like?
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.040]   That would be awesome.
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.840]   I mean, that's a table I want to go to, right?
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.240]   Wouldn't it be amazing?
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.240]   I mean, think about this.
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:35.860]   I have a very long list of people that I don't like.
[00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.200]   Maybe you also have a long list of people you don't like.
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:42.760]   I also have a long list of people who don't like me, people who don't like the vine.
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:48.640]   I think the vine is a bad church, that we preach heresy here, that this is not a good
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.040]   place to be.
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.920]   I've had social media stuff said about me, rumors spread about me.
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:59.400]   I mean, I've got people I could list that keep me up at night that I really struggle
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.400]   to love.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:07.160]   Could you imagine if God surrounded this table with those people and he gave me a cup of
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:12.760]   his blessing and poured his oil on me and I could sit there and go, "Ha, ha, ha!
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.080]   Look how I turned out!"
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.080]   I mean, come on, that sounds amazing.
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.840]   Doesn't that sound amazing?
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:27.120]   It sounds amazing, but it doesn't sound very Christian.
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.240]   And that's a little bit of a problem if you're a Christian here in this room or online right
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:35.800]   now, because kind of we want that traditional interpretation because it would feel great
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:39.920]   to like gloat in front of our enemies.
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.800]   But the imagery doesn't sit well with us, does it?
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:50.360]   And it doesn't sit well with us for some very good reasons, because I don't know if that's
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.280]   quite the table God has provided for us.
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:58.600]   In fact, if you look at Jesus and his teachings, you'll get a sense of this.
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:03.400]   This is Jesus teaching in Matthew 5, starting in verse 43, Sermon on the Mount, most important
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:07.040]   thing Jesus does right at the beginning of his ministry, wanting people to understand
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:11.320]   why he's come, what he's going to do, the type of kingdom he's inviting people into.
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.320]   Listen to this.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:17.480]   "You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbors and hate your enemies.'"
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:18.480]   Ha, ha!
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:22.160]   "Gloat over your enemies."
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:28.200]   But I tell you this, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:32.560]   may be sons of your Father or sons and daughters of your Father in heaven.
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.720]   He causes the sun to rise on the evil and the good.
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.080]   Notice this, Jesus talking here.
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:42.320]   He's going to make great things happen for the evil people and the good people.
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:46.340]   And he sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.
[00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:50.040]   If you love those who love you, what kind of reward do you get?
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.640]   What kind of reward is that?
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.200]   Are not even the tax collectors doing that?
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:58.780]   And if you greet only your brothers and sisters, what are you doing that's more than others?
[00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:00.320]   Don't even the pagans do that?
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.320]   No.
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:06.480]   Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.680]   I mean this is amazing to me.
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:13.400]   Jesus is basically standing before Psalm 23, 5 in the traditional way that it's understood,
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:17.280]   and he's saying that is not it at all.
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:23.360]   In fact, here's what Jesus does, and if you forgive the pun, he turns the table over.
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.840]   And he basically says, "You want to know how to live in my kingdom?
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.240]   You want to know what life is like with me?
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:34.840]   It's not a joy of lying down and drinking my cup and gloating in front of your enemies.
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.840]   I want you to love your enemies.
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.000]   I want you to approach your enemies.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.200]   I want you to be in communion with your enemies.
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:48.480]   I want you to experience the greatest thing that you could ever experience, and that is
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.920]   communion with the very people who want to tear you apart.
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.880]   I want that for you," Jesus is saying.
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:59.480]   I love the way that Eugene Peterson, who wrote the message translation of Scripture, he put
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.480]   it on verse 48.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.480]   Let me read this to you.
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.080]   He says, "In a word, what I'm saying is this.
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.480]   Grow up.
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.000]   Your kingdom subjects.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.640]   Now live like it.
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.600]   Live out of your God-created identity.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:17.040]   Live generously and graciously towards others the way God lives towards you."
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:20.800]   Oh, I prefer the traditional approach.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.280]   How about you?
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:27.880]   Live graciously and generously towards those who may not be gracious or generous towards
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.320]   you.
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:33.360]   Notice that Jesus is not saying, "Live generously with people who live generously with you.
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.640]   Be nice to the people who are nice with you."
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:38.440]   He's saying, "Be gracious and generous with all people."
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.440]   Why?
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:43.120]   Because of their reaction, not because of how they treat you, not because of their words,
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.640]   but because of how I treat you.
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.200]   I'm treating you with grace.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.760]   I'm treating you with love.
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:51.040]   I'm empowering you, so I'm doing that.
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.640]   The way I work with you, I want you to work with others.
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:59.680]   He doesn't say, "Only with the people who are nice."
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:03.480]   He's inviting us into a new journey.
[00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:09.000]   How do we then understand Psalm 23, verse 5?
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.800]   I want to put it to you today that actually I think the traditional interpretation is
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:18.400]   completely wrong, and there's an original interpretation, one that actually I think
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:23.640]   David was thinking about as he wrote this, an interpretation that when you see the language
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:30.280]   of verse 5, you'll come to see is far more in line with Jesus than you may have first
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.280]   thought.
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:34.760]   Have a look again in Psalm 23, verse 5.
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:40.120]   It says, "You prepare a table before me."
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.120]   Very important.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.080]   David says, "You provide a table before me."
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:48.520]   The idea of a table being before him is the, it's actually the Hebrew word, "lefanai."
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:52.440]   And lefanai pitches the idea that a table is created before.
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.080]   Lefanai means in front of.
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:59.040]   And what's interesting about that Hebrew word is it's a word that doesn't carry with it
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.400]   any ownership or claim.
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:05.860]   In other words, David's saying, "This is not my table."
[00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.720]   This is not David's table.
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.040]   It is not my table.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.040]   It is not your table.
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.040]   It is lefanai.
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:16.760]   It is prepared before you, in front of you, but it is not yours.
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:24.000]   Because if David had said, "Oh, you prepare a table for me in the presence of my enemies,"
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.520]   what he would have been saying is basically like the traditional approach.
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:27.520]   The table's for me.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.280]   It is not for my enemies.
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:33.760]   My enemies have to stand around and suffer watching me gloat and enjoy myself.
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.360]   The table is for me.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.360]   Are you following?
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.440]   He doesn't say that.
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.040]   David specifically says, "It's a table that I do not own.
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.080]   It is not a table that has my name on it.
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:46.300]   It is a table that is before me, in front of me.
[00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:51.800]   And because it's in front of me, there's an invitation."
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:56.560]   In other words, actually, lefanai, the Hebrew word, actually has a welcome and an invitation
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.780]   to it.
[00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:01.760]   It's basically God saying, "You are surrounded by your enemies.
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:06.240]   I've provided a table for you.
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.560]   Will you have a seat, David?
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:15.480]   Will you sit down at my table, in the presence of your enemies?"
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.880]   What even blows my mind even more is that he then uses another word for this.
[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.680]   He says, "In the presence of my enemies."
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.680]   "In the presence" is the Hebrew word neged.
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.680]   Neged means confrontation.
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.240]   It means against or opposite.
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:33.000]   What the word means is that there are two parties, two individuals or two groups that
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.440]   are at war with each other.
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:41.440]   So when David says, "You prepare a table before me in the neged of my enemies," David's including
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:46.240]   himself in that strife, in that tension, in the war that's happening.
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.340]   That's really important.
[00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:51.900]   This is not about David going, "I'm perfect and my enemies suck."
[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:54.480]   This is David going, "There is a war going on.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.480]   I feel passionately as well.
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:57.480]   I've been hurt.
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:58.480]   I know I've hurt.
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.160]   There's stuff happening here."
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:04.880]   And it's like God shows up and he takes the two warring parties and he pushes them aside
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:09.680]   and he places a table before them, in between them, if you will.
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:15.600]   And not only, and this is the powerful thing, not only is God opening up the table for David,
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.000]   he's also saying, "It's in the presence of your enemies."
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   In other words, it's their table too.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:29.200]   And if it's their table, then God is also opening up an invitation for your enemies
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.200]   to sit down.
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:34.200]   Oh, that's not so nice.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:39.840]   What was supposed to be a lovely meal has now turned into tension in the air.
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:42.280]   I could cut the tension with a knife.
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:49.480]   It wasn't quite the plan that I had to begin with.
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:54.240]   God is saying, "We get to sit down at a table and have a meal with our enemies."
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:58.640]   The Hebrew word for meal, which is not in this passage, is the word shuel.
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:02.600]   And shuel is a derivative word from another word that is in this passage, and that's the
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:04.140]   word table.
[00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:06.160]   Table is shulkan.
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:12.120]   Shulkan is the place we come to to have a shuel, a meal with someone.
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:17.060]   Now shulkan, although it's translated here table and it means table, it was also used
[00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:23.120]   metaphorically in the Old Testament for an act of reconciliation.
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:29.440]   The table, the shulkan, was a place where a shulkan could take place.
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:34.000]   In fact, an act of reconciliation at a table had another Hebrew word.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.420]   It's the word socha.
[00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:42.540]   So I have a shulkan that enables me to have a shuel with someone, a meal, so that we can
[00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:44.200]   socha together.
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:45.680]   We can reconcile.
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.300]   We can deal with our differences.
[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.020]   We can change our attitudes.
[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.860]   We can talk about the stuff that we wouldn't normally talk about.
[00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:55.080]   We'd take that big elephant in the corner of the room and we'd sacrifice it and we'd
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:18:01.280]   eat it together as we shuel together on the shulkan so that we can have a socha.
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:04.280]   Are you with me?
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:13.020]   Now this idea of a table being the place of reconciliation is throughout the Scriptures.
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:17.340]   In fact, in the New Testament, it becomes the predominant picture of what reconciliation
[00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:18.340]   is all about.
[00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:21.640]   I'll give you a couple of just quick examples.
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:26.300]   There's that amazing moment in Luke chapter 7 where the woman comes in whilst Jesus is
[00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:27.300]   at the table.
[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:32.440]   By the way, a bit of a side note, Jesus basically throughout the Gospels is either on his way
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.620]   to a meal, at a meal, or leaving a meal.
[00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:35.620]   That's basically Jesus.
[00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:38.880]   He's just pigging out the whole time, right?
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:43.640]   And it's because of the shuel and the shulkan.
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:48.420]   So there's this woman who comes into Simon's house in Luke chapter 7 and sits down and
[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:53.700]   actually comes behind Jesus who's at the table and she breaks open an alabaster jar of oil
[00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:58.600]   and pours it on his feet and she weeps and wipes his feet with her hair and it's a beautiful
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:03.500]   picture of her restoring herself, reconciling herself with the one that she believes is
[00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:10.220]   her Messiah, the Savior, and Jesus in front of everybody says, "Your sins are forgiven."
[00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:12.660]   Reconciliation with God.
[00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:17.660]   And then there's that amazing moment, isn't there, where Peter has denied Christ three
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:22.420]   times and he's taken off and he's gone back fishing and Jesus shows up in the resurrection
[00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:28.740]   and makes a barbecue and invites Peter for a shuel with him and they share fish together
[00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:35.440]   and during the meal they reconcile with one another and connect deeply together.
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:40.040]   And of course there's that moment in Acts chapter 2 where the church is establishing
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:45.180]   the rhythms of what church is going to look like and it says there that on every day they
[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:51.780]   met together in each other's homes, they broke bread together with sincere and glad hearts.
[00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:55.500]   The Hebrew for sincere there means without any rocks.
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:56.700]   That's the literal translation.
[00:19:56.700 --> 00:20:01.820]   In other words, the early church practiced a daily practice of coming around the people
[00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:06.100]   in the community and having a meal together so they could talk about stuff and make sure
[00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:10.540]   no rocks were getting in between their relationship.
[00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:16.060]   They embraced Shulchan as part of their church community.
[00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:22.380]   And all of this culminates in the early church going, "Hang on, how do we create a symbol
[00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:25.860]   that will help the world to understand reconciliation?
[00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:26.860]   Let me think about it.
[00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:27.860]   Oh, I know.
[00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:30.460]   This is Paul, right?
[00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:33.700]   On the night that Jesus was betrayed, do you know what he did?
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:39.820]   He took bread and he took wine and he shared a meal with us and he said, "Do this in
[00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:41.980]   remembrance of me."
[00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:44.900]   And so the early church did this incredible thing.
[00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:48.620]   They started to gather around together and celebrate in the reality that the best symbol
[00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:53.140]   that there could be for reconciliation is a table and not just a table but a meal at
[00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:57.460]   the table and we've come to understand it as communion, that we take the bread and we
[00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:01.580]   take the wine and it's a way of us saying, "We are reconciled with God, that there's
[00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:06.260]   no longer any rocks between us and God, that he's poured out his spirit, poured out his
[00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:10.660]   love and we are now restored to the fullness of relationship with him and it's symbolized
[00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:11.660]   by a meal."
[00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:16.280]   And here's the powerful thing.
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:21.740]   When you think about communion, you're not sitting on this side of the table.
[00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.860]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:28.780]   When you think about communion, you're sitting on this side of the table because you're the
[00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:33.260]   enemy that's been invited to the table.
[00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:37.760]   You're the one who was at odds against God.
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:43.000]   In fact, Paul, writing in Romans chapter 5 verse 8, said it this way, "God demonstrates
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.860]   his love for us in this, that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us, whilst
[00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:52.940]   we were enemies of God, whilst we were still separate from him, a long way from him, God
[00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:55.300]   came and offered reconciliation to us.
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:56.500]   He took the first move.
[00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:00.760]   Christ died for us whilst we were still sinners, whilst we were his enemies.
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:06.400]   He could have sat at the table and gloated with his angels at how bad humanity was, but
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:11.660]   instead he prepared a table, he invited us to come and sit, he broke the bread, he spilled
[00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:16.420]   his blood, he did it on the cross of Calvary so we would know shulchan with God."
[00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:18.820]   Are you with me?
[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:25.100]   And what this all is suggesting is if God has invited us to his table and if he has
[00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:30.500]   shulchaned with us so we could have reconciliation with him, how can we then hold that back from
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.060]   others?
[00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:38.120]   How can we then stand on the other side, grab the chalice and gloat at our enemies?
[00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:45.860]   Could it be that actually David was right in line with Christ and was saying the table
[00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:57.380]   is set before us in the presence of our enemies so that we might know love, community?
[00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:02.440]   So that all that anxiety and stress that we hold in our hearts and our lives could be
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:06.260]   dealt with right here at the table.
[00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:11.180]   I love this idea because I want you to see how David then speaks of the reality of what
[00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:15.200]   a community could be like if it actually shulchaned with one another.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:21.340]   He says this, he says, "Oh, you anoint my head with oil."
[00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:27.220]   It's like when I no longer have enmity with other people, when I actually sit down and
[00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:32.060]   reconcile with the people that have been against me, when I feel that connection, when we actually
[00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:35.980]   deal with some of our issues where we forgive one another, it's a little bit like God pours
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:36.980]   his...
[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:37.980]   I'm not going to do it, don't worry.
[00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:38.980]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:42.620]   But God's going to pour his oil on my head and I'll have this anointing and it'll be
[00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:47.340]   like a blessing and we'll both be anointed together, which is really interesting because
[00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:52.300]   if you jump a little bit forward to Psalm 133 verses 1 and 2, listen to what it says,
[00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:57.740]   how good and pleasant it is when brothers and sisters, when people live together in
[00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:58.740]   unity.
[00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:01.020]   You want to know what it's like?
[00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:06.020]   It's like precious oil poured on the head, running down on the beard, running down on
[00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:09.100]   Aaron's beard, down on the collar of his robes.
[00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:12.660]   It is not this posture.
[00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:18.340]   It is this posture.
[00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:22.500]   And that posture is like an anointing that pours over our heads and runs down our robes
[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:25.220]   and we're filled with the anointing of God.
[00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:29.580]   Back in Psalm 23, then it says, "My cup overflows, the free flow forever."
[00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:30.580]   Why?
[00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:33.380]   Because there's no enmity here.
[00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:36.260]   Remember when I said earlier in my message, could you imagine what it would be like to
[00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:38.800]   have no enemies?
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:43.020]   When Jesus challenges the church and He says, "You should love your enemies," He's inviting
[00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:46.580]   you into that world.
[00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:51.100]   He's inviting you into the place where you actually don't have enemies, where actually
[00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:52.100]   you can be free.
[00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:57.500]   Because I want you to know this, the place of greatest stress and anxiety, the place
[00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:02.620]   that's going to make you more of an anxious person in the chaos of this world is when
[00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:07.140]   you don't deal with the friction that you've got in relationships with others.
[00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:12.140]   Your brokenness in your relationship with others will be the number one stress-inducing
[00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:13.860]   thing in your life.
[00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:15.860]   It will tear you apart.
[00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:21.060]   I know every single one of us in this room, we know what it's like to have division with
[00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:22.820]   people.
[00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:25.260]   Some of you in this room, that division is with your family members.
[00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:28.780]   In the last three years here in Hong Kong and all the political stuff that's happened
[00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:33.780]   has torn you apart in your relationships with your mothers and your fathers and your families.
[00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:37.140]   Some of you in here, you know what that's like with your spouse right now.
[00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:41.340]   You're in enmity with the one that you were originally brought together with, with such
[00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:43.460]   love and such grace.
[00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:47.660]   Yet right now the reality is you know what it feels like to be against one another.
[00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:51.700]   Some of you, it might be a colleague at work, it might be some sort of relationship in your
[00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:52.700]   life.
[00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:54.420]   We all know that feeling, don't we?
[00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:56.820]   That anxiety and stress that is there.
[00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:03.780]   It is so hard for us to find a place of peace when we are at enmity with people.
[00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:08.460]   And God has prepared a table before us and before them.
[00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:12.620]   And He said, "Will you come and sit?"
[00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:16.140]   It's going to take courage from you.
[00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:19.220]   It's going to take a huge amount of grace in you.
[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:23.060]   It's going to take you having the ability, this is where it gets hard, you having the
[00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:29.580]   ability to go, "I was also wrong, that I actually made some mistakes too, that it's not all
[00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:30.580]   about you.
[00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:32.980]   It's also about me."
[00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:40.020]   It's going to take some of us actually being willing to ask for forgiveness.
[00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:43.740]   There's no more humbling thing to do in the world than that.
[00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:51.380]   And it's going to take some of us braving the pain that the enemy has caused in us,
[00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:55.380]   braving the hurt that sits there.
[00:26:55.380 --> 00:27:00.940]   And by saying that we are to love our enemies, God is not saying, "Just continue to be abused
[00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:02.820]   by your enemy."
[00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:06.980]   He's not saying even, "You have to like everything the enemy does."
[00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:11.660]   He's not saying, "You have to accept all the stuff that the enemy has done to you."
[00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:14.100]   He's saying, "You have to love them."
[00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:20.380]   And how does love most gloriously get portrayed in life?
[00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:26.260]   Through the cross, through the laying down of our pride and our humility.
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:33.300]   And it's picking up our cross and following after Christ and saying, "Love means to say
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:36.540]   that the same God who forgave me can also forgive them.
[00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:42.540]   And if the same God can forgive them, how can I not forgive them?"
[00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:44.900]   It's not easy, is it?
[00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:50.980]   And David says, "You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies."
[00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:59.100]   We'd love to gloat, but actually we have to submit.
[00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:00.980]   How do we do this?
[00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:02.540]   Let me give you some practical ways as I close.
[00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:05.060]   Has this been helpful for some of you so far?
[00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:11.300]   Let me give you some practical ways that you this week can start a shulkan with someone
[00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:14.020]   that you might need to shulkan with.
[00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:15.900]   Here's the first thing.
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:21.780]   You have to embrace Jesus' perspective that the concept of an enemy is never permanent.
[00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:25.180]   The concept of an enemy is never permanent.
[00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:30.260]   The idea of an enemy is always temporary in God's eyes because God has the ability and
[00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:34.180]   the power and the grace to change an enemy to a friend.
[00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:37.580]   And if our starting point is, "There's no way this is ever going to happen.
[00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:39.100]   There's no way they're ever going to like me again.
[00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:40.660]   There's no way that this is ever thing.
[00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:42.100]   They're going to be my enemy forever."
[00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:44.340]   Then we're in the wrong starting point.
[00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:46.740]   We're not starting point from the perspective of Jesus.
[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:49.380]   We're starting from the perspective of ourselves.
[00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:54.500]   So we have to believe that enemy states are temporary and that actually God has the ability
[00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:58.540]   to change everything in the power of His name.
[00:28:58.540 --> 00:28:59.980]   That's the first thing.
[00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:00.980]   Here's the second thing.
[00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:06.060]   We have to realize that if we want to be reconciled with others, we have to first be reconciled
[00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:07.380]   with God.
[00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:10.300]   Our starting point is reconciliation with God.
[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:15.740]   In fact, not just that, but our ability to feel the reconciliation of God will directly
[00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:18.900]   be our ability to offer that reconciliation with others.
[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:22.260]   The more that we have been forgiven, the more that we are able to forgive.
[00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:25.020]   He who has been forgiven much is able to forgive a lot.
[00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:27.620]   He that's been loved a lot is able to love a lot.
[00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:30.740]   Those that have been forgiven little, forgive little.
[00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:32.420]   This whole thing is in our Scriptures.
[00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:34.220]   Jesus speaks about this a lot.
[00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:38.700]   And so your ability to understand the reconciliation of God, to feel that power yourself, will
[00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:41.580]   be directly your power to be able to then pass that on.
[00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:44.580]   And that's great news for some of you in this room if you're not a Christian, if you're
[00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:47.100]   watching online right now and you're not a Christian.
[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:52.300]   There's a table set before you where God invites you to come into a new relationship with Him.
[00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:54.440]   He doesn't see you as an enemy.
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:55.940]   He sees you as a friend already.
[00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:59.780]   Whilst you were still distant from Him, He died for you as we saw in that Scripture earlier.
[00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:04.140]   He invites you to the table of reconciliation and love so that you would know His forgiveness
[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:06.020]   and His power.
[00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:11.180]   But this verse or this part here is not just for non-Christians in this room.
[00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:13.580]   It's also for you as Christians.
[00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:17.180]   It's challenging you that you need to have short accounts with God.
[00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:22.340]   That actually your job is to walk in His grace and forgiveness, to come to the table regularly,
[00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:26.780]   both as we take communion in church, the blood and the bread that symbolizes that, but in
[00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:31.060]   your own prayer life, regularly coming before the Lord and saying, "Would you forgive me,
[00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:32.060]   Lord?
[00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:33.060]   I screwed up again in this.
[00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:34.060]   I said this here.
[00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:35.060]   I did this here.
[00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:36.060]   I did that.
[00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:37.060]   I did what I did.
[00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:40.780]   I'm coming into that repentive discipline that I have to be able to be reconciled with
[00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:44.900]   you so that I can then offer reconciliation to others."
[00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:45.900]   Here's the third thing.
[00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:48.060]   You have to always embrace your own brokenness.
[00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:53.980]   You have to be willing to accept that you are also wrong.
[00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:57.980]   Reconciliation at the table is not, "Hey, buddy, would you come and join me for the
[00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:58.980]   table?
[00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:01.680]   I want you to come and have a meal with me because I want to spend 45 minutes telling
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:04.700]   you how bad you are."
[00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:07.500]   Like who would enjoy that meal, right?
[00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:08.500]   Maybe you would.
[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:09.500]   I don't know.
[00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:10.500]   But that's not the idea.
[00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:14.060]   The idea is this table is not prepared so I can spend the whole time telling you how
[00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:16.340]   bad you are and how much you've hurt me.
[00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:20.740]   The table is prepared so that I would realize that I am a contributing factor.
[00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:24.980]   Remember, two people at enmity with one another and God moves them apart and places the table
[00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:25.980]   there.
[00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:30.720]   Our first posture as we sit down is, "I've made mistakes too.
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:33.020]   I've screwed up in this relationship as well.
[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:34.460]   I didn't do it all right either."
[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:37.260]   And yeah, you hurt me and there were things you did that really hurt me and I want to
[00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:39.060]   be honest about that and we're going to talk about that.
[00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:44.620]   But my starting point is I've also contributed to this mess and I want to just admit that
[00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:46.820]   before you and ask for your forgiveness.
[00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:49.140]   It's powerful.
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:50.140]   Notice this.
[00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:51.500]   Here's the fourth thing.
[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:55.140]   Forgiveness is an event but reconciliation is a process.
[00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:56.140]   It's a process.
[00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:58.460]   You know, it's interesting in Scripture, Jesus said this.
[00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:01.620]   He said basically, "Forgiveness is a command."
[00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:03.420]   Jesus commands us to forgive.
[00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:07.140]   He says it so strongly that He says, "If you don't forgive, then I will not forgive you."
[00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:08.540]   That's strong.
[00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:10.300]   So forgiveness is a command of God.
[00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:14.340]   Now, the reason why it's a command is because it's something you can do just yourself.
[00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:18.340]   You are able to just forgive because you don't need a third party or somebody else to be
[00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:19.340]   involved in that.
[00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:20.420]   The choice is on you.
[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:24.020]   When God commands you to forgive, whether that person ever says sorry, whether that
[00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:28.620]   person ever acts better, whether that person ever does more nice things for you or not,
[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:33.020]   even if they continue to abuse you, continue to criticize you, continue to pull you down,
[00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:34.020]   it does not matter.
[00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:37.780]   The command is still for you to find a place in your life to forgive them.
[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:39.580]   So forgiveness is an event.
[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:40.580]   It's a command.
[00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:41.580]   It's something we do.
[00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:43.660]   Reconciliation though, Paul writes this.
[00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:44.660]   He says it's a ministry.
[00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:48.580]   It's not a command, a ministry because it takes two people.
[00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:50.300]   No longer are you solely responsible.
[00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:54.100]   You're solely responsible for the forgiveness in your heart, but you can't be solely responsible
[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:56.060]   for reconciliation around a table.
[00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:58.480]   That involves another's free choice.
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:02.740]   You may end up sitting at the table and they never take their seat.
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:06.380]   We have to recognize that reconciliation is a process that we go through.
[00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:08.620]   And sometimes it takes a lot longer than we might like.
[00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:12.860]   It's not always that one meal and suddenly it's rainbows and My Little Ponies.
[00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:15.740]   It takes hard work sometimes.
[00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:20.480]   It takes time to allow the conversations to be what they are.
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:24.660]   Some of you just need to allow yourself to be in a process.
[00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:29.740]   Maybe stop kind of putting that expectation on yourself that it needs to be fixed by now
[00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:31.500]   and recognize you're in a process.
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:36.420]   And as long as both of you are working into that process, then you can believe that restoration
[00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:37.900]   and reconciliation can come.
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:39.060]   And here's the last thing.
[00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:40.980]   Do it over a meal.
[00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:42.460]   Literally do it over a meal.
[00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:46.900]   There's something quite powerful in the reality of sitting down for an hour and a half with
[00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:51.860]   someone, having some unhurried time and inviting them to a meal and having a conversation with
[00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:54.560]   them about the things that you haven't been able to have a conversation with.
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:57.060]   The reason why it's great around a table is because you can't run away.
[00:33:57.060 --> 00:34:01.080]   Well, you can, but generally people don't run away, right?
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:04.500]   It's over food, so there's usually other talk and conversation.
[00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:06.140]   There's an enjoyment together.
[00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:10.460]   And yet then there's that open space for that conversation to happen.
[00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:15.060]   I want to challenge you, invite you to invite somebody out for a meal this week that you
[00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:16.660]   need to show calm with.
[00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:25.380]   I'm a bit nervous saying that because I might get a lot of invitations this week for dinner.
[00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:33.140]   Who is it that God might be asking you today to invite to a meal so that you can sit down
[00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:37.980]   and not gloat at them for 45 minutes, but actually do what this passage encourages us
[00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:39.940]   to do and reconcile?
[00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:46.260]   Could you imagine a Hong Kong where there were no enemies?
[00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:51.140]   Could you imagine your family where divisions are restored?
[00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:57.620]   Could you imagine your workplace where it's a place of family and community and life and
[00:34:57.620 --> 00:34:59.800]   not draining every moment of your life?
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:03.700]   Could you imagine what it would feel like for you if you were able to be a non-anxious
[00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:05.820]   presence in the chaos of this world?
[00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:13.100]   And the only way that will happen is if you embrace the table.
[00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:17.260]   The Holy Spirit is basically saying to you today, "I've set a table before you in the
[00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:21.620]   presence of your enemies, and your head could be anointed with oil.
[00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:23.420]   Your cup could overflow.
[00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:26.220]   You could be that non-anxious presence in a chaotic world.
[00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:30.620]   The question is, will you sit down?"
[00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:34.660]   Can we pray together?
[00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:37.220]   Let's pray.
[00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:44.900]   Holy Spirit, we're grateful for your presence, grateful for the holy ground that you prepared
[00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:50.220]   for us today, and we're grateful for this topic that's not easy.
[00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:55.100]   And Lord, I want to pray now over every person here.
[00:35:55.100 --> 00:36:01.300]   Lord, each one of us has broken relationships in our lives.
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:10.140]   Each one of us has areas in our lives where we have enemies, people that we've hurt, people
[00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:12.460]   that have hurt us.
[00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:19.860]   Each one of us knows what it's like to carry the stress of relationships that are in turmoil.
[00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:26.380]   And just like last week, you don't promise the immediate end to all of those things.
[00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:34.860]   But what you're offering us today is a sobering thing, that because you have reconciled with
[00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:43.340]   us who were once your enemies, you now are empowering us in the kingdom to offer reconciliation
[00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:46.860]   to those around us.
[00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:56.940]   And Lord, there is nothing that is more liberating than us being at peace with those that we
[00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:59.700]   were once at enmity with.
[00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:02.220]   Holy Spirit, I want to pray, Lord.
[00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:06.540]   I love the fact that in this verse, David says, "It's like oil flowing over me.
[00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:10.020]   It's like my cup never is dry.
[00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:13.500]   That's what it feels like when I'm reconciled with my enemies," David is saying.
[00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:16.500]   It's like this constant place of blessing.
[00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:19.100]   It's like the world is just as it should be.
[00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:23.460]   It's like my fear and my anxiety has been stripped apart from me, and I'm finding myself
[00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:25.980]   back in that relationship again.
[00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:27.180]   There's shalom.
[00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:28.180]   There's peace.
[00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:29.180]   There's grace.
[00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:30.180]   There's love.
[00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:32.860]   And my cup overflows.
[00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:35.580]   David wants you to experience that kind of life.
[00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:39.460]   Jesus wants you to experience that kind of life.
[00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:43.500]   That's why he said to you, "Love your enemy."
[00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:54.500]   That's why he said to you, "There is possible to have a world free from rocks, sincere hearts,
[00:37:54.500 --> 00:38:00.100]   holy ground, intimacy with God and with others, so we might be a non-anxious presence in the
[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:02.020]   chaos of this world."
[00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:04.420]   Holy Spirit, I pray for courage.
[00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:07.700]   In fact, I wonder whether you'd just stand with me for a second.
[00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:12.420]   I want to pray one final thing as we just finish our time, as we go back into worship.
[00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:16.100]   But I feel to pray this over you as you stand.
[00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:19.540]   If this is an important word for you this morning, would you just, whether you're online
[00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:20.940]   as well, just open your hands.
[00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:26.900]   I want to pray what we prayed right at the start of this message.
[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:31.620]   Lord for the people here standing before you with their hands open, I pray.
[00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:33.620]   Holy Spirit, would you come.
[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:39.180]   Father, would you enable them to be strong and courageous in this area of their life.
[00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:40.180]   Lord I want to pray.
[00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:42.660]   Lord, every single one of us have different personalities.
[00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:44.460]   For some of us, we love to run into conflict.
[00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:48.220]   For some of us, we run as far away from conflict as possible.
[00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:53.340]   Holy Spirit, I pray for the Spirit-infused courage that is needed right now, for the
[00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:56.060]   conversations that lie ahead of these people this week.
[00:38:56.060 --> 00:39:01.780]   I want to pray for boldness and courage and grace to sit down with people that they have
[00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:05.700]   long not sat down with, maybe ignored or avoided.
[00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:08.780]   Lord, I pray that you would give them the right words, Lord.
[00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:15.140]   I want to ask for grace to be in those conversations, a grace that fills our lips so that our starting
[00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:20.380]   point is I'm a contributor to this too, and I don't want to walk around with this burden
[00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:21.380]   anymore.
[00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:23.540]   I don't want to walk around with this anxiety anymore.
[00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:27.180]   I want us to reach out, and I don't know if this is something you're going to respond
[00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:32.980]   to or not, but I just need to say this, that I forgive you, I forgive myself, and let's
[00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:35.300]   try to make something work here together.
[00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:38.220]   Lord, I pray for the courage for that conversation.
[00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:43.020]   I pray for the grace that will be needed in the words of that conversation, and I pray
[00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:52.020]   for the humility, and I also pray for a releasing of the anointing and the blessing that those
[00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:54.420]   conversations create.
[00:39:54.420 --> 00:40:00.860]   You have set before us a table in the presence of our enemies.
[00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:04.940]   Lord, may our heads overflow with oil.
[00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:14.300]   May our cup constantly be spilling out as we experience the beauty of your forgiveness
[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:18.340]   and our forgiveness with others.
[00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:22.420]   May we stay in this place of just receiving from Him as we close our time with a little
[00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:23.180]   bit more worship together.
[00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:23.680]   Thank you.
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:29.680]   [music]
