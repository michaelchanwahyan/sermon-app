[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   >>
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   Welcome everyone and welcome to everyone
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:05.540]   joining us online.
[00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.780]   Some weeks ago
[00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.780]   one of my daughters, my son and I
[00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.820]   were returning home.
[00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.820]   As we came up to our apartment building
[00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.860]   you have to scan
[00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.220]   your Octopus card to get in.
[00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.200]   It is specially linked.
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.160]   In previous years
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.900]   if you were a family unit and you were coming in
[00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.500]   you had to zap your card
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.500]   and you could all enter.
[00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.980]   Lately they have gotten really strict
[00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.540]   and they have been wanting everyone
[00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.340]   to touch their card as they come in.
[00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.080]   As we came up to the doorway
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.420]   my son and daughter were in front of me.
[00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.420]   I was behind them
[00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.580]   and I had my earphones in and I was watching
[00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.620]   on my phone
[00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.560]   one of the loves of my life, rugby.
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.520]   I was completely immersed
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.560]   in this game
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.200]   and my two children were in front of me
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.200]   and they both went and zapped their cards
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.140]   and I just followed in behind them.
[00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.040]   I did not zap my card.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.880]   The elderly security guard
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.080]   saw me and he pointed at the machine
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.980]   like you need to zap your card.
[00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.740]   I ignored him
[00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.780]   and kept walking
[00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.280]   and I pointed to my son and daughter like I am
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.520]   with them.
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.060]   I must have made a noise
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.140]   and it must have been
[00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.080]   a little bit loud
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.640]   because my son immediately turned around
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.040]   to me and he said
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.080]   that was really rude.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.160]   When Andrew
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.860]   asked me to speak on this message
[00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.320]   of living a life worthy of the calling of God
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.120]   and I am somebody
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.020]   that is still being held accountable
[00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.400]   in the way I walk and live by my son
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.160]   I was like
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.060]   writing back to Andrew
[00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.600]   going I will do this but you need to know
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.340]   that this is very much something
[00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.840]   that I am wrestling with
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.600]   and I am a work in progress.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.140]   He replied back to me
[00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.280]   and said yes,
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.340]   that is the honesty
[00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.340]   that we need.
[00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.940]   Today I will be sharing with you
[00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.020]   some things
[00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.680]   that are at work within me
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.880]   and I hope that they will be an encouragement
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.980]   to you as well.
[00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:25.980]   Let's read Ephesians 4
[00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.020]   verses 1-10
[00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.560]   as a prisoner for the Lord
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.320]   I urge you to live a life
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.520]   worthy of the calling
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.460]   you have received.
[00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.620]   Be completely humble and gentle
[00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.700]   and be patient
[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.260]   and bearing with one another in love.
[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.560]   Make every effort to keep the unity of the
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.240]   spirit through the bond of peace.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.240]   There is one body and one spirit
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.680]   just as you were called
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.880]   to one hope
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.880]   when you were called.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.520]   One Lord, one faith, one baptism
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.440]   one God and father of all
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.440]   who is overall
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.480]   and through all
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.480]   and in all.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.060]   But to each one of us,
[00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.120]   grace has been given
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.120]   as Christ apportioned it.
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.320]   This is why it says
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.660]   when he ascended on high
[00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:13.720]   he took many captives
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.760]   and gave gifts
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.760]   to his children.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.960]   What does he ascended mean
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.500]   except that he also descended
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.000]   to the lower earthly regions?
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.040]   He who descended
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.140]   is the very one
[00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.160]   who ascended
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.640]   higher than all the heavens
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.740]   in order to fill
[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.740]   the whole universe.
[00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.280]   I would like to focus first
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.280]   on Ephesians 4 verse 1
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.580]   as a prisoner for the Lord
[00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.440]   then I urge you
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.020]   to live a life worthy
[00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.020]   of the calling
[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.020]   you have received.
[00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.280]   The new King James Version
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.640]   says I therefore
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:49.680]   the prisoner of the Lord
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.720]   beseech you
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.740]   to walk worthy
[00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:52.780]   of the calling
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:53.820]   with which you are called.
[00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:54.840]   What word or words
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.880]   do you focus on
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:56.920]   when you hear
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.960]   these verses?
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:00.980]   My eyes get drawn
[00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.020]   to the word worthy.
[00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.060]   Walk worthy, live worthy.
[00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.100]   And lately I found myself
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.100]   measuring myself
[00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.100]   and asking myself
[00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.140]   am I living a life
[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.140]   worthy of the calling
[00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.160]   I have received?
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.200]   Am I living a life
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.200]   worthy of the calling
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.200]   I have received?
[00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:17.660]   And I'm asking myself
[00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:18.700]   am I living a life
[00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.720]   that is worthy enough?
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.760]   At times I've felt guilty
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:23.800]   because I feel like
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.840]   I've not been doing enough.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.860]   That there are expectations
[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.900]   I'm not fulfilling.
[00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:30.940]   I've wrestled with
[00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:31.980]   whether my life
[00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.000]   is turning out
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.040]   the way
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.080]   God intended it to.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.120]   I wonder if there's
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.140]   anyone here this morning
[00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.180]   that's asked
[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.220]   a similar question.
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.240]   Is my life
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.280]   turning out
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.320]   the way
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.360]   I intended it to?
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.380]   Recently on one of my
[00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.400]   bus commutes to school
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.420]   and as you know
[00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.440]   if you've heard me
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.480]   preach before
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.500]   there's always something
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.540]   from my bus commutes
[00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.580]   to school.
[00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:56.600]   I felt God
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.620]   shift my focus
[00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.640]   in the verse
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.660]   away from the word
[00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:01.680]   worthy
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.720]   to the words
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.740]   walk and live.
[00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:05.760]   God reminded me
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.780]   in a profound way
[00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:07.800]   that our worthiness
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.820]   has nothing to do
[00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.860]   with us.
[00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:12.880]   We cannot do
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:13.900]   anything
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.920]   to walk
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.940]   more worthy
[00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:16.960]   or live
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.980]   more worthy.
[00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.000]   We have
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.020]   been made
[00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.040]   worthy
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.060]   through an
[00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.080]   act of
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.100]   grace.
[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.120]   An undeserved
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.140]   lavish
[00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.160]   gift
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.200]   of love.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.220]   I'll say it
[00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.240]   again,
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.260]   our worthiness
[00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.300]   has nothing
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.320]   to do
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.340]   with us.
[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.360]   It has
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.400]   everything to do
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.420]   with a precious
[00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.440]   gift of a
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.460]   son
[00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:41.480]   whose perfection
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.500]   and goodness
[00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:43.540]   covers us
[00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:44.560]   as we walk
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.580]   out
[00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:46.600]   our
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.620]   sanctification
[00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:48.640]   journey.
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.680]   Paul spends
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.700]   the first
[00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:51.740]   half
[00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:52.780]   of his
[00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:53.800]   letter
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.820]   going into
[00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:55.840]   extravagant
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:56.880]   detail
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:57.920]   of the
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.940]   wondrous
[00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:59.980]   things God
[00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.020]   has done
[00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.040]   for us.
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.080]   He chose
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.120]   us.
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.160]   In love
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.180]   he adopted
[00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.220]   us.
[00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.260]   All of this
[00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:09.280]   freely given
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.320]   by God's
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.360]   extravagant
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.400]   grace.
[00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.420]   Our eyes
[00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:14.460]   might be
[00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:15.500]   drawn to
[00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.520]   this word
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.560]   worthy and
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.600]   for some
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.640]   of us it
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.660]   may have
[00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:21.700]   made you
[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:22.740]   feel
[00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:23.760]   disqualified.
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:24.800]   But this is
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.840]   not what
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:26.880]   this verse
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:27.900]   is about.
[00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:28.900]   It is not
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:29.940]   what Paul
[00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:30.940]   was trying
[00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:31.980]   to convey.
[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.020]   Commentators
[00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.020]   believe that
[00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.040]   Paul was
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.040]   under house
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.080]   arrest in
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.120]   Rome when
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.160]   he wrote
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.180]   this letter.
[00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.220]   He was
[00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:42.260]   unable to
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.280]   use their
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.320]   freedom
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.360]   to walk
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.400]   and live
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.420]   worthy of
[00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:48.460]   the calling
[00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:49.500]   they had
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.520]   received.
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.560]   To walk and
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.600]   live in the
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.640]   calling of
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.660]   God has
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:55.700]   nothing to
[00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:56.740]   do with
[00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:57.760]   our worthiness.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:58.780]   The calling
[00:06:58.780 --> 00:06:59.800]   is worthy.
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.800]   Our primary
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.840]   calling is to
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:02.880]   be in a
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.900]   personal
[00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:04.940]   relationship with
[00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:05.980]   God.
[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.020]   To be a
[00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.020]   son or
[00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.040]   a daughter
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.080]   of God.
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.120]   If we
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.160]   have received
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.180]   this
[00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:14.220]   calling,
[00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:15.260]   we have
[00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:16.280]   been made
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.320]   worthy.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.360]   So Paul's
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.400]   focus was not
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.420]   to call the
[00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.460]   people to
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:22.500]   worthiness.
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.500]   This had
[00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.520]   already been
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.560]   achieved by
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.600]   them receiving
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.640]   and responding
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:28.660]   to God's
[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:29.700]   call to be
[00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:30.740]   in relationship
[00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:31.780]   with him.
[00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:32.780]   Paul was
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:33.800]   urging them,
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:34.840]   beseeching
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:35.880]   them.
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:36.900]   This word
[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:37.940]   means to
[00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:38.980]   ask someone
[00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.020]   urgently or
[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.040]   fervently to
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.080]   do something.
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.120]   He was
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.140]   imploring
[00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:45.180]   them to
[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:46.180]   walk in
[00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:47.220]   it, live
[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:48.260]   it out,
[00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.280]   do something
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.320]   with it.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.360]   Under house
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.360]   arrest, Paul
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.400]   was well
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.420]   aware that
[00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:55.460]   his ability
[00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:56.500]   to walk and
[00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:57.600]   live out his
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.600]   calling had
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.640]   been somewhat
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:00.640]   limited.
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:01.440]   His imprisonment
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.360]   had opened
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.500]   his eyes to
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.440]   how necessary
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.440]   it was to
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.540]   live out his
[00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:07.580]   calling.
[00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:08.600]   He was
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.600]   imploring them
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.680]   to walk in
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.880]   it, live
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:12.920]   it out, do
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:13.840]   something with
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:14.840]   it.
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:15.840]   How necessary
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.880]   it was that
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:17.920]   God's people
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:18.940]   did not waste
[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:19.980]   their freedom,
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:20.720]   their opportunity
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.760]   to do something
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:22.780]   with this
[00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:23.820]   incredible gift,
[00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:24.860]   this incredible
[00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:25.880]   calling they
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:26.920]   had received.
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:27.960]   So in
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.000]   summation of
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   this first
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.020]   verse, the
[00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.060]   calling is
[00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:33.100]   worthy.
[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.100]   The calling is
[00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.140]   worthy of our
[00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.160]   attention.
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.200]   You do not
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.240]   have to be
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.280]   worthy.
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.300]   In fact, you
[00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:41.340]   cannot ever
[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:42.380]   be worthy of
[00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:43.400]   the calling of
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.440]   God.
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.440]   You cannot
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.480]   be worthy of
