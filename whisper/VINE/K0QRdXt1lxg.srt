1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,280
 I want to share a word or a picture that we received in the first service.

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,740
 So as your hands are open before the Lord, it's a posture of just being ready to receive

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,820
 what it is that he has on his heart for you here on the first Sunday of 2025.

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:20,020
 We believe no one's in this room, no one's in the overflow, no one's watching online

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,540
 by mistake in this moment.

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:27,100
 Wherever you are, whatever's going on, the Lord knew you would be here in this moment.

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:33,140
 And he has something to say to you, whether just in the worship time, whether in the message,

8
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:39,220
 whether in our prayer ministry time, but he's excited that you're here.

9
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:45,660
 Whether you feel a long way away from him or whether you are rejoicing in your relationship

10
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,820
 with him.

11
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,140
 In the first service, we saw a picture, somebody from the congregation had a picture of a little

12
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:58,660
 bamboo seed being planted in soil to grow a bamboo tree, a bamboo plant.

13
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:04,380
 And they planted this seed, but they didn't realize that bamboo plants take a long time

14
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,380
 to actually bud.

15
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:12,660
 Apparently it takes about seven years for a bamboo seed to finally come up above the

16
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,660
 soil.

17
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:17,540
 And what it's doing in those seven years is spreading its roots out.

18
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:21,380
 It's putting its roots far and wide just by the surface of the soil so that whenever the

19
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,140
 rain comes, it can easily receive.

20
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,900
 And it's not until about seven years that the first of the buds of the bamboo stalk

21
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,580
 appear on the surface of the ground.

22
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:37,220
 And we felt that as the Lord gave us this picture, that for some of us, it feels like

23
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:42,860
 it's been a long time, perhaps a long time of dryness, perhaps a long time before you've

24
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,780
 seen any fruit.

25
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,660
 Perhaps you've been praying, perhaps you've been working, perhaps you've been expecting,

26
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:53,060
 you've been faithful.

27
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:57,940
 But what you planted in faith a long time ago seems to have not come to fruition.

28
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:03,220
 And the Holy Spirit would say to you today that sometimes things take a little bit longer

29
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,980
 than you expect.

30
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,900
 Sometimes things have to go deeper.

31
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,380
 Sometimes roots have to be placed.

32
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:17,060
 So that when the future happens and when the winds blow and the weather comes, that you

33
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,140
 have that solid ground.

34
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,900
 Jesus shared something similar in a parable once, didn't he?

35
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,540
 He said, "Those who hear my word and obey it, they're ones who put their feet on solid

36
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,620
 rock, not on shifting sand."

37
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:35,540
 Some of you who feel like the Lord is a long way away, he's been at work putting roots

38
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,220
 into you.

39
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:41,180
 Some of you who have been wondering why there hasn't been some fruit, I believe that you're

40
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:45,180
 about to step into a season of great fruit.

41
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,860
 And sometimes we don't see the things that the Holy Spirit sees.

42
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,700
 Sometimes no matter how faithful, how much prayer, how much hope, sometimes we do not

43
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,020
 see the things that God sees.

44
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:00,500
 And I want to just pray over you at the first Sunday of 2025 that the eyes of your heart

45
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,460
 would be enlightened as Paul prays to the church in Ephesus.

46
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:09,180
 That the eyes of your heart would become enlightened, that you would see the things that you currently

47
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,900
 do not see.

48
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,540
 I want to say that as a prophetic word over us here at the Vine this morning.

49
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:20,620
 That 2025 will be a year that some of us, all of us I hope, will see the things that

50
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,700
 we currently do not see.

51
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,920
 That we would see with eyes of hope, with eyes of faith.

52
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,980
 We would see with renewed vision.

53
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,980
 We would see the things that have been planted long ago, we would suddenly see fruition.

54
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,540
 Even some of the things that we forgot that we'd planted.

55
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,900
 Some of the old prayers, some of the old dreams, some of the things that we've laid aside,

56
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:43,300
 that we're actually going to see the birthing, the budding, the flourishing, the fruit of

57
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,760
 those old dreams, old prayers, old promises.

58
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,340
 We declare it so in the name of Jesus.

59
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,740
 And Father, we are grateful that we stand before a living God.

60
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:59,800
 That at the beginning of 2025, we're not praying to some statue.

61
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,760
 We're not praying to an idol.

62
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,800
 We're not praying to a philosophy.

63
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,860
 We're praying to a God who is alive and present in this world.

64
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:13,080
 We're praying to a God who is here in this room, who is with us always.

65
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:18,380
 We're praying to a God who cares, who loves, who renews, who deepens us.

66
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:26,060
 And so Lord, I want to pray that the living Spirit, in the name of Jesus, the living Spirit,

67
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,320
 would set fire in the hearts of everybody here at The Vine in 2025.

68
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,860
 We need it, Lord.

69
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,620
 Hong Kong needs it, Lord.

70
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,860
 We're not satisfied.

71
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,860
 Come on, church.

72
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,480
 We're not satisfied with what we see in our city, Lord.

73
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,460
 We love our city.

74
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,100
 We love the people of this city.

75
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,020
 We love the leaders of this city.

76
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,540
 We love the government of this city.

77
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:53,420
 But Lord, we want to see things that we do not currently see in the Spirit and in the

78
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,700
 physical in this place, Lord.

79
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,140
 And so Father, we pray that you would raise up a church, Lord.

80
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:03,500
 You would raise up a church this year, Lord, who would have eyes of faith to believe in

81
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,380
 the greater things, Lord.

82
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:09,360
 Who would look at the challenges and say, "That is nothing for my God."

83
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,720
 Who would say, "Hey, even if the fire burns me, I will still not give up on my God."

84
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,760
 Who would say, "Hey, even if the waters don't seem to part, I'm going to step my foot out

85
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,760
 into the stream."

86
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:27,640
 Father, you are the one who is holy forever.

87
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:31,040
 And Lord, we pray that you would light a fire in us.

88
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,960
 I want to say that again.

89
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:40,520
 Lord, I want to pray that you would light a fire in us for your Word, that your Word

90
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,840
 would come alive in us like never before, for your Spirit, that we would hunger and

91
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:52,440
 thirst for righteousness, for your justice, for the poor and the vulnerable and the marginalized.

92
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:58,880
 Lord, you'd light a fire in us for the gospel and that we would see Hong Kong receive the

93
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,600
 gospel in 2025 like never before.

94
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,080
 And we pray this in Jesus' name.

95
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,080
 Everyone says, "Amen."

96
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,760
 Hey, why don't you take a seat?

97
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,340
 Why don't you say hi to someone?

98
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,560
 Maybe they weren't standing with you when you started, but they're with you now.

99
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,340
 Say hi to them.

100
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,340
 Welcome them.

101
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:23,600
 Well, I'm so glad you're here.

102
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,600
 Welcome to the Vine.

103
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,600
 My name is Andrew.

104
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,320
 I'm one of the pastors here, and we're really grateful that you're here on the first Sunday

105
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,320
 of 2025.

106
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,320
 Can you believe 2025?

107
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:37,320
 Allison said to us this morning that there are people that are just being born recently

108
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,320
 who will see the year 3000.

109
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,720
 Get your head around that.

110
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,440
 Okay, only that blew me away.

111
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,440
 Okay, whatever.

112
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,920
 I just thought that was cool.

113
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,080
 My daughter might see the year 3000.

114
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,320
 Anyway, I really believe as we're stepping into 2025, I really believe this.

115
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,360
 We're about to begin what I believe is going to be the most significant year in the Vine's

116
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,680
 history.

117
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,640
 I have so much excitement in my heart, so much longing for what I sense that God wants

118
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,640
 to do amongst us.

119
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,840
 I believe that this will be our most significant year in the history of this church.

120
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,840
 I want to say this.

121
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,680
 I think it's going to be your most significant year too, because the church isn't an institution.

122
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,120
 It's not an organization, although we sometimes need those things in the fabric and structures

123
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,120
 of churches.

124
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,640
 But the church, if it's anything, is the people.

125
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:29,360
 And I believe that this can be, will be, and I'll say it in a prophetic way over you, your

126
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,240
 most significant year ever.

127
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,240
 And I don't know how you feel as you step into 2025.

128
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,720
 Perhaps some of you in here, you feel excited and expectant.

129
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,600
 Maybe some of you feel cautious.

130
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,520
 Maybe you're a bit careful as you step in.

131
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,960
 Maybe 2024 was a difficult, challenging year, and you're not sure how 2025 is going to go,

132
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,120
 and you're sort of tentatively stepping into the year.

133
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,440
 Maybe you're stepping into this year with excitement, or whether you're a little bit

134
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,440
 cautious.

135
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,240
 Here's what I do know.

136
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:06,240
 That the God that we worship and we serve is a God whose primary purpose is the movement

137
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,280
 of God's people forward into a deeper relationship with Jesus Christ.

138
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:18,400
 The primary focus that we have from God is to move his people forward to become more

139
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,120
 and more like Christ Jesus.

140
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:27,400
 And if that is true, then surely this year has every chance to be your most significant

141
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,440
 year ever, because we don't serve a God who's going backwards.

142
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,680
 Come on, church.

143
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,800
 We don't serve a God who's heading back somewhere.

144
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:42,120
 We serve a God who always moves forward, and therefore the church is always moving forward.

145
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:47,400
 And actually the work of the Spirit is always to come and transform and change us.

146
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:52,560
 Yes, so that we are transformed, but almost more than that, so that we would become an

147
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:58,200
 influence in our city, in our workplaces, in the places that we have an influence for

148
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,480
 his kingdom, for the gospel, for the hope that is in Christ Jesus.

149
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:10,080
 In other words, God changes you so that you can partner with him in changing the world.

150
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,000
 And I want you to hear this not in some sort of puffed up kind of, "Oh, it's the new year.

151
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,480
 We're going to change the world."

152
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,840
 Only Jesus changes the world.

153
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,320
 You don't change the world.

154
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,160
 Jesus changes the world.

155
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,840
 But here's the most profound thing.

156
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:27,520
 It is Jesus that changes the world, but he's decided to do it through the church, through

157
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,560
 us, through broken vessels, through the ones that don't always have the answers, through

158
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,120
 the ones that don't always get it right, through the ones that have sin and are wrestling with

159
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,120
 sin.

160
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,440
 God has decided in his infinite wisdom to choose the broken vessels of this world to

161
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:47,080
 bring his spirit and his hope and his gospel into the world.

162
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:51,640
 And if God is moving forward, oh, how we should be moving forward.

163
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:56,160
 We should be a church with momentum, a church on the go.

164
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,720
 And so however you feel as you step into this year, and let's be honest, 2025, there's going

165
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,960
 to be some challenges.

166
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,640
 We know that there are challenges in the world right now geopolitically, and perhaps they're

167
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,740
 going to get worse as we go forward.

168
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,540
 And maybe you recognize that there are some challenges and some struggles in your own

169
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,820
 life right now.

170
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,860
 This is personal for you.

171
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,880
 You also feel personal challenges, whatever challenges you might be facing.

172
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,580
 We cannot start this year in retreat.

173
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:30,660
 We cannot start this year defeated because if our God is a God of momentum, moving his

174
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:35,740
 people forward to become more like Christ Jesus, then surely we have to start this year

175
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,740
 saying I'm ready to go.

176
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,740
 Okay.

177
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,740
 Try that again.

178
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,740
 No, I won't.

179
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:44,740
 I'm not even going to try it again.

180
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,740
 Okay.

181
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,740
 We're just going to carry on.

182
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,740
 Now, listen to this.

183
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:54,100
 If we're going to be a church in Hong Kong that takes the gospel seriously in 2025, we

184
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,260
 have to take Jesus's word seriously.

185
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:02,300
 And Jesus, right at the end of his life, gathers his disciples up on that mountain, doesn't

186
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,300
 he?

187
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:07,260
 And before his ascension, he's resurrected, so he's in his resurrection power, but it's

188
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:11,660
 before he ascends and he gathers his most faithful disciples around him.

189
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,020
 There were 11 of them at that time.

190
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,420
 And he speaks into them and he says these words.

191
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,340
 He says, "All authority on heaven and earth has been given to me.

192
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,700
 So now stay here."

193
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,700
 No, he didn't say that.

194
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,900
 He did say that in a minute because he said, "Stay and wait for the Holy Spirit."

195
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,900
 But in this moment, he says, "Now go.

196
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,900
 Go.

197
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,900
 I'm sending you," he says.

198
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,700
 And you want to know what I'm sending you to do?

199
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:35,100
 He says, "I want you to make disciples of all the nations and I want you to baptize

200
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,180
 them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

201
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:41,460
 And then I want you to teach them to obey everything that I've commanded you.

202
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,460
 And here's the kicker.

203
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,000
 I will be with you.

204
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,220
 Every step of the way, I will be with you."

205
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:52,340
 So Jesus is, one of his last words to his disciples is, "I have all authority and power.

206
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,420
 So here's what I'm saying to you as the church.

207
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,100
 I want you to go.

208
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,700
 I want you to go forward in that authority and power that is invested into you through

209
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,220
 the work of the Holy Spirit."

210
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,820
 That's why he says, "Wait and jurisdict until you receive the Holy Spirit.

211
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,020
 Once you have that Holy Spirit, you are to go."

212
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,540
 And so we must be a church on the move.

213
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,540
 Does that make sense?

214
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,820
 A church with mission.

215
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:18,900
 So if 2025 is anything for the vine, it should be a year of action.

216
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:23,100
 Now I want to just say that this is not some new calling for us.

217
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:28,080
 This is not like some new vision or some fresh idea at the start of the year.

218
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,940
 This has actually been birthed by the Holy Spirit in our community over multiple years

219
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,140
 of what the Lord's been doing amongst us.

220
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,120
 In fact, I want to actually pull the threads together a little bit this morning and help

221
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,620
 you to see what the Holy Spirit has been doing in us as a community.

222
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,880
 In 2022, we felt called to heal.

223
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,020
 It was right off the back of COVID.

224
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,860
 And we felt like the Holy Spirit said to us, "2022 is going to be a year of healing, a

225
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:55,340
 year of gathering back together for the first time after all that pandemic, after all the

226
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:59,900
 social distancing, even after the social movement that had happened in 2019 and 2020, as we

227
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:03,900
 gathered back together physically for the first time in 2022, we knew that we were being

228
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:08,260
 called to heal, that all of us were carrying some baggage.

229
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,580
 In fact, one of the things that we said to us that year is that we need to shake the

230
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,580
 dust off.

231
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:16,780
 We all had gotten a little bit dusty and it was great to get back together again in 2022.

232
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,980
 Then in 2023, we felt God call us to Exodus.

233
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:24,900
 We actually spent a whole year pretty much studying the book of Exodus in Scripture.

234
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:29,260
 And in that book, we saw so many profound, important things for us as Christians, how

235
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:34,420
 God wants to bring us on a journey out of our slavery to sin into newness and freedom,

236
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,020
 into a promised land that He has given to us.

237
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:41,100
 And we taught that year that Hong Kong is that promised land for us, and that we need

238
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:46,660
 to be an Exodus people, people that have been called out of slavery of sin into new life

239
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:51,380
 in Christ so that we can enter our promised land and do the things that God has on His

240
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,540
 heart for us to do.

241
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,540
 That was 2023.

242
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:57,780
 But then in 2024, we said, "God is calling us to intimacy."

243
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,180
 That was the word we had for us as a church that whole year.

244
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,740
 Now, that made sense because you know what happened in Exodus.

245
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:08,060
 God calls these people out of their slavery into sin, and He calls them out in order to

246
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,940
 call them in to His presence on Mount Sinai.

247
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:13,100
 Remember that if you're around here in 2023?

248
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:18,420
 We were called out of our slavery in to His presence around Mount Sinai.

249
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:23,860
 And so it followed that a year of Exodus would follow in 2024 to a year of intimacy.

250
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:28,980
 And we invited you to connect deeply with God, to have time with Jesus, to make it a

251
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,140
 priority to fall more in love with Christ.

252
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,900
 I had the blessing of having a sabbatical last year.

253
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,740
 And so that was a great way for me to do that.

254
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,460
 And I know that many of us did that in lots of different ways.

255
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,660
 It was a year of intimacy.

256
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,800
 But here's the important thing.

257
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,180
 As a leadership, even though we discern that God was calling us into intimacy, we knew

258
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:50,880
 that that intimacy was actually on behalf of a bigger purpose.

259
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:56,180
 And while it was important that we would connect with Jesus, fall more in love with Him, spend

260
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:01,300
 more time with Him last year, it was always on behalf of something else.

261
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,900
 What you have to understand in Scripture is that intimacy is a platform, not a destination.

262
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,100
 Come on, church.

263
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,920
 Intimacy is a platform, not a destination.

264
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,740
 Jesus actually said in John 15, where we get the name of the vine from, the very passage

265
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:18,700
 that we get it from, He says, "If you abide in Me, you will bear much fruit."

266
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:23,620
 In other words, there's stuff that will happen out of the intimacy you have with Me.

267
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:29,780
 So intimacy is this platform through which and from which we are able to serve.

268
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:33,740
 If we serve without the intimacy, we will burn out.

269
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:39,500
 But if we abide in Him, we are able to do more in our city, more in the world around

270
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,460
 us out of that abiding in Him.

271
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,260
 So intimacy is a platform, not a destination.

272
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,780
 Does that make sense to you?

273
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:51,980
 So that is why as we head into 2025, we knew that intimacy was not always going to be there.

274
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:55,960
 We knew that actually this year is a call to action.

275
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:00,620
 This is to take that fruit that hopefully every single one of us has received last year

276
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:06,460
 and begin to sow that fruit into our workplaces, into the places of influence that we have,

277
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,860
 into the city that we love so much.

278
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:12,980
 We are called this year out of intimacy into action.

279
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,580
 That doesn't mean that we let go of intimacy.

280
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,460
 It doesn't mean that that was a 2024 thing.

281
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,420
 You don't need to be intimate with Jesus anymore.

282
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:24,540
 We have to abide in Him, remain in Him, but we have to shift our mentality from just being

283
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:30,740
 with Him to being with Him for a purpose, being with Him so that we can partner with

284
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,140
 Him to change the world.

285
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,020
 Does that make sense to you?

286
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:37,740
 Okay, now that flow is where our challenge lies.

287
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,380
 Here's the challenge.

288
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:46,680
 It's not easy to go from intimacy to action because intimacy is good.

289
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,220
 Intimacy is comfortable.

290
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,780
 Intimacy is awesome.

291
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:54,060
 It was great to stand up last year and say, "Hey, be more intimate with Jesus."

292
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,740
 You were all like, "Yes!"

293
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,780
 Now I'm standing up and saying, "Hey, take the gospel to your workplace."

294
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:03,420
 And you're like, "Hmm, that's a little bit different, right?"

295
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:08,380
 It's easier to remain in a place of intimacy because intimacy is awesome, it's comfortable,

296
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:13,140
 it's good, but then stepping out of intimacy into action, that requires a shift.

297
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,980
 That requires something new.

298
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,860
 That's not a straightforward transition.

299
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:20,680
 And so here's what we want to do at the start of 2025.

300
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:26,540
 If God is calling us to a year of action, then how do we go from intimacy to action

301
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,540
 well?

302
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,900
 And over the next four Sundays, we're going to actually explore that with you.

303
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,260
 And we're going to look at Samuel and David.

304
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,300
 The reason why we're looking at Samuel and David in the Old Testament is because they

305
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:40,120
 both went through times of intimacy into action in their lives.

306
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,460
 And so we're going to see how they do that transition to help us understand ours.

307
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:51,060
 But also, they go through what I would say are mindset changes in order to do the things

308
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,980
 that God has called them to do.

309
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:58,980
 They had old mindsets that they needed to let go of in order to embrace a new mindset

310
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,420
 to be able to do what it is that God had for them to do.

311
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,260
 And I think it's the same also for us.

312
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:10,020
 I think we need some mindset changes as we step into 2025 for the things that God has

313
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,820
 for the vine to do in its future.

314
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:16,460
 And again, by that, has for you to do in your sphere of influence.

315
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,100
 And so we're going to talk about four things.

316
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,820
 Next week, we're going to talk about having the right choices.

317
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,340
 We'll talk about choices.

318
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:25,100
 A week after that, we're going to talk about having the right kind of resources in our

319
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,860
 lives and how we're using those resources.

320
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:30,340
 We're going to talk about after that, the right community and the people that we have

321
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,340
 around us.

322
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,660
 Are they the right people that we have around us?

323
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:37,760
 And then finally, or actually today, we're going to talk about having the right start.

324
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,540
 How do we actually begin?

325
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,020
 How do we get our starting point right?

326
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,400
 Because here's the thing.

327
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,380
 If you don't start from the right place, you're going to easily drift.

328
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,420
 How do we make sure we're all starting in exactly the place that we should start?

329
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,620
 The question is, how do we begin?

330
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:01,100
 Well, let me tell you something that I think is really important as we begin to think about

331
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,020
 a mindset shift.

332
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:10,660
 Psychologists, counselors, therapists, they will tell you that there are five emotional

333
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:15,580
 barriers that all of us have, or all of us struggle with at some point.

334
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:23,020
 Five emotional barriers that actually block us, inhibit us, stop us from moving forward

335
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,540
 in whatever it might be in our human life.

336
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:29,940
 Whether that might be moving forward into a new job, moving forward into a new relationship,

337
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,740
 moving forward into a goal or a dream we have.

338
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:39,120
 There are five emotional barriers that will stop you, inhibit you, slow you down from

339
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,120
 your forward momentum.

340
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,120
 Does that make sense?

341
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,620
 You want to know what those five are?

342
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:48,060
 Hurt, disappointment, regret, shame, and failure.

343
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,060
 Say it again.

344
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:53,860
 Hurt, disappointment, regret, shame, failure.

345
00:19:53,860 --> 00:20:00,740
 Those five things are the emotional barriers that will inhibit you from moving forward

346
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:04,420
 with excitement into a new thing in your life.

347
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:09,420
 When hurt, disappointment, regret, shame, and failure are upon us, are a part of us,

348
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,220
 they become barriers to our growth.

349
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,980
 Does that make sense to you?

350
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:13,980
 Now here's the thing.

351
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,700
 They're not just barriers to our general human movement.

352
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,380
 They're also barriers spiritually as well.

353
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:25,060
 In fact, you can go to the Bible and you can see many examples of God's people struggling

354
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:28,100
 with hurt, disappointment, regret, shame, and failure.

355
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:32,940
 And that in the struggle, they find themselves held back from what it is that God wants to

356
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,940
 do with them.

357
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:41,040
 And they find it difficult to shift out of the old and into the new.

358
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:47,900
 And the burden that I felt sitting on me as I was preparing this message today is that

359
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:53,220
 I feel like for me, but I also feel like for many of us here, many of us watching online

360
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,700
 right now, here's the reality.

361
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:59,900
 Because hurt, disappointment, shame, regret, and failure has had such an impact on us at

362
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:05,140
 times, we actually think that we're kind of on plan B now for our lives.

363
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,980
 It's like, that was really hard.

364
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:11,940
 I went through a really traumatic time, or I had a really bad breakdown in a relationship,

365
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:16,340
 or I tried a job and I got fired and it was really, really hard for me.

366
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:21,900
 And we have these situations where we're sitting heavy with the weight of our brokenness from

367
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,980
 something that's happened in our past.

368
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:28,540
 That hurt and that disappointment, that shame and that regret, that kind of tethers us,

369
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,540
 anchors us to that.

370
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:35,380
 And we begin to think, well, I guess I'll just live a plan B kind of life then.

371
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:40,620
 I guess the only life that's really available for me now is not the life that I hoped for,

372
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,260
 not the life that I believe that God had put in my heart.

373
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,700
 I guess that's kind of failed.

374
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,700
 That hasn't worked out.

375
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,980
 I guess I'm going to live a half life.

376
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:52,340
 It's still a pretty decent one, but it's not quite the one that I was hoping it would be.

377
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:55,660
 And particularly when we're dealing out of hurt, disappointment, regret, shame and failure

378
00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:01,460
 because of sin, we then get the mentality of, I'm not worthy of the life that Christ

379
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,940
 wants me to have.

380
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:07,180
 I'm not worthy to be used by him in the way that he wants to use me.

381
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:10,180
 I hear Pastor Andrew on a Sunday and the other pastors speak.

382
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:14,220
 I read the Bible and I see what God does in other people, but that's everybody else's

383
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,220
 story.

384
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,940
 If they knew the sin that was in my life, they would know that that's not my story and

385
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,620
 that shouldn't be my story.

386
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,100
 Are you with me?

387
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:26,420
 And so because of that, we think we're on plan B or maybe some of us plan C, D, E and

388
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:33,980
 F. And you have no anticipation as you step into 2025 that actually maybe you're still

389
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:39,740
 on plan A. That actually the hurt, disappointment, shame, regret and failure does not have to

390
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:43,220
 determine your future.

391
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:51,260
 See, when the hurt, disappointment, shame and failure of our past speaks louder to us

392
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:57,420
 than the hope of our future, we are always in danger of missing out on the most significant

393
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:02,340
 moments of influence and impact we can have in this world.

394
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:09,020
 Always in danger of missing out on the most significant moments of impact and influence

395
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,420
 that we could have in the world around us.

396
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:16,620
 And I don't want a church, and I don't think you do either, that is so tethered to its

397
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:23,860
 brokenness of its past that it isn't impacting and influencing the world in the way that

398
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:28,100
 the cross of Calvary says it should.

399
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:31,220
 Jesus said, "I have built this church.

400
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:36,100
 I will build this church and the gates of hell will not pervade against it."

401
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,660
 And as we step into this new year, I wonder whether we could step in actually believing

402
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,660
 that.

403
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:43,300
 So if you struggle with hurt, disappointment, shame, regret and failure, you're human, number

404
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,620
 one.

405
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,340
 Number two, you're just like me.

406
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:51,060
 And number three, the scripture has something important to say to you.

407
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:54,220
 I want to frame that by sharing with you about the story of Samuel.

408
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:58,220
 I don't know if you know much about Samuel in the Old Testament.

409
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,340
 Samuel lived this incredible life.

410
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:02,300
 I'm going to pick up the story right at the end of Samuel's life though, because I want

411
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,220
 to show you the transition that takes place here.

412
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:10,660
 Right at the end of Samuel's life, he's so old that the leaders of Israel come to him

413
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,420
 and they say these very words, "You are very old."

414
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,620
 Can you imagine that?

415
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:19,580
 Imagine your boss coming up to you saying, "You are very old."

416
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:22,860
 So basically, he's at the end of his life, okay?

417
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,380
 And here's the thing you need to know about Samuel.

418
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,440
 He's lived an amazing life.

419
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,140
 This guy's lived an incredible life.

420
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:31,460
 He's been a judge of Israel for the majority of his life.

421
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:35,260
 And as a judge, he was the leader of the nation at that time.

422
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:39,020
 Now you can see in the book of Judges, the book of 1 and 2 Kings and all this, you can

423
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:43,500
 see that actually the judges really struggled, many of them, with sin and brokenness, and

424
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,300
 they didn't lead God's people very well.

425
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,980
 Samuel, however, did.

426
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:51,540
 He's one of the few judges that was actually upright, who actually had moral integrity,

427
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:55,860
 who actually loved God, who actually served him and obeyed his word.

428
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,340
 And he did an incredible job with Israel.

429
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:01,700
 And at the end of his life, success becomes a problem for him.

430
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,500
 Anybody else in this room, has that ever been in your case?

431
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,500
 Just me?

432
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,500
 No, it's okay.

433
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,100
 Success can become a problem, right?

434
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,380
 And so for him, he's done this amazing job, but he's done it so well that the leaders

435
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:16,260
 of Israel come to him and say, "You're very old, which means you're going to die soon,

436
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:21,300
 which means your sons will become judges, but your sons are not like you.

437
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,700
 Your sons don't have the same character you do.

438
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,580
 Your sons are not the same upright integrity that you have.

439
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,860
 We don't want your sons to lead us.

440
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,820
 And because we don't want your sons to lead us, here's what we want you to do.

441
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,580
 We want you to anoint a king.

442
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,440
 We want to start a monarchy now.

443
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,660
 We want to be like the other nations that we see, who have kings and queens.

444
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,140
 We want that for ourselves too.

445
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,180
 We do not want your sons, Samuel.

446
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:45,180
 Oh, you've been a great judge, but you've been a terrible father."

447
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:48,180
 Woo!

448
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,180
 Imagine how...

449
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,180
 They didn't actually say that.

450
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:53,340
 I added that to Scripture, but I think that's kind of what they were saying.

451
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:57,180
 Could you imagine how hurt Samuel would be?

452
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:00,460
 I mean, he's given his life to these people.

453
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,500
 He served them as best as he can.

454
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:07,500
 And right at the end of his life, the people have come and said, "We don't want your family

455
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,500
 anymore."

456
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,980
 The hurt, the disappointment.

457
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:17,540
 I think he was hurt because he wanted to defend his sons, I'm sure.

458
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:21,900
 But I think he was hurt more than that because he felt like he had been rejected by his people,

459
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,380
 him personally.

460
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:26,300
 In fact, we know that because he comes to God and it's recorded for us in Scripture.

461
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,500
 He comes to God and he prays a prayer.

462
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,500
 He says this.

463
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,860
 He says, "Lord, I'm distraught because they have rejected me."

464
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:36,820
 And God, in only the way that God can, comes to him and says, "No, no, no, no, Samuel.

465
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:37,980
 They've not rejected you.

466
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,260
 They've rejected me as king over them."

467
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:45,660
 In other words, God always saw himself as their king, as the ultimate ruler.

468
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:49,760
 And when they came and asked for a king, God was like, "They're trying to usurp my power

469
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,760
 and my authority.

470
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,260
 They haven't rejected you, Samuel.

471
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:55,260
 They've actually rejected me."

472
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,920
 And God, because he's compassionate and loving and faithful and committed, he says these

473
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,920
 words to Samuel.

474
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:03,540
 He said, "Look, if they want a monarchy, we can work through a monarchy."

475
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:07,900
 He's basically like, "My redemptive purposes are not going to be thwarted by some human

476
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,900
 idea.

477
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,980
 If it's a monarchy they want, a monarchy can happen.

478
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:15,580
 I can still bring my redemptive purposes to the world through that."

479
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,580
 And so he says this thing to Samuel.

480
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,300
 He says, "Samuel, I want you to pick up your horn.

481
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,420
 I want you to fill it with oil.

482
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:24,820
 And then I want you to pour it over the one I'm about to anoint as king."

483
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:29,900
 Now for Samuel, he as a prophet and judge, he would have a horn, not too dissimilar to

484
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,660
 something like this.

485
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:36,540
 And in the horn, what he would do is he would pour anointing oil, perfumed oil into it.

486
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:39,700
 And then he would choose an amazingly good looking man like this man right here.

487
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:43,180
 And he would come up to him and he would say, "Okay, the Lord's going to use this man for

488
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,180
 leadership."

489
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,480
 And he would pour that anointing oil over his head.

490
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,660
 And that was a prophetic symbol to say that this person has now been anointed to lead

491
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,620
 or to be a prophet or whatever it is.

492
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:56,540
 So when God says to Samuel, "Grab your horn, fill it with oil because I'm about to use

493
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:59,740
 it," it's saying to Samuel, "There's one more thing I want you to do.

494
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,100
 You're very old, but there's one more thing.

495
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,140
 You can hold your horn.

496
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,140
 You can do what I'm asking you to do."

497
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,500
 And so he goes, "I want you to go and anoint this guy called Saul."

498
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,500
 And so he goes to Saul and he anoints Saul.

499
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,420
 Now Saul says these beautiful words when he's anointed.

500
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:16,560
 He says, "Who am I that I would be chosen out of all of Israel to be the one?

501
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,760
 Like my clan is the smallest, my tribe is the smallest.

502
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,200
 I can't believe I've been chosen."

503
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,240
 There's this beautiful humility in Saul.

504
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:27,100
 And everything in the story at this point seems to be going quite well.

505
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,200
 And then Saul begins to lead.

506
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:34,800
 Now I don't know if you've ever tried to lead, but leadership is not easy.

507
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,400
 And he gets seduced by power.

508
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:41,760
 Not the only or first leader in the world to have been seduced by power.

509
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,680
 He gets seduced so much by power.

510
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,040
 He gets a taste of it so much that within a short period of time,

511
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:51,680
 begins to erect statues of himself around all of the cities of the land.

512
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,720
 Because he wanted his people to begin to look to him for authority

513
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,280
 rather than to look to God.

514
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,560
 "They've not rejected you, Samuel.

515
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,640
 They rejected me as king."

516
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,640
 And Saul begins to live a life where he actually begins to disobey the things

517
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,000
 that God is asking him to do.

518
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,440
 Erect statues for people to basically essentially worship him, to look to him.

519
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,080
 And this so grieves heart of God.

520
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,560
 So grieves God's heart that he comes to Samuel and he says,

521
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:18,920
 "Samuel, I'm so grieved that I have made Saul king over Israel.

522
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:23,520
 I'm lifting my anointing from him."

523
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,040
 This throws Samuel into another cycle.

524
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:31,720
 And this cycle is regret, shame, and failure.

525
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:36,360
 Because suddenly Samuel's feeling like this, "I'm at the end of my life.

526
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:41,440
 And I've just anointed the last act that I've done in my life is to anoint this one

527
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,000
 to be king.

528
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,800
 I've then stood aside, my family has stood aside.

529
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,480
 We've made space for this to happen.

530
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,880
 And this guy has been seduced by power.

531
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,960
 And now God has lifted his anointing."

532
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:57,360
 Samuel's feeling like, "My last act of life has been a failure.

533
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,040
 The last thing I've done has failed.

534
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,240
 It hasn't worked out.

535
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,480
 What kind of prophet?

536
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,680
 What kind of judge?

537
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,560
 What kind of leader?

538
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,880
 What kind of legacy?

539
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:10,080
 Am I leaving behind when the last thing I did didn't work out well?"

540
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:16,920
 The shame, the shame of being the one that actually anointed the wrong person,

541
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,840
 if you will, the one who grieves the heart of the Lord.

542
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,040
 How did that all happen?

543
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:27,040
 And Samuel is so wallowing deeply in his brokenness, in the hurt, disappointment,

544
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:33,560
 shame, regret, and failure of what's just happened to him that he is completely

545
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:37,000
 at a loss.

546
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,800
 I wonder if you've ever felt that way.

547
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,200
 I wonder if you've ever had a moment in your life where maybe something you've

548
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:51,040
 done in your past has so filled you with regret, so filled you with hurt that you're

549
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,840
 filled with shame just thinking about it.

550
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,800
 And that whole thing, you've either tried to ignore it, tried to bury it,

551
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:04,120
 tried to avoid it, or it's so consumed you that it's been difficult for you to get

552
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,720
 out of bed the next day.

553
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,680
 I wonder if it's just me who's felt that way.

554
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:13,120
 I'm sure all of us, right, to some degree can connect to where Samuel is in this

555
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,120
 moment.

556
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,040
 Perhaps for you, it's a relationship.

557
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:22,040
 Perhaps you've got a failed relationship in your life, maybe a failed marriage,

558
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:25,080
 and the hurt of that, the disappointment in that, the shame of that's holding you

559
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,160
 back.

560
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,080
 Perhaps it's a work thing.

561
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:32,200
 Maybe you tried for a job and you didn't get the job, or maybe you had a job and you

562
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,360
 got fired, or you lost your job, or you were made redundant or something,

563
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,600
 and that's sitting heavy on you.

564
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,960
 Perhaps it's a financial decision.

565
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,680
 Maybe you made an investment in something and that investment didn't work out.

566
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,680
 You put it all in and it didn't come through.

567
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:49,400
 And that still stings, and you're still embarrassed about that.

568
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,760
 And you feel like you hurt your loved ones because you made a choice that didn't work

569
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,800
 out, that it failed.

570
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:58,920
 I think we all can connect with Samuel in some way, can't we?

571
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:02,280
 God shows up to Samuel in this place of hurt, disappointment, regret, shame,

572
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,520
 and failure.

573
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:08,040
 And he speaks to him some words that if you're feeling anything like what Samuel

574
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:12,400
 was feeling in that moment, I think God's saying these words over you today.

575
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,120
 Because these words change everything for Samuel.

576
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,320
 And as I unpack them for you now, I pray that they will change everything

577
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:24,520
 for you, and that you will be able to start 2025 walking forward.

578
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:29,280
 Let me read this to you from 1 Samuel, chapter 15, starting in verse 34,

579
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,400
 and I'm just going to read a few verses.

580
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:36,680
 "Then Samuel left for Ramah, but Saul went up to his home in Gebeah of Saul.

581
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:40,560
 Until the day Samuel died, he did not go to see Saul again,

582
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,760
 though Samuel mourned for him.

583
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,400
 And the Lord was grieved that he had made Saul king over Israel.

584
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,080
 The Lord said to Samuel, 'How long will you mourn for Saul,

585
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,800
 since I have rejected him as king over Israel?

586
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,880
 Fill your horn with oil and be on your way, for I'm sending you now to Jesse

587
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:02,760
 of Bethlehem, for I have chosen one of his sons to be king.'"

588
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,000
 So I want you to picture this.

589
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,280
 Samuel was in a place of hurt, disappointment, reject, shame,

590
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,480
 and failure.

591
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,160
 He's right at the end of his life, and he thinks his life is done,

592
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,480
 everything's done.

593
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:16,320
 And he's mourning, grieving, hurting for all the things that have just happened

594
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,600
 at the end of his life.

595
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,840
 And God shows up and says these words.

596
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,800
 Let me read this again.

597
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,960
 "How long will you mourn for Saul?"

598
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,120
 I want you to see a couple of things here.

599
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,600
 Notice what God doesn't say.

600
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,760
 God does not say, "Why are you mourning for Saul?"

601
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,440
 He says, "How long will you mourn for Saul?"

602
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,200
 It's a subtle but very important difference.

603
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,280
 Could you imagine if you were Samuel and you're feeling the worst that you've ever

604
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,480
 felt in your life?

605
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,360
 You're feeling a failure, you're burnt out, you're feeling like what you've just done

606
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,280
 just didn't work out, and God shows up and says, "Why?

607
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,040
 Why are you feeling that way?"

608
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,840
 Can you imagine how that would feel?

609
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,360
 I mean, that would be a bit weird, wouldn't it?

610
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,360
 God was saying, "Why are you doing that?

611
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,360
 Why would you do that?

612
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,160
 You shouldn't do that.

613
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:56,960
 I've given up on that one.

614
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,360
 I gave up on him a long way ago.

615
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,080
 I've rejected him.

616
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,520
 Come on, why are you feeling this way?"

617
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,760
 It's so beautiful to me that God doesn't show up to Samuel and say,

618
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,680
 "Why are you feeling this way?"

619
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:10,400
 Instead, he shows up to him and goes, "I understand why you're feeling this way.

620
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,480
 Like, I totally get it.

621
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,880
 You're in a place of mourning.

622
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:18,880
 I'm not asking you why you're in a place of mourning because I know you're human,

623
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,600
 and you've just gone through something that was really hard, and you feel the shame,

624
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,040
 and you feel the embarrassment, and you feel the brokenness, and I get it.

625
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,960
 You're mourning."

626
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,640
 And I think it's beautiful because in God saying, "How long will you mourn?"

627
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:35,200
 Notice, God is giving him space to mourn.

628
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,240
 He's giving him space to wrestle with that feeling.

629
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,840
 He's giving him a space to process what has happened to him.

630
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,680
 He's not expecting him to get immediately better.

631
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:48,920
 How long will you mourn saying, basically, "There's a place for mourning."

632
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,280
 Hear this, church.

633
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,520
 There's a place for mourning.

634
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,320
 There's a place to wrestle with the brokenness, to wrestle with the things

635
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,480
 that we've done that we're not proud of.

636
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,200
 There's a place to bring our sin before the Lord and not to have to walk

637
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,400
 in the brokenness anymore.

638
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,000
 There's a place to receive the forgiveness, and the healing,

639
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,760
 and the restoration.

640
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,160
 There's a place for mourning.

641
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:11,440
 This is why we have the Psalms in the Scriptures because the Psalms are the

642
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,080
 beautiful poetic voice of Israel saying, "Hey, it's okay.

643
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,360
 We feel this way, God.

644
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,600
 We feel this way, but we're going to trust.

645
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,520
 We know that you're still for us even though it feels like you're a long,

646
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,520
 long way away from us, even though you've kind of forsaken us."

647
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:30,560
 The Psalms are this beautiful, honest reflection of God's people crying out

648
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,560
 and saying, "We're hurting.

649
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,160
 This is not easy.

650
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,040
 This is a painful experience."

651
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,360
 And God is saying, "There's space for that."

652
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,400
 Jesus himself in Matthew 5, 4, in the Sermon on the Mount,

653
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,240
 he says these beautiful words.

654
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:47,440
 He says, "Blessed are those who are mourned for they will be comforted."

655
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,720
 Blessed are those who mourn.

656
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,600
 Blessed are those that process the hurt and the feelings in them.

657
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:58,040
 For I, here's my promise to them, I promise I will comfort them.

658
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,080
 I promise my Spirit will be there for them.

659
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,960
 I promise they will not go through it alone.

660
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,440
 That's the wonderful heart of God.

661
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,400
 And so I want to say this to some of you in this room.

662
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,520
 Some of you here are in a season of mourning.

663
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,800
 And I want to say that's absolutely good.

664
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,400
 That's fine.

665
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,360
 In fact, your season of mourning is your greatest opportunity to receive the comfort

666
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,120
 of the presence of Jesus.

667
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:23,240
 And so if you're in a season of mourning in this room, our prayer for you is that we

668
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:23,800
 will be with you.

669
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,560
 We'll stand with you.

670
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,400
 We'll be the support to you.

671
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,840
 We will pray for you and we will hope that the comfort of Christ will be known

672
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,440
 in your life.

673
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:33,960
 We'll journey with you forever, however long it takes.

674
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,480
 If you're mourning here, we love you and we're here for you.

675
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,960
 Are you with me?

676
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,040
 I don't want you to hear anything else if that's your season right now.

677
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:46,080
 The only thing I want you to take away from today is that God will comfort you.

678
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,400
 Jesus will comfort you.

679
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:51,000
 And we as a church, we're here for you.

680
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,640
 But I want you to see this.

681
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:57,520
 By God coming to Samuel and saying, "How long are you going to mourn?"

682
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,280
 God understands something that Samuel needed to understand.

683
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:06,160
 And it's really important that at some point, mourning has to finish for new

684
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,840
 life to begin.

685
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,960
 Come on, church.

686
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:14,360
 At some point, mourning has to stop for new life to begin.

687
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,720
 I don't know how you sleep at night.

688
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,400
 Let me explain.

689
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,240
 We're going to get intimate now.

690
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,360
 I'm going to explain to you how I sleep at night.

691
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,360
 When I sleep at night, I sleep with my arms under the pillow.

692
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,240
 Anyone ever do that?

693
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,200
 Like you put your arms under your pillow, with the two arms or one arm?

694
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,840
 I like to sleep with one arm under my pillow.

695
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:32,240
 Now, the problem with that is about twice a night, I will wake up in the middle

696
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,760
 of the night, and I've been leaning my whole body weight on one arm.

697
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,960
 And that means that arm is now dead.

698
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,520
 Like all the blood has been pushed out of that arm.

699
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,080
 You ever had like a dead arm, right?

700
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:45,640
 And if you're leaning on it and your arm is dead, the funny thing is you can't kind

701
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,400
 of move because you can't push off.

702
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,080
 So you have to get your other hand and sort of push off the mattress,

703
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,720
 and then your hand just sort of stays there, and then you've got to grab it,

704
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,360
 and it sort of flops like this because there's no blood in it.

705
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,560
 And then you move on to your other side, and about two hours later,

706
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,760
 you wake up and that arm's dead, right?

707
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,400
 This is like a repetitive thing in my life.

708
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,800
 When God comes to Samuel and says, "How long are you going to mourn?"

709
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,720
 He's basically saying, "We do this with ourselves spiritually.

710
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,720
 We do this with ourselves emotionally.

711
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:17,280
 When we hold on to the mourning of something for too long, it's like that thing

712
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,320
 remains dead.

713
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,600
 You remain dead.

714
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:25,000
 And for new life to come, you have to let go at some point.

715
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,800
 You have to move forward at some point."

716
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,440
 And he comes to Samuel and says, "How long are you going to mourn?"

717
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:37,400
 Which is actually an invitation for Samuel to both mourn, yes,

718
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,560
 but also to realize that at some point, that's going to have to stop and that God

719
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,640
 will be there for him.

720
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,920
 And when God is there for him, things will begin to change.

721
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,080
 Some of you in this room, you're struggling to find a new

722
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:51,080
 relationship in your life because you're still holding on to the old one that's

723
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,840
 long been dead.

724
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:57,240
 Some of you are struggling to find that job that's your career job that you'd

725
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:02,160
 love to do because you're hanging on to the old job out of fear of lack of security

726
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,560
 for the future.

727
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,800
 You're holding on to the job you hate, and that's keeping you from the job you

728
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,680
 really want to receive.

729
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:13,600
 Or what it might be in any area of our lives, but we can all go through this.

730
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,080
 And I want you to see something that's happening here.

731
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,120
 When God says to Samuel, "How long are you going to mourn?"

732
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,200
 Here's essentially what's happening for Samuel.

733
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,920
 Samuel is so consumed to the mourning of his past that he is ignorant,

734
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,800
 he's blind to the importance of his future.

735
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,240
 I want you to see this because this is what happens for all of us in these five

736
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,400
 emotional barriers.

737
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:36,560
 He's so consumed by the past that he's blind to the importance of his future.

738
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,160
 He thinks he has no future.

739
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,720
 He thinks his story is done.

740
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,200
 "I anointed one and he failed.

741
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,680
 That's my postscript.

742
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,320
 I'm leaving this world with that.

743
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,040
 I am done."

744
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:53,240
 And God says, "You don't understand, Samuel, but you are standing in this

745
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:57,560
 moment right in the most significant moment of human history."

746
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:03,360
 Samuel has no idea the importance of what's ahead of him, but God knows.

747
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:07,640
 And because God sees what is just ahead of Samuel, he says, "How long are you

748
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,160
 going to mourn?"

749
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,440
 Samuel is thinking, "Hang on a sec.

750
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,560
 Everything's done for me."

751
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:17,080
 And God's saying, "You can't see what it is that I'm about to do for you."

752
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,560
 Think about this.

753
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:23,120
 Samuel, and we're going to see this next week, Samuel is about to go and anoint,

754
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,800
 he's about to pour oil over David.

755
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:33,720
 David, who would become the starting point of the Davidic dynasty that Jewish people

756
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,240
 and Christians believe, or Jewish people believe will come eventually for a

757
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:41,200
 Messiah, Christians believe came in Jesus.

758
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,680
 Samuel is about to pour oil over the very one who will start the bloodline that will

759
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,520
 bring Jesus Christ.

760
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,640
 Get your head around that.

761
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,680
 Samuel is about to start the process for Jesus.

762
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,680
 He has no idea.

763
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:59,680
 He has no idea that he's standing at the most critical moment of human history

764
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,280
 because he's so blinded by the hurt, disappointment, shame, regret,

765
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,440
 and failure.

766
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,560
 But God sees.

767
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,840
 I want you to see this, church.

768
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,480
 God sees.

769
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,240
 God sees David.

770
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,160
 God sees the bloodline.

771
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,560
 God sees Jesus.

772
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:20,040
 And God sees Jesus' life and ministry and miracles and teaching.

773
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:24,320
 He sees his death on the cross and the horror of that, but the importance of that

774
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,360
 for liberation for sin.

775
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:30,080
 He sees his resurrection and the filling of the Holy Spirit upon him.

776
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:33,440
 He sees him gathering disciples and giving them the great commission.

777
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,200
 He sees them receiving the Holy Spirit in the upper room.

778
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,360
 He sees them begin the church with their own sweat and blood,

779
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,280
 some of them martyred for their faith.

780
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,200
 He sees over 2,000 years, the church grow in history.

781
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:50,600
 He even sees the first Sunday of 2025 and you sitting at the vine hearing the

782
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,960
 message right now.

783
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,640
 He sees all of that.

784
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:58,200
 And because of the worth and the value of all of that, he comes to Samuel and he

785
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,760
 says, "How long?

786
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,960
 How long?

787
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:13,560
 How long are you going to mourn because Jesus is coming?"

788
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,680
 It's really important.

789
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,720
 I think that we all hear this.

790
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:22,720
 Some of us have Davids right up ahead of us in our future, but we're in danger of

791
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:27,760
 failing to receive them because we're still holding on to our souls.

792
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:34,680
 Which soul as you start 2025 are you holding on to that is blinding you to the

793
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:38,320
 wonder of what the Lord wants to do in you?

794
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:44,080
 The David that's there, your dream job, a new relationship,

795
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:47,480
 maybe a goal that you've longed had for.

796
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:51,320
 Maybe that moment of life that you've been dreaming and praying for,

797
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:54,080
 that budding of the bamboo shoot that's going to come out of the ground.

798
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,880
 It's right there in front of you.

799
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,560
 He sees it.

800
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:04,480
 And he says, "How long are you going to mourn?"

801
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,600
 How do we then respond to this?

802
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:10,720
 Well, notice what he says to Samuel 16, chapter 16, verse 1.

803
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,720
 He says, "The Lord said to Samuel, 'How long will you mourn for Saul since I've

804
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,920
 rejected him as king over Israel?

805
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,600
 Fill your horn with oil and be on your way.'"

806
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,680
 Isn't that a beautiful thing?

807
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:24,160
 See, Samuel thought it was all over.

808
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,680
 My last act as a judge was to pour oil over Saul.

809
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,960
 What a mistake that was.

810
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,440
 I'm never doing that again.

811
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,800
 Oh, I don't want to take the risk of that again.

812
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,120
 Oh, if I step out and try that again, oh man, that's going to fail.

813
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:39,040
 I did that once and it sucked.

814
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,200
 It sucked so hard because God's heart was grieved, my heart was grieved.

815
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,520
 I hurt, shamed.

816
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,600
 Disappointment, failure.

817
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,760
 Why would I ever bother to do that again?

818
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,200
 You could imagine Samuel thinking.

819
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:57,400
 And God says, "Have the courage, Samuel, to pick up your horn, fill it with oil and

820
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,560
 be on your way."

821
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:02,120
 In other words, here's what Samuel hears.

822
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,080
 I love this.

823
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:07,280
 Samuel hears God say to him, "I am not done with you yet."

824
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,720
 Come on, church.

825
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,240
 I'm not done with you yet.

826
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,360
 Who told you I was finished with you?

827
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,960
 You told yourself that.

828
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:17,320
 You let the hurt, shame, disappointment, regret, frame, failure all tell you that.

829
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,960
 I never told you that.

830
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,320
 I never said your life was over.

831
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,120
 I never said you were too old.

832
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,960
 That was Israel who said that to you.

833
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,800
 I never said that you were a failure.

834
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,320
 None of those words ever came from me.

835
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,400
 Here's what I'm saying to you.

836
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,920
 Pick up your horn because I'm not done with you yet.

837
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:34,840
 Because there's something you're about to do that will be a legacy for the whole of

838
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,280
 the human race.

839
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,440
 Grab your horn, he says.

840
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,240
 And here's what I want to say to some of you this morning.

841
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,880
 Pick up your horn.

842
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,720
 Pick up your horn.

843
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,960
 For Samuel, it was a literal horn.

844
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:47,960
 For you, it's not a literal horn.

845
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,520
 That would be weird.

846
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:55,040
 But the horn was a symbol for Samuel of what he had been called to do.

847
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,440
 What's that tool for you?

848
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,440
 What have you been called to do?

849
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,320
 For some of you, that's your work.

850
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,320
 That's your business.

851
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,440
 Grab a hold of it like never before.

852
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,280
 Some of you, that's the ability to pray.

853
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,360
 Pray like never before.

854
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:09,040
 Some of you, that's a gift or a talent to communicate.

855
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,400
 Pray like you've never done before.

856
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,280
 For some of you, it might be whatever it is.

857
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,680
 Whatever God has put on your heart, whatever talent or gift, whatever tool he has given

858
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:21,160
 you to be able to share the gospel, and he's given it to every single person, grab your

859
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,520
 horn.

860
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:28,080
 Don't allow shame, regret, failure, disappointment, and hurt define your future.

861
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:31,680
 He is not done with you yet.

862
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:32,680
 Come on, church.

863
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,920
 He's not done with you yet.

864
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,800
 There's so much more ahead for you.

865
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,000
 So much more ahead for me.

866
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
 I'm turning 50.

867
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,120
 Oh, I feel like he's done with me.

868
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:44,120
 I'm turning 50 in a month.

869
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:47,640
 Oh, Lord Jesus.

870
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,280
 Yeah.

871
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,560
 The eldest came to me the other day.

872
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:55,480
 "Andrew, you are very old," they said.

873
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,480
 Just kidding.

874
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:57,480
 The eldest didn't say that.

875
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,480
 He's not done with me yet.

876
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,480
 Honestly, I'm preaching to myself.

877
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:03,400
 I feel a bit emotional right now.

878
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,560
 I'm preaching to myself.

879
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,240
 He's not done with me yet.

880
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,240
 He's not done with you.

881
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,240
 How old you are in this room?

882
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,240
 50 is not old.

883
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:15,360
 There might be some older people here watching online.

884
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,360
 I see you, John.

885
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:20,000
 I love you.

886
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,400
 He's not done with you yet.

887
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,400
 Amen?

888
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,400
 Now, notice this.

889
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,240
 He says, sorry, I'm going to finish soon.

890
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,080
 He says here, he says, "Fill your horn with oil."

891
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,080
 I love this.

892
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:32,560
 He doesn't say, "Fill your horn with your own strength.

893
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:36,040
 Fill your horn with just your good news or your good works."

894
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,320
 He doesn't say, "Fill the horn with your talent."

895
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,000
 He said, "Fill it with my oil.

896
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,680
 Fill it with the oil of the Holy Spirit."

897
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:46,840
 It's only Jesus that brings our dead tools to life.

898
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:51,480
 It's only Jesus that takes those talents and uses them to do something in the kingdom.

899
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:54,400
 Remember, it's him who changes the world.

900
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:59,280
 We're just empty, broken vessels, but when the oil of the Holy Spirit comes on us, we

901
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:03,480
 are able to do like the disciples did in that upper room, things that they never thought

902
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,280
 they would ever be able to do.

903
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,480
 Think changes and transforms when you're filled with Jesus.

904
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,880
 Notice this.

905
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:15,720
 When sin happened in Genesis 3, all of humanity was brought into a place of brokenness and

906
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,400
 the whole of creation was.

907
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:23,140
 And the Bible describes it like this, that all of creation has been mourning.

908
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:27,800
 And Jesus is described to us through the Old Testament as the horn of our salvation.

909
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:35,640
 In other words, Jesus is the vessel that God decided to choose to pour out on humanity.

910
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:41,320
 The one who has decided to bring hope and freedom and life to broken, sinful humanity.

911
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,600
 Jesus is the horn of our salvation.

912
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:48,560
 And so if there's anyone that we come to to receive the oil from, to receive the Spirit

913
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,280
 of God from, surely it's Christ.

914
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,280
 It has to be Christ.

915
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,280
 It's only Christ.

916
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:56,420
 He is the horn that God has provided that is poured out over you.

917
00:47:56,420 --> 00:48:00,820
 So when he says, "Pick up your horn," he's like, "I've already picked up mine.

918
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:07,240
 My horn went to the cross for you, rose from the dead for you, forgives your sins for you.

919
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:08,240
 You are forgiven."

920
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:11,880
 That doesn't mean you're going to have this perfect, sunny, shiny life all the time, but

921
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:14,800
 it means that even in mourning, you are comforted.

922
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,800
 Amen?

923
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:20,120
 Even in the hurt, disappointment, shame, regret, and failure, that is not the end of your story.

924
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:24,960
 I am there with you and I will walk you into the new thing that I have for you.

925
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:31,700
 2025 will be your most significant year yet, because he would say over to you, "I am not

926
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,760
 done with you.

927
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:37,920
 Do not allow the soul to stop you from the David.

928
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,120
 How long will you mourn?"

929
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:43,320
 I wonder whether you'd close your eyes with me.

930
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:47,240
 I want to just pray and we're going to make some space.

931
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,240
 We've got plenty of time.

932
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:53,240
 So we've designed the service today specifically to give us more time.

933
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:57,620
 And as your eyes are closed, I want to just explain in a moment, we're going to invite

934
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:59,680
 you to come forward for communion.

935
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:04,040
 Now just keep your eyes closed, but let me explain.

936
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,160
 In a moment, we're going to invite you to come forward for communion.

937
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:11,160
 Normally here at the Vine, we pass communion out to you and you receive it that way.

938
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,720
 But today we want you to be active.

939
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,960
 We want you to take action.

940
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:19,080
 Want you to be in the prophetic side of this word.

941
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:21,400
 And so we want you to come forward.

942
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,400
 So there's going to be four stations in the front here.

943
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,440
 There's two on either side in the lower house as well.

944
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,120
 Upstairs there's two at the front and two at the back.

945
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:35,000
 And in a moment, you'll be invited in your own time when you're ready to come and receive

946
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,300
 communion for one of our leaders or elders here.

947
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,040
 And we will bless you as you receive the communion.

948
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:44,840
 Then you can take it back and you can take communion in your chair with your friends,

949
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:50,200
 family, whoever you're here with, or if you're on your own, you can take it on your own.

950
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:54,040
 But before you come forward for communion, we want to give you space to receive what

951
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,600
 the Holy Spirit has for you.

952
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:02,880
 In some ways today, the communion is the coming forward after we felt like the Lord has ministered

953
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:03,880
 to us.

954
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:06,480
 And so we're going to create some space for you now to receive the ministry of the Holy

955
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,480
 Spirit.

956
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:13,640
 It's the most important part of our service and I want to encourage that in a couple of

957
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:14,640
 ways.

958
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:20,160
 Maybe something I've shared today, maybe you recognize it hurt, disappointment, shame,

959
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:24,800
 regret and failure has dominated your thinking too much.

960
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:30,060
 Maybe you recognize that you're holding onto a soul.

961
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:34,280
 Maybe you feel like you're not worthy of a David.

962
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:41,720
 Maybe you're entering 2025 locked and anchored and tethered into the past when the Lord says

963
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:49,080
 this is going to be your most significant year yet.

964
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:53,400
 But if you're anything like me, hurt, disappointment, regret, shame, failure, those are powerful

965
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,160
 things.

966
00:50:55,160 --> 00:51:02,760
 And when the Lord said to Samuel, "Fill your home with oil," what he's basically saying

967
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:06,080
 to you is how long will you go before you invite my Holy Spirit into that part of your

968
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:10,120
 life?

969
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:16,720
 How long will you go until you invite my Spirit into the hurt, into the disappointment, into

970
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:21,120
 the regret and the shame and the failure?

971
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:26,960
 For I'm here and I will comfort those who mourn.

972
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:31,120
 Maybe for some of you, you've been carrying around those five things so much because you

973
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:34,600
 haven't had the courage to invite the Spirit in.

974
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,680
 Maybe it's been too painful to invite the Spirit in.

975
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:43,520
 I want to encourage you to be brave at the start of this year.

976
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:48,160
 And so in this ministry time before you come for communion, you can just take your time

977
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:52,880
 to invite Him into those areas.

978
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,400
 Ask Him to help you to let go of your soul.

979
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:02,000
 Ask Him to show you what He sees about your future, how much He loves you, how much He's

980
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:08,360
 prepared that's just ahead of you, how He doesn't want the hurt and the shame and the

981
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:13,000
 regret and failure to dominate your thinking and your vision.

982
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,080
 If you're here with family and friends and you want someone to pray for you, just invite

983
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,720
 them to pray for you in a moment.

984
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,600
 Just reach out and say, "Hey, would you pray for me?

985
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,160
 That's an important word for me today.

986
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,200
 I need to respond.

987
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:28,360
 Would you just help me and pray?"

988
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:33,360
 And so whilst we're all being ministered to and prayed for in your own time when you're

989
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:38,280
 ready, you can then come forward to receive communion as a way of culminating perhaps

990
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,760
 what it is that the Spirit of God is doing in you.

991
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:45,520
 We have about 15 minutes for this, so there's no need to rush.

992
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:49,040
 So Lord Jesus, I pray for each person here.

993
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:52,640
 If you'd like to receive this prayer, just open your hands as I pray.

994
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:57,320
 Holy Spirit, Father, we're grateful.

995
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:00,600
 We're grateful that we're standing on the precipice of 2025, the most significant year

996
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,520
 of our lives.

997
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:07,120
 We're thankful that you are a forward-moving God.

998
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:15,080
 Father, we recognize that we carry hurt and disappointment, that regret and shame and

999
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:21,680
 failure are part of our story and sometimes are too much a part of our story.

1000
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:26,100
 Father, would you come?

1001
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:29,720
 Would you minister to me right now in this place?

1002
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:34,320
 Would you enable my spirit to say to you, "You are not done with me?

1003
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,600
 Thank you, Lord, that you're not done with me.

1004
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,960
 Thank you that I have not disqualified myself.

1005
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:44,360
 Thank you, Lord, that I'm still on plan A. I may not have all the answers.

1006
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:48,400
 I may still struggle with the trauma of what it is I've been going through, but Lord, thank

1007
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:54,400
 you that you forgive, redeem, renew, restore, that this will be my most significant year."

1008
00:53:54,400 --> 00:54:02,160
 So I'm just going to invite the elders and pastors to come and just be at the stations

1009
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,160
 now.

1010
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:06,280
 But I want to invite you to take your time.

1011
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,680
 Pray with the person next to you if you want to pray.

1012
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:12,120
 Just receive more of the Holy Spirit if that's what you want.

1013
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:15,320
 Weep if you want to weep.

1014
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:23,280
 This is a safe place, and in a moment, when it's right, we'll respond together in worship.

1015
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:33,280
