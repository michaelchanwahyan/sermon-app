[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560]   >> [INAUDIBLE]
[00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.360]   >> Help those that are in the overflow
[00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.800]   come and sit down, that's great.
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.600]   Well, as you know, we're in a new sermon series.
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.680]   We've started last week with Andrew as he shared on the person of the Holy Spirit.
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.960]   And we're entering a series of really doing a teaching around who the Holy
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.200]   Spirit is, and so we're super excited about that.
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.440]   And it's an honor to have with us today one of our elders.
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.480]   Our elder has been with the Vine, her family have been part of the Vine for
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.760]   many, many, many years.
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.640]   So would you give a very warm Vine welcome for Elder Susanna.
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.360]   >> [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.520]   >> And let's pray for Susanna.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.800]   Father, we thank you for Susanna and
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.720]   we thank you for the word that she has prayerfully prepared.
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.400]   It is a word that she has surrendered to you.
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.840]   And so we pray for her, we pray your blessing over her.
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.280]   And we pray for us, that again, we would lean into what you are saying.
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.520]   And the truth of your word truly sets us free, in Jesus' name.
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:12.560]   >> Good morning.
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.120]   And good morning to all of those who are joining online today.
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:24.440]   As Carla just said, we started a new series last week on the Holy Spirit.
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.240]   And I loved how Andrew focused in on and
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.640]   reminded us that the Holy Spirit is a person.
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:39.840]   And the Holy Spirit is a person whose role, since the very beginning of creation,
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.560]   has always been to bring order out of disorder.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:52.640]   That beautiful picture in Genesis of the Holy Spirit hovering over the darkness and
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.200]   the chaos, ready to bring things fully alive.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.840]   And now, for those of us who've chosen Jesus, he's at work within us.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:12.240]   The Holy Spirit willing and ready to move us out of darkness,
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.640]   to shape our chaos into the fullness of what we were intended to be.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.160]   Today, we're going to explore the comfort and the conviction of the Holy Spirit.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:31.840]   John 14, verses 16 to 17 says, and I will pray the Father,
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.680]   and he will give you another helper.
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.720]   And he may abide with you forever, the spirit of truth,
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:46.160]   whom the world cannot receive because it neither sees him nor knows him.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.520]   But you know him, for he dwells with you.
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.480]   And will be in you.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.120]   John 14, verse 26 says, but the helper,
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:05.600]   the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.720]   And bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:19.280]   And then in John 16, verses 7 to 8, it says, nevertheless, I tell you the truth.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.760]   It is to your advantage that I go away.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.040]   For if I do not go away, the helper will not come to you.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.760]   But if I depart, I will send him to you.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.400]   And when he has come, he will convict the world of sin,
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.360]   of righteousness, and of judgment.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:48.120]   All three verses use the word helper to describe the Holy Spirit.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:55.600]   The Greek word is parakletos, which translates as comforter or advocate.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:01.240]   Someone who is called or sent to assist another.
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.560]   Someone who pleads the cause of another.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:13.160]   Someone who's present to render various beneficial services.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.200]   John would later, in 1 John 2, 1,
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.320]   use the very same word, parakletos, to describe Jesus.
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.720]   This connection has meaning.
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.840]   Jesus' words in John 16, 7 to 8,
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.000]   tell us that Jesus is leaving behind his earthly ministry,
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.520]   specifically so the Holy Spirit can act.
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.920]   The Holy Spirit, in a sense, does from the inside,
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:52.480]   what Christ was doing from the outside with his disciples.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.800]   Teaching, convicting, reminding, comforting, and guiding.
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.920]   Let's unpack these verses.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.240]   Sometimes, if you've been a Christian for a little while,
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.440]   it's easy to gloss over these verses and
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.600]   miss the enormity of what is taking place here.
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:20.440]   John 14, 16 to 7 teaches us that the Holy Spirit is given to us by the Father.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.600]   That he will abide in us forever.
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.280]   He will dwell with us.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.520]   He will be in us.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:36.680]   If you believe in Jesus, if you've recognized your need of his saving love,
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:43.760]   and have chosen to give him your life, you have been given the gift
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.360]   of the Holy Spirit from the Father.
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.120]   The Holy Spirit is living within you.
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.120]   And this verse tells us that he will never leave you.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.520]   He will abide with you forever.
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:02.760]   This Greek word abide, meno, means to remain,
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:10.000]   to stay, to continue to exist, and I love this last word.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.240]   It means to persist.
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:18.480]   I don't know about you, but I'm glad I have someone dwelling with me
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.320]   who persists with me and doesn't give up on me.
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.120]   Jesus said, it's to your advantage that I go away.
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.840]   Let's think about that for a minute.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:38.320]   Jesus is saying that we get a better deal if he leaves and the Holy Spirit comes.
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.760]   It's to our advantage.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:47.200]   I'm sure the disciples who were listening to this would have been thinking,
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.720]   that just can't be right.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.160]   How can it be better if you go?
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:57.920]   You see, as long as Jesus was there in person,
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:06.440]   the object of the disciples' faith would always be a tangible, external person.
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:12.760]   Now that's not necessarily bad, however it means that they would have constantly
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:17.760]   depended on him to direct them to answer their questions.
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:22.600]   Their own thoughts and conscience would be perpetually pushed aside
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.680]   in favor of asking Jesus for his judgment and what he thought.
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:32.280]   When he was not physically present with them, they would have felt incomplete.
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:38.960]   In short, Jesus's physical presence in some sense,
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.280]   limited the depth of the disciples' reliance on God.
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:49.640]   It limited also how many people Jesus could influence at once.
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.760]   The Holy Spirit, on the other hand,
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:08:00.360]   completely fulfills the prophecy that's given in Jeremiah 31.
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.520]   It says, "Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord,
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:09.520]   when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah.
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:15.520]   I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:20.000]   And I will be their God, they'll be my people, and no longer will they be
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.920]   my God, they'll be my people, and no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:29.840]   each his brother saying, know the Lord, for they shall all know me.
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.360]   From the least of them to the greatest, declares the Lord, for
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:37.600]   I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more."
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:42.400]   The Holy Spirit, the helper, provides the ability for
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:47.200]   each of us to have a constant, a personal, and
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.560]   immediate, and indwelling contact with God.
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:55.400]   Instead of relying on someone outside of ourselves,
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:00.080]   believers in Christ can focus on the voice of God inside,
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.960]   inside their hearts as he dwells with them.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:10.040]   Now this doesn't make us infallible or all-knowing.
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:16.880]   It does mean that we have the advantage of his influence.
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.600]   So far as we're willing to submit to it.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.640]   Paul puts it like this,
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:26.240]   our bodies have now become the temple of the Holy Spirit.
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:35.080]   So as our helper, the Holy Spirit has this dual purpose to both comfort and convict.
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:42.080]   These words may seem to be opposites, but in fact, they can be intertwined.
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:49.040]   The conviction of the Holy Spirit in our response leads to his comfort,
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:52.920]   and the work of his comfort in our lives.
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:10:00.720]   A key thing to really note here is, we can carry the Holy Spirit within us,
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:05.840]   and he will be actively working to both convict and comfort us.
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.920]   But it only works if we're listening.
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.160]   It only works if we're responding and submitting to him.
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:19.920]   It's also important to note that the comforting work of the Spirit
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.240]   isn't always connected to conviction.
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:28.000]   Sometimes he comforts us because we're broken hearted, or
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.240]   we've experienced loss, or we're lonely.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:38.000]   Or sometimes he brings his comfort through us for somebody else.
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:44.920]   After one of the Sunday messages, I was having lunch across the road here in
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:49.880]   the little Malaysian place, cuz I love their rendang there, just a bit of a shout out.
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:53.040]   And I happened to be there by myself.
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.360]   Normally I'm having lunch with my family, but on this day I was by myself.
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:00.040]   And I'm just sitting there eating my lunch, and
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.760]   I'm getting ready about to stand up and go pay for my meal.
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:08.520]   And the Holy Spirit just said, you see that lady next to you?
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:12.720]   And I looked over, and I could tell it was one of our helpers.
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.200]   You know, like somebody who is a domestic worker working in Hong Kong,
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.040]   Sunday being their day off.
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.800]   She was sitting there relaxing, looking at her phone.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:24.520]   Her bill for her dinner was just sitting on the table, and
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.440]   the Holy Spirit said, pay for her dinner.
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.880]   And I was like.
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:32.800]   The paying part wasn't the issue.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.120]   The part was I didn't know this person.
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.560]   She was a stranger.
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:40.120]   And for a moment I really wrestled, cuz I thought I'm gonna be embarrassed,
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:45.840]   like talking to a complete stranger and saying, can I pay for your dinner?
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.040]   And I wrestled for quite a while.
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.040]   I sat there and I was like.
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:12:00.040]   But eventually I gave in, I stood up, and as I passed this woman's table I said,
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.800]   is it all right if I pay for your meal today?
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:06.440]   She kind of looked at me like in shock.
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.880]   And I actually picked it up off the table and
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.760]   started walking towards the cashier.
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.800]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:14.920]   >> And she sort of got up and
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.080]   started following me.
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.760]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.640]   >> It's very awkward.
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:24.720]   And she said to me, but why, why, why?
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:28.280]   And I could have given her a whole Christian thing.
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.880]   I didn't.
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:31.920]   I just said, just because.
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.960]   Cuz I can.
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.120]   She said to me, can I give you a hug?
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:45.080]   The Holy Spirit was doing that not for my benefit.
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:48.320]   He was comforting her.
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.040]   He was bringing her to a place, even though she was giving me a hug,
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:55.280]   she was like the Holy Spirit was hugging her and letting her know that she was seen.
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:02.400]   So sometimes the Holy Spirit works his comfort through us if we're willing
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.240]   to listen, and not just listen but obey.
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:11.000]   Let's look at the convicting work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.880]   Jesus said, the Holy Spirit will teach you all things and
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:19.600]   bring to your remembrance all the things I said to you.
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.720]   He will convict the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment.
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:28.960]   Let me give you an example of the convicting work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:34.440]   When I was a teenager, my mom and dad made it clear
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:38.160]   that they did not want me dating until I was 16 years old.
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:45.080]   And they wanted me to choose someone who held similar Christian values.
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:50.120]   They would always tell me about that whole unevenly yoked thing.
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:57.040]   The oxen pulling the plow and how they'd put the harness over the shoulders.
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:00.320]   And if the oxen weren't the same height,
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.160]   one of the oxen would carry more of the load.
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.520]   And they would always tell me, if you go out with someone who doesn't share
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.160]   the same values, it's gonna be like that.
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:12.920]   There's gonna be times when you're gonna feel under pressure, and
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:14.480]   things are not gonna work out so well.
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:20.200]   Well, there were a number of times I broke these rules.
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:24.880]   In fact, my first boyfriend was when I was 11.
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.080]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.560]   >> Nowhere near the 16 years of age.
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:36.320]   But you know, every time without fail, I would be convicted by the Holy Spirit.
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:42.880]   I remember once I was sitting in the back seat of a car holding a boy's hand, and
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.440]   my stomach was churning.
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:48.640]   I can remember literally feeling physically ill.
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:57.600]   And I could hear a very persistent voice in my head saying, this is not okay.
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.600]   This is not the right person for you.
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:05.040]   You need to end this.
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:08.920]   This didn't just happen once.
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:11.000]   I'm a slow learner.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.880]   It happened many times.
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:20.000]   And I became aware at these moments that my parents were praying for me.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.360]   And this is a good time to just encourage all the parents here.
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.720]   Do not stop praying for your children.
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:34.760]   The Holy Spirit is at work even when you are not around.
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:42.880]   You know I would experience no peace until I relented and
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:45.360]   I responded and I ended the relationship.
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:52.240]   Recently, I've been joking around with my teaching partner at school.
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:56.880]   And I made some comments about a staff member.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:01.920]   The next morning driving to school, having a quiet time,
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:05.400]   the Holy Spirit convicted me of this conversation.
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:13.200]   He reminded me of who he was calling me to be, a person of encouragement.
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:19.640]   And he encouraged me to speak to my teaching partner when I got to school.
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:23.480]   To apologize to her and
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:28.360]   tell her that I shouldn't have been talking about this person behind her back.
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:34.120]   And that from now on I was going to endeavor to not do that again.
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:41.000]   The Holy Spirit reminds us of the person we are meant to be.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:47.760]   He convicts us of sin and righteousness.
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:50.760]   He reminds us of the right way to live.
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:57.200]   As Andrew explained to us last week, the Holy Spirit has that great purpose
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:03.600]   of bringing something from disorder to order in our lives.
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:07.360]   And one of the key ways he does this is through his conviction.
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:12.320]   He helps us to recognize when we are not living
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:14.400]   as the person he's created us to be.
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:19.240]   When we believe in and accept Jesus as our savior,
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:22.040]   he covers us with his righteousness.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:25.440]   He covers us with his goodness.
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:29.960]   The Holy Spirit holds us accountable.
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:34.840]   He reminds us that we are sons and daughters of God and
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:39.360]   we are called to reflect his light and goodness in the world.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:44.920]   The conviction of the Holy Spirit only works, as I said before,
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:47.840]   if we listen and respond to it.
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:53.440]   You see, the more we hear and we don't respond,
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:57.920]   the duller the voice of the Holy Spirit gets.
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:04.640]   Eventually we'll reach a point where we won't hear at all.
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:09.520]   Ezekiel 12, 2 describes this.
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:14.600]   Son of man, you dwell in the midst of a rebellious house,
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:18.800]   which has eyes to see but does not see.
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:23.120]   And ears to hear but does not hear.
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:26.960]   For they are a rebellious house.
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:34.360]   Many of us have stopped listening for many reasons.
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:40.800]   But mostly because we don't want to respond to what we hear.
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:45.240]   You see, it's easier making our own choices
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.400]   and living the way we want to live.
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:53.480]   But James warns us about what happens when we live like this.
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:57.880]   James 1, verses 23 to 24 says,
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:01.200]   "If anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer,
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:05.560]   "he is like a man observing his natural face in a mirror.
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:08.040]   "For he observes himself, he goes away,
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:13.040]   "and he immediately forgets what kind of man he was."
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:16.800]   You see, when we stop listening to the Holy Spirit,
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:21.800]   we forget what kind of person we are meant to be.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:26.520]   And we lose our true identity.
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:34.560]   Now we're going to speak about the comfort of the Holy Spirit.
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:39.040]   The Holy Spirit assists us.
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:41.000]   He counsels us.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.480]   He guides us.
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.520]   He gives us the strength to move forward.
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.960]   He counsels us.
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:50.040]   He advocates for us.
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:53.320]   As I was preparing this sermon,
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:56.840]   I was reminded of this moment in my life.
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:00.680]   I was 17 and my boyfriend had just broken up with me.
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.360]   Seems to be a theme this morning,
[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.400]   doesn't it, all my boyfriend stories?
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.840]   But this one, he had broken up with me
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:10.360]   and I had been going out with him for a year and a half.
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.600]   It wasn't just a month or something.
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:15.920]   And I sincerely thought that we would continue
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.320]   and eventually one day get married.
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:21.320]   I was sitting on my bed
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:25.000]   and I was experiencing inconsolable grief.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.760]   And my father walked into the room.
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.080]   He sat down beside me on my bed.
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:38.120]   He put his arm around me and he said three words.
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:44.080]   It's his loss.
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:48.640]   I'll never forget that moment.
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:54.440]   The comfort and belief I received from those three words.
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:58.160]   It was like my dad restored my value.
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:02.760]   He helped me to see myself through his eyes.
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:07.480]   This is what the Holy Spirit does for us.
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:11.440]   The Holy Spirit restores our value
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:15.760]   and he helps us to see ourselves truly
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:17.320]   as we were created to be.
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:20.760]   Some of you here today,
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.920]   you are going through big and difficult things.
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:28.600]   20 years ago, my husband, Glenn and I,
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:31.320]   we moved to Darwin in Australia.
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:34.840]   Our friends had gone to pastor there
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:38.040]   and they asked us to join them.
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:42.560]   And at first we said, "No."
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:43.800]   If you know where Darwin is,
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:47.360]   it's like the Northwest tip up the top of Australia.
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.960]   It is isolated.
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:52.800]   You've either got to drive 24 hours to get somewhere
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:53.680]   or you fly.
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:56.280]   Like it is the back of beyond.
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.720]   And so when they said this,
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.200]   our pastor friend, Darren, he actually said,
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:03.240]   "I had a dream about you and you were in Darwin."
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.480]   And we were like, "No, no, no, no, no.
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:06.800]   That can't be right."
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:11.760]   However, we respected them enough to go and visit them.
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:14.160]   So we went and we visited.
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:17.120]   And while we were there, both my husband and I,
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.360]   I remember we were driving in the car
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:22.400]   heading out to one of the national parks.
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:25.960]   And I said, "Oh, what are you thinking?"
[00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.920]   And he said, "I think we're meant to be here."
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.600]   And I went, "Yeah, me too."
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:35.960]   So we packed up our four kids and we moved to Darwin.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.080]   And we actually lived with Darren and Kim
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:41.640]   for a number of weeks
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:45.080]   because we were searching for a house to rent.
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.480]   And it took some time.
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:50.120]   And I remember we had meals with them.
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:52.120]   Darren loved to cook on the barbecue.
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.120]   So we'd sit outside beside their pool
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:56.720]   and we'd barbecue together and have meals.
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:58.680]   And it was a really beautiful time.
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:03.280]   We'd only been in Darwin six months.
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:07.400]   And our pastor, our friend, our mentor, Darren,
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.000]   was killed in a car crash.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.320]   In fact, he had just been with my husband.
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:17.200]   Darren had visited him where my husband worked
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.680]   and they'd chatted.
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:22.480]   He'd given Glen a hug, hopped into his car,
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:26.520]   and about a kilometre away, he was hit by a big truck
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:28.320]   that just flattened the car.
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:34.360]   And I remember going to Kim's house that night
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:36.360]   and sitting on her bed.
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:39.080]   And we were just weeping together.
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:43.680]   And then she said,
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:49.200]   "God must have something pretty amazing planned
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.200]   "to come out of all of this."
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:58.880]   The gentle whispers and encouragement of the Holy Spirit,
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:02.360]   it didn't alter the heart-wrenching loss
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:04.840]   and it didn't change the circumstances.
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:09.800]   But I remember in the weeks and months that followed,
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:15.080]   months that should have been filled with chaos and despair,
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:18.120]   instead were filled with comfort.
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:23.960]   And we were given the strength and grace to lean in
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:27.120]   instead of lean away.
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:33.200]   We experienced, the church there experienced
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:37.480]   deep levels of comfort that held us and carried us.
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:42.960]   Andrew spoke last week of leaning into the person
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.760]   and the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:49.800]   In the last church-wide prayer and worship night
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.000]   that we held here,
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.960]   a word was given to us,
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:57.040]   a picture of what the Holy Spirit is doing amongst us.
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:01.600]   The picture was of a heart that had become hardened.
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:05.000]   It was encased in stone.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.280]   But then the stone began to crack
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:11.000]   and it looked like eggshell.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.960]   And then the work of the Holy Spirit came like water,
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:21.560]   coming and lifting the stone and washing it away.
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:27.760]   And as it did that, it revealed the red beating hearts
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.000]   of who we are truly meant to be,
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.320]   the fully alive version of ourselves.
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:39.840]   2 Corinthians 3:17 reminds us
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:43.080]   that where the spirit of the Lord is working,
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:45.360]   he brings freedom.
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:52.520]   Now we are going to get practical.
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:54.640]   And I know all the introverts are cringing,
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.400]   thinking, do I have to connect with someone?
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:00.080]   No, you don't, only the Holy Spirit.
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.960]   We are going to slow down
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.720]   and we are going to listen to the convicting voice
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:07.240]   of the Holy Spirit.
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:11.400]   You can use your phones,
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:16.400]   you can use your old school like me, your journal.
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:22.760]   You're going to write down whatever you hear
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:25.600]   and you're not going to overthink it.
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.160]   We have a great way of discounting
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:30.200]   the voice of the Holy Spirit.
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:33.320]   He speaks, we go, oh, that can't be the Holy Spirit.
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:36.720]   Whatever you hear, write it down.
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:41.640]   We are going to respond.
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:43.960]   So we're not only going to listen,
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:46.120]   but we're going to respond to what we hear.
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:52.120]   It's his kindness that leads us to repentance.
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:56.200]   You need to know that he comes,
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:27:00.080]   that his conviction comes with kindness.
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:06.400]   We're going to sit in what we hear
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:09.720]   and we're going to respond from our hearts.
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:18.200]   This isn't going to be about me,
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.120]   it's not going to be about any of the leadership here,
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:21.920]   this is a moment just for you
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:24.400]   and the Holy Spirit.
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:29.000]   Now maybe you're here today and you're not a Christian
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.360]   and you're thinking, well, this is going to be a waste
[00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:33.200]   of my time.
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:38.880]   Actually, you need to know that God
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.040]   has a real soft spot for you.
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:46.080]   In the Bible, there's a whole story
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:49.680]   where he leaves all the people who already know him
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:53.040]   and he goes and searches for the one that's lost.
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:56.120]   So actually this time is more for you
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:58.080]   than any other person in this room.
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:00.920]   You see, he's still speaking to you
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:02.520]   even if you don't know him yet.
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:05.360]   You can still hear him.
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:10.360]   So now we're going to take some time.
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:15.120]   Just you and the Holy Spirit.
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:19.920]   Imagine like my dad sitting beside me
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:21.760]   with his arm draped over me.
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:25.920]   That's how the Holy Spirit comes to us in gentleness.
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:29.120]   He sits beside us and he whispers
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:35.360]   and he reminds us of things that we need to hear,
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:40.360]   things we need to fix, things we need to let go of.
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:49.040]   So now, take this moment to listen.
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.480]   Don't just listen to him.
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.040]   Don't get distracted.
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:58.800]   If you're online, I hope that you are doing this
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:28:59.800]   with us as well.
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:02.920]   We invite you to join with us.
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:07.120]   Now we're going to take some time to sit
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:09.200]   in the comfort of the Holy Spirit.
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:14.880]   We're going to continue to listen to his gentle whispers
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:16.720]   and we're not going to rush.
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:19.720]   (gentle music)
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:23.360]   Once again, whatever you hear,
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:26.000]   you're going to write it down and you're going to sit.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.800]   Just sit in his presence.
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:35.520]   Last night as I was sleeping,
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.360]   I was kind of in and out of sleep
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:39.240]   as I was thinking about today.
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.880]   I think my mind was worried about being prepared
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:53.240]   and through it all, I just heard the Holy Spirit say,
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:58.240]   "Susanna, my presence is not dependent
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:00.160]   "on your preparedness.
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:06.800]   "My presence is determined by your welcome."
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:11.960]   And I was thinking about that on the bus on the way in
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:16.960]   and I looked up the Hebrew word for welcome
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:23.280]   and it means to bless the one who comes.
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:30.480]   And I thought, whoa, so many times I look to be blessed,
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:35.280]   but how many times have I blessed the Holy Spirit
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:37.680]   by making room for him
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.520]   and blessing him with my time
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:46.240]   and blessing him with my attention
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:50.880]   and blessing him with my obedience.
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:55.720]   So today as we listen to his comfort,
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:31:02.480]   choose to welcome him, to make space.
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:05.880]   He's with you already, but he's a gentleman.
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.760]   He only goes as far as we allow him.
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:14.080]   So welcome him, make space.
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:19.240]   Let your ears be attentive to what he is speaking
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:21.520]   into your life right now.
[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:25.480]   The worship team is gonna come,
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:29.440]   but we are not ending this.
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:43.160]   The Holy Spirit reminded me of a moment
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:48.320]   when I was a teenager and I was in a Christian conference
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:54.880]   for teenagers and the person who was preaching,
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:32:00.160]   I was standing at the altar call and he looked at me
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:03.960]   and he said, "The Holy Spirit is hovering over your life."
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:10.240]   And in that moment, I didn't fully understand
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:13.400]   what that meant, but I do now
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:18.200]   because the Holy Spirit across my life
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:23.200]   has been slowly bringing all the disorder into order,
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:32.480]   taking all the broken pieces and weaving his gold
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:38.520]   between those broken pieces and remaking this pot,
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:44.680]   giving me a beautiful story to tell.
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:51.640]   The Holy Spirit is hovering over all our lives.
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:59.000]   And this is not a moment just to be had and forgotten,
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.320]   but a moment to be carried into your everyday.
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:08.360]   You see, it doesn't matter if you're on a bus
[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:13.360]   or driving a car or having a shower or washing the dishes,
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:19.000]   he's present with you.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:25.720]   So welcome him and listen.
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:34.800]   He's working to make you
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:42.800]   the splitting image of Jesus.
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:45.880]   He's working to make you like Jesus.
[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:51.720]   He's working to restore,
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:58.560]   but it only works if we listen and we obey.
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:03.560]   So make this a daily thing
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:06.560]   where you're stopping and you're listening
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:08.360]   and you're responding.
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:11.480]   He's your best friend,
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:16.080]   but he will also bring out the best in you.
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:21.680]   He will convict you and he will comfort you.
[00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:29.280]   (gentle music)
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:36.000]   Father, we just all come to you right now and
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:43.960]   we carry such brokenness sometimes, God,
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:47.880]   such disorder and chaos at times.
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:53.480]   Holy Spirit, teach us to slow down,
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:57.240]   teach us to remove distractions
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:00.960]   and do the one thing that's needed
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:07.320]   to sit with you in your presence and listen and respond.
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:15.720]   We commit ourselves to you and we ask
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:19.480]   that we will have the courage to respond to the things
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:21.440]   that you talk to us about today.
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:27.440]   Father, if you've challenged some of us to be more generous
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:31.040]   with our time or money, give us the courage to respond.
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:36.480]   If you've challenged us to restore a broken relationship
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:41.480]   with your help, give us the courage to love well.
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:48.040]   If you've encouraged us to let things go,
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:57.960]   whatever that may be, to make more space and room.
[00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:03.840]   If you've told us to say no to a relationship
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:08.240]   because it's not the right one for us, give us courage.
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:14.280]   Help us to walk these things out
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:16.880]   that you've spoken to us about today
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:20.560]   and rest in the comfort that comes when we do respond.
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:24.440]   We just thank you for loving us,
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:31.160]   walking with us and persisting with us.
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:32.000]   Thank you.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.120]   Let's all stand, we're gonna worship together
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:38.440]   as we finish today.
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:41.040]   (gentle music)
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:43.720]   (bells chiming)
[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:46.400]   (bells chiming)
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:56.400]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
