1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 of the redemptive story of Jesus Christ,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 and that celebrates in the freedom and grace

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 that such a story brings.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 This church is not constricted by the walls of a building,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 but actively engaged in the community it is planted in,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 desiring for God's kingdom to take root

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 and bear fruit in local soil.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 A church that sees salvation as holistic,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 transforming God's people for God's work

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 and equipping a generation to represent God's heart

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 to the poor, the weak, the oppressed and the persecuted.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Imagine this church committed to seeing the family

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 as integral to all that it's called to be and do,

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 involving intentional, committed and authentic relationships

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 across all levels.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 It is the sort of place where both the young and the old

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 feel cared for, supported and equipped.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 A church where people of all backgrounds and traditions

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 come to feel at home, a cultural mosaic that honours

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 and embraces a richness in diversity

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 that marks us as the body of Christ.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 It is a church that is willing to innovate

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 and express faith creatively,

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 and it is a church that has the limitless limits

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 of God's creativity as glory to Him.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 A place where people gather, hungry for the presence of God,

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 and passionate to see this invade all aspects of their lives,

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 where they seek to develop an intelligent, spiritual faith,

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 rooted in God's word and driven with prayer.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 A church that does not make its Sunday services

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 but instead the comma in its ongoing sentence.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 A time of service, love and engagement

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 that inspires and emboldens all equally

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 for the conversation that lies ahead.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 A church that cares, disciples, rebuilds, renews.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 This is our city.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 This is our church.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 This is our home.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Good morning, everyone.

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Happy Sunday, church.

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Thank you.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Good morning, everybody.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 So great to see all of you.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Very colorful today.

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 It's a colorful Sunday.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Welcome to the Vine Yuen Long.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 So great to have all of you.

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 And yes, please feel free to settle.

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 This morning, as we were praying inside,

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 I thought of this word, "limit."

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 This past week, I've been feeling myself like,

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 "Wow, I'm so limited."

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 My body's limited.

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 I get sick all the time.

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 And 24 hours a day is very limited, right?

56
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Because all of us want to have 48 hours a day, right?

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 But then God kind of reminded me our God is limitless,

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 that He can do so much, more than we think.

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 And then kind of remind us,

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 why are we here on a Sunday together?

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Worshiping together and serving kids together

62
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 to praise and to encounter the God that is limitless God.

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 So now if I could invite all of you,

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 and let us get into a time of worship.

65
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 And I just want to read Psalm to you.

66
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Psalm 139 says,

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 "I praise you because I'm fearfully and wonderfully made.

68
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Your works are wonderful.

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 I know that full well.

70
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 My frame was not hidden from you

71
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 when I was made in the secret place.

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 When I was woven together in the depths of the earth,

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 your eyes saw my unformed body.

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 All the days ordained for me were written in your book.

75
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 And before one of them came to be,

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 how precious to me are your thoughts, God.

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 How vast is the sum of them.

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Were I to count them,

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 they would outnumber the grains of sand.

80
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 And when I awake, I'm still with you."

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Let us pray.

82
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Father, we come before you

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 because your love for us is so great.

84
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 And because we're fear--because we're wonderfully made,

85
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 and we just want to come before you and praise you,

86
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 praise your good work, and praise your love, Lord.

87
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 And Lord, I just pray that you open our hearts today

88
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 as we come and worship and sing praise.

89
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 And these are more than just words.

90
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 These are our love to you, Lord.

91
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 Lord, we love you, we welcome you,

92
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 and may your spirit come.

93
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 May your spirit come now.

95
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 Let's worship change.

96
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 Are you hurting and broken within?

97
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 Overwhelmed by the weight of your sin?

98
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Jesus is calling.

99
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 Have you come to the end of yourself?

100
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 Do you thirst for a drink from the well?

101
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Jesus is calling.

102
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 Let's sing it.

103
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 O come to me, O come.

104
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 The Father's arms are open wide.

105
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 Forgiveness was bought with

106
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 the precious blood of Jesus Christ.

107
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 Jesus Christ.

108
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Leave behind your regrets and mistakes.

109
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 Come today, there's no reason to waste.

110
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 Jesus is calling.

111
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 Yes, Jesus.

112
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 Free your sorrows and train them for joy.

113
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 From the ashes a new life is born.

114
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Jesus is calling.

115
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Yes.

116
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Let's sing it.

117
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 O come to me, O come.

118

 The Father's arms are open wide.

 the precious blood of Jesus Christ.

121
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 O come to the altar.

122
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 The Father's arms are open wide.

123
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 Forgiveness was bought with

124
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 the precious blood of Jesus Christ.

125
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,000

249
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 >> Hello, I just want to say welcome again, everybody, to the Vine Yunlong.

250
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 Welcome, everybody.

251
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 Now, the Vine Yunlong, it's actually one church in two locations, one in Yunlong and one in Wan Chai.

252
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 And so for those perhaps who are screaming online or maybe you're visiting from Wan Chai, we welcome all of you here today.

253
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 And for anyone first time in the Vine Yunlong here, anybody, if you can, raise your hand.

254
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 Oh, there's -- what are you waiting your hand, Emmanuel?

255
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 Over there, welcome.

256
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 Anybody on the side?

257
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 Oh, there are a couple here.

258
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 And I know there's one here as well.

259
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 Welcome, all of you.

260
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 So great to see you here.

261
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 Perhaps our brother and sister can give them a warm welcome, tell them a little bit more about who we are and perhaps, you know, our time of service and what's going on.

262
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 For those who are not -- on this side.

263
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 For those who don't know, we have a WhatsApp channel.

264
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 So if you can just take out your phone, scan this QR code, then you'll be able to join our channel.

265
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 Now, you might concern, huh, then everybody will know my phone number, you know.

266
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 We know this concern.

267
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 So this is only a one-way channel.

268
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 It will only be you receiving information from us at church about the latest service or events that we're having.

269
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 So also, if you were in the previous WhatsApp channel group, this is a new one due to technical issues.

270
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 So you might have to scan it again and rejoin the newest group.

271
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 So if you know friends that they were in the previous group but not in the new one, you might want to help us to tell them.

272
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 Is that all right?

273
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 Yeah?

274
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 Great.

275
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 All right.

276
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 Now, we have so many beautiful, energetic children, all of us here.

277
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 So can we reach out our hands and pray for them as they go for their kids' time, K4C, Kids for Christ.

278
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 All right.

279
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 Lord, we thank you for these beautiful children that you've blessed us with.

280
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 Not only they're energetic, but they are our hope, the next generation, Lord.

281
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 Just pray that in the time of K4C that they will continue to learn about your words and learn about truth and have a really good time and build relationship with other kids and teachers as well.

282
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 And most importantly, Lord, I pray that all of them will build good and intimate relationship with you.

283
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 Lord, we thank you and may you bless the teachers as well, that they will have a wonderful time together.

284
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 In Jesus' name we pray.

285
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 Amen.

286
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 All right.

287
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 So, we're going to take a moment to pray for our friends.

288
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 You may take your kids to the rooms accordingly.

289
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 And now, this is a moment where we get to say hello to our friends, our neighbors, or people that you don't know.

290
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 Maybe you can ask them what is their highlight of last week.

291
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 All right?

292
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 Let's go.

300
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 All right.

301
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 I believe everybody's back.

302
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 All right, great.

303
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 Now, we have a couple announcements for this week.

304
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 The next, the first one is right now we're having an upcoming EGM, Extraordinary General Meeting.

305
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 Now, what is this?

306
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 It's, as I mentioned earlier, we're a One Church Two Lakes occasion.

307
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 So, for those of you who have come from One Chi, the Vine, you probably will know what EGM is.

308
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 And now, we are actually going to vote for a new elder, Ming Xu.

309
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 So, if you are registered as a Divine member, you will already receive an email.

310
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 So, if you're not sure, you might have forgotten, go check your email and see if you are a member.

311
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 If you are, you will be sent information about, you can vote for the newest elder, because the Vine is actually an independent church that we don't belong to any denomination.

312
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 So, we have our own governing body with eldership.

313
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 So, with the Vine, we have around eight elders right now, right?

314
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 And then, we're going to, hopefully, we'll have an additional one.

315
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 And then, that's why this voting is for.

316
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 So, if you're a member, we encourage you to participate.

317
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 Check your email, and we invite you to either attend in person, or you can do it by a proxy form, which means you can ask a friend to vote for you.

318
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 So, all the details will be included in the email.

319
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 If you're not sure, you can always ask Ivan or team.

320
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 Yes.

321
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 Now, then you might wonder, what about us, Divine Yuen Long here?

322
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 Now, we're a new church.

323
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 We're progressing.

324
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 We're now currently obtaining a charity status, which means in the future, near future, we will have our own membership as Divine and Wan Chai as well.

325
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 But bear with us.

326
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 Be patient.

327
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 When we have the latest information, we'll let you know.

328
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 Okay?

329
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 And if you have any questions regarding membership or EGM, feel free to talk to Ivan and team after the service.

330
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 All right.

331
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 Perfect.

332
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 Now, let me see.

333
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 Okay.

334
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 And next is we have our prayer meeting, which is upcoming Tuesday here in Divine Yuen Long from 8 to 9.30.

335
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 So, if you want to be, if you've been coming to Divine Yuen Long for some time and you really see it as your family, or if not, we welcome you to join.

336
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 Together in prayers, we get to bless one another and pray for the church.

337
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 And also, it's our heart in Yuen Long, Divine, is to pray for the community.

338
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 So, we welcome you to join.

339
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 If you haven't, come check it out.

340
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 It's actually really fun.

341
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 All right.

342
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 Why are you laughing?

343
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 All right.

344
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 And next is we have our youth ministry coming up.

345
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 So, we mentioned -- all right, give me a big cheers for us.

346
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 Woo!

347
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 [Applause]

348
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 I remember in the beginning, there were people, I'm like, where's the youth ministry?

349
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 I'm like, not yet.

350
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 We haven't, you know.

351
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 But now it's happening.

352
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 It's been almost a year, and it's happening now.

353
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 So, we already talked about it.

354
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 Now we're recruiting volunteers.

355
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 So, if you're hot to serve youth, or you want to find a little bit more, maybe you're not sure.

356
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 Maybe you're like, do I want to?

357
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 Do I not want to?

358
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 This is the perfect meeting for you to attend, okay?

359
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 Now, this is just an info session, one hour.

360
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 Chapman will give you a bit more information about what this is and maybe what we need help with, okay?

361
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 So, we encourage you to come.

362
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 Don't worry, even you come, you don't have to be in it, okay?

363
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 It's complete voluntary, and it's just for you to find a little bit more.

364
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 Perhaps you come, you don't want to be in the part of ministry, but you can always pray for the youth ministry.

365
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 Is that okay?

366
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 Lovely, okay.

367
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 And also, if you have friends, families, or even you guys are youth, you want to find a little bit more,

368
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 after service today, you can come over to the side and maybe talk to Chapman, right, about this ministry.

369
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 And he'll give you more about the information.

370
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 All right.

371
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 So, I think that's all for the announcements.

372
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 Now, this is time of continual worship and offering.

373
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 Here at the Vine, we can offer in so many ways.

374
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 We can do it digitally, or we have our buckets.

375
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 Thank you, Welcome Team.

376
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 And today, I just really want to read this scripture, because this scripture is always here, but I'm not sure if you've seen it.

377
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 I just really want to read it together, because I feel really called to.

378
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 So, it's 2 Corinthians 9, 7-8.

379
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 It said, "Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion.

380
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 For God loves a cheerful giver, and God is able to bless you abundantly.

381
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 So that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you are bound in every good work."

382
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 Let us pray together, Church.

383
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 Lord, we thank you for your provision, and thank you that we can call ourselves children of God.

384
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 And Lord, all that you've blessed us, Lord, today, and every day in our lives, we live it up to you.

385
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 And we come and we offer with a cheerful heart, that may you use this money and our heart towards your ministry, for this community,

386
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 for all the good work that you're about to do here in Yuen Long.

387
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 And Lord, we trust you, and may you give us all wisdom to manage and to glorify you in all the ministry that we're doing here.

388
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

389
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 Thank you very much.

390
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 Now, let's invite our speaker today, Pastor Tim.

391
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 Let's give him a big hand.

392
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 This morning, Tim and I were like, everybody's so tired, and we're like, "Yeah, come on, so excited!"

393
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 Right? I hope you're excited.

394
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 I'm excited.

395
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 Okay, good.

396
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 He was more excited than earlier.

397
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 All right, shall we raise our hands and pray for him?

398
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 Father, we thank you so much for Tim.

399
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 We thank you for all the energy he brings to this church, and all his vision, and his heart.

400
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 And most importantly, Lord, his heart to serve you, and to bring your words to your people.

401
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 Lord, I pray you just give him wisdom as he preaches, and as he shares your words to the congregation.

402
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 And that his words be full of power, full of truth, and full of boldness.

403
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 And Lord, may you open our hearts to receive his words, Lord.

404
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 Thank you, Jesus, and in your name we pray.

405
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 Amen.

406
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 Amen. Thank you, Francesca.

407
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 Well, it's great to see everyone.

408
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 And I want to start off, when I was in 2000, actually I don't know when it was, it was a long time ago.

409
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 I don't even think it was 2000.

410
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 When I was 15 years old, I had a friend that lived about two hours away.

411
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 And so I used to visit him on extended holidays with a train, or sometimes he came and saw me.

412
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 And on one occasion, I got on the train, I had a basketball magazine.

413
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 This was before the times of like having your smartphone, so I like, there was nothing to do.

414
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 So I had a magazine.

415
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 I find a compartment where there's six seats in one compartment.

416
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 That's how they used to have trains in Germany.

417
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 So I sit down where there's nobody else.

418
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 I'm like, this is awesome. I'm by myself.

419
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 I start reading.

420
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 And then a guy comes in, a young man older than me, sits right across from me.

421
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 I'm like, why did he sit right across from me?

422
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 There's all this space.

423
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 Come on.

424
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 And the first thing he says to me is, you're a Christian, aren't you?

425
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 He's like, what?

426
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 It's like, no, you have to know I've never have seen this guy before in my life.

427
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 I have no idea who he is.

428
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 So in my mind, my wheels are turning.

429
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 I was like, what does this guy want from me?

430
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 He doesn't introduce himself.

431
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 He doesn't say hello.

432
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 He starts off with, you're a Christian.

433
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 What does he want?

434
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 Do I want to say that I'm a Christian?

435
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 So I had a choice to make.

436
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 Am I going to step out in faith and say, yes, I'm a Christian, or am I going to remain in hiding?

437
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 Now, what you also don't know is I have just become a Christian.

438
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 So I'm a new Christian, my baby Christian.

439
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 And so before this point, I had never publicly told anyone that I was a Christian, besides people in church.

440
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 So I ended up telling him, yes, I'm a Christian.

441
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 And we had an amazing conversation for the entire train ride, talking about faith, all sorts of things.

442
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 And as I was reflecting on that experience, I realized that God was calling me, through this guy's question, to a greater faith.

443
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 That he was calling me to step out in faith and publicly declare, yes, I'm a Christian.

444
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 And what I also didn't know was that on that weekend, as I was heading to see my friend, it was important for me to have my clear identity of who I am, what I'm going to do, and what I'm not going to do.

445
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 So God worked through this encounter.

446
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:57,000
 Now, God doesn't only just, or has not just done it in that specific circumstance.

447
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 Actually, part of our discipleship journey is that there is times where Jesus calls us to greater faith.

448
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 Maybe it's trusting him with a job search, and he's teaching you to trust him, that he can provide, and he's asking you to trust yourself to him.

449
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 For me, it was trusting to say I'm a Christian in this awkward situation, that this guy doesn't have some weird, bad agenda.

450
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 But right now, as we're going through the Longing for Healing sermon series that we started last week, I believe that the Holy Spirit wants to stir some faith among us.

451
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 He's calling us to a deeper faith in the type of feeling that Jesus is powerful to do in our lives, and that Jesus is powerful to do in your lives, and in this community's life.

452
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 Amen?

453
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 And so, Jesus calls us out of our comfort and routines to turn to him in faith to receive his restoring and healing work.

454
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 He wants to break some of those comfort and some of that routine that we're right now living in.

455
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 He's calling us to step out of that.

456
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 So that's what we're going to be looking at today.

457
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 But we're continuing in our message series, Longing for Healing.

458
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 This is the second week.

459
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 The thing that we're looking at is that Jesus is the one in whom there is help, healing, wholeness, and he's the only one who can fully deliver that.

460
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:43,000
 He's the only one who has the power to do this work in our lives.

461
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 And so, as you look at the Gospels, and we're going to look at a story of an encounter between Jesus and a woman today.

462
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:59,000
 And as you look at these encounters, a lot of times people come with the obvious need to Jesus, the one that's very visible.

463
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 A lot of times that's a physical need.

464
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 And so they bring their physical need to Jesus, and Jesus heals the physical need.

465
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 But he actually does a deeper healing.

466
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:17,000
 Because we don't just need healing physically, we need healing spiritually, emotionally, mentally, socially.

467
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 And Jesus cares about all of who we are, a whole person.

468
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:34,000
 And so my prayer for this series is that we will see and that we will experience that Jesus did not just heal back then, but he heals here today.

469
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:49,000
 That he has the power to bring restoration, healing, wholeness, where we're feeling broken, where we are carrying hurt, where we are carrying pain.

470
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:58,000
 And not only does he want to do that in our lives, so he wants us to receive that, but he also wants us to be agents who bring healing to others.

471
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,000
 Because one way that God works a lot of times is actually through loving community.

472
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 That he brings healing to people's lives through other people who point others to Jesus, who show the love of Jesus, the grace of Jesus to people, and walk with people.

473
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 So that's my prayer for this series, that we see how Jesus can bring healing into our life in deeper and unexpected ways.

474
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:31,000
 And that we can also see that he calls us to be agents of healing in other people's lives, so that we can pass this on to others.

475
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 So today we're in the Gospel of Mark.

476
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 Let me set the context for the story that we're going to look at.

477
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
 So the story we're looking at, it's actually found in between another story.

478
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:50,000
 So there's a story that begins, then there's our story, and then that other story continues.

479
00:45:50,000 --> 00:46:03,000
 So Jairus, who was a leader in the synagogue, well-respected, honored man, his daughter is lying in bed and she is dying.

480
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:14,000
 And so he has heard about Jesus, he goes to Jesus, he asks for Jesus to come to lay hands on his daughter, to heal her, to deliver her from this death.

481
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,000
 And Jesus agrees, and he goes with Jesus.

482
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:27,000
 And so they're on their way, they're walking to his house, and this is where our story interrupts that story.

483
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:34,000
 So that's where we're going to pick up, we're in Mark chapter 5, verse 24b, and that's where we're going to start reading.

484
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:43,000
 A large crowd followed and pressed around him, and a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for 12 years.

485
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:54,000
 She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors, and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better, she grew worse.

486
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak, because she thought, "If I touch his clothes, I will be healed."

487
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:15,000
 Immediately her bleeding stopped, and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering.

488
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,000
 At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him.

489
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
 He turned around in the crowd and asked, "Who touched my clothes?"

490
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:31,000
 "You see the people crowding against you," the disciples answered, "and yet you ask who touched me?"

491
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:36,000
 But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it.

492
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:46,000
 Then a woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet, and trembling with fear, told him the whole truth.

493
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:55,000
 He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering."

494
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:04,000
 Now at the beginning of this story, we learn about the specifics of this woman's prolonged suffering.

495
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,000
 This has been going on for a very long time. Twelve years, we're told.

496
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:16,000
 She is experiencing bleeding. It's not the normal menstrual bleeding. It's a uterine bleeding.

497
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:23,000
 It's just ongoing. It's a medical condition, and it's causing her a lot of pain, a lot of shame.

498
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:31,000
 But we also have to know the cultural context that she's having this medical condition in.

499
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:39,000
 Because during that time, if you had uterine bleeding, you would be considered as an unclean person.

500
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,000
 So they have this concept of clean and unclean, and she would be considered unclean.

501
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:50,000
 What that means is if she touches anyone, if she sits down anywhere, then there needs to be cleansing.

502
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
 The person needs to wash their clothes. They need to bathe themselves.

503
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:01,000
 So not only is she experiencing this physical pain, but she's also experiencing social and emotional pain.

504
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:08,000
 Because she's really cut off from normal human relationships.

505
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
 So this has an incredible impact on her.

506
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,000
 She's also not able to go to the temple. She's not able to go into the synagogue.

507
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,000
 So she's also cut off from a spiritual life and community.

508
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:25,000
 On top of that, to add pain to pain, she most likely is not able to marry,

509
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:30,000
 and because of her medical condition, also not able to have children.

510
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:36,000
 So we can see these are just layers of suffering.

511
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:43,000
 But then we're also told that she suffered a great deal under many doctors.

512
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:52,000
 As I was reading this, I'm familiar with this passage, but this had never stood out to me before.

513
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:59,000
 She suffered a great deal under many doctors, and I just wonder, what treatments did they take her through?

514
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:04,000
 Was it humiliating? Was it traumatizing? Was it painful?

515
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:15,000
 Were there just expectations where every time she had hope that she would be healed, and then it was just crushed?

516
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:20,000
 And we're told that she spent all her money.

517
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:25,000
 So this used to be a woman of means, but she lost all her money.

518
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:33,000
 So she's also on top of it, living in poverty, and that with all the medical treatment, she actually just got worse.

519
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:40,000
 But the one thing that we do see in her is that there is this longing, just this desire to be healed, to be well.

520
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:47,000
 And she has done everything that she knows how to do, but nothing has worked.

521
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:53,000
 Now, the reason why I wanted to slow down, a lot of times you can read past this suffering quickly,

522
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
 and almost not notice it or feel it.

523
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:05,000
 But I wanted us to see it, to actually see this woman, to not just brush past her.

524
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:17,000
 Now, I also know that some of us here have actually been carrying pain and suffering for a very long time.

525
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:22,000
 Maybe it's also been multiple years.

526
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:35,000
 And I just want to say that I'm so thankful and grateful that you're here, and that we love you.

527
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:43,000
 And that my hope is that in this community, you can find friendship, you can find support,

528
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:50,000
 and you also can encounter the healing and the loving presence of Jesus.

529
00:51:50,000 --> 00:52:00,000
 That's my heart.

530
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:07,000
 So God's Word tells us that even as Christians, we will experience suffering in this world.

531
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
 This is part of human experience.

532
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:16,000
 Suffering, pain, and death, they're not God's will for life.

533
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
 That's not what we were created for.

534
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
 But they are unavoidable aspects of this world in its broken condition.

535
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:27,000
 And last week we looked at creation, fall, redemption, new creation.

536
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:34,000
 We looked at how the sin fall impacted every aspect of our lives,

537
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
 and brought damage to every aspect of our lives.

538
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,000
 So this is part of living in a fallen world.

539
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
 So we don't have to feel surprised if we experience suffering and pain.

540
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:51,000
 At one point or another, most of us experience this, if we're just honest.

541
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:56,000
 And it also doesn't mean that God is specifically trying to target you with what's happening,

542
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:01,000
 that He's somewhat angry with you.

543
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,000
 So this is the reality of living in a broken world.

544
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:13,000
 And God's Word, one thing that it does do is it encourages us to bring a brokenness and our pain to Jesus,

545
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,000
 who is healer, who is savior.

546
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,000
 Now we don't always understand why in one instance a person is healed,

547
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
 and in another instance a person is not healed.

548
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:30,000
 We don't understand why healing sometimes is a process, and sometimes it's instantaneous.

549
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,000
 I met a person that used to be addicted to heroin and strong drugs,

550
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,000
 and he had an instantaneous healing where Jesus delivered him from those drugs.

551
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
 Amazing.

552
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:47,000
 And there are others where it's struggles and it's therapy and a long time of getting out of it.

553
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
 We don't always understand why things work that way.

554
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:56,000
 What we do know is that through Jesus' death and resurrection, heaven has come down.

555
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
 The kingdom of God has broken into this world.

556
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:12,000
 Now through Jesus, healing, restoration, hope, help, love is available in him.

557
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,000
 I'm actually going to quote Pastor Chapman from last week's Cantonese service.

558
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:22,000
 Now I did not understand what he said, but I do get to read the script in English.

559
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
 So he said this. I thought he said it perfectly.

560
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:29,000
 "When we see healing, we see the already of the kingdom of God.

561
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,000
 And when we haven't seen healing, we see the not yet.

562
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:41,000
 But even if healing doesn't happen now, it will always happen when the kingdom of God is fully realized."

563
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:47,000
 Now that's the biblical sort of background to our whole longing for healing conversation.

564
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
 But the one thing that scripture does make very clear in our passage today,

565
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
 it makes very clear that we are called to bring our brokenness,

566
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,000
 that we're called to bring our pain to Jesus because he is powerful.

567
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
 He is able to heal. He is able to restore.

568
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:07,000
 And so we can't control these other things, and we don't understand them,

569
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
 and there's some mystery to that.

570
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,000
 But we know what we can do, and that's come to Jesus.

571
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,000
 And that's what we're encouraged to do, to bring ourselves to him.

572
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:24,000
 And unlike those doctors that the woman went to, we never leave Jesus feeling more broken.

573
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:30,000
 But we always, after encountering Jesus, we feel his love, his loving presence.

574
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,000
 We feel better.

575
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
 And he does not put us to shame when we turn to him.

576
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,000
 He does not put us to shame when we come to him with our mess,

577
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:46,000
 sometimes our sinfulness, our brokenness.

578
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
 But let's continue looking at the scripture.

579
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:55,000
 So in verse 27, we're told that the bleeding woman, that she heard about Jesus.

580
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,000
 So words have been spreading about Jesus that in him there is healing.

581
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,000
 So it stirs in her heart, and it raises hope inside of her.

582
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,000
 And so in her mind she thinks, "If I can only touch his cloak,

583
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,000
 if I can only touch his clothes, I'm going to be healed."

584
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,000
 So she sneaks up behind Jesus, touches his clothes,

585
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:20,000
 and we're told in verse 29 that immediately her bleeding stopped,

586
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,000
 and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering.

587
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
 It's amazing. Praise Jesus.

588
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,000
 An absolutely incredible healing.

589
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,000
 Now, why did she sneak up on Jesus?

590
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
 Earlier, Jairus, actually he goes publicly to Jesus.

591
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
 He doesn't have to sneak up to her.

592
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:46,000
 Why does she have to sneak up to Jesus, or feels like she has to sneak up to Jesus?

593
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:51,000
 Well, it has to do with what I explained earlier, because she feels unclean.

594
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
 Or that's what society tells her.

595
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:57,000
 Society tells you you're a walking contamination.

596
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:03,000
 She feels unworthy, and she doesn't feel like she can come just face to face with Jesus.

597
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
 So she does the only thing that she knows how to do,

598
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:11,000
 and just comes to him from behind, touches his clothes.

599
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:18,000
 And I just wonder if there are some of us who can relate to how this woman felt about herself

600
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
 and about coming to Jesus.

601
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,000
 I know I have felt that way in the past.

602
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
 I remember I really used to resonate with the lyrics from a song,

603
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
 "I'm too messed up for love."

604
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
 I'm going to try to write a whole--it's like a rap.

605
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
 It's like, "Will you take me as I am?

606
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
 I know the way that I'm living is wrong, but I can change on my own trying to make it along.

607
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:46,000
 I wonder how could you love me with my life so ugly that you laid down your life for me?"

608
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
 That's how I felt.

609
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:54,000
 I felt that my life was so ugly, and I knew it, because it's full of sin and brokenness.

610
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:59,000
 So I was ashamed.

611
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:04,000
 But let's continue verse 30, and I'll read 30 through 32.

612
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,000
 "At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him.

613
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,000
 He turned around in the crowd and asked, 'Who touched my clothes?'

614
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:17,000
 'You see the people crowding against you,' the disciples answered.

615
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,000
 'And yet you can ask who touched me?'

616
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:26,000
 But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it."

617
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:31,000
 Now, I just picture Jesus on the NPR.

618
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
 Anyone with me?

619
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:40,000
 Rush hour, somewhere around Admiralty or one of those points where there's so much going on.

620
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:45,000
 Everybody's pushing against you on every side.

621
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
 Everybody's clothes are touching with other people's clothes.

622
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
 And then Jesus says, "Who touched my clothes?"

623
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:57,000
 The disciples, "What are you talking about? Everybody's touching everyone's clothes."

624
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:05,000
 But what they didn't know is that Jesus had felt a power going out from him.

625
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:11,000
 And so he continues to look around, and he's not swayed by the disciples to stop.

626
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
 Now, let me ask this question.

627
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:20,000
 Why does Jesus continue to look for the person who has touched him?

628
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,000
 Why not just wink at the woman?

629
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:29,000
 "I know what you did. It's okay, and I'm just going to let you go in peace."

630
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,000
 Why did he do that?

631
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:37,000
 Why didn't Jesus--she already has been carrying so much shame.

632
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,000
 Why make her step out from the crowd?

633
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,000
 Well, let me explain.

634
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,000
 Now, the woman, she did receive physical healing.

635
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,000
 When she touched his clothes.

636
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
 That was amazing.

637
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:59,000
 But it was actually her shame that made her just sneak up on Jesus.

638
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:06,000
 And it was also her shame that was now at work in her heart as Jesus is asking, "Who touched me?"

639
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,000
 And obviously this must have taken a while because the way it's described in Scripture,

640
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
 she didn't just jump out immediately.

641
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,000
 There was some delay.

642
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,000
 And so she's still carrying this shame in her heart.

643
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:25,000
 And it almost keeps her from stepping out into the presence of Jesus,

644
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:30,000
 into the face-to-face with Jesus.

645
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
 Now, Brene Brown, some of you know her.

646
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:37,000
 She's a well-known author, a professor, researcher, especially on the topic around shame.

647
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
 She defines shame this way.

648
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:46,000
 "Shame is the intensely painful feeling or experience of believing that we are flawed

649
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:53,000
 and therefore unworthy of love and belonging."

650
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:58,000
 So the woman, she had internalized society's messages about herself.

651
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:05,000
 Unclean, unworthy, dishonored.

652
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:10,000
 She was carrying shame.

653
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
 Now, a while ago, I moved back to California.

654
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,000
 So I'm moving back and forth between different countries.

655
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:23,000
 And I had to go to the Department of Motor Vehicle, which is known in California as DMV.

656
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,000
 Now, in other parts of the U.S., you go to DMV, you're served right away.

657
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
 You're in, you're out.

658
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:37,000
 And California is notorious for these eternal lines where you go in and you want service,

659
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
 and it takes three, four hours, you're just standing there.

660
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:45,000
 So I needed to renew my driver's license because my license had expired like forever ago.

661
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
 So I'm standing in line.

662
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
 I don't know, it's probably already an hour and a half.

663
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,000
 And then this person, this man who is experiencing homelessness, he comes up to me.

664
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,000
 He needs a government ID.

665
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,000
 And he asked me if I can help him fill out a form because he just couldn't do it.

666
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:05,000
 His body through living on the streets was so impacted, he wasn't able to do that anymore.

667
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
 So I was like, "Sure, I'd be happy to help."

668
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
 So I fill out the form, I work with him.

669
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
 We get to the part about organ donation.

670
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
 So I asked him, "Do you want to be an organ donor?"

671
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:19,000
 He says, "Me? I'm filth.

672
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:24,000
 Who would want my organs?"

673
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:33,000
 And that just broke my heart that he saw himself as filth, that that's how he understood himself.

674
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:39,000
 Yes, he most likely was drinking, using drugs, all of those things.

675
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:45,000
 But we know that every single person is created in the image of God,

676
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:54,000
 that every single person is lovable, beautiful creation from God.

677
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,000
 And so we're not filth.

678
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:03,000
 But that's what society told him that he was in his experience of being homeless.

679
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,000
 Now that reminds me of the woman when I read the story,

680
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:15,000
 that she had internalized these messages that she was unclean, unworthy, unlovable.

681
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
 That then became her identity.

682
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:23,000
 That's who she thought she was.

683
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:32,000
 And her shame was a real barrier that was standing between her and Jesus.

684
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:38,000
 And her shame almost kept her from receiving what Jesus wanted to do in her life.

685
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,000
 Because he didn't just want to heal her physically.

686
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:47,000
 There was more work to be done.

687
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,000
 And so Jesus calls her out.

688
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
 He doesn't let it go.

689
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
 He wants her to step forward.

690
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:58,000
 He wants her to take a step of faith.

691
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,000
 And then she steps forward, trembling with fear.

692
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
 There's courage.

693
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
 There's vulnerability.

694
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,000
 Verse 33 describes it, says this,

695
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
 "Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet,

696
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:18,000
 trembling with fear, told him the whole truth."

697
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:26,000
 So that means she stepped into the presence, the loving presence of Jesus.

698
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:31,000
 Instead of sneaking up on him, and an impersonal encounter with him,

699
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:37,000
 she now is having a personal encounter with Jesus.

700
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,000
 And she tells him the whole truth.

701
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
 So we're not told exactly what that all entails,

702
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:47,000
 but at the very least this entails her desiring and longing for healing,

703
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:54,000
 and touching his clothes, and in her, experience miraculous physical healing.

704
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
 And when we read about trembling with fear,

705
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,000
 now this can be for many reasons.

706
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:07,000
 Maybe she was trembling with fear because of the whole clean, unclean thing,

707
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
 and she touched him, and thereby defiled him.

708
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,000
 She was like, "Maybe Jesus is going to get angry with me."

709
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
 And then I touched him.

710
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
 Once he finds out.

711
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:23,000
 Or perhaps she thought maybe she stole some power from Jesus,

712
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:27,000
 because her understanding of how Jesus works is probably--

713
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,000
 it's actually informed more by superstitions and beliefs of the time,

714
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
 that holy men, when they had clothes, you touch them,

715
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,000
 there's healing power in the clothes.

716
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,000
 So she may have thought that, "Oh, I stole power illegitimately of Jesus,

717
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
 and he's going to be angry."

718
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:46,000
 And then finally, another reason is that she had experienced healing,

719
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:50,000
 and it raises the question, "Who is Jesus?"

720
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:54,000
 Because none of those doctors could heal me, but Jesus healed me.

721
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,000
 And so there's a--it's like dawning on her,

722
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:04,000
 "Could it be that Jesus is God with us?"

723
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,000
 And so she's trembling and stepping in front of Jesus.

724
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
 Now, she does not know how Jesus is going to respond.

725
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,000
 We know because I read the story earlier, or you might know the story.

726
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
 But she does not know.

727
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,000
 And here's how Jesus responds.

728
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:21,000
 He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you.

729
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:28,000
 Go in peace and be freed from your suffering."

730
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
 So Jesus is not angry with her touching him.

731
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:34,000
 Actually, that never made him angry because he can make people clean.

732
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
 He can restore people.

733
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
 That never bothered Jesus.

734
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,000
 That bothered other people.

735
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
 And through his actions, he's telling her, "You are worthy.

736
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
 You're worthy of my time.

737
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
 You're worthy of my attention.

738
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:52,000
 You're worthy of me stopping in the middle of heading to this very important person

739
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,000
 who is very wealthy, who has all the honor.

740
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:03,000
 You're worthy for me to stop and to give you all of my attention,

741
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:11,000
 to not let go of this moment, of this greater thing that I want to do in your life."

742
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:19,000
 And so he speaks these incredible words over her.

743
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:24,000
 "Daughter, my daughter."

744
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,000
 And so he's restoring her, her broken identity.

745
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:32,000
 She was having self-talk that said, "I'm unclean.

746
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
 I'm unworthy."

747
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
 But Jesus says, "You're worthy.

748
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,000
 You're my daughter."

749
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,000
 And what that also means is, "You are part of my family.

750
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
 You're part of the family of God."

751
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,000
 That's what Jesus says.

752
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
 "You belong.

753
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,000
 I love you."

754
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:58,000
 He also tells her that it is her faith that has healed her.

755
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:08,000
 So he corrects her mysterious understanding of a faith and how God works through that.

756
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:15,000
 So to answer the question, "Why did Jesus insist that she steps out?"

757
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,000
 Well, it's because he loves her too much to just let her walk away.

758
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:23,000
 He loves her too much to just let her have this impersonal encounter with Jesus

759
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
 and then to slip out.

760
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:29,000
 He wants her to know that she is lovable, that she is worthy.

761
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
 He wants to restore.

762
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,000
 He wants to bring healing where there's been emotional pain and shame

763
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
 that she's been carrying.

764
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:39,000
 And so he does this beautiful healing, restoring work in her life.

765
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:45,000
 Not only that, now instead of leaving not knowing and maybe even having all these questions

766
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:50,000
 and leaving with her emotional pain, with her social pain,

767
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:57,000
 now she is part of Jesus' family, daughter.

768
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
 She's part of the family of God.

769
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:05,000
 She's leaving the personal relationship with Jesus from this encounter.

770
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:12,000
 And that's where true and full healing is found, is in that personal relationship with Jesus.

771
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,000
 Because when we step into that relationship every time,

772
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:23,000
 it's the loving and healing presence of Jesus that wants to meet us.

773
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:27,000
 Now where does that leave us?

774
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,000
 Jesus is not afraid of your pain.

775
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
 He's not afraid of your brokenness.

776
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
 He's not afraid of your sin.

777
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:39,000
 He's not afraid of your shame that you might be carrying.

778
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:44,000
 He just welcomes us to come to Him with whatever has happened in our lives,

779
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:52,000
 whatever you have done, and to open our heart to Him.

780
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:57,000
 And He calls us forth like He called forth the woman to faith, to greater faith,

781
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:03,000
 because He wants you to experience His healing, His power in your life.

782
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:08,000
 He wants you to experience His emotional healing, social healing, forgiveness from sins,

783
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
 whatever it is, physical healing.

784
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:16,000
 He calls you, calls me to step forward in faith.

785
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:25,000
 Now a professor of mine, he says this, "Faith opens the door to the power of God."

786
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:29,000
 So when the woman decided that she believes that Jesus somehow can heal her,

787
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:33,000
 and she didn't fully understand even who He was, she didn't have a clear picture,

788
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:39,000
 but her faith was erected towards Him.

789
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
 And it was God worked through her faith.

790
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
 Faith opens the door of the power of God in our lives.

791
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:51,000
 So when we come to Jesus with faith, it opens the door of the power of God in our lives

792
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:56,000
 that brings healing and restoration.

793
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
 So how much faith do you have to have?

794
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:02,000
 Do you have to have super faith, a little bit medium faith?

795
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
 Sounds like a steak.

796
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
 Little faith?

797
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:11,000
 Or what, very well?

798
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:16,000
 No, all it takes is just faith that's enough to come to Jesus.

799
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,000
 It's not about your amazing and incredible faith.

800
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,000
 All you need is just to turn to Jesus and say, "Jesus, help!

801
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
 Help, Jesus!

802
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,000
 I need you.

803
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,000
 I need you to work in this area of my life.

804
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,000
 Help, Jesus."

805
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:40,000
 Now I want to invite the worship team to come up right now.

806
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:44,000
 I guess that was a surprise.

807
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:55,000
 Jesus wants to heal our emotional, our social pain.

808
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:01,000
 What is some of the shame and pain that you have been carrying around?

809
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:06,000
 What are some of the messages that you have internalized?

810
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,000
 Just like the woman had internalized, "I'm unclean. I'm unworthy."

811
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:15,000
 Like the person that was experiencing homelessness had internalized, "I'm filth."

812
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
 What are some messages that you have internalized about yourself?

813
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:25,000
 The self-talk, how you see yourself, but not how God sees you.

814
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,000
 Is it, "I'm a bad son. I'm a bad daughter.

815
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:33,000
 I'm a horrible parent. I'm unlovable.

816
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:38,000
 I'm just the greatest sinner."

817
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:43,000
 And Jesus, he's calling us right now to step forth in faith

818
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,000
 and just bring these things to him.

819
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:51,000
 Bring these pains to him that we have been calling ourselves,

820
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:55,000
 that we have been naming ourselves with.

821
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:59,000
 Because he wants to do his restoring and healing work.

822
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:10,000
 He wants to bring his peace, his shalom to bear on our lives.

823
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:20,000
 So what I want to do right now is I want to invite you actually to take a step of faith.

824
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
 And whatever it is that's going on in your lives,

825
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:27,000
 maybe there is emotional pain, maybe there is shame,

826
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:31,000
 maybe you feel isolated, socially cut off,

827
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
 maybe there is physical pain, I don't know.

828
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:37,000
 Whatever it is, I want to encourage you to bring that to Jesus

829
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,000
 and say, "Help, Jesus, I need you."

830
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,000
 Just to turn to him.

831
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:48,000
 And the way I want to encourage you to do it is actually just to stretch out your hand before you,

832
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:52,000
 just as a sign, "Jesus, I just long for deeper healing.

833
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,000
 I have an ache, I have a pain in my heart, and I just long to be well.

834
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,000
 I'm just not feeling well.

835
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,000
 And I know it's only you who is able to do that."

836
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:08,000
 So I want to encourage you to do that right now.

837
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:13,000
 And just start that conversation with Jesus.

838
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:20,000
 So we're going to have some space to just talk to him.

839
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:25,000
 No one left the doctor worse than when we come to Jesus, we never leave worse.

840
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:39,000
 We always leave better when we step into the loving and the healing presence of Jesus.

841
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,000
 And Jesus, right now, he wants to -- he's speaking over our lives.

842
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:56,000
 He's saying, "Daughter, my son, my child, your faith has healed you.

843
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,000
 Go in peace.

844
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:06,000
 Be freed from your suffering."

845
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:12,000
 Jesus wants and is bringing deliverance from Satan's lies about you,

846
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:19,000
 things that Satan wants you to believe, wants me to believe.

847
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:27,000
 And he wants to break the power of those lies over your life.

848
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,000
 And just replace it with the truth, "You are my beloved.

849
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
 You are worthy of my time.

850
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,000
 You are worthy of my attention.

851
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:53,000
 You are worthy."

852
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:59,000
 Let me pray all over you.

853
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:04,000
 Jesus, you know every one of our lives.

854
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
 You know every one of our stories.

855
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,000
 You know all the things about us.

856
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:13,000
 And yet you choose to love us.

857
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:22,000
 And you hear right now the prayers that are being spoken of just pain and shame

858
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:28,000
 that we've been carrying for too long.

859
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:39,000
 And Holy Spirit, will you do the healing, the restoring, the renewing work right now.

860
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:44,000
 Will you pour out your spirit on people.

861
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:49,000
 Will you fill your sons, your daughters, your children with your spirit,

862
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:58,000
 with your loving presence, with words spoken over their lives that they need to hear.

863
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:02,000
 And will you release your healing.

864
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:10,000
 Jesus, will you release your healing over us right now.

865
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,000
 Like you did in this woman's life.

866
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:20,000
 Will you bring holistic healing.

867
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:30,000
 Will you bring healing to our emotional pain, our physical pain, our social pain, our mental pain.

868
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,000
 Thank you, Jesus.

869
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
 Thank you, Jesus.

870
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:43,000
 That you are powerful, that you are able, and that as we heard earlier, you are limitless.

871
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,000
 So we thank you for your healing and restoring work right now.

872
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:52,000
 In your name, Jesus. Amen.

873
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,000
 I want to invite everyone to stand.

874
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,000
 Let's worship.

875
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,000
 In Jesus' name. Amen.
