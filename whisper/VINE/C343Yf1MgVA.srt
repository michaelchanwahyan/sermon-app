1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Well, it's great to see everyone.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 And I want to start off, when I was in 2000, actually I don't know when it was, it was a long time ago, I don't even think it was 2000.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 When I was 15 years old, I had a friend that lived about two hours away.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 And so I used to visit him on extended holidays with a train or sometimes he came and saw me.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 And on one occasion, I got on the train, I had a basketball magazine, this is before the times of like having your smartphone.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 So I like, there was nothing to do, so I had a magazine.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 I find a compartment where there's six seats in one compartment, that's how they used to have trains in Germany.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 So I sit down where there's nobody else, I'm like, this is awesome, I'm by myself.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 I start reading and then a guy comes in, a young man older than me, sits right across from me.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 I'm like, why did he sit right across from me? There's all this space.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Come on.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 And the first thing he says to me is, you're a Christian, aren't you?

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 I was like, what?

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 He's like, no, you have to know, I've never have seen this guy before in my life.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 I have no idea who he is.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 So in my mind, my wheels are turning.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 I was like, what does this guy want from me?

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 He doesn't introduce himself, he doesn't say hello.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 He starts off with, you're a Christian.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 What does he want?

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 Do I want to say that I'm a Christian?

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 So I had a choice to make.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Am I going to step out in faith and say, yes, I'm a Christian, or am I going to remain in hiding?

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Now, what you also don't know is I have just become a Christian.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 So I'm a new Christian, my baby Christian.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 So before this point, I had never publicly told anyone that I was a Christian, besides people in church.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 So I end up telling him, yes, I'm a Christian.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 And we had an amazing conversation for the entire train ride, talking about faith, all sorts of things.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 And as I was reflecting on that experience, I realized that God was calling me, through this guy's question, to a greater faith.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 That he was calling me to step out in faith and publicly declare, yes, I'm a Christian.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 And what I also didn't know was that on that weekend, as I was heading to see my friend,

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 it was important for me to have a clear identity of who I am, what I'm going to do, and what I'm not going to do.

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 So God worked through this encounter.

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Now, God doesn't only just, or has not just done it in that specific circumstance.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Actually, part of our discipleship journey is that there is times where Jesus calls us to greater faith.

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 Maybe it's trusting him with a job search, and he's teaching you to trust him, that he can provide.

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 And he's asking you to trust yourself to him.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 For me, it was trusting to say I'm a Christian in this awkward situation, that this guy doesn't have some weird, bad agenda.

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 But right now, as we're going through the Longing for Healing sermon series that we started last week,

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 I believe that the Holy Spirit wants to stir some faith among us.

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 He's calling us to a deeper faith and a type of feeling that Jesus is powerful to do in our lives,

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 that Jesus is powerful to do in your lives, and in this community's life.

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Amen?

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 And so, Jesus calls us out of our comfort and routines to turn to him in faith to receive his restoring and healing work.

45
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 He wants to break some of those comfort and some of that routine that we're right now living.

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 He's calling us to step out of that.

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 So that's what we're going to be looking at today.

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 But we're continuing in our message series, Longing for Healing.

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 This is the second week.

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 The thing that we're looking at is that Jesus is the one in whom there is help, healing, wholeness,

51
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 and he's the only one who can fully deliver that.

52
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 He's the only one who has the power to do this work in our lives.

53
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 And so, as you look at the Gospels, and we're going to look at a story of an encounter between Jesus and a woman today.

54
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 And as you look at these encounters, a lot of times people come with the obvious need to Jesus,

55
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 the one that's very visible. A lot of times that's a physical need.

56
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 And so they bring their physical need to Jesus, and Jesus heals the physical need.

57
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 But he actually does a deeper healing.

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 Because we don't just need healing physically, we need healing spiritually, emotionally, mentally, socially.

59
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 And Jesus cares about all of who we are, our whole person.

60
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 And so my prayer for this series is that we will see and that we will experience that Jesus did not just heal back then,

61
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 but he heals here today.

62
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 That he has the power to bring restoration, healing, wholeness, where we're feeling broken,

63
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 where we are carrying hurt, where we are carrying pain.

64
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 And not only does he want to do that in our lives,

65
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 so he wants us to receive that, but he also wants us to be agents who bring healing to others.

66
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Because one way that God works a lot of times is actually through loving community.

67
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 That he brings healing to people's lives through other people who point others to Jesus,

68
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 who show the love of Jesus, the grace of Jesus to people, and walk with people.

69
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 So that's my prayer for this series, that we see how Jesus can bring healing into our life

70
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 in deeper and unexpected ways, and that we can also see that he calls us to be agents of healing in other people's lives.

71
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 So that we can pass this on to others.

72
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 So today we're in the Gospel of Mark.

73
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 Let me set the context for the story that we're going to look at.

74
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 So the story we're looking at, it's actually found in between another story.

75
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 So there's a story that begins, then there's our story, and then that other story continues.

76
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 So Jairus, who was a leader in the synagogue, well-respected, honored man,

77
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 his daughter is lying in bed and she is dying.

78
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 And so he has heard about Jesus, he goes to Jesus, he asks for Jesus to come to lay hands on his daughter,

79
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 to heal her, to deliver her from this death.

80
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 And Jesus agrees, and he goes with Jesus.

81
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 And so they're on their way, they're walking to his house, and this is where our story interrupts that story.

82
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 So that's where we're going to pick up, we're in Mark chapter 5, verse 24b, and that's where we're going to start reading.

83
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 "A large crowd followed and pressed around him, and a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for 12 years.

84
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors, and had spent all she had,

85
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 yet instead of getting better, she grew worse.

86
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak,

87
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 for she thought, 'If I touch his clothes, I will be healed.'

88
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 Immediately her bleeding stopped, and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering.

89
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him.

90
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 He turned around in the crowd and asked, 'Who touched my clothes?'

91
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 'You see the people crowding against you,' the disciples answered, 'and yet you ask who touched me?'

92
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it.

93
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 Then a woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet, and trembling with fear, told him the whole truth.

94
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 He said to her, 'Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering.'"

95
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 Now at the beginning of this story, we learn about the specifics of this woman's prolonged suffering.

96
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 This has been going on for a very long time. Twelve years we're told.

97
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 She is experiencing bleeding. It's not the normal menstrual bleeding. It's a uterine bleeding.

98
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 It's just ongoing. It's a medical condition.

99
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 It's causing her a lot of pain, a lot of shame.

100
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 But we also have to know the cultural context that she's having this medical condition in.

101
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 Because during that time, if you had uterine bleeding, you would be considered as an unclean person.

102
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 So they have this concept of clean and unclean. And she would be considered unclean.

103
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 What that means is if she touches anyone, if she sits down anywhere, then there needs to be cleansing.

104
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 The person needs to wash their clothes. They need to bathe themselves.

105
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 And so not only is she experiencing this physical pain, but she's also experiencing social and emotional pain.

106
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 Because she's really cut off from normal human relationships.

107
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 So this has an incredible impact on her.

108
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 She's also not able to go to the temple. She's not able to go into the synagogue.

109
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 So she's also cut off from the spiritual life and community.

110
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 And on top of that, to add pain to pain, she most likely is not able to marry.

111
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 And because of her medical condition, also not able to have children.

112
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 So we can see these are just layers of suffering.

113
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 But then we're also told that she suffered a great deal under many doctors.

114
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 As I was reading this, I'm familiar with this passage, but this had never stood out to me before.

115
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 She suffered a great deal under many doctors.

116
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 And I just wonder, what treatments did they take her through?

117
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 Was it humiliating? Was it traumatizing? Was it painful?

118
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 Were there just expectations where every time she had hope that she would be healed, and then it was just crushed?

119
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 And we're told that she spent all her money.

120
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 So this used to be a woman of means, but she lost all her money.

121
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 So she's also on top of it, living in poverty.

122
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 And that with all the medical treatment, she actually just got worse.

123
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 But the one thing that we do see in her is that there is this longing, just this desire to be healed, to be well.

124
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 And she has done everything that she knows how to do, but nothing has worked.

125
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 Now, the reason why I wanted to slow down, a lot of times you can read past this suffering quickly, and almost not notice it or feel it.

126
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 But I wanted us to see it, to actually see this woman, to not just brush past her.

127
00:11:49,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 Now, I also know that some of us here have actually been carrying pain and suffering for a very long time.

128
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 Maybe it's also been multiple years.

129
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 And I just want to say that I'm so thankful and grateful that you're here, and that we love you.

130
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 And that my hope is that in this community, you can find friendship, you can find support,

131
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 and you also can encounter the healing and the loving presence of Jesus.

132
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 That's my heart.

133
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 So God's Word tells us that even as Christians, we will experience suffering in this world.

134
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 This is part of human experience.

135
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Suffering, pain, and death, they're not God's will for life.

136
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 That's not what we were created for. But they are unavoidable aspects of this world in its broken condition.

137
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Last week we looked at creation, fall, redemption, new creation.

138
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 We looked at how the sin fall impacted every aspect of our lives, and brought damage to every aspect of our lives.

139
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 So this is part of living in a fallen world.

140
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 So we don't have to feel surprised if we experience suffering and pain.

141
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 At one point or another, most of us experience this, if we're just honest.

142
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 And it also doesn't mean that God is specifically trying to target you with what's happening.

143
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 That He's somewhat angry with you.

144
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 So this is the reality of living in a broken world.

145
00:13:50,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 God's Word, one thing that it does to you is it encourages us to bring a brokenness and our pain to Jesus, who is healer, who is Savior.

146
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 Now we don't always understand why in one instance a person is healed, and in another instance a person is not healed.

147
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 We don't understand why healing sometimes is a process, and sometimes it's instantaneous.

148
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 I met a person that used to be addicted to heroin and strong drugs, and he had an instantaneous healing.

149
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Jesus delivered him from those drugs. Amazing.

150
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 But then there are others where it's struggles and it's therapy and a long time of getting out of it.

151
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 We don't always understand why things work that way.

152
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 What we do know is that through Jesus' death and resurrection, heaven has come down.

153
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 The kingdom of God has broken into this world.

154
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 And now through Jesus, healing, restoration, hope, help, love is available in Him.

155
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 I'm actually going to quote Pastor Chapman from last week's Cantonese service.

156
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 Now, I did not understand what he said, but I do get to read the script in English.

157
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 So he said this. I thought he said it perfectly.

158
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 When we see healing, we see the already of the kingdom of God.

159
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 And when we haven't seen healing, we see the not yet.

160
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 But even if healing doesn't happen now, it will always happen when the kingdom of God is fully realized.

161
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 Now, that's the biblical sort of background to our whole longing for healing conversation.

162
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 But the one thing that scripture does make very clear in our passage today,

163
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 it makes very clear that we are called to bring our brokenness, that we're called to bring our pain to Jesus.

164
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 Because He is powerful. He is able to heal. He is able to restore.

165
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 And so we can't control these other things.

166
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 And we don't understand them. And there's some mystery to that.

167
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 But we know what we can do. And that's come to Jesus.

168
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 And that's what we're encouraged to do, to bring ourselves to Him.

169
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 And unlike those doctors that the woman went to, we never leave Jesus feeling more broken.

170
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 Where we always, after encountering Jesus, we feel His love, His loving presence. We feel better.

171
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 And He does not put us to shame when we turn to Him.

172
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 He does not put us to shame when we come to Him with our mess.

173
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 Sometimes our sinfulness, our brokenness.

174
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 But let's continue looking at the scripture.

175
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 So in verse 27 we're told that the bleeding woman, that she heard about Jesus.

176
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 So words have been spreading about Jesus that in Him there is healing.

177
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 So it stirs in her heart and it raises hope inside of her.

178
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 And so in her mind she thinks, "If I can only touch His cloak, if I can only touch His clothes, I'm going to be healed."

179
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 So she sneaks up behind Jesus, touches His clothes, and we're told in verse 29 that immediately her bleeding stopped.

180
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 And she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering.

181
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 It's amazing. Praise Jesus. Absolutely incredible healing.

182
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 Now, why did she sneak up on Jesus?

183
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 Earlier, Jairus, actually he goes publicly to Jesus. He doesn't have to sneak up to her.

184
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 Why does she have to sneak up to Jesus, or feels like she has to sneak up to Jesus?

185
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 Well, it has to do with what I explained earlier, because she feels unclean.

186
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 Or that's what society tells her. Society tells you you're a walking contamination.

187
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 She feels unworthy.

188
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 And she doesn't feel like she can come just face to face with Jesus.

189
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 She does the only thing that she knows how to do, and just comes to Him from behind, touches His clothes.

190
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 And I just wonder if there are some of us who can relate to how this woman felt about herself and about coming to Jesus.

191
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 I know I have felt that way in the past.

192
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 I remember I really used to resonate with the lyrics from a song, "I'm too messed up for love."

193
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 I'm going to try to write a whole, it's like a rap.

194
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 It's like, "Will you take me as I am? I know the way that I'm living is wrong, but I can change on my own trying to make it along.

195
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 I wonder how could you love me with my life so ugly that you laid down your life for me?"

196
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 You know, that's how I felt. I felt that my life was so ugly.

197
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 And I knew it, because it was full of sin and brokenness.

198
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 And so I was ashamed.

199
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 But let's continue verse 30, and I'll read 30 through 32.

200
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 "At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from Him.

201
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 He turned around in the crowd and asked, 'Who touched my clothes?'

202
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 'You see the people crowding against you,' the disciples answered.

203
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 'And yet you can ask who touched me?'

204
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it."

205
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 Now, I just picture Jesus on the NPR.

206
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 Anyone with me? Rush hour, somewhere around Admiralty, or one of those points where there's so much going on.

207
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 Everybody's pushing against you on every side.

208
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 Everybody's clothes are touching with other people's clothes.

209
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 And then Jesus says, "Who touched my clothes?"

210
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 The disciples, "What are you talking about? Everybody's touching everyone's clothes."

211
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 But what they didn't know is that Jesus had felt a power going out from Him.

212
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 And so He continues to look around, and He's not swayed by the disciples to stop.

213
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Now, let me ask this question.

214
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 Why does Jesus continue to look for the person who has touched Him?

215
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 Why not just wink at the woman, "I know what you did. It's okay, and I'm just going to let you go in peace."

216
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 Why did He do that?

217
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 Why didn't Jesus--she already has been carrying so much shame.

218
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 Why make her step out from the crowd?

219
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 Well, let me explain.

220
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 Now, the woman, she did receive physical healing.

221
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 When she touched His clothes.

222
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 That was amazing.

223
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 But it was actually her shame that made her just sneak up on Jesus.

224
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 And it was also her shame that was now at work in her heart as Jesus is asking, "Who touched me?"

225
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 And obviously this must have taken a while because the way it's described in Scripture,

226
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 she didn't just jump out immediately.

227
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 There was some delay.

228
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 And so she's still carrying this shame in her heart.

229
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 And it almost keeps her from stepping out into the presence of Jesus, into the face-to-face with Jesus.

230
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 Now, Brene Brown, some of you know her.

231
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 She's a well-known author, a professor, researcher, especially on the topic around shame.

232
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 She defines shame this way.

233
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 "Shame is the intensely painful feeling or experience of believing that we are flawed

234
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 and therefore unworthy of love and belonging."

235
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 So the woman, she had internalized society's messages about herself.

236
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 Unclean. Unworthy. Dishonored.

237
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 She was carrying shame.

238
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 Now, a while ago, I moved back to California.

239
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 So I'm moving back and forth between different countries.

240
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 And I had to go to the Department of Motor Vehicle, which is known in California as DMV.

241
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 Now, in other parts of the U.S., you go to DMV, you're served right away.

242
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 You're in, you're out.

243
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 And California is notorious for these eternal lines where you go in and you want service,

244
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 and it takes three, four hours.

245
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 You're just standing there.

246
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 So I needed to renew my driver's license because my license had expired like forever ago.

247
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 So I'm standing in line.

248
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 I don't know. It's probably already an hour and a half.

249
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 And then this person, this man who is experiencing homelessness, he comes up to me.

250
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 He needs a government ID.

251
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 He asked me if I can help him fill out a form because he just couldn't do it.

252
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 His body through living on the streets was so impacted, he wasn't able to do that anymore.

253
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 So I was like, "Sure, I'd be happy to help."

254
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 So I fill out the form. I work with him.

255
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 We get to the part about organ donation.

256
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 So I asked him, "Do you want to be an organ donor?"

257
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 He says, "Me? I'm filth.

258
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 Who would want my organs?"

259
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 That just broke my heart that he saw himself as filth, that that's how he understood himself.

260
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 Yes, he most likely was drinking, using drugs, all of those things.

261
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 But we know that every single person is created in the image of God,

262
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 that every single person is lovable, beautiful creation from God.

263
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 And so we're not filth.

264
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 But that's what society told him that he was in his experience of being homeless.

265
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 Now that reminds me of the woman when I read the story,

266
00:23:51,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 that she had internalized these messages that she was unclean, unworthy, unlovable.

267
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 That then became her identity.

268
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 That's who she thought she was.

269
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 And her shame was a real barrier that was standing between her and Jesus.

270
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 And her shame almost kept her from receiving what Jesus wanted to do in her life.

271
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 Because he didn't just want to heal her physically.

272
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 There was more work to be done.

273
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 And so Jesus calls her out.

274
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 He doesn't let it go.

275
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 He wants her to step forward.

276
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 He wants her to take a step of faith.

277
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 And then she steps forward, trembling with fear.

278
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 There's courage.

279
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 There's vulnerability.

280
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 Verse 33 describes it, says this,

281
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 "Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet,

282
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 trembling with fear, told him the whole truth."

283
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 So that means she stepped into the presence, the loving presence of Jesus.

284
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 Instead of sneaking up on him,

285
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 and an impersonal encounter with him,

286
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 she now is having a personal encounter with Jesus.

287
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 And she tells him the whole truth.

288
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 So we're not told exactly what that all entails,

289
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 but at the very least, this entails her desiring and longing for healing

290
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 and touching his clothes,

291
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 and in her, experience miraculous physical healing.

292
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 And when you read about trembling with fear,

293
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 now this can be for many reasons.

294
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 Maybe she was trembling with fear because of the whole clean, unclean thing,

295
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 and she touched him, and thereby defiled him.

296
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 She was like, "Maybe Jesus is going to get angry with me."

297
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 Then I touched him.

298
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 Once he finds out.

299
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 Or perhaps she thought maybe she stole some power from Jesus

300
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 because her understanding of how Jesus works is probably--

301
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 it's actually informed more by superstitions and beliefs of the time,

302
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 that holy men, when they had clothes,

303
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 when you touch them, there's healing power in the clothes.

304
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 So she may have thought that, "Oh, I stole power illegitimately of Jesus,

305
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 and he's going to be angry."

306
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 And then finally, another reason is that she had experienced healing,

307
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 and it raises the question, "Who is Jesus?"

308
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 Because none of those doctors could heal me, but Jesus healed me.

309
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 And so it's like dawning on her, "Could it be that Jesus is God with us?"

310
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 And so she's trembling and stepping in front of Jesus.

311
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 Now, she does not know how Jesus is going to respond.

312
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 We know because I read the story earlier, or you might know the story.

313
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 But she does not know.

314
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 And here's how Jesus responds.

315
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you.

316
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 Go in peace and be freed from your suffering."

317
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 So Jesus is not angry with her touching him.

318
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 Actually, that never made him angry because he can make people clean.

319
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 He can restore people.

320
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 That never bothered Jesus.

321
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 That bothered other people.

322
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 And through his actions, he's telling her, "You are worthy.

323
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 You're worthy of my time.

324
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 You're worthy of my attention.

325
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 You're worthy of me stopping in the middle of heading to this very important person

326
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 who is very wealthy, who has all the honor.

327
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 You're worthy for me to stop and to give you all of my attention,

328
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 to not let go of this moment, of this greater thing that I want to do in your life."

329
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 And so he speaks these incredible words over her.

330
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 "Daughter, my daughter."

331
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 And so he's restoring her broken identity.

332
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 She was having self-talk that said, "I'm unclean.

333
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 I'm unworthy."

334
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 But Jesus says, "You're worthy.

335
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 You're my daughter."

336
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 But that also means, "You are part of my family.

337
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 You are part of the family of God."

338
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 That's what Jesus says.

339
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 "You belong.

340
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 I love you."

341
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 He also tells her that it is her faith that has healed her.

342
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 So he corrects her mysterious understanding of a faith and how God works through that.

343
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 So to answer the question, "Why did Jesus insist that she steps out?"

344
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 Well, it's because he loves her too much to just let her walk away.

345
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 He loves her too much to just let her have this impersonal encounter with Jesus

346
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 and then to slip out.

347
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 He wants her to know that she is lovable, that she is worthy.

348
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 He wants to restore.

349
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 He wants to bring healing where there's been emotional pain and shame

350
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 that she's been carrying.

351
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 So he does this beautiful healing, restoring work in her life.

352
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 Not only that, now instead of leaving not knowing and maybe even having all these questions

353
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 and leaving with her emotional pain, with her social pain,

354
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 now she is part of Jesus' family, daughter.

355
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 She's part of the family of God.

356
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 She's leaving with a personal relationship with Jesus from this encounter.

357
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 And that's where true and full healing is found,

358
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 is in that personal relationship with Jesus.

359
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 Because when we step into that relationship every time,

360
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 it's the loving and healing presence of Jesus that wants to meet us.

361
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 Now, where does that leave us?

362
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 Jesus is not afraid of your pain.

363
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 He's not afraid of your brokenness.

364
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 He's not afraid of your sin.

365
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 He's not afraid of your shame that you might be carrying.

366
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 He just welcomes us to come to Him with whatever has happened in our lives,

367
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 whatever you have done, and to open our heart to Him.

368
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 And He calls us forth like He called forth the woman to faith, to greater faith,

369
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 because He wants you to experience His healing, His power in your life.

370
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 He wants you to experience His emotional healing, social healing, forgiveness from sins,

371
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 whatever it is, physical healing.

372
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 He calls you, calls me to step forward in faith.

373
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 Now, a professor of mine, he says this, "Faith opens the door to the power of God."

374
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 So when the woman decided that she believes that Jesus somehow can heal her,

375
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 and she didn't fully understand even who He was, she didn't have a clear picture,

376
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 but her faith was erected towards Him.

377
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 And it was God worked through her faith.

378
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 Faith opens the door of the power of God in our lives.

379
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 So when we come to Jesus with faith, it opens the door of the power of God in our lives

380
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 that brings healing and restoration.

381
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 So how much faith do you have to have?

382
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 Do you have to have super faith, a little bit medium faith?

383
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 It sounds like a steak.

384
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 A little faith?

385
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 Or what, very well?

386
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 No, all it takes is just faith that's enough to come to Jesus.

387
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 It's not about your amazing and incredible faith.

388
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 All you need is just to turn to Jesus and say, "Jesus, help!

389
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 Help, Jesus!

390
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 I need you!

391
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 I need you to work in this area of my life.

392
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 Help, Jesus!"

393
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 Now, I want to invite the worship team to come up right now.

394
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 I guess that was a surprise.

395
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 Jesus wants to heal our emotional, our social pain.

396
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 What is some of the shame and pain that you have been carrying around?

397
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 What are some of the messages that you have internalized?

398
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 Just like the woman had internalized, "I'm unclean, I'm unworthy."

399
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 Like the person that was experiencing homelessness had internalized, "I'm filth."

400
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 What are some messages that you have internalized about yourself?

401
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 The self-talk, how you see yourself, but not how God sees you.

402
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 Is it, "I'm a bad son. I'm a bad daughter.

403
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 I'm a horrible parent. I'm unlovable.

404
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 I'm just the greatest sinner."

405
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 And Jesus, He's calling us right now to step forth in faith

406
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 and just bring these things to Him.

407
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 Bring these pains to Him that we have been calling ourselves,

408
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 that we have been naming ourselves with.

409
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 Because He wants to do His restoring and healing work.

410
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 He wants to bring His peace, His shalom to bear on our lives.

411
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 So what I want to do right now is I want to invite you actually to take a step of faith.

412
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 And whatever it is that's going on in your lives,

413
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 maybe there is emotional pain, maybe there is shame,

414
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 maybe you feel isolated, socially cut off,

415
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 maybe there is physical pain, I don't know.

416
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 Whatever it is, I want to encourage you to bring that to Jesus

417
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 and say, "Help, Jesus, I need you."

418
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 Just to turn to Him.

419
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 And the way I want to encourage you to do it is actually just to stretch out your hand before you,

420
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 just as a sign, "Jesus, I just long for a deeper healing.

421
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 I have an ache, I have a pain in my heart, and I just long to be well.

422
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 I'm just not feeling well.

423
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 And I know it's only you who is able to do that."

424
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 So I want to encourage you to do that right now.

425
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 And just start that conversation with Jesus.

426
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 So we're going to have some space to just talk to Him.

427
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 No one left a doctor worse than when we come to Jesus, we never leave worse.

428
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 We always leave better when we step into the loving and the healing presence of Jesus.

429
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 And Jesus, right now, He's speaking over our lives.

430
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 He's saying, "Daughter, my son, my child, your faith has healed you.

431
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 Go in peace.

432
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 Be freed from your suffering."

433
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 Jesus wants and is bringing deliverance from Satan's lies about you.

434
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 Things that Satan wants you to believe, wants me to believe.

435
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 And He wants to break the power of those lies over your life.

436
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 And just replace it with the truth, "You are my beloved.

437
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 You are worthy of my time.

438
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 You are worthy of my attention.

439
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 You are worthy."

440
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 Let me pray over you.

441
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 Jesus, you know every one of our lives.

442
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 You know every one of our stories.

443
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 You know all the things about us.

444
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 And yet you choose to love us.

445
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 And you hear right now the prayers that are being spoken of just pain and shame

446
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 that we've been carrying for too long.

447
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 And Holy Spirit, will you do the healing, the restoring, the renewing work right now.

448
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 Will you pour out your spirit on people.

449
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 Will you fill your sons, your daughters, your children with your spirit,

450
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 with your loving presence, with words spoken over their lives that they need to hear.

451
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 And will you release your healing.

452
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 Jesus, will you release your healing over us right now.

453
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 Like you did in this woman's life.

454
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 Will you bring holistic healing.

455
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 Will you bring healing to our emotional pain, our physical pain, our social pain, our mental pain.

456
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 Thank you, Jesus.

457
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 Thank you, Jesus.

458
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 That you are powerful, that you are able, and that as we heard earlier, you are limitless.

459
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 So we thank you for your healing and restoring work right now.

460
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 In your name, Jesus. Amen.
