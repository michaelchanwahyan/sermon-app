1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,720
 Okay, now here we go. Apparently, I turned it off. Come on, production! Oh, wait, it

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:22,000
 was me, sorry. All right, hey, when I was 14 years old, I experienced fear at night,

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,880
 and I wasn't able to sleep well. And part of the reason for that was that at night time,

4
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:38,640
 I saw grimacing faces, and I experienced an evil presence. Now, I didn't really know what

5
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,520
 to do with that. I grew up in a Christian home. I wasn't a Christian at the time. Just

6
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,000
 because you grew up in a Christian home doesn't mean you're a Christian. And so I went to

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,960
 my parents, and I told them, "Hey, this is what's going on. What do I do? Can you help

8
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,440
 me?" Well, even though they were Christians, they actually had never experienced anything

9
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:06,640
 like this, so they didn't really know how to help me. So I also didn't want to talk

10
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,760
 to my friends. My friends, actually, at that time, I didn't really talk about spiritual

11
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,400
 stuff with my friends. We just did other things. And I also didn't want them to think that

12
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:25,320
 I was somehow crazy. So I was really isolated and on my own in this experience. Now, this

13
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:37,360
 went on for a year, and it really started weighing on me. I was worn out. The fear increased.

14
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,920
 Now, instead of just experiencing things at night, I was experiencing during the day as

15
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:50,600
 well. So I reached a point, and I remember saying this to myself, "If life is like this,

16
00:01:50,600 --> 00:02:00,560
 I'm not sure if I want to live." This was my cry, my longing for healing, what we've

17
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,880
 been talking about. Now, I didn't use those words, but I was like, "I just want to be

18
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:17,080
 well. I just want to have peace. This is just too much to bear." Now, we all, at one point

19
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:28,200
 or another in our lives, are confronted with evil. In my case, it was demonic oppression.

20
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,360
 That's what I was experiencing. I just didn't know exactly, didn't understand everything

21
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:40,120
 exactly. Now, for others, it might be addictions. Maybe there's addictions to alcohol. Maybe

22
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:46,760
 there's addictions to drugs, to pornography, to sex, to pain medication. It can be many

23
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:52,080
 different things. For others, it might be unhealthy emotional relationships where we

24
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:58,340
 find ourselves in relationships that we know we shouldn't be in, but for whatever reason,

25
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:03,800
 we are stuck, and we just cannot move out of those relationships. So it can be many

26
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:11,240
 different ways and different things for different people. You can fill in the blank. Now, our

27
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:23,280
 sins in our lives are footholds for evil that enslave us. Satan and his minions shame us,

28
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:32,560
 dehumanize us, puts us down, and his desire is to bring destruction into our life, destruction

29
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:40,080
 into your relationships, and to mess up your life, to make you an ineffective Christian

30
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:50,440
 if you're a Christian here. That's on his agenda. So what I want to explore with you

31
00:03:50,440 --> 00:04:00,080
 is how can I overcome evil in my life? How can I break free from patterns of sin that,

32
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,560
 for whatever reason, I'm stuck in, and besides my own choices, there's something else going

33
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:12,000
 on. Evil is working in them, pushing me down, tempting me, whatever it is. I'm in bondage,

34
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 and I'm not able to be free. So how can I experience freedom from all these things?

35
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,080
 I love the worship. Today was so fitting. Freedom reigns in this place. We spoke Jesus

36
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:31,920
 over each other. Well, that's what this message is about. Now, today is our final message

37
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:39,680
 in our Longing for Healing series. I don't know about you. I've enjoyed it. God has met

38
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:47,120
 me myself in this time. We've heard from some of you how God has been bringing healing and

39
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,520
 doing something new in your life, and we've been so encouraged, so praise Jesus for that.

40
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:57,600
 And I hope that this has been helpful for you on your journey of healing, because we

41
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,260
 mentioned at the beginning of this sermon series, every single person is on a journey

42
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:09,400
 of healing, because Jesus is not finished with us yet. He's still at work in our lives,

43
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:18,760
 and we need it. So how has it been? I would love to hear. Good? Yeah? All right. Thanks,

44
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:25,360
 man. He's like, you know, we didn't pay him. He's just supportive. You know, right here.

45
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:35,080
 Come on. Now, we're in the book of Mark today, and before I set the context for our passage,

46
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,840
 let me... Actually, before we go into our passage, let me set the context for our passage

47
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:47,320
 so that way. Jesus is crossing with the disciples of the Sea of Galilee, and there is this incredible

48
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:55,160
 storm, life-threatening storm, and Jesus commands the wind and the waves to be still. And the

49
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:02,600
 crazy thing is, it actually happens. The wind and the waves become quiet. Now, the disciples

50
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:11,960
 are afraid, and all of this raises the question, who is this Jesus? And the story, or this

51
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:20,520
 episode from Jesus' life, it shows that Jesus has authority over nature, because he is God

52
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:27,000
 with us. And he was part of creation where he spoke, and it was made. And so that's why

53
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,760
 Jesus can command and has authority over nature. So this is what happens. Absolutely incredible.

54
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:40,600
 Now we pick up where they land on shore. So we're in Mark 5, verses 1 through 5. That's

55
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,920
 where we're going to start with. It says this, "They went across the lake to the region of

56
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:51,280
 Gerizim. When Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an impure spirit came from the tombs

57
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:58,000
 to meet him. This man lived in the tombs, and no one could bind him anymore, not even

58
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:05,560
 with a chain, for he had often been chained hand and foot, but he tore the chains apart

59
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:13,600
 and broke the irons on his feet. No one was strong enough to subdue him. Night and day

60
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:29,160
 among the tombs and in the hills, he would cry out and cut himself with stones." So the

61
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:35,280
 disciples and Jesus, they just arrived. The first thing that happens is that a man approaches

62
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,320
 them. We learn that he has an unclean spirit, that he lives among the tombs, which Jewish

63
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:45,640
 people also considered unclean. So this is like unclean squared. So we know something

64
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:51,440
 is happening. Something is up. We are told that the community, they had tried to bind

65
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:57,560
 him. They had chained it up with metal chains. They had put on iron shackles on his feet,

66
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:06,560
 but the man managed to break himself free. Now this is strength beyond human strength.

67
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,860
 Again something is going on. In verse 3 it says this, "No one could bind him anymore,

68
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:16,160
 not even with a chain." So it sounds like things got progressively worse. In verse 4

69
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:22,880
 it repeats that. It says, "No one was strong enough to subdue him." Now the Greek word

70
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:33,680
 for subdue, damazo, can also be translated as tame or control. Now this is strange, right?

71
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:41,720
 Tame. And that's actually probably the preferred way of translating this. That no one could

72
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:48,000
 tame him. Now this is referring to a human being. We don't usually talk about taming

73
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:59,200
 human beings. We talk about taming wild animals. But this man was running wild and people,

74
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,920
 the community, was trying to tame him. Now there's two observations I want to make for

75
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:11,200
 this. First, this speaks of the destructive nature of the evil spirits that were possessing

76
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:19,240
 this man. That he was running wild like this, causing harm. And second, the use of the word

77
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:27,440
 tame shows that people have stopped seeing him as a human being. He is excluded and treated

78
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:35,840
 as an outcast from society. They describe him as an animal. Now in verse 5 we're told,

79
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:41,160
 "Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with

80
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:50,800
 stones." Now this is a 24/7 thing. Just think of that. 24/7 this man is crying out and cutting

81
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,440
 himself with stones. It's not like he did this one time. He does this day in and day

82
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:13,720
 out. So we see that this demonic possession is destructive. It's tearing this man apart.

83
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:20,080
 Now I used to lead a community group in the US in my home and there was two people there

84
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,160
 that were experiencing homelessness. They were part of the community group. And so one

85
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,360
 night I don't remember exactly the circumstances. Somehow I was with some of them on the go

86
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,440
 and then we were dropping off one of the homeless men at the shelter that he lived in. And so

87
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,240
 when we were coming back from dropping him off and we had parked, brought him, walking

88
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:47,120
 back, a man comes up to my friend and in a growling voice says, "Give me your money."

89
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,120
 My friend was like, "I'm not going to give you any money." So then this guy goes to a

90
00:10:52,120 --> 00:11:01,800
 fence and he breaks off a metal bar and points it out and says, "Give me your money." And

91
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:08,400
 my friend was trying to show his manhood and was trying to be a tough guy, you know, standing

92
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:16,360
 there like... And I was like, "Let's go. Time to leave. Time to get out of here." Now what's

93
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:23,640
 interesting as I was remembering this episode in preparation for this message, my only response

94
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:30,440
 to that man was that I saw him as a homeless person, as somebody who was using drugs, and

95
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:37,520
 as somebody who was demon possessed. That's where it stopped for me. But as a reading

96
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:44,160
 about the circumstances of this man and Mark and just how horrible all this must be for

97
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:52,680
 a human being, what I missed was that this homeless man was a person that God loves and

98
00:11:52,680 --> 00:12:00,080
 that Jesus wants to set free. Jesus, when he started his ministry, he said that he has

99
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:06,720
 come to set the captives free. That's Jesus' mission. That's what he's doing. That's why

100
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:15,440
 he has come. And then in John 10, it says, "The thief comes only to steal, kill, and

101
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:23,600
 destroy. I have come that they may have life and have it to the full." The devil's aim

102
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:32,000
 is to destroy people. But Jesus has come to give people life to the full. That's what

103
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:39,160
 Jesus does. That's why he has come. And he wants us as people to be people who bring

104
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:46,960
 this hope and this good news that there is life to the full in Jesus to other people,

105
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:57,600
 even when on the outside they might initially scare us. Now, one thing the enemy does is

106
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:06,080
 when it comes to spiritual oppression, addiction, bondage, is lie to us that it is hopeless.

107
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:15,760
 You will never break free from your alcohol addiction. You will never change. When I was

108
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:22,800
 14, I was experiencing all this. The lie was, "Things will never change. You will always

109
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:32,160
 live in fear." And I started to believe it because it was already going on for a year.

110
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:39,880
 Now, Jesus in the Gospel of John, John 8, verse 44, you can look it up. He talks about

111
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:47,680
 that Satan is a liar and a deceiver. So part of his work in our lives is that he lies to

112
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,280
 you and he deceives you. He wants you to be hopeless about what's going on because he

113
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,400
 wants to keep you captive. He wants to keep you in bondage. He does not want you to be

114
00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:01,680
 free. He does not want you to experience Jesus in your life. So the enemy wants to keep you

115
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:08,440
 under oppression, addiction, and bondage because he is out to destroy, shame, dehumanize you.

116
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:13,880
 His goal is to keep you from having a personal relationship with God and from living the

117
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:21,820
 life God has for you. That's what he's trying to undermine. And he does that both in non-Christian

118
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:29,840
 lives and also in Christian lives. So I just wondered, what are some of the lies of the

119
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:39,440
 enemy that we are believing in this room here today? You're never going to change. You will

120
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:48,880
 never break free from this. But the good news is that Jesus can set you free. He has the

121
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:55,680
 power and authority to bring freedom, wholeness, goodness in your life where you are not able

122
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:01,120
 to do it. We've tried. I tried when I was young. I tried to somehow fight whatever this

123
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:07,480
 thing that was going on, but I couldn't do anything. It's by the power of Jesus that

124
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:17,040
 we are set free, that we gain victory. Let's continue in Mark 5 and verse 6. It says, "When

125
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:23,560
 he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front of him. He shouted at

126
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:31,480
 the top of his voice, 'What do you want with me? Jesus, son of the most high God, in God's

127
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:38,320
 name, don't torture me.' For Jesus had said to him, 'Come out of this man, you impure

128
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:45,480
 spirit.' Then Jesus asked him, 'What is your name?' 'My name is Legion,' he replied, 'for

129
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:52,520
 we are many.' And he begged Jesus again and again not to send him out of the area. A large

130
00:15:52,520 --> 00:16:00,040
 herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside. The demons begged Jesus, 'Send us among the

131
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:07,460
 pigs. Allow us to go into them.' He gave them permission and the impure spirits came out

132
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:14,200
 and went into the pigs. The herd, about 2,000 number, rushed down the steep bank into the

133
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:22,240
 lake and were drowned." So when Jesus asked this man, "What is your name?" Or addressing

134
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:28,640
 the evil spirits, he said, "My name is Legion, for we are many." Now, Legion was a Roman

135
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:34,400
 military term. It consists of 6,000 troops. The point is, this was massive. The oppression

136
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:42,440
 that this man was experiencing was massive. This implies that... Well, actually, I already

137
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:48,000
 said that. So let me make two observations about this. First, since Jesus casts out the

138
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:55,720
 demons, it demonstrates that even a multitude of demons, they cannot stand against Jesus.

139
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:03,400
 Jesus has the authority and the power over any evil force because he has won the victory

140
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:09,480
 on the cross. Satan and his enemies have been disarmed when Jesus died and rose. And then

141
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,720
 also in the book of Revelation, you can read about how ultimately there will be final judgment

142
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:21,120
 on Satan. He will be thrown into the lake of fire and will be banned there forever.

143
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,400
 And so Jesus has the authority to set people free. And what's interesting is the demons

144
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,720
 know that, but people in the Gospel of Mark don't know that a lot of times. Because the

145
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:40,640
 demons themselves say, "Jesus, son of the most high God," in verse 7. They know. So

146
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:47,720
 Jesus casts out the demons, sets the man free, demonstrates that he has authority over evil.

147
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:53,040
 Now the second thing that I want to highlight from this militaristic language of Legion,

148
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:58,960
 it points to the fact that there is a spiritual battle raging. Now the New Testament assumes

149
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:05,480
 that. And if you're familiar with the Bible and you read it, you can learn about that.

150
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,520
 So for example, Paul in this letter to Ephesians, he's writing to Christians and he says this,

151
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:16,120
 Ephesians 6, verse 12, "For a struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the

152
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:22,840
 rulers, against authorities, against the powers of the stark world, and against the spiritual

153
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:30,360
 forces of evil in the heavenly realms." So this is the reality we find ourselves in.

154
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:36,000
 Even as Christians, this is what's going on. And C.S. Lewis, a well-known author from the

155
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,480
 past, he says this, commenting on spiritual warfare and battles, "There are two equal

156
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:49,720
 and opposite errors into which our race can fall about the devils. One is the disbelief

157
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:56,960
 in their existence. The other is to believe and to feel an excessive and unhealthy interest

158
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:05,160
 in them. They themselves are equally pleased with both." So on the one hand, there's disbelief.

159
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:12,280
 Where I grew up, scientific, Western Germany, most of my friends do not believe in evil

160
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:21,880
 spirits or any of that. But as Christians, if we are leaning in that direction or don't

161
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:26,440
 think about it much, we actually should not be unaware. The Bible teaches about it. We

162
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:31,080
 should learn what God's word has to teach about it so that we understand our enemy,

163
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:39,600
 understand how he works. So that's the first thing. Disbelief is not helpful. If you don't

164
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,800
 understand your enemy, it's like you're very vulnerable, right? So we don't want to be

165
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,880
 vulnerable. We want to just very basically understand what does God's word teach about

166
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,320
 evil. And I think the most important thing is I'll just say here is that Jesus has defeated

167
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:57,080
 evil and in Jesus you have victory. So let's just be very clear about this. Now, the second

168
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:02,520
 thing is an excessive interest in evil. Now, when I was younger, I was in circles where

169
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:07,960
 people were obsessed with all those things and their focus was really on the wrong thing,

170
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:14,040
 which was on all the evil and all that stuff. While we should be aware that a spiritual

171
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:20,240
 war is being fought, our focus should be on Christ, his victory, and how we can live in

172
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:29,560
 that victory that Jesus has won for us. And if we do that, actually what that leads us

173
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:36,240
 in is that we become faithful disciples of Jesus. And faithful disciples of Jesus, what

174
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:43,840
 they do is they love people, they serve people, they share the good news about Jesus, they

175
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:52,000
 advance the kingdom of heaven, the kingdom of God through their discipleship. And so

176
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,440
 when we do that, the kingdom of darkness recedes and the kingdom of God advances. So that's

177
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:05,200
 what we focus on. We focus on advancing the kingdom of God and sharing the gospel and

178
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:12,800
 following Jesus and living in his victory. That's our focus. Now, by casting out the

179
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:17,960
 demon and setting man free, Jesus advances the kingdom of God and Jesus is saving and

180
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:24,400
 healing work in a man's life in a non-Jewish territory, a Gentile territory, and actually

181
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:32,680
 also foreshadows that his delivering and his healing work is for all peoples, not just

182
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:37,920
 for Jewish people, for Israelites, but for all people because they were outside of that

183
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:46,480
 region. So this is important. This is for everyone here. Let's continue in Mark, verse

184
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:54,480
 14, it says, "Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside,

185
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,680
 and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they saw the man

186
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:05,920
 who had been possessed by a legion of demons sitting there, dressed and in his right mind,

187
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:12,400
 and they were afraid. Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed

188
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:19,080
 man and told about the pigs as well. Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave

189
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:26,480
 their region. As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed

190
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:34,320
 begged to him to go with him. Jesus did not let him, but said, 'Go home to your own people

191
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:41,600
 and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.' So

192
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:48,160
 the man went away and began to tell the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him, and all the

193
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:55,720
 people were amazed." Now here we see two different responses of different people. There's the

194
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,000
 townspeople and there's the response of the man who's been set free. So let's look at

195
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,520
 the townspeople and their response first. So in verse 15 it said this, "When they came

196
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:11,800
 to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the demon, and he was sitting there, dressed

197
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:17,600
 and in his right mind, and that they were afraid." Now just picture this. I grew up

198
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:24,380
 in a little village in Germany, 5,000 people. It's like one building complex here, right?

199
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:32,000
 Now in our area, everyone knows people like this man. Whether it's a homeless man, whether

200
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,080
 it's somebody who has mental health issues, whether somebody has demon possession, whatever

201
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:47,600
 is going on, the villagers around all know. And so they knew this man. And now they see

202
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:52,000
 him sitting there in his right mind. They had tried to chain him up. They had tried

203
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 to tame him like an animal. And now suddenly Jesus has come along. He just speaks a word.

204
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 He doesn't fight or tries to tie him up. He just speaks a word. And this man is in his

205
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,280
 right mind and he's set free. This is incredible. This is absolutely incredible. And again,

206
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:15,640
 it just points to the authority and the power of Jesus. But we are told that the townspeople,

207
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:23,400
 they were afraid. Now that's quite normal when we experience the awesome and awe-inspiring

208
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:32,720
 power of God. That's a normal reaction. The disciples in the episode before, they also

209
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,920
 were afraid. But what's interesting is that in other parts of the gospel, when you read

210
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:45,200
 that people are, that Jesus drives out demons and heals the sick, other people bring people

211
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,480
 to Jesus for healing. They bring demon-possessed people because they want their neighbor, they

212
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:56,560
 want their person in a town or village that they know, they want them to be free. They

213
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:01,920
 want their friend who needs healing to be healed. But this is not what they do. It says

214
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:11,720
 that they begged Jesus to leave the area. Now why is that? Now some biblical scholars,

215
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:20,240
 they focus on the money. 2,000 pigs was a lot of cash. And so the theory is they were

216
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:26,640
 afraid of more financial loss, so they wanted Jesus to leave. That that was their focus.

217
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,880
 Now I believe there's some truth to it, but I don't believe it's everything. So I want

218
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:37,600
 to frame this in a little bit of a broader way. The townspeople are choosing comfort

219
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:43,760
 and status quo over change in their lives. I think that is really what's going on. And

220
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:50,040
 part of that is also the finances. So they're choosing comfort and status quo over change

221
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:56,560
 in their lives. In the gospel of John 3.19, it says this, "This is the verdict. Light

222
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:03,300
 has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds

223
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:10,640
 were evil." So people are comfortable with their lives, and they don't want anything

224
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:20,200
 to change. They prefer darkness to saving, healing, delivering work of Jesus. Comfort,

225
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:26,640
 maintaining your status quo is an idol, and it's often important to the people that God's

226
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:32,240
 -- it's often more important to people than God's kingdom breaking into their lives and

227
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:45,280
 oppressed people being set free and restored. Now, comfort can also be an idol for Christians.

228
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:49,160
 That not Jesus is at the center, as we, I believe, also sang earlier in some way or

229
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:58,720
 form, but that comfort is at the center. That we don't want God to disrupt our life. We

230
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:08,400
 want a little bit of Jesus, but we don't want all of Jesus. Sometimes comfort also has to

231
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,680
 do is that we're -- that our comfort place is actually a place where we're living in

232
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:22,340
 sin and doing what we knowingly know is wrong against God, against God's will for our lives.

233
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:30,480
 And we find comfort in that place, that place of pleasure and sin, and we don't really want

234
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:38,680
 that to change. We're actually quite happy there, or so at least we think. But a problem

235
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:46,160
 is when we get comfortable with our sin, we give Satan a foothold in our lives. And he

236
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:53,800
 seeks to enslave you. He seeks to destroy you. He seeks to bring havoc into your relationships

237
00:27:53,800 --> 00:28:03,760
 and destroy them. That's what happens. And he wants to make you ineffective for God's

238
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:13,320
 kingdom. So I just wonder, is there an area in your life where you have chosen the comfort

239
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:23,680
 of sin over what Jesus asks you to do? Let me say this again. Is there an area in your

240
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:31,040
 life where you have chosen the comfort of sin over what Jesus asks you to do? Now Jesus

241
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:39,440
 is calling you out of that place today. He's calling you to repentance and to turn to him

242
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:49,320
 and to surrender and submit that part, whatever that is, to him. And I'm not shaming. This

243
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:54,880
 is part of every Christian's journey. But if you're living there right now, Jesus is

244
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:02,160
 calling you out of that place. Don't give Satan a foothold in your life. Don't do it.

245
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:08,480
 He just brings destruction. This dehumanizes you, messes up your relationships, messes

246
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:17,360
 up your life, makes you ineffective for the kingdom. Well, let's look at how the man reacts

247
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:24,160
 to Jesus delivering him from the evil spirit. So we looked at the townspeople. They chose

248
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:29,400
 comfort. They didn't want anything to change. They wanted Jesus to leave. They didn't want

249
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:35,240
 Jesus' transformative power working in their lives. Now let's look at how the man responds.

250
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:43,920
 Well he is, it's a striking contrast. He begs to be with Jesus, to go with him. In other

251
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:49,560
 words, he wants to be his disciple. He wants to follow Jesus. He wants to be part of what

252
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:55,680
 Jesus is doing because the work that he's done is amazing. Finally, after what this

253
00:29:55,680 --> 00:30:02,720
 grueling existence before, howling day and night, cutting himself, being, experiencing

254
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:09,920
 demonic possession, he is free. But interestingly enough, Jesus does not grant his request.

255
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:17,560
 What? Because Jesus actually has something more important and something better for him.

256
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:25,000
 He actually sends him out as his disciple into, back to his hometown. So in verse 19

257
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,080
 it said, "Go home to your own people and tell them how much the Lord has done for you and

258
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:36,600
 how he has had mercy on you." Jesus sends him out to share what God has done in his

259
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:41,080
 life with the people he lives with, with the people he works, with his family that he probably

260
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:47,480
 hasn't seen in a long time. And then we're told as he does that, that people were amazed

261
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:55,000
 at his testimony. Because again, everyone knows him and they can see the change that

262
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,160
 has happened in his life. And now Jesus sends him out to bring that same change into other

263
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:08,120
 people's lives. Also interesting, Jesus doesn't go tell him, "Go fight evil spirits," even

264
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:12,720
 though that might be part of advancing the kingdom. But he tells him to go tell others

265
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:21,000
 your testimony of what Jesus has done. So again, the focus is on Jesus. Now this is

266
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:28,200
 a very fitting word for us at the end of our sermon series, Longing for Healing. When we

267
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:35,680
 experience the healing and saving work of Jesus, it is not meant to be kept to ourselves.

268
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:41,440
 Instead like this man that Jesus had delivered from evil spirits, Jesus sends us to go out

269
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:48,280
 to our families, our friends, our coworkers, our neighbors, and to testify to the healing

270
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:58,600
 and saving work that he has done in our lives. Our healing is not meant to be a dead end.

271
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:05,640
 Jesus is healed so we can be part of this healing work in this world. Now I just wonder

272
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:13,360
 who here is saying, "I want to go. I want to do this." Because that's your choice. That's

273
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,320
 my heart for us as a church, a church that goes, that wants to tell others about what

274
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:25,160
 Jesus is doing in our lives. Now at the beginning of the message, we asked the question, "How

275
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:30,840
 can I have victory over evil in my life? How can I experience freedom from patterns of

276
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:36,800
 sin and bondage and oppression that I'm experiencing in my life?" Now I actually never finished

277
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:47,520
 my story of when I was 14 years old. Again, I was not a Christian. I was living in fear.

278
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:55,920
 I was hopeless or getting to that point, not wanting to live like this, just wanting peace.

279
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:00,000
 And so out of desperation, I talked to my father again. Remember the first time was

280
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,680
 not helpful, but I was like, "I don't know what else to do." So I talked to my father.

281
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:10,480
 And this time he asked me, "Tim, have you placed your trust in Jesus?" And I hadn't.

282
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,800
 Even though I grew up in a Christian family, had millions of opportunities, I never did

283
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:20,360
 it. There was pride for whatever reason. I just didn't want to do it. And so that night,

284
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:26,960
 and I don't remember exactly how, I just called out to Jesus for help. "Help me, Jesus. Come

285
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:35,600
 into my life." And you know what was amazing? Those grimacing faces, they disappeared that

286
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:46,320
 night and I was able to sleep. And I finally had this peace that I was longing for. And

287
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:53,440
 this was so powerful. This is my coming to know Jesus experience. This was so powerful

288
00:33:53,440 --> 00:34:00,080
 that since that point in that age, I know that Jesus has the power and authority to

289
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:11,840
 set people free because it's my story and I'm testifying to it. Now, Colossians 1:13

290
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:18,000
 had become true for me. It says this, "For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness

291
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 and brought us into the kingdom of the son he loves." So Jesus had rescued me from the

292
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:37,680
 dominion of darkness and brought me into his kingdom, into a relationship with him. And

293
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:46,480
 in Jesus, this victory over evil is available to everyone who turns to Jesus. It's available

294
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:59,960
 to everyone. I want to invite the worship team to come up right now. Jesus died on the

295
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:09,140
 cross and rose from the dead to rescue and redeem us so that we can be set free from

296
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:16,960
 anything that binds us and that we can be brought into his kingdom where there is forgiveness,

297
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:30,600
 freedom, life, and salvation. So the most important step to overcome evil in your life

298
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:41,680
 is by becoming a Christian and experiencing the victory that is there in Jesus. So if

299
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,680
 you would like to take the step, like I did when I was 14 years old, where I said, "I

300
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:53,140
 need help, Jesus. I want you to come into my life." I want to invite you right now to

301
00:35:53,140 --> 00:36:03,560
 give me a little sign from your hand that you want to do that. I'm going to pray a prayer

302
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:11,460
 where you can pray this prayer. And that's the way of inviting Jesus, inviting the Holy

303
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:18,740
 Spirit into your life and receiving the victory and the life to the fullest that Jesus has

304
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:24,060
 for you. So to encourage those who are going to be praying this prayer and following along,

305
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:30,660
 I want to actually invite everyone to pray this prayer after me. So let's pray. Jesus,

306
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:43,020
 I need help. I'm tired of fighting these battles on my own. I'm sorry for all the wrong that

307
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:52,900
 I have done. Please forgive me. Thank you, Jesus, that you died on the cross for me and

308
00:36:52,900 --> 00:37:05,660
 that you rose so that my sins can be forgiven and I can receive the gift of new life in

309
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:24,580
 you. Thank you that in you, Jesus, I can experience victory over evil. Please come into my life,

310
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:38,980
 fill me with your Holy Spirit and give me your peace. Amen. Now, if you pray this prayer,

311
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:45,140
 you are a Christian now if you weren't before and the Holy Spirit indwells you. You get

312
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:53,220
 to share in the victory that Jesus has won over evil and you no longer need to give in

313
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:58,900
 to sin and into the works of the enemy. You can call on Jesus and he can give you the

314
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:06,140
 strength and the grace to overcome whatever is going on in your life. So praise God for

315
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:13,740
 his work there. Now, for those of us who are Christian, I also mentioned that at times

316
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:24,500
 we give Satan footholds in our lives. And we do this in different ways, whether it's

317
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:31,140
 giving in to some sin and getting stuck in addiction, we experience demonic oppression,

318
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:35,700
 maybe there's unhealthy relationships that we just can't get out of, can be many different

319
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:41,460
 things. And if you find yourself right now battling evil and there's just something going

320
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:46,700
 on where you are not able to break free on your own, I want to encourage you to stretch

321
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:53,820
 out your hands before you. And I want to share a verse with you. It says from James 4, 7

322
00:38:53,820 --> 00:39:00,660
 says to submit yourself then to God, resist the devil and he will flee from you. And so

323
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:05,880
 you're expressing that like, Lord, I submit to you. I desire for you to meet me in this

324
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:10,820
 area of my life where I'm just stuck in this pattern that is destructive. And I don't want

325
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:16,140
 to be stuck in that anymore. And I actually want to invite the people around you to see

326
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:21,660
 somebody stretching out their hands. I want to invite people around you to actually go

327
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:27,020
 and to pray for them. So let's do this right now for a few minutes as we do often here

328
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:36,300
 at the Vine and then I'll pray for us. Let's do this right now.

329
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:40,420
 Somebody sitting around you. Don't let them just sit there with their hands stretched

330
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:43,300
 out, but go and pray for them.
