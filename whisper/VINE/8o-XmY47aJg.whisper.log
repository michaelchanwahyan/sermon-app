[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.560]   So there's a sound, a sound that you are familiar with more than any other.
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:15.680]   When you hear it, your whole being responds and reacts, shifting towards it, suddenly
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.400]   conscious of nothing else.
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.200]   By this sound, you have been shaped.
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:30.780]   You have been identified, at one and the same time, as very common and yet beautifully unique.
[00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:36.660]   This sound travels with you, it goes before you, it follows after you.
[00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:46.200]   When the sound is loud, it can summon up all anger, hatred, revenge, joy.
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:55.280]   And that sound is soft, it invites compassion, seduction, intimacy, love.
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.160]   It is a sound that both creates and also corrects.
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.080]   And if I was to make this sound right now, it would fill you with a sense of dignity
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.040]   and honor not possible in any other way.
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.400]   What is this sound?
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.200]   It is your name.
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.840]   And the day when my wife and I named our daughter is perhaps one of the most special days of
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.840]   my life.
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.900]   If you've been here at the Vine for a while, you'll know that my wife and I were not able
[00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.760]   to have our own biological children.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.040]   And so we have built our family through the wonder of adoption.
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.320]   And I remember adoption being a difficult journey with some beautiful moments in it.
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.200]   One of the interesting things about adoption is that you often with adoption don't meet
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.400]   the child on the first day that they're born.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.440]   Often that will happen later.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.640]   My wife and I were matched to our daughter when she was 16 months old.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.160]   The photo that's coming up here behind me now was taken...
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.520]   I know, I just wanted to put a photo of my daughter.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.840]   I shaped the whole message around that photo right there.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.760]   I took this photo just 15 minutes after meeting her for the very first time.
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.320]   Can you imagine?
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.840]   Heart-melt moment, right?
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.760]   Now here's the interesting thing.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.000]   Our daughter, understandably, came with a name.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.840]   I mean, she was 16 months old, wasn't she?
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.000]   And so she had been given a name from her biological mother.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   And so in the first two sessions when we spent time with our daughter, we used the name,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.800]   of course, that she had been given.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.640]   But my wife and I, we had said during the adoption process, long before we got matched,
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.760]   that we wanted the honor of naming our child.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.440]   Because most other families, when they give birth biologically, have that honor of doing
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.440]   that.
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.440]   And we didn't want that honor necessarily taken away from us, because there's power
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.400]   in naming something.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.080]   That naming something carries with it a story and a journey and speaks of something.
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.680]   And so we wanted to do this.
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.400]   And so we had a list of names, just like every normal family.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.760]   A list of names.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.360]   Some were good, some were really bad, but there was a list of names.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.760]   And we decided that we were gonna spend a couple of times meeting with our daughter
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.400]   before deciding which name was suitable, because we wanted to name her in a way that would
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.520]   capture her character, capture something about her.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.120]   Because that's what names do, don't they?
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.400]   They shape and tell you something about that person, who they are, maybe something that
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.920]   labels them in a certain way.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.880]   And so we spent a couple of sessions just hanging out with her, getting to know her,
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.120]   discovering her personality.
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.720]   And soon after that, about a week after meeting her, when I took this photo for the first
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.400]   time, we named her Mia Lynn Gardner.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:52.720]   Mia is Latin for "mine."
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.880]   This was like my wife and I going, "Back off, every human being in the world.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.960]   This one is mine.
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:01.960]   This one is ours.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.000]   We're taking this one into our family.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.120]   No one else is ever gonna have this one.
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.660]   This is her forever family."
[00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.440]   But we also knew that this was an important name for her too, for every time she says
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:20.080]   her name from that moment onwards, she's also declaring, "These parents are mine.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.320]   No one can take them away from me either.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.840]   They are mine.
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.960]   They're a part of my forever family.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.760]   So she is Mia, mine."
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:40.000]   Lynn is my wife's mother's name.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.560]   And it's a beautiful name.
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.720]   And we decided that when we were naming Mia, that we had to name her along her New Zealand
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.920]   family, not just her British family.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:53.300]   We knew that she would have the last name Gardner, my name as the British family line.
[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.840]   But we also decided that she needed to carry her New Zealand family name.
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.720]   That's important, the whanau in New Zealand.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.000]   That's the Maori name for family.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.320]   We wanted her to represent her whanau in New Zealand.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.920]   So Lynn was the gateway for that, saying that Mia has connected to the land of the long
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:16.100]   white cloud, that's New Zealand, and she's connected to the UK through me.
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.360]   And that name was important because there's power in a name.
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.920]   And now anytime that my daughter ever says that name, anytime I ever write it on a piece
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:31.220]   of paper, I'm declaring to the world that her story changed on that day.
[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.960]   And her story is a beautiful one about to be written.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.200]   She is mine.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.300]   She's connected.
[00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.780]   She has a family.
[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.240]   It is glorious.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.440]   Now the Bible, the Bible often talks about the power of a name.
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.760]   In fact, sometimes I think God spends most of his time in the Bible naming things.
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.040]   I don't know if you've ever noticed this.
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.360]   If you've been coming to the Vine for a while and listening to my preaching, you'll know
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.640]   that so often I'll pause when I'm explaining a passage and I'll tell you about the name
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.640]   of somebody.
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:08.200]   I'll explain to you what that name means of a person or of the village that the disciples
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.200]   are in.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:14.360]   Because more often than not, the Bible writers are including those names because in the name
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.960]   there is something captured that will tell you about that message, tell you about what
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.760]   God is actually trying to say and do in that moment.
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.440]   I don't know if you've noticed this in the Bible either, but God has this tendency of
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.880]   changing people's names, of going, "Oh, you're this.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:30.880]   No, you're not that.
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.220]   You're actually this."
[00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:39.640]   So we have God creating the very first human being and he says, "This is Adam," from the
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.120]   Hebrew word Adama.
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.940]   Adama meaning soil or dirt.
[00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:49.080]   And it was God's way of going, "Watch what God can do, that I can take the very soil
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:54.600]   and dirt of creation and create the most wonderful thing, this thing called humanity."
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:04.000]   Jacob, which means son of laughter, his name is changed to Israel, which means to suffer.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.760]   And if I was him, I would rather have had the first name.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:15.120]   But God names him Israel because to suffer would be what would shape and face Israel
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.440]   as this nation's history.
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:21.280]   You could argue even to this day, and yet God who walks with a group of people who are
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.840]   in pain and can show them his grace and his mercy.
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:29.160]   And if there's ever a nation that has shown the wonder and the miracle and the mercy of
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.320]   God, surely it's Israel.
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:38.980]   Simon, Simon who has this moment, a fisherman for many years, has this moment of clarity
[00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.600]   when Jesus says, "Who do you think I am?"
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:45.360]   And he says, "You're the Messiah, the son of God, right?"
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:50.320]   Jesus says, "I'm no longer going to call you Simon anymore, but your name is Peter,
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.600]   because Peter means rock.
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.600]   And from this point on, I'm going to build my church.
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:58.360]   I'm going to build the people that will always gather under my name, under the foundation
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.960]   of the revelation of the understanding that I am the Messiah.
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.400]   Oh, you're now Peter, the rock."
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:08.920]   God loves to change our names because a little bit like with Chris and I, in that moment
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:12.880]   of adoption, where we were honoring the name that she had been given, of course, by her
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:18.680]   biological mom, but we wanted to put an imprint on her to say that this is now her story.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.120]   So God names us.
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:25.920]   And when he names us, it's like he's declaring over us our character, who we are, what it
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.360]   is that he sees in us.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:32.280]   It is both a declaration of his ownership, but it is also an invitation into the prophetic
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.520]   life that we're going to live in him.
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:44.960]   And there is one name, one name that we should all long for him to call us.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:51.280]   To understand what that name is, we have to understand the trajectory of human history.
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.880]   My staff are going to roll their eyes right now, because I'm going to talk about Genesis
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.320]   1 and 2, and I do that a lot.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:04.400]   But in Genesis 1 and 2, God creates humanity, male, female, brings them together, and God
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.720]   reveals his intimacy to Adam and Eve.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:12.560]   And God names them, claims them, and draws them to his family.
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:16.040]   And you see this wonderful picture of intimacy in Genesis 1 and 2.
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:20.920]   We're told that they walk together, the three of them, in this intimate family unit together
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:24.600]   in the cornice of the night in the garden itself.
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:29.920]   It is a wonderful picture of what the Bible describes as shalom, this word peace, which
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:35.440]   just basically means the wholeness of creation, the way things were always intended to be.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.800]   This was before sin.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.400]   This was before brokenness.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:42.160]   This was the way that God had created his relationship with humanity to be.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.200]   It's shalom, it's peace.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:50.440]   And we know what happens then in Genesis 3, as we turn the page of the Bible.
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.680]   And Adam and Eve, through their disobedience to the things that God had called them to,
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.320]   bring sin into the world.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:00.160]   And that ruptures that relationship, that intimacy they had in that garden, didn't it?
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.200]   And here's an interesting thing that happens.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.760]   God pushes them out intentionally from the garden.
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.960]   In other words, he pushes them away from that intimacy that they had experienced because
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:13.680]   sin had now driven a wedge between the human and the divine.
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:18.720]   In a way, Adam and Eve are pushed out to be orphans in the world.
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.680]   And the rest of the biblical narrative is really Adam and Eve and then humanity trying
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:27.560]   to get back into right relationship with God, trying to do all that they can to win God's
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.560]   favor again.
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.240]   They even try to build a tower that reaches up to the heavens so that they can be with
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.240]   God again.
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.640]   And God comes and says, "That's not the way this works.
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.060]   You have created the division, but if it's going to be restored, it's going to be restored
[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.060]   at my hand."
[00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.760]   And God comes and he takes Abraham.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.880]   He actually changes his name.
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:46.880]   His name's Abram.
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.720]   He changes it to Abraham.
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:49.720]   And he gives him a calling.
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.560]   "You'll be a blessing to all nations."
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:54.000]   And through Abraham comes the Lion of Israel.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.800]   And through that comes the people of God.
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.480]   And God meets with them and is intimate with them and begins to show them a way, teaches
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.720]   them their character, gives them the law, helps them to understand how to live as representatives
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.800]   of his in the world.
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:10.180]   But that divide is still there and that sin still gets in the way.
[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:12.400]   So God sends Jesus.
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:18.760]   Jesus through his life and his death and his resurrection pays the price for that brokenness
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.800]   and that division, stands in the gap.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:27.280]   The Bible describes it as reconciling us back to him, creating shalom again, peace
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.600]   between humanity and God.
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:33.120]   He's declared Jesus the Prince of Peace.
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:37.920]   And in the Prince of Peace, as he reconciles us back to God, Paul then, writing to the
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.160]   early church, says this.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.160]   Guess what?
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.320]   You're not just reconciled to God.
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.640]   Now you are reconcilers in the world.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.440]   You've been given the ministry of reconciliation.
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.240]   And as you do that, guess what?
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:54.960]   You are doing that because you are now changed in your status with God.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.760]   And the language that is used by Paul in the New Testament and the early church is the
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.520]   language of adoption.
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:07.000]   You've been adopted into God's family, that he, through the life, death and resurrection
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.860]   of Jesus, not because of what you've done, but because of what he's done, you are now
[00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:12.200]   swept up in a new story.
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:17.800]   And so what is that name that is the most valuable, beautiful name you could ever be
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.600]   called?
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.640]   Child of God.
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:29.840]   You're a son and daughter of God, a child of God, meaning you are now adopted into his
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:34.520]   family, meaning that your name has changed, your future has changed, your trajectory in
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:35.840]   life has changed.
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:40.300]   The enemy may have come to kill, steal and destroy, but he has come to give life and
[00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:41.300]   life abundant.
[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:45.760]   And we now have this name, children of God.
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.920]   And that name brings authority.
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:55.320]   That name marks us for something that is different to others in the world.
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.840]   And we don't hold that name with a sense of human pride.
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:05.000]   We hold it with humility, but it fills us with an authority and a power and a destiny
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.160]   that can be given no other way than the fact that Jesus has called you his child.
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.960]   Are you with me?
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:20.800]   All of which is why it's really important what Jesus says in the Beatitudes, the Beatitudes
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:25.480]   being this manifesto for Jesus of what the kingdom of God is all about.
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:29.520]   And I want you to read this or I'm going to read this to you from Matthew 5, verse 9.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:37.720]   It says this, "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God."
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.600]   Sit with that for a moment.
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:46.520]   "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they are the ones who hold my name."
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:50.720]   They're the ones who are going to live out this calling of being a child.
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.040]   Oh, it's the peacemakers.
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:57.200]   Jesus says this, and it's really interesting because it's the only time in the Beatitudes
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:03.480]   where Jesus says this, where he names something, accords people something because of an attitude
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.480]   that they have.
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:10.040]   For the other Beatitudes, what results in that attitude is a action that responds to
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.040]   that attitude.
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.040]   Give me an example.
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:17.680]   "Blessed are those who are merciful, for they will receive mercy."
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:23.200]   Or "Blessed are those who seek and hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.520]   be filled."
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:27.920]   Or "Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted."
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:32.120]   In other words, the action, the result equals to what it is that they put in.
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:36.720]   Now, if Jesus had kept that formula, here's what he would have said at Matthew 5, 9.
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.880]   "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will know peace."
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.740]   But he didn't say that.
[00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:44.800]   He changes the formula here.
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:48.120]   And one of the questions we should ask ourselves as good Bible scholars, as we read the Bible,
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:51.840]   is why does he mess up the formula here?
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:56.400]   What does this mean to say, "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be children of
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.400]   God"?
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:02.440]   Our temptation is to read that passage and go, "Well, this is a causation kind of statement."
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:07.600]   In other words, I earned my way into being in God's family by being a maker of peace.
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.280]   That's the wrong way to read this.
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:10.600]   That's a theological disaster.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.300]   I mean, you know, right?
[00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:15.600]   You know that we don't earn our way into God's family.
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:19.360]   You don't earn your way into his acceptance and into his love.
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.480]   In fact, it's given to us through faith in grace.
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:29.000]   A very important passage to read here in relation to Matthew 5, 9 is John 1, verse 12.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.280]   "All who have received him, all who have believed in his name, have the right to be
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:36.640]   called children of God."
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.400]   In other words, you don't earn it.
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.180]   You don't work towards it.
[00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:42.180]   You accept it.
[00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:43.240]   You receive it.
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.320]   You recognize that Christ has died for your sins.
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:48.940]   And when you bring that to him, you're set free and you find new life.
[00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:53.360]   And just because of that, you're a son, you're a daughter, you're a child of God.
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:57.960]   So when Jesus says, "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be named, called children of
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.960]   God," what is he saying here?
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:05.480]   He's saying that your peacemaking doesn't cause you to be in your family.
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:11.840]   Your peacemaking shows the world that you're a part of my family.
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:17.160]   It's Jesus saying, "You want to know what my children look like?
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.560]   They look like people who make peace."
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:26.320]   A few years ago, my daughter Mia, she wanted to start to learn how to skateboard.
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.860]   I was so excited because I grew up as a skateboarder.
[00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:33.040]   Skateboarding was my big passion when I was a teenager into my early 20s.
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:37.520]   When I turned 40, I had a midlife crisis and I couldn't afford a motorbike, so I brought
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:39.480]   a skateboard.
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:42.360]   I love skateboarding, always have, always followed it.
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:46.160]   And a few years ago, my daughter said, "Daddy, I've seen you skateboard.
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.160]   I want to try it."
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:50.940]   I was like, "This is the best day of my life."
[00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:53.760]   So we brought her a skateboard, we brought her all the pads, made sure it was safe.
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:57.600]   We took her to the skate park and I was amazed, blown away.
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.600]   She went up in the slopes and down the slopes.
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:04.160]   I mean, within the first day, she was skating so confidently and I realized that she had
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:08.160]   the same anointing that her father had.
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:16.440]   And I was so impressed because everybody thinks it's DNA, but it's not always biological.
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:20.500]   And as she's skateboarding, this is what comes out of my mouth, almost naturally without
[00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:21.880]   me even thinking about it.
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.360]   That's my girl.
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:27.000]   Are you with me?
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.520]   And this is what Jesus is saying.
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.880]   He's saying, "You know what?
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:35.760]   When you walk into a difficult conflict, when you brave a hard conversation that you've
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:39.820]   been putting off, when you humble yourself towards somebody that you've upset and there's
[00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:44.760]   a division, when you actually become a maker of peace, I step back and I go, 'That's my
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:46.560]   girl.
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.600]   That's my boy right there.
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:49.600]   That's my child.
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:54.480]   Blessed are the peacemakers for they are the ones that prove they are my children.'"
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.960]   Are you with me?
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:02.080]   Oh, this is so beautiful and deeply challenging.
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:07.240]   Because if this is true, then perhaps one of the most important things that the people
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:15.100]   of God must do at all times is everyday peacemaking.
[00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:19.440]   And I think that raises a challenging question for us as a church in this time.
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:26.480]   Are we proving to be God's children in the very hour of Hong Kong's history when we need
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:30.000]   to be the most?
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.780]   Are we?
[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:42.200]   Because blessed are the peacemakers for they're the ones where I'm going to go, "That's mine.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.200]   That's Mia.
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.200]   Mine."
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:50.920]   I want to unpack for you a little bit what peacemaking is all about today because I want
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:57.480]   to call us as a church to it because I believe that as we reopen ourselves after this fifth
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:02.840]   wave, there is no more important thing for us to be doing than being makers of peace.
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.760]   What does Jesus mean when he says, "Blessed are the peacemakers"?
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:08.600]   Well, let me tell you what he didn't say.
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:16.320]   He didn't say this, "Blessed are the peacekeepers for they will be called children of God."
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:21.720]   Peacekeepers are those who will do everything in their power to avoid conflict.
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:25.400]   Peacekeepers are those that will submit to compromise all the time.
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:28.920]   They were the ones who will do whatever it can to make sure that no one is upset with
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:29.920]   them.
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.920]   No one is upset with anybody else, that everything is okay, right?
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:32.920]   Everything's okay.
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:33.920]   I'm sure everything's okay.
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:34.920]   Are you sure it's okay?
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:37.440]   I'm not sure if it's okay, but we're going to pretend it's okay, right?
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:41.000]   Peacekeepers are those that will compromise their values and their beliefs at times to
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.760]   ensure that there is just this kind of sense of harmony amongst people.
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:50.080]   They're the ones that are going to do their very best not to upset anybody.
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:54.280]   There might be a raging elephant in the corner of the room, but they are serving tea with
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.920]   a fake smile on their face.
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:02.320]   Jesus didn't say, "Blessed are the peacekeepers."
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.760]   That's not the way of Jesus.
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:11.600]   Jesus never advocated for peace through self-ignorance or avoidant behavior.
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:20.080]   In fact, sometimes Jesus was willing to break the false peace of the status quo in order
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:24.840]   to actually build the true peace of the kingdom of God.
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:28.680]   We saw one of those very moments last week, didn't we, when he walked into the temple
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:36.760]   and overturned the tables there, upsetting the false peace of the status quo of the temple.
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:44.480]   See, peacekeeping is passive, but peacemaking is active.
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.800]   Jesus also didn't say this.
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:52.840]   He didn't say, "Blessed are the peace lovers, for they will be called children of God."
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.360]   Everybody loves the idea of peace.
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:55.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.400]   I challenge you to find someone who doesn't like the idea.
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.400]   "I like war.
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.400]   I want war."
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:03.800]   Most people love peace, and they'll tweet about it.
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.040]   They'll post about it.
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:06.880]   They'll hashtag about it.
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:10.120]   They'll put something up on Instagram that fights for peace, that says something.
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:13.560]   They'll quote some famous person that said something about peace.
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:19.320]   Oh, everybody wants to be a peace lover, but nobody actually wants to do the hard work
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.640]   of creating peace.
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:26.320]   So you can be a peace lover all you want, and you can wax lyrical about it, but if you're
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:30.640]   not actually working in your life towards creating and building peace, then you are
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.160]   not a child of God.
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.520]   You're not someone God's going to stand over and say, "Hey, well done.
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.560]   Well done for having the idea of peace.
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:38.560]   Great job.
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:40.320]   Oh, well done for having a heart towards peace.
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:41.320]   That's nice."
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:46.460]   No, no, this person right here is walking into conflict and doing the hard work of extending
[00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:50.360]   their hands towards those who are opposed to one another and doing their best through
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:56.520]   a self-sacrificial moment of love to see two people who cannot talk together and build
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:58.240]   a bridge towards them.
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.480]   That is someone who is making peace.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:04.880]   And I have to be really careful not to stand up here today, and I was challenged on this
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:10.200]   this week as I was preparing this message, but I cannot stand before you as a peace lover.
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:16.520]   I have to try to stand before you as someone committed to the hard work of peace.
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:17.960]   Jesus also didn't say this.
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:22.520]   He didn't say, "Blessed are the peace achievers, for they will be called children of God."
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.320]   And I'm so glad he didn't say that.
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.520]   Because you know what?
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:32.280]   No matter how hard we might try sometimes, sometimes we can't achieve peace.
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.740]   Sometimes peace is elusive to us.
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:37.280]   Sometimes peace seems to be a little bit too far away.
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:42.200]   Sometimes despite our efforts, the other person that we're trying to be reconciled to doesn't
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:45.880]   want to be reconciled to, and we feel a failure because of that.
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:49.320]   Jesus did not say, "Blessed are the peace achievers."
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:55.280]   He said, "Blessed are the ones who are committed to the process of working towards peace."
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:23:00.080]   You have to read Matthew 5, 9 in conjunction with Romans 12, 18.
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:05.820]   There it says this, "If possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with one
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:06.820]   another."
[00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:09.120]   I love the practicality of Paul.
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:13.120]   "If possible," because it isn't always possible.
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.600]   But if it is possible, live at peace with one another.
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:21.720]   But then notice this, even if it is not possible, you better make sure that you're not the one
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:23.240]   who's holding up the peace.
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:27.720]   In other words, as far as it depends on you.
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.520]   The ball's in your court in God's eyes.
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:33.440]   And he's saying, "You better be working all you can towards making peace."
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:37.920]   And sometimes that peace will not be achievable because there's some other things happening.
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:39.560]   The other person's not willing to respond.
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:41.000]   The other side is staying away.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.240]   I understand that.
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:46.080]   But you better be making sure that you're not a conduit to breaking peace.
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:50.760]   You better make sure that you're doing everything that you can to live peacefully with the people
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:55.400]   around you, holding out your hands, building those roles, walking in the conflict as much
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:24:00.040]   as you can, because blessed are the peacemakers, not the peace achievers.
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:04.120]   "Trust me with the achievement of peace," Jesus is saying to his people.
[00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:05.480]   "Put it in my hands.
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:10.320]   It's my grace ultimately that creates peace."
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:19.880]   Overall, give up your life, pick up your cross, lay down your pride, lay down even
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:32.800]   the fact that you think you're right, and love your neighbor and your enemy as yourself.
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:36.360]   Our ultimate example of a peacemaker, of course, is Jesus Christ.
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.840]   He's our example and our mentor.
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:42.600]   And a quick look at his life will show us what peacemaking is all about.
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.320]   It's not easy.
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:52.240]   You know, Jesus amazingly, amazingly did not bring peace for Israel through the temptation
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:55.400]   of picking up military might or physical violence.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:25:00.040]   In fact, the one time where we see a disciple physically being violent to another, taking
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:05.720]   a sword and cutting off a centurion's ear, Jesus is so freaked out by this moment of
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:09.960]   violence that he picks up the bloody ear and he walks up to the soldier who must have been
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:17.400]   wailing his eyes out and places it on his head and prays and restores him back to life.
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:22.880]   Jesus is one who doesn't use violence to achieve peace.
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:25.840]   In fact, he's one who models something very different to us.
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:32.960]   Jesus shows us that the life and the work of the peacemaker is not some fairy tale euphoria,
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:40.240]   but it is some gritty, subversive and sacrificial life of faithfulness to God and to a kingdom
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:46.880]   that has standards that are different to the systems and powers of this world.
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:48.480]   That's Jesus.
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:54.200]   That's Jesus, the Prince of Peace, who's willing to lay down his life so that others might
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:57.680]   know reconciliation again.
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:01.200]   And one of the great arguments that comes against the church when the church tries to
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:07.400]   be a peacemaker is that oftentimes people will say, "Well, peacemakers are soft.
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:10.920]   Peacemakers are just kumbaya peace lovers.
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:15.320]   They're just interested in wiping over injustice, ignoring justice.
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:20.120]   I don't like peacemaking because it doesn't allow those who are evil to be held account
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.120]   for their evil."
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.600]   That's not peacemaking.
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.040]   That's peacekeeping.
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:31.600]   Justice's role of peacemaking never averted the reality of an injustice that has happened,
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:35.760]   never covers up the reality that an evil may have been done.
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:43.400]   In fact, peacemaking does not ignore injustice, nor does it advocate pressing on without addressing
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:45.320]   it.
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.640]   Peacemaking actually faces injustice.
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:56.160]   It actually runs and walks intentionally towards injustice and conflict and stands within it
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.160]   in order to heal it.
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:00.560]   Are you following me?
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:03.040]   This is the life of Jesus Christ.
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:04.560]   Think about it for a second.
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:05.560]   Step back one moment.
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:07.000]   Think about this biblically.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.200]   The greatest conflict that there ever was in all of creation was that conflict in Genesis
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.440]   3 between humanity and God.
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:18.360]   The greatest divide that's ever happened, the one that's caused the most amount of pain
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:21.080]   is that divide that happened in that moment.
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:25.280]   And Jesus did not stand at a distance.
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:28.800]   Jesus did not ignore the reality of sin.
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:34.360]   Jesus instead decided to incarnate himself as Paul beautifully writes about in Philippians
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:40.880]   2, was willing to leave his kingship behind and subvert himself to being a sacrifice for
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:47.000]   all people, willing to subvert himself to the people of God, to humanity itself in order
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.040]   to win them, in order to love them, in order to show them a new way.
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:56.320]   He was willing to be ridiculed, spat on, sent to a cross, killed in the most painful way.
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:57.320]   Why?
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:01.880]   Because he was willing to be inside the very heart of the injustice of the brokenness of
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.580]   humanity and restore it from within.
[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:10.760]   And in doing that, he shows us what reconciliation and justice truly is.
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:15.920]   And then God's people are now called to be ministers of that reconciliation.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:20.040]   What does it mean for us to be peacemakers, to stand back, to pretend that there's a big
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:22.880]   elephant in the room and ignore it by drinking a cup of tea?
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:26.560]   Does it mean that we love justice and tweet it out and think that that's great and we've
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:27.680]   ticked that box?
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:32.760]   Or does it actually mean picking up our cross, laying down our lives, taking our pride, killing
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:42.320]   it, and being willing to do the hard work of being God's true children, ones that he
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:49.000]   can call mine?
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:58.960]   I think as we wrestle with this, we have to sit in this reality that peacemaking is tough,
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:05.400]   that it's scary, that it takes a lot of courage to do that kind of work.
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:08.920]   My friend and mentor, Shane Claiborne, I've followed him for many years.
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:09.920]   I have a relationship with him.
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:11.400]   We talked a number of times about peacemaking.
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:15.720]   He's been here at the Vine actually, talking to us at the Justice Conference about peacemaking.
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:19.360]   He wrote this, "Peacemaking doesn't mean passivity.
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:24.240]   It is the act of interrupting injustice without mirroring injustice, the act of disarming
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:28.880]   evil without destroying the evildoer, the act of finding a third way that is neither
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:35.160]   fight nor flight, but the careful, arduous pursuit of reconciliation and justice."
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:37.600]   Isn't that beautiful?
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:42.440]   God stands back from these kinds of people, and he goes, "That's my girl.
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:44.080]   That's my boy.
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:45.520]   Look at them.
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:46.520]   Look at them go."
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:53.520]   I think as we emerge from this fifth wave, as we think about what it means to be reopened
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:30:01.680]   to a Hong Kong society that is still deeply divided from three years ago, we have to emerge
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:04.800]   as makers of peace.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:11.000]   I think we are in a window of opportunity because we are the only people, we are the
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.720]   only humans in this city, I believe, who are able to offer the brokenness and the division
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:19.000]   a new way and a new path.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.920]   Surely we who have been marked as the children of God are the ones who can step forward in
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:29.240]   this time with a new story, with a new name on us and a new name on others and say, "We
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:36.680]   are willing to forge those that have been at the extremes and draw them together."
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:41.760]   Because there may not be any physical process still on our streets in Hong Kong, but there's
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:45.360]   still deep divisions in families in this city.
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:52.420]   There's still deep divisions in workplaces, in churches, in the generations of this city.
[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:54.680]   Those things have not gone away.
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:59.400]   The passing of a law has not removed them from this city.
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:04.360]   And we have an opportunity to say, "There's a lot of hurting people, ourselves included."
[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:13.000]   Oh man, though, what would it look like if we didn't take a side and we actually fought
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   for peace?
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.480]   You see, being a peacemaker is hard work.
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:22.680]   It is a lot easier to be an extremist with a perspective.
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:27.720]   Oh, it's a lot easier to take an extreme position when it comes to a divisive debate.
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.080]   It's a lot easier to be yellow or blue.
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:33.720]   It's a lot easier to stand for abortion or stand for pro-life.
[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:39.760]   It's a lot easier to decide to stand for black or stand for white or stand for gay or stand
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:42.040]   for straight or whatever the issue might be.
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:46.680]   It's much easier to push yourself to the extreme and find a tribe there and point a finger
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:48.120]   at the people on the other side.
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:51.200]   That's the easy path, but that's not the path of Jesus.
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:57.720]   Jesus forges a narrow path, a path in the middle, one in which you take the hand of
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:03.880]   those that are deeply opposed to each other and you do the work of embracing the conversations,
[00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:09.080]   having the talk, embracing the words, being honest with the brokenness, talking about
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:14.800]   the hurt, not covering up the injustice, but instead working together, finding the beauty
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:19.920]   and the honor of our humanity together, seeing the moments of God, even in the other person
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.200]   on the other side.
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:27.080]   And when we do that, we are becoming his children, showing the world what God's family looks
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.280]   like.
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:35.940]   But if we stay on the extremes and point the finger, we are dividing and we are showing
[00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:45.600]   the world we are children of the enemy who has come to kill, divide and destroy.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:54.400]   We have this invitation to stand in the middle, even if we might have opinion about which
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:33:06.200]   side might be right or wrong, and lay down our right to be right and serve the other,
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:10.760]   even the other that we disagree with.
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:16.520]   I wonder what the future of Hong Kong might look like if we really were the children of
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:17.520]   God.
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:23.360]   Now, I don't want to just be a lover of peace and not a maker of it.
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:24.360]   I want to help you with this.
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:26.240]   And I've gone a little bit long.
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.360]   I'm going to go another five minutes and tell you how to do this.
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:29.360]   Is that okay?
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:30.600]   Because I know you want to know how.
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.680]   You're like, "Okay, Andrew, that's a lot of good stuff."
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:34.920]   All right, I get it, Andrew.
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:36.560]   You've won me over with Scripture.
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.320]   I still have no idea how I do this.
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:40.680]   "Oh, Andrew, you don't know about my situation.
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.160]   You don't know how bad that is.
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:43.760]   You haven't seen the division that I'm dealing with.
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:45.880]   There's no way that could be fixed."
[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:50.520]   Here's a couple of quick practical ways that you can be an everyday peacemaker.
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:54.720]   And this is where the last two weeks of this course, of this time together, has all come
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:55.720]   together.
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:57.640]   This is the culmination of what this has all been about.
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:58.640]   Here's the first thing.
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:00.740]   We begin our healing journey.
[00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:05.520]   You can't be a peacemaker if there is still deep trauma inside of you.
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:09.120]   And in week one, I spoke about the power and the need that we have for forgiveness, for
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:11.880]   mercy, for God's love to restore and renew us.
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:17.560]   Oh, we lean into Him in our healing journey so that we go forward as peacemakers, not
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:21.800]   perfect but ones that have received the touch and heal and liberation and reconciliation
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:22.800]   of God.
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:23.800]   That's week one.
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:24.880]   Week two, here's the second thing.
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:26.640]   We deal with our sin.
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:32.200]   Week two, I said, we have to go and invite Jesus into our temple and allow Him to turn
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:34.280]   over some tables that need to be turned over.
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.640]   We need to deal with our sin.
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:39.920]   We need to make sure that as we move forward as peacemakers, that we're again, not perfect
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:42.000]   people but people under the grace of God.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.720]   And here's what will happen every single time.
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:47.680]   Your sin will drive you to the extremes.
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:52.960]   It is God's grace and forgiveness, His holiness and purity that will sustain you in the middle
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:53.960]   space.
[00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:56.080]   Here's the third thing.
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:58.160]   Embrace relational proximity.
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:03.820]   What that means is you cannot hope to be a peacemaker and stay removed from the people
[00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:06.280]   you're trying to build peace with.
[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:12.200]   It means that you cannot try to be a peacemaker and try to stay away, not know, not be in
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:15.720]   relationship with the ones that perhaps are hurting you, upsetting you.
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:18.760]   Oh, well, we have to have relational proximity.
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:20.640]   Jesus modeled for this beautifully.
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:21.880]   He hung with the sinner.
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:23.380]   He hung with the outcast.
[00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:26.840]   He hung with the ones that weren't allowed in the temple, the ones that were unclean.
[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:29.040]   And equally, He hung with those with power.
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.560]   He hung with the Pharisees.
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:35.420]   And with every single one, He ministered justice, truth, reconciliation, love.
[00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:37.500]   He didn't choose sides.
[00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:39.420]   He drew people to the kingdom of God.
[00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:43.700]   If you want to be an everyday peacemaker, you have to be willing to get to know some
[00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:48.260]   people that you don't like.
[00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:49.260]   Here's the third thing.
[00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:50.260]   Fourth thing, maybe.
[00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:53.100]   I can't remember.
[00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:54.420]   Think beyond ourselves.
[00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:57.100]   This is a hard one to do.
[00:35:57.100 --> 00:36:00.460]   It's easy for us to think about our own situation and our own circumstance.
[00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:04.180]   "Oh, pastor, my situation is X, Y, and Z."
[00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:07.900]   If you want to be an everyday peacemaker, you have to think beyond just your circumstance
[00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:11.500]   and think about the issue from the other person's perspective.
[00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:14.460]   Think about what it might be like that they're going through, what it is that they're challenged
[00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:19.400]   with, how they might feel in this situation, how even your own actions and words may have
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:21.180]   impacted them on their side.
[00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:23.020]   That's a very difficult thing to do.
[00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:29.580]   But this is a kingdom of God thing because Jesus came to the world and never sinned.
[00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:34.420]   But he looked on the other side to us who are sinners, and he understood our pain, and
[00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:39.620]   he went to the cross because he believed he could heal that pain.
[00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:40.620]   Here's the next thing.
[00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:43.740]   Look for collaboration with the people you don't like.
[00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:44.740]   Guess what?
[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:48.260]   The person you don't like and the person on the other side is not the sum total of the
[00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:49.260]   thing that's the issue.
[00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:51.620]   That's not the sum total of who they are.
[00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:54.020]   There are some beautiful moments of humanity in them.
[00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:56.980]   There are some beautiful moments of the goodness of God in them.
[00:36:56.980 --> 00:37:01.800]   And where we as everyday peacemakers, one of our skills is to look for the good in people,
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:03.640]   to look for the humanity in people.
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:08.180]   And when we find it, we connect to it and we say, "We're not that different.
[00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:11.140]   You and I, we're actually kind of same in many ways.
[00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:14.740]   And yeah, we might disagree with this thing, and that's a big thing, but we truly love
[00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:16.140]   one another, right?
[00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:19.820]   We can truly see that I'm grateful for you for this, and you're grateful for me for this,
[00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:25.100]   and we look for ways we can collaborate because in collaboration, it doesn't solve everything,
[00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:30.220]   but it begins to forge a new path of friendship and respect.
[00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:31.220]   Here's the final thing.
[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:33.580]   See it through.
[00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:35.340]   Now you're not going to be a peace achiever.
[00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:40.220]   It's not seeing it through to get the achievement of peace, to get the badge of the person of
[00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:41.220]   peace.
[00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:45.500]   No, it's to see it through so that you're doing everything in your power to bring peace
[00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:49.620]   through your everyday actions and your words and the things that you do.
[00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:54.140]   Knowing that as far as it depends on you, live at peace with others, see it through,
[00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:58.180]   be committed to the long haul of the way in which you need to humble yourselves, lay down
[00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:02.280]   your pride, apologize for the words you've said, apologize for the divide that you've
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:08.580]   created in others, and work your best to brave the hard conversations and to walk intentionally
[00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:13.220]   into the brokenness in order to heal it from within.
[00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:17.700]   You are the children of God.
[00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:22.860]   And God stands over you and he says, "You are mine.
[00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:26.420]   Your little Mia's, if you will."
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:32.180]   Would we rise up as his children in this critical hour of Hong Kong's history?
[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:38.220]   Would we not keep the peace, not love the peace?
[00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:40.420]   Would we make the peace?
[00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:41.740]   Because Christ has made it for us.
[00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:43.780]   I wonder if you'd stand with me.
[00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:49.060]   I'd love to pray for you.
[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:56.540]   If you're online now, you can just close your eyes as well.
[00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:59.740]   I wonder whether you'd just be comfortable to open your hands online and in this room
[00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:05.660]   if this is speaking to you today, if this is a moment for you just to humble yourself
[00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:06.660]   before the Lord.
[00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:11.580]   We do that here at the Vine as a posture of receiving as we pray.
[00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:21.140]   Father, we come before you now as ones who understand division and disruption, as ones
[00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:25.060]   who have contributed to disruption and division.
[00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:33.020]   Father, we come to you now recognizing that we're not always the children of God in this
[00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:34.020]   area.
[00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:40.620]   But Father, we also come to you now with the weight of this time in history on our
[00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:46.660]   shoulders and the wonderful opportunity we have to make a difference.
[00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:56.220]   Lord, we ask you to forgive us where we have tried to keep the peace and ignored the injustice,
[00:39:56.220 --> 00:40:02.940]   tried to keep the peace by burying our heads in the sand at times.
[00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:11.620]   Forgive us where we've found it easy to be lovers of peace, to talk about it, to shout
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:19.140]   about it, to post about it, but where we haven't lifted a single finger to repair the broken
[00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:25.420]   relationships that are in our own lives or to speak out in our workplaces or in the areas
[00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:32.180]   of our influence, to humble ourselves and to bring the two to be together as one.
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:35.660]   Thank us, Lord.
[00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:41.140]   Father, I want to pray for your Holy Spirit to come now on this group of people online
[00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:42.780]   in this room.
[00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:48.260]   Father, you commission us here today to be makers of peace.
[00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:54.220]   Lord, would you humble us, give us courage.
[00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:58.140]   Lord, there are people in this room that need to brave a conversation that they've been
[00:40:58.140 --> 00:40:59.140]   avoiding.
[00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:01.100]   I want to pray by the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:04.180]   Lord, would you give them the courage this week to have that conversation they've been
[00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:05.180]   putting off.
[00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:10.140]   Father, there are some people in this room that need to admit that they were wrong and
[00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:12.580]   their pride has kept them from doing that.
[00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:14.580]   And that pride has created a division.
[00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:21.060]   Lord, would you give them the courage this week to ask for forgiveness.
[00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:26.220]   Lord, there are some in this room that have deeply been hurt by others.
[00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:32.740]   And Lord, I want to pray for those people, that as they commit to waging peace in the
[00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:39.340]   future, that you would meet them in the places of their hurt and heal and restore and redeem
[00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:40.540]   them, Lord.
[00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:43.500]   Father, we thank you that you call us your children.
[00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:44.500]   What a privilege that is.
[00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:47.020]   And so I want to speak over every person here.
[00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:51.300]   You might be thinking right now, this is not going to work in my situation.
[00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:54.620]   You might be here right now and go, "Pastor, have you understood the depth of my division?
[00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:56.540]   Have you understood what I'm going through?"
[00:41:56.540 --> 00:42:00.660]   You would know that these nice words of yours today, they don't really scratch the surface
[00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:02.660]   of what I'm facing.
[00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:04.700]   I want you to hear this.
[00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:06.580]   I don't fully understand.
[00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:09.860]   No, but there is one who does.
[00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:13.780]   And that one has called you his son or his daughter.
[00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:17.500]   That one has claimed you as his child.
[00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:21.540]   And because you are his child, you do not stand defeated.
[00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:25.420]   Because you are his child, you are not worn down or beaten up.
[00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:28.780]   Because you are his child, you are not removed.
[00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:32.460]   God is here to fight battles that you cannot fight.
[00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:34.160]   You are a child of God.
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:36.100]   There is an authority upon you.
[00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:38.020]   There is the spirit of God in you.
[00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:43.700]   The same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead exists, has its life, is flourishing
[00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:44.700]   in you.
[00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:48.300]   And yes, it might be difficult right now, but you are not done.
[00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:49.820]   You are not defeated.
[00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:51.740]   This is not the end for you.
[00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:58.180]   There is a God who has made peace, not just for you, but shalom for this world.
[00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:03.980]   And he will fill you with the courage, with the spirit, with the hope, and with the power
[00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:07.140]   to be a reconciler in this place.
[00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:12.780]   And so Lord, I want to pray that you would release faith over the people in this room,
[00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:16.460]   that you need to release faith over Lord.
[00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:25.820]   And I pray that we would fight, not with violence, not with the world's method of fighting,
[00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:37.100]   but we would fight forwards with the weapons of the kingdom, humility, forgiveness, reconciliation,
[00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:43.860]   grace, love for enemy, for neighbor, for ourselves.
[00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:47.020]   Lord, we thank you for this.
[00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:52.380]   In Jesus name, everyone says, amen.
[00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:54.900]   Two things very quickly before you go.
[00:43:54.900 --> 00:44:00.700]   The first is this, you do not need to go.
[00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:03.380]   I want to invite you to stay.
[00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:05.340]   I want to invite you to pray.
[00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:06.340]   We have a prayer team here.
[00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:07.340]   We have a prayer team here.
[00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:10.900]   We have a prayer team online.
[00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:14.440]   We can connect right now with somebody to pray with them.
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:19.240]   If you're feeling a stirring in your spirit today, if this is a helpful word in season
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:22.980]   for you, I want to encourage you not just to receive a prayer from me and shoot off
[00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:23.980]   for lunch.
[00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:28.380]   I want to encourage you to do some real work by praying for one another, loving one another,
[00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:31.420]   listening to one another, and asking for help in this time.
[00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:32.420]   All right?
[00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:34.700]   So I want to encourage you to do that.
[00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:38.380]   Here's the second thing, and you're going to love, love, love this.
[00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:47.380]   We are getting rid of the pre-registration system.
[00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:50.340]   I know you guys have been so incredibly faithful.
[00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:52.460]   We're so grateful that you've done that.
[00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:57.180]   The government announced this week that on May 18th, churches and cinemas are able to
[00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:59.700]   reopen at 85%.
[00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:02.460]   And we know just because of the numbers that we've had here, we haven't really even been
[00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:04.780]   hitting 50% of some of our services.
[00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:08.500]   So the need for that pre-registration system now is not anymore needed.
[00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:12.460]   So in other words, you can come next week for Vision Sunday on May 15th, and you can
[00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:13.460]   just show up.
[00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:14.460]   Isn't that nice?
[00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:15.460]   I'm excited about that.
[00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:16.460]   We're so grateful for that.
[00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:23.460]   But thank you again for being so willing and patient with us as we've done the registration
[00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:24.460]   system.
[00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:25.940]   I hope we never need to do it again.
[00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:28.500]   Famous last words.
[00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:31.260]   But at least from next Sunday onwards, just come.
[00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:32.260]   We'd love to have you here.
[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:33.940]   Tell friends, tell neighbors.
[00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:35.460]   We'd love to join together.
[00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:39.980]   May you go from here as children of God, makers of peace, and may it fill you with hope and
[00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:40.980]   love and life.
[00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:41.980]   God bless everyone.
[00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:42.540]   Thanks so much.
[00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:45.700]   (audience applauding)
