[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   Amen, amen.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.560]   Have a seat, have a seat.
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.340]   We're continuing our series in Ephesians here this morning
[00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.620]   and as we do so, we come to what I consider
[00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.960]   the pivot passage in the whole of the book.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.840]   There's a saying that says that big huge doors
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.460]   swing on small hinges.
[00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:22.980]   And we're only gonna be looking at, say,
[00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.100]   four verses of text this morning,
[00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.700]   but a big huge door swings on just this small hinge
[00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.700]   we're gonna be looking at.
[00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.500]   This pivot passage is found right in the heart
[00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.940]   of Paul's letter to his church in Ephesus.
[00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.620]   And if you were with us in the first week,
[00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.660]   you would have heard me talk about how I think Paul
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.860]   structures the letter into two halves.
[00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.340]   There's the half of grace and the half of peace.
[00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.740]   The first three chapters is Paul's way of sort of saying,
[00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.340]   here's all the things that Christ has done in his grace.
[00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.300]   The first three chapters are a theological treaties
[00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.320]   of the grace and the wonder and the power
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.340]   of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.
[00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.580]   It's one of the most profound things.
[00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.540]   And over the last number of weeks of this series,
[00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.300]   we've preached through almost verse by verse
[00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.700]   all the things that Paul is teaching to his church
[00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.260]   about the grace of Christ.
[00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.260]   It's a deep and rich theology.
[00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.420]   But he's about to now move into the second half
[00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.140]   of the letter from chapters four to six,
[00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.440]   where he's gonna talk about peace and what it's like
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.820]   to now live out of this grace that he's just talked about.
[00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.340]   And he's gonna challenge them with some pretty tough words.
[00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.340]   He's gonna talk about what it is to be in marriage,
[00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.060]   what it is to be parents, what it is to be children.
[00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.480]   He's gonna talk about the unity that he's expecting
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.060]   to see in the church.
[00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.820]   He's gonna talk about the need for the armor of God
[00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.100]   so that we can be equipped and fully ready
[00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.900]   for all the attacks that are gonna happen
[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.100]   in the spiritual realm out there.
[00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.580]   He's got some pretty important things to say
[00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.820]   about practical Christian living,
[00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.020]   but he's finding himself in the passage
[00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.340]   we're looking at this week between the two.
[00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.740]   It's like he said, here's all the stuff that Christ has done.
[00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.140]   Here's how you should now live.
[00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.820]   But before we get there, we need to stop.
[00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.300]   And Paul realizes before he gets to what he wants to say
[00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.740]   in chapters four to six, he has to first pray.
[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.460]   And he has to pray because Paul understands
[00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.620]   that there is no way we can move from a theology
[00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.400]   to a living out in the way that Paul has a vision
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.400]   for his church without that being a sovereign move of God.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.620]   It's gotta be the work of the spirit.
[00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.980]   All the theology that he's just talked about,
[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.500]   as important as that is, as important as good,
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.700]   sound doctrine is, it's not gonna do much to help us
[00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.740]   to move into being the people of God.
[00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.620]   He realizes that's a move of the spirit.
[00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.940]   That's gotta be a move of the heart of God,
[00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.340]   restoring and changing his people.
[00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.020]   And so he's like, before I get there, we need to stop.
[00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.920]   And you need to let me pray for you,
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.340]   he's saying to the church.
[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.900]   You need to let me pray for you
[00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.220]   because this is not a work of me.
[00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.600]   It's not a work of a pastor.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.020]   This is not a work of a church.
[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.700]   The only way this is gonna happen
[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.340]   is if the spirit of God does something
[00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.500]   that I cannot do, Paul is saying to the church.
[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.860]   So before we get on to talking about all this stuff,
[00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.300]   we first have to pray.
[00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:28.220]   We have to ask that God would come in his power
[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.140]   and transform us from the inside out, he says.
[00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.080]   Oh, look at all this crazy, beautiful grace
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.800]   that Christ has given us.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.920]   Look at how we should live.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.320]   But if it doesn't happen in here,
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.320]   none of it is worth anything.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:52.200]   Paul understands that we have to be encountered
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.920]   before we can be an encounter.
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.640]   He knows that we have to be deeply transformed
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.500]   before we can hope to be a transforming agent
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.480]   of the spirit of God in the world.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.520]   And so he prays, and boy, does he pray.
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.600]   He prays one of the most passionate,
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.380]   one of the most heartfelt, one of the most deepest,
[00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.000]   one of the most profound prayers
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.280]   that we find in the whole of the New Testament.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.040]   'Cause for Paul, this is where the rubber hits the road.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.800]   This is where life really matters.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.720]   And he desperately wants to see his church alive.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.240]   This is the pastoral presence of Paul for his people.
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.240]   Oh, if only Christ would come and fill you with his love.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.120]   I'm also quite passionate about this prayer
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.920]   in case you haven't realized so far.
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.920]   And the reason being is because everything
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.680]   that Paul prays in this prayer is exactly
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.120]   what would be on my heart for you here at the Vine.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.400]   In fact, our whole vision here at the Vine,
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.000]   which is growing big people,
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.160]   the idea that whether you're with us for two weeks,
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.080]   two months, two years, two decades,
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.280]   we want you to grow in Christ Jesus.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.120]   We want you to mature in your relationship with him
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.640]   so that you can come to the full measure,
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.960]   the fullness of Christ,
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.320]   as Paul's about to teach us in Ephesians 4.
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.560]   But before he gets there, before we get there in this series,
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.360]   we have to pause and we have to realize
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.040]   that the prayer that he prays
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.000]   captures the heart of that vision.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.440]   Without this prayer, that vision is nothing.
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.280]   With this prayer, that vision can come.
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.000]   This is why, funnily enough,
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.340]   I'm emotionally connected to this today
[00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.320]   because at the very first Sunday that I became senior pastor,
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.700]   the 3rd of November, 2013,
[00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.280]   it was this passage that I chose to preach from.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.800]   And I preached from this passage
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.120]   because it was a summary of my heart to you at the church.
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.400]   And some 11 years later,
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.760]   as I'm unpacking this for myself again
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.040]   over the last month or so,
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.720]   as I'm preparing for this message,
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.400]   that same heart resonates inside of me.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.040]   If there's one thing I want for you,
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.080]   it is these verses that we're looking at here today.
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.480]   And so as we teach this, as I open it up,
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.960]   as I do my best to perhaps show you
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.240]   what I think was on Paul's heart for his church,
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.920]   and you get a glimpse of what I think
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.720]   is on God's heart for you,
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.840]   my prayer is that this isn't just some teaching.
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.000]   My prayer is that there is an impartation
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.120]   that takes place for you from the heart of the Father
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.080]   for what he has in your life.
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.100]   I believe that there is so much
[00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.320]   of what Ellison spoke about just a moment ago,
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.800]   this idea of him coming and meeting us in our hearts
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.880]   that he wants for us.
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.600]   This is why we do the Vine.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.400]   Not so you would come here and be tickled in your ears
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.440]   and entertained on a Sunday,
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.240]   but so that the Spirit of God
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.140]   would transform you from the inside out.
[00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.920]   Amen? - Amen.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.960]   - So I wanna read you this prayer,
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.800]   but I'm gonna do it in a way that we don't normally do here.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.120]   I want to actually pray it over you.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.560]   I'd love for you to stand with me.
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.520]   Would you stand?
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.200]   And if you're comfortable,
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.280]   I'd invite you just to close your eyes,
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.220]   and you can open your hands before you,
[00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:03.640]   because this is Paul's prayer for his church,
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.500]   but it is also our prayer for you.
[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:12.560]   For this reason, I kneel before the Father
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.280]   from whom his whole family in heaven and on earth
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.500]   derives its name, and here's what I pray.
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:24.000]   I pray that out of his glorious riches,
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.720]   he may strengthen you with power
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.860]   through his Spirit in your inner being.
[00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.860]   I'm gonna pray that again for you.
[00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.320]   This is what we want for you here at The Vine.
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:39.360]   We pray that out of God's glorious riches,
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.880]   he may strengthen you with the power
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.960]   through his Spirit in your inner being,
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:49.440]   so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith.
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.240]   And we pray that you who are rooted and established in love
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.840]   may have the power together with everybody in this room
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:01.040]   to grasp how wide and long and high and deep
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.820]   is the love of Christ, and to know this love
[00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.820]   that surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled
[00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:12.820]   to the fullness, the full measure of the fullness of God.
[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:17.660]   In Jesus' name, everyone says, have a seat.
[00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:21.180]   When was the last time somebody prayed that prayer,
[00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:23.140]   a prayer like that over you?
[00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.580]   When was the last time you prayed a prayer like that?
[00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.600]   When was the last time I prayed a prayer like that?
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:32.220]   What a stunning heart, pastoral heart Paul has
[00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.020]   for his people.
[00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.940]   I love how he begins the prayer.
[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:38.580]   He does something that was not done in that time.
[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:42.900]   He says, I bow my knee, or I get on my knees
[00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:44.900]   before the Father.
[00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.820]   Now, here in modern Christianity days,
[00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.540]   we think about being on our knees in prayer all the time.
[00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.900]   It's a very common thing in our time,
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:56.640]   but in the first century, it was a very uncommon thing.
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.620]   In fact, prayer, whether that was in the temple,
[00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:02.100]   or whether that was actually done in the house churches
[00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.500]   at the time, prayer was predominantly done standing,
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.500]   and standing with your arms stretched out
[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.140]   towards the heavens.
[00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:11.780]   In fact, as a leader of the temple,
[00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:15.140]   or a leader in the church, this was the posture you prayed.
[00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:17.460]   Jesus spoke about this when he gave the parable
[00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.180]   of the tax collector and the Pharisee
[00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:20.700]   coming into the temple to pray.
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.380]   They're both pictured standing before the Lord,
[00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:24.880]   and they're raising their hands out,
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.180]   and they're acknowledging a confidence,
[00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:29.300]   and a faith, and a trust in God.
[00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.460]   That was the posture.
[00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.340]   But Paul flips it on its head,
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.220]   and he does something that was rare,
[00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:39.540]   and was hardly spoken about, hardly done in that time.
[00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:41.860]   He gets on his knees.
[00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:47.620]   Now, Paul does this because he has a deep and rich
[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.980]   theological understanding of the Old Testament.
[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.900]   Remember, he was a Hebrew of Hebrews,
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.800]   a Pharisee of Pharisees before he came to know Christ.
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.480]   And his deep rooting in the Old Testament,
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.480]   understanding of scripture and theology
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.820]   roots him even in this prayer.
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.640]   It's fascinating, in the Old Testament,
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:07.400]   the word bless is the Hebrew word barak.
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.440]   And barak actually comes in a number of different forms.
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:14.600]   In one particular form, barak actually is better translated
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:19.040]   to break yourself down, or to bend your knee.
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.720]   It's a posture of humility and surrender.
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.640]   One of the most famous places in the Old Testament
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.920]   that the word is used that way is Psalm 103, verse one,
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.360]   where it says, "Bless the Lord, O my soul,
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.960]   "and all that is within me, bless His holy name."
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.560]   When we normally read that, we think of this
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:39.000]   as a worship psalm, as a proclamation psalm,
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.520]   as if the psalmist is standing there
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.200]   with his hands open to the heavens,
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.980]   and saying, "Bless the Lord, O my soul,
[00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.080]   "and all that is within me, bless His holy name."
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.120]   In other words, worship and praise Him.
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:52.160]   But actually, the word barak here is in the cognate form
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.400]   that means to bend the knee.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.440]   Here is what the psalmist is actually saying.
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.880]   He's saying, "Bend the knee, O my soul,
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.520]   "and all that is within me,
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.640]   "bend the knee to His holy name."
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:08.560]   In other words, this is a psalm not of worship,
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:11.520]   it's a psalm of holy surrender.
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:15.560]   It's a psalm of recognizing that we are nothing
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.340]   before the holiness of God.
[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:23.100]   Paul starts his prayer in an uncommon posture.
[00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:27.300]   He blesses the Lord at the start by bending his knee,
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.620]   and what he's saying is, "God, this has nothing
[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.420]   "to do with me.
[00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:37.060]   "I may be the pastor over these people
[00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:38.260]   "in this church in Ephesus,
[00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.340]   "but this has nothing to do with me.
[00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.380]   "It's not about my strength, it's not about my theology,
[00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:44.860]   "it's not about everything I know.
[00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:49.820]   "I bend my knee, everything within me bends itself now
[00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:54.540]   "to you because only you can do what I'm about to pray.
[00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:57.780]   "There's no strength within me,
[00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:59.540]   "there's no ability that I have.
[00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:02.080]   "Nothing can actually happen in my church
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.320]   "the way that I long to see it happen,
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:08.160]   "unless, God, there's a sovereign move of your spirit
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.180]   "so I will get on my knees."
[00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.820]   This is a radical thing,
[00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:14.500]   'cause he was expected to be standing
[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.780]   and bold and strong, offering confidence before the Lord,
[00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:19.820]   and he says, "Before the whole church,
[00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.780]   "I declare I am nothing."
[00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:29.820]   He then prays to the Father, to the Father,
[00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:33.280]   which again, in our New Testament kind of Christian sense
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.460]   in this modern day and age, we understand that,
[00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:38.620]   but again, in his time, he's rooting that back
[00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.460]   to the Old Testament.
[00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.940]   We actually learned this in the Exodus series last year,
[00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.540]   where we saw that the first time God refers to himself
[00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:48.020]   as a father is in Exodus chapter four,
[00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.220]   where he's speaking through Moses and Aaron
[00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:51.980]   to speak to Pharaoh for the first time,
[00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:55.900]   and in that passage, he actually says, "Israel is my son."
[00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.860]   It's the first time that God actually uses the metaphor
[00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.100]   as a father over his people Israel.
[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:03.780]   He declares that they are his son,
[00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:05.700]   making him the father of that nation.
[00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.700]   Now, here's the interesting thing.
[00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:10.540]   This happens just one chapter
[00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.860]   after Moses has come to God at the burning bush
[00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.220]   and said, "What is your name?
[00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:17.820]   "How do I refer to you?
[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:20.300]   "How do I understand you?"
[00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:24.300]   And in that moment, God says, "I am that I am."
[00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:29.220]   The famous sacred name of God for the Jewish people
[00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.240]   is spoken in that time.
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.760]   We come to understand that as Yahweh.
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:38.620]   It's the L-O-R-D in capital letters in your Old Testament.
[00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:41.300]   Anytime you read that in your Old Testament,
[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:44.340]   it's actually the sacred name that's being spoken,
[00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:45.940]   this Yahweh.
[00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.300]   I wanna show you how it's spelt in the Hebrew.
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.060]   It's spelt like this.
[00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:52.060]   They are two consonants,
[00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:55.500]   and these particular consonants are very unique
[00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.620]   in the Hebrew language.
[00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.460]   They're the only two consonants
[00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:03.100]   that when pronounced properly do not require you
[00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:06.300]   to move your mouth or to move your tongue,
[00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.900]   and they're specifically designed that way
[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:12.620]   to be used in the sacred name
[00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:15.900]   so that when the sacred name is spoken,
[00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:19.820]   it's almost like you're inhaling and exhaling.
[00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:22.780]   It's almost like it's breath.
[00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:26.500]   Let me demonstrate by trying to pronounce it
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.460]   as best I can like this.
[00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:33.220]   (breathing heavily)
[00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.220]   (breathing heavily)
[00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:39.860]   Can you hear it?
[00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:42.940]   Okay, I want you all, don't move your mouth,
[00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:44.260]   don't move your tongue.
[00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.060]   I want you all now, breathe in.
[00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.340]   Breathe out.
[00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:49.180]   Keep going.
[00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:51.820]   Keep going.
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:54.540]   Stop, people are not doing it.
[00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:58.540]   Okay, we're gonna try it again.
[00:14:58.540 --> 00:14:59.660]   We're all gonna do it.
[00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:02.140]   Honestly, this will blow your mind.
[00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:02.980]   Breathe in.
[00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:06.780]   (breathing heavily)
[00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:11.060]   Can you hear it?
[00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:15.860]   The sacred name of the Lord, Yahweh,
[00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:19.020]   designed specifically to be like breath
[00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:22.020]   of which links in the Old Testament to his name,
[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:24.620]   which Paul now links to him being a father,
[00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:27.820]   which is why he says every family on earth
[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.540]   derives its name from this father.
[00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:32.380]   Yahweh.
[00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:38.460]   Because the very first word that ever came out of you
[00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:39.980]   was the sacred name of God.
[00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:43.660]   And the very last word that will ever come out of you
[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:47.820]   before you die will be the sacred name of God.
[00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:52.460]   Your first breath, your last breath, you declared.
[00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:53.300]   Yahweh.
[00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:59.220]   And Paul is on his knees before his church
[00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:01.740]   and he knows the importance of what he's about to pray
[00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:04.660]   and it's like he takes a breath.
[00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:05.500]   Yahweh.
[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:11.980]   And he centers himself before the father
[00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:15.060]   of who everybody derives his name.
[00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:18.260]   Anything that has ever taken its breath,
[00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:22.020]   connected to the one who is the sacred name,
[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:25.540]   the I am that I am, the Lord Yahweh.
[00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:28.700]   We're connected in through that and he takes a moment,
[00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:31.940]   humble before his church, breathing in, breathing out,
[00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:35.140]   to then pray something for them.
[00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:38.420]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:42.500]   Can you get a sense of Paul's pastoral heart for his people?
[00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:44.780]   He's like we're all connected to this God.
[00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:46.260]   We've been connected from the very beginning.
[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.460]   We're still connected and here's what I pray
[00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:50.660]   that this God would do.
[00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:55.060]   He says I pray that out of his glorious riches,
[00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:59.460]   he would strengthen you with power through his spirit
[00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:00.500]   in your inner being.
[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:02.780]   Is there not any more beautiful verse
[00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:04.780]   in the whole Bible than that?
[00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:09.300]   That he would strengthen you with power in your inner being
[00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.500]   out of his glorious riches.
[00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.500]   Paul starts here by saying this,
[00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.940]   out of his glorious riches,
[00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:19.700]   out of this incredible amount of love,
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:20.860]   this incredible amount of mercy,
[00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:22.300]   this incredible amount of grace,
[00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:24.660]   all the stuff that I've just been talking to you about,
[00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:26.100]   how you've been adopted into his family,
[00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:26.980]   not because you did anything,
[00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:28.300]   but just because he loved you,
[00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.140]   how he went to the cross to die for you,
[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:32.260]   how he resurrected your dead spirit
[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.220]   and made you alive by grace, not by works.
[00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:38.660]   All of that stuff, the glorious riches of a God
[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:41.180]   who was willing to bring himself to this earth
[00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:43.980]   to die on your behalf 'cause he so loves you.
[00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:45.700]   Out of all of that work,
[00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.580]   I now pray that he would come and do something for you.
[00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:53.580]   Paul does not say out of my great life, I pray.
[00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:58.740]   He doesn't say out of the fact that I'm your pastor, I pray.
[00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:00.340]   He doesn't say it's got anything to do with me.
[00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:05.060]   He says out of his glorious riches, 'cause I am nothing.
[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:08.100]   I'm even in prison, he's just told them in chapter three.
[00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:11.260]   He's like, I got nothing to offer you,
[00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:14.420]   but I know the glorious riches of Christ
[00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:16.540]   are overflowing with love.
[00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:19.380]   And it's out of the storehouse of his riches
[00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:21.780]   that I feel this ability to now pray
[00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:23.180]   that he would do something in your life.
[00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:25.460]   Oh, may that change your prayer life.
[00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:33.380]   You always have a reason to pray out of his glorious riches,
[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:36.340]   out of his glorious riches for you.
[00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:40.340]   You have to understand that when he's saying this,
[00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:43.580]   what he's doing is he's rooting every move of the Spirit
[00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:46.180]   out of those glorious riches.
[00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:47.700]   I mean, think about this for a second.
[00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:51.620]   Anytime you have ever encountered the work of the Spirit
[00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:54.700]   in your life, it has happened for no other reason
[00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:57.940]   than the scandalous idea that God loves you.
[00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:00.820]   Have you thought about that?
[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:05.820]   No other reason than the reality of his love for you.
[00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:08.740]   Anytime that there's been a move of the Spirit in your life,
[00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:11.420]   anytime you've opened the scriptures and they've come alive,
[00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:14.060]   anytime that you felt the wind of the Spirit in you,
[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:15.780]   it's because he's saying, I love you.
[00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:19.140]   I love you, I love you, I chose you, I made you,
[00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:22.100]   I formed you, you're not perfect, but I love you.
[00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:26.300]   Out of his glorious riches,
[00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:30.380]   you have and are able to make your being.
[00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:34.100]   And out of this place, he says this,
[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:37.780]   he says that you would be strengthened by power
[00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:39.900]   through his Spirit in your inner being.
[00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:43.100]   The idea of being strengthened in power here,
[00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:44.220]   it's not talking about,
[00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:47.500]   I hope that you will become a more powerful person.
[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:51.740]   He's not getting Caesar or empire imagery here.
[00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:53.660]   He's not saying, I hope you become the best banker
[00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:55.700]   you could ever be, the best lawyer you could ever be.
[00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:57.740]   I hope you get much more wealth and prosperity
[00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:59.820]   and you enlarge the territory of your influence
[00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:01.300]   and you will be super powered.
[00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:05.700]   When he talks about being strengthened by power,
[00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:08.780]   what he's talking about is healing and restoration.
[00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:13.740]   He's talking about healing and restoration.
[00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.980]   But by the mere fact that he says my prayer for you
[00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:17.980]   out of the glorious riches of Christ
[00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:20.740]   is that his Spirit would work in you to strengthen you.
[00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:23.100]   What he's saying is all of us have areas of weakness,
[00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:23.940]   don't we?
[00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:26.700]   He's saying all of our hearts have somewhere
[00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:30.460]   where it's weak, our inner being is weak.
[00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:32.340]   This is his pastor, Oral Hartford's church.
[00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:34.420]   He's like, I know you.
[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:37.500]   And I know that some of you are suffering with shame.
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.940]   Some of you are struggling with guilt.
[00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:41.900]   Some of you are overwhelmed in fear.
[00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:43.020]   I can see it in you.
[00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:44.580]   I can feel it in you, he's saying.
[00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:46.780]   And so my prayer is that out of the glorious riches
[00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:49.580]   of Christ, his Spirit would be at so much work in you
[00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:51.740]   that you would be strengthened where you're weak.
[00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:53.500]   You would be healed where you're weak.
[00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:55.500]   Where right now you're feeling fear,
[00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.420]   my prayer is that you would know power.
[00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:02.620]   Where you're feeling pain, my prayer is that you would have
[00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:05.260]   a healing and restoration in the area of your heart
[00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:06.540]   that feels pain.
[00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:09.180]   My gosh, he's saying, that you would only know
[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:12.020]   that the Spirit of God could fill you completely.
[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:17.620]   Again, he's linking back to Old Testament rooting here.
[00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:20.580]   He's saying, do you realize the move of the Spirit
[00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:23.020]   that's happened in redemptive history?
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:25.500]   At the beginning, the Spirit of God appears to Moses
[00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:28.940]   in a bush, then appears to Moses on a mountain,
[00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:31.460]   the fullness of God's presence on a mountain.
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.780]   Then it was found in the tabernacle,
[00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:35.900]   and God's people would crowd around the tabernacle
[00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:39.140]   and witness the power of God inside a tent.
[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.020]   Once the temple was constructed, it was found
[00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:42.900]   in the Holy of Holies within the temple,
[00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:45.540]   this powerful sense of God's presence with his people.
[00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:47.260]   And his people would come into the temple,
[00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:49.980]   but they couldn't get too close because of his holiness.
[00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:51.420]   They had to stand on the outside.
[00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:53.940]   The only person that could go in was after a year
[00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:56.940]   of sacrifice to get himself ready to get in there.
[00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:59.140]   And then the Babylonians come in the sixth century,
[00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:01.300]   destroy the temple.
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.420]   God's people are in exile in Babylon.
[00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:06.180]   70 years later, they'll come back out of exile,
[00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:10.220]   and the prophets begin to speak again of God's Spirit.
[00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:12.020]   But now it's different.
[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:14.620]   Where God's Spirit used to be in a mountain,
[00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:17.740]   in a bush, in a tabernacle, and in a temple,
[00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:21.020]   the prophets begin to speak of a new time.
[00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:23.900]   The best example is Ezekiel 36.
[00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:25.020]   I'm gonna read this to you.
[00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:28.740]   I will give you a new heart and a new spirit in you.
[00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:30.780]   I will remove from you the heart of stone
[00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:32.580]   and give you a heart of flesh.
[00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:34.940]   And I will put my Spirit in you and move you
[00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:38.140]   to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws.
[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:40.380]   Ezekiel says, "A time is coming where God
[00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:42.580]   will no longer be on a mountain, in a tabernacle,
[00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:45.180]   in a temple, he'll be within you."
[00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:48.860]   And when he's within you, the stone,
[00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:51.500]   remember the law was given on the mountain in stone,
[00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:55.940]   "The stone of your heart will become like flesh," he says.
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:57.660]   And here's Paul years later going,
[00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:59.340]   "I've had that experience.
[00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:00.900]   I was on the road to Damascus.
[00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:03.180]   I was on my way to kill Christians,
[00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:06.020]   and I was so overwhelmed by the Spirit of God
[00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:10.660]   that inside my inner being, I was transformed forever."
[00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:13.660]   He wasn't there in the upper room at Pentecost,
[00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:16.140]   but he knows the stories from the disciples.
[00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:18.540]   And he knew that the Spirit of God had so poured out
[00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:21.300]   in power in Pentecost in the upper room
[00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:22.900]   that they began to speak in tongues
[00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:24.900]   and people came to faith and it was amazing.
[00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:26.100]   And here's Paul's prayer.
[00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:28.260]   He's saying, "That's what I want for you.
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:33.780]   I want you out of the glorious riches of Christ
[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:36.820]   that you would so know inside of you,
[00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:38.820]   you would be strengthened with power
[00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:41.180]   by the Spirit in your inner being."
[00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:45.540]   He's saying, "Oh man, there is nothing more valuable
[00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:47.540]   in the world than that."
[00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:52.620]   I love Paul's pastoral prayer for his church.
[00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:55.540]   Paul does not pray for Johnny to stop smoking.
[00:23:55.540 --> 00:24:00.340]   He doesn't pray for Anita to stop worrying.
[00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:02.140]   He doesn't pray for Jamie to finally deal
[00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:03.420]   with his porn habit.
[00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:06.420]   No, no, Paul's actually interested
[00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:08.140]   not in the surface of things.
[00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:10.580]   He's interested in the things that are much deeper than that
[00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:14.420]   because he knows that that's where God starts.
[00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:17.060]   And while it might be important to try to sort out
[00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:18.700]   some of those surface things,
[00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:20.620]   Paul's not praying for God to show up
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.580]   and give a band-aid to his church.
[00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:24.980]   He wants God to show up and do surgery
[00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:27.420]   in the lives and the heart of his church
[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:28.980]   'cause he sees their brokenness.
[00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:30.300]   He sees their pain.
[00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:33.020]   He sees the hardness of their hearts at times.
[00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:35.220]   And he knows that he can't do anything about it.
[00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:37.540]   But out of the glorious riches of Christ,
[00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:41.300]   the Spirit might be able to come and transform his church
[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:47.060]   so that they would know that they are so deeply loved
[00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:50.020]   and so deeply new people in him
[00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:51.740]   that their whole lives are changed.
[00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:55.020]   And they'll probably deal with that porn habit.
[00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:58.180]   Not out of some, "Oh my gosh, I better fix this thing
[00:24:58.180 --> 00:24:59.940]   to be a better Christian."
[00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:02.620]   But out of suddenly a place of,
[00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:07.140]   "Oh my gosh, the Lord loves me so deeply.
[00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:08.900]   He has changed my life.
[00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:12.740]   How can I not serve him with everything within me?
[00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:15.580]   Open the eyes of my heart, Lord,
[00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:20.820]   so that I can see you, be you,
[00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:23.580]   live out what Ezekiel was talking about here
[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:25.340]   where he says a new heart
[00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:29.060]   so that we can live out your law in love,
[00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:32.020]   not in some sort of thing."
[00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:34.300]   See, so many people think that Christianity
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:36.260]   is a behavior modification religion.
[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:39.100]   That's so many people in the world think
[00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:40.140]   that that's what our faith is.
[00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:40.980]   And to be honest with you,
[00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:41.820]   there's a lot of people in the church
[00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:43.900]   that think that that's what our faith is as well.
[00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:45.980]   That actually Christianity is all about
[00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:48.300]   having something with God
[00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:50.300]   and there's rules and regulations and restrictions.
[00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:53.500]   And if I adhere to the rules, regulations and restrictions,
[00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:54.940]   then I'll be a better person.
[00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:56.580]   I'll be more loved by God
[00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:58.940]   and I'll be able to succeed more in life.
[00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:00.300]   And Paul's saying, "No, no, no, no.
[00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:01.460]   We've got this all wrong.
[00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:04.460]   Christianity is not a behavior modification religion.
[00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:08.540]   Christianity is a relationship that brings inner healing
[00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:10.260]   that leads transformation."
[00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:13.260]   It's actually the opposite of the direction we think.
[00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:15.420]   We think we can just deal with the surface stuff
[00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:17.300]   and everything's gonna be okay.
[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:20.700]   God is not five tips to help you control your drinking.
[00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:22.220]   He's not an Instagram reel.
[00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:24.740]   Come on, church.
[00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:26.660]   Jesus was here today.
[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:28.900]   He would not be making those kinds of Instagram reels.
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:29.740]   Okay?
[00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:32.460]   Five tips to deal and control your drinking habit.
[00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:35.340]   Instead, here's God.
[00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:38.980]   God is like, "I wanna get to the very place of the shame,
[00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:42.700]   the hurt and the guilt and the insecurity
[00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:45.380]   that is causing you to drink excessively
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:46.260]   in the first place.
[00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:48.100]   That's what I wanna walk with.
[00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:50.140]   That's where my heart is for you.
[00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:53.900]   I wanna so radically transform the hardness
[00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:56.860]   and the darkness and the struggles and the pains
[00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:59.420]   and the hurts of your heart that you literally
[00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:01.620]   become a new person from the inside out."
[00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.140]   Isn't that beautiful?
[00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:06.660]   Wow, I'm hot.
[00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:10.340]   It's really beautiful.
[00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.260]   Notice what he says next.
[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:13.620]   I mean, he's only just getting started.
[00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:15.140]   He then says this.
[00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:16.980]   He says, "Now you need to understand that you,
[00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:20.180]   being rooted and established in love,
[00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:22.420]   may go on to have the blah, blah, blah."
[00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:24.780]   But he starts, "You're rooted and established in love."
[00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:26.220]   This is really important for Paul.
[00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:28.780]   He wants you to understand that the Spirit is gonna come
[00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:30.780]   and do this incredible work within you.
[00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:32.860]   Only the Spirit can do that out of his glorious riches.
[00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:35.140]   But he needs you to know where your starting point is.
[00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:38.420]   You're rooted and established in love already.
[00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:41.700]   In fact, from the very moment that you gave your life
[00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:44.260]   to Jesus, you find yourself rooted in it.
[00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:46.100]   This is a metaphor he's using.
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:48.300]   One is a agricultural metaphor.
[00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:50.060]   It's for the rural people out there.
[00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:51.860]   The other one is an architectural metaphor
[00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:53.340]   for the urban people out there.
[00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:56.700]   He uses both to help to connect to his wide audience.
[00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:58.860]   And he's saying both of those things mean the same thing.
[00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:03.060]   You have a firm foundation in Jesus's love.
[00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:04.140]   That's your starting point.
[00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:07.260]   Love is our starting point.
[00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:10.100]   It's not the thing that we attain and gain years
[00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:13.100]   down the line when we've done some behavioral modification
[00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:14.260]   that earns that love.
[00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:15.820]   He's saying you need to understand
[00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:17.260]   that you are at the very beginning,
[00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:20.460]   rooted and established in love.
[00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:21.620]   It's your firm foundation.
[00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:24.020]   It's the thing that you can put your whole hope in.
[00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:26.980]   Your feet are embedded in the love of Christ.
[00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:30.620]   And from there, all good things can grow.
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:36.460]   All good things can be built up, to use the two metaphors,
[00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:39.900]   if you're rooted and established in love.
[00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:42.380]   That's important for some of you in here,
[00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:44.660]   because my sense is that for some of us,
[00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:46.100]   we really struggle with this.
[00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:50.860]   I felt just before this service in particular
[00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:52.580]   that there's quite a few of us
[00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:54.980]   where it's been a long time since we felt loved.
[00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:59.140]   Maybe that's the reality on a human level for you.
[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:01.340]   It's been a long time since you felt loved
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:03.500]   and accepted on a human level.
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:05.820]   My guess is for some of us in this room,
[00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:07.100]   it's a divine level.
[00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:10.740]   And maybe because of some of those surface things
[00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:14.620]   that are going on in your life, things that are important,
[00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:16.620]   but because of those surface things,
[00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:18.980]   you feel like God can't love you.
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:20.580]   You feel unworthy to be loved.
[00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:22.940]   You feel like he is distant from you.
[00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:25.260]   And Paul is writing to a church
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:28.380]   where he knows all the brokenness in his church too.
[00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:30.180]   And he's seen all the surface stuff,
[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:31.980]   and he's like, "My prayer is not there.
[00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:34.060]   "My prayer is in their hearts.
[00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:35.820]   "And my prayer is that they would understand
[00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:38.420]   "from the very beginning, they are rooted
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:40.780]   "and they are established in love."
[00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:42.100]   And as your pastor here,
[00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:44.500]   that is ultimately my prayer for you today.
[00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:47.500]   For those of you who feel like you are not loved,
[00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:50.740]   I need to say that that is a lie of the enemy.
[00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:53.420]   The enemy's greatest strategy against Christians
[00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:55.780]   to keep them away from the intimacy of God
[00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:58.740]   is to convince them that they cannot be loved.
[00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:05.420]   Paul says you're rooted and you're established in love.
[00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:08.780]   If you have a faith in Jesus here,
[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:12.100]   you are fully, completely, totally, and absolutely
[00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:13.940]   rooted and established in love.
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:16.140]   You can take that to the bank.
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:17.140]   That's who you are.
[00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:21.140]   And from that place can flourish so much growth,
[00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:24.700]   which is why he uses a metaphor of the rooting
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:27.540]   and the establishing, the agricultural and architectural,
[00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:28.700]   'cause what he's trying to say is,
[00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:30.540]   hey, seeds get planted in soil,
[00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:32.100]   not so that they remain seeds,
[00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:34.300]   so that they grow and become something.
[00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:36.140]   We pour cement in the ground,
[00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:37.900]   not so that we can just have cement in the ground,
[00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:39.620]   so that we can build a building on top of it.
[00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:41.180]   So he's talking about growth here,
[00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:43.140]   which is where he now takes the prayer.
[00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:44.420]   Now that he's established for them,
[00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:46.660]   that they're rooted and established in love,
[00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:47.740]   look what he says here.
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:49.220]   This is so beautiful.
[00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:51.060]   He says that you would have the power together
[00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:53.820]   with all the saints to grasp how wide and long
[00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:57.620]   and high and deep is the love of Christ,
[00:30:57.620 --> 00:30:59.940]   and to know this love that surpasses knowledge,
[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:02.220]   that you may be filled to the whole measure
[00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:03.860]   of the fullness of God.
[00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:06.380]   Oh man, preachers have tripped themselves up
[00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:09.620]   all over the place to try to define what Paul means
[00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:14.100]   by high, wide, long, and deep is the love of Christ.
[00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:16.380]   There have been countless numbers of sermons
[00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:18.820]   to help to articulate and exegete
[00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.940]   what Paul must have been thinking,
[00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:23.900]   as if high love was talking about his divine love.
[00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:25.420]   Wide love must have been the love
[00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:27.460]   that covers a multitude of sin.
[00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:30.100]   Long love must be the eternal love that he has.
[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:32.380]   The deep love must be about uprooting
[00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:34.420]   the deepest brokenness within us.
[00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:37.220]   And I think, sure, I'm sure all of those are biblical,
[00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:38.620]   all of those make sense,
[00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:40.020]   but I don't think that's what Paul's
[00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:42.420]   trying to communicate here.
[00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:45.660]   I think actually Paul's being far more simple than that.
[00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:48.340]   I think all Paul's doing is saying this.
[00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:54.580]   God's love is more vast and broad and big
[00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:57.060]   than you have ever realized.
[00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:03.020]   His love is greater than you have ever comprehended.
[00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:05.420]   And his love for the church,
[00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:07.980]   his heart, Paul's heart for the church,
[00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:10.940]   he wants his church to grasp, he uses this word grasp,
[00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:12.260]   it means to take hold of,
[00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:14.460]   take hold of in their mind to comprehend
[00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:16.820]   how amazing is the love of God,
[00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:20.060]   how big and vast and huge it truly is.
[00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:21.780]   Paul's saying, whether you've been a Christian
[00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:24.180]   for 50 years or a Christian for five minutes,
[00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:27.260]   there's more of the love of Christ for you to understand,
[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:28.860]   for you to grasp a hold of,
[00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:31.500]   for you to understand in your mind.
[00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:35.420]   He wants you to grow in your comprehension
[00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:37.780]   of the vastness of the love of Christ.
[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:42.780]   And every day you wake up, you can know that love more.
[00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:44.620]   - That's right.
[00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:47.980]   - Which is a great encouragement,
[00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:49.140]   but we have to be really careful here
[00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:51.180]   that we don't get Paul wrong.
[00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:54.540]   What Paul's not saying is that when you became a Christian,
[00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:57.260]   you got a small amount of love,
[00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:58.860]   and now you just need to grasp a hold
[00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:01.260]   of more and more amount of love.
[00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:02.820]   That's not what he's saying.
[00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:05.860]   What he is saying is, when you became a Christian,
[00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:09.180]   the wholeness, you are rooted and established
[00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:11.340]   in the wholeness of his love,
[00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:14.220]   and yet I want you to continue to mature
[00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:16.540]   and grow in your comprehension,
[00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:19.140]   your understanding of that love
[00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:21.300]   that is already fully yours.
[00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:25.340]   Let me help explain that by sharing a story
[00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:27.260]   out of Chris and I's life.
[00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:29.180]   So Chris and I couldn't have our own children,
[00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:30.780]   went into the adoption process.
[00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:32.740]   After a long period, we finally got a phone call.
[00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:35.020]   We've matched you to this amazing kid,
[00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:38.460]   half Nepalese, half Indonesian, 16 months old.
[00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:40.220]   We're not gonna show you a photo.
[00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:41.820]   We can't tell you much about it,
[00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:43.580]   but you need to say yes or no.
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:45.780]   So we said yes.
[00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:49.540]   Now, just the day before we met our daughter
[00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:52.300]   for the very first time, we met with our social workers,
[00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:54.020]   and our social workers, who had been brilliant
[00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:55.180]   throughout the whole process,
[00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:56.380]   our social workers said this.
[00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:58.460]   They said, "Now, we need to prepare you for tomorrow.
[00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:00.300]   "We need to prepare you because the chances are
[00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:04.620]   "you will not love this kid straight away.
[00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:07.100]   "You need to be prepared that you will not love them
[00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:09.540]   "because this is not like a biological thing.
[00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:11.700]   "This is not like you've had nine months with this child,
[00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:13.700]   "and the child comes, and all this pain,
[00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:15.940]   "and kind of celebration of childbirth,
[00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:17.940]   "and there's this immediate emotional connection
[00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:19.420]   "between you and the child."
[00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:21.860]   They're like, "No, no, adoption is kind of a bit more
[00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:24.740]   "sort of, you know, not particularly emotional.
[00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:27.380]   "And so you need to be prepared when you meet this person
[00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:29.140]   "tomorrow for the first time,
[00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:31.900]   "chances are you will not love them."
[00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:34.860]   Chris and I left that meeting,
[00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:37.340]   and our first thought was, "Get behind me, Satan."
[00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:40.180]   'Cause we were like, "Nuh-uh,
[00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:42.060]   "that's not gonna be our story."
[00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:43.980]   Now, we appreciate what the social workers
[00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:47.300]   were trying to say, but we were like, "Nah, nah, nah, nah.
[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:49.380]   "We believe in a God who can do all things,
[00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:52.940]   "a God who can strengthen us with power in our inner being.
[00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:55.580]   "We're gonna come tomorrow, and I tell you what,
[00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:58.020]   "I'm praying that the Lord will so fill me
[00:34:58.020 --> 00:34:59.620]   "with a love for this child
[00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:02.780]   "that it will be like literally this child came from Chris."
[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:06.740]   So we show up the next day, sitting in this room,
[00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:08.940]   there's a glass door in front of us,
[00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:10.740]   the child comes down with the social worker,
[00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:12.260]   we can't see it properly yet,
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:14.860]   but there's a silhouette of this 16-month-old girl
[00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:15.980]   wearing a tutu.
[00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:20.020]   And as we're looking at the silhouette,
[00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:23.420]   we're already loving this child.
[00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:26.500]   And then the door opens, and Mia walks into our lives,
[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:29.300]   and immediately, 100%,
[00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:31.780]   I have never loved anything in this,
[00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:33.980]   other than my wife, I had to say this this morning.
[00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:38.460]   I have never loved anything inside of me,
[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:41.140]   and Chris had never loved anything inside of her
[00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:46.140]   more completely and fully than that child in that moment.
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:51.380]   It was an instant, full, all of our love to Mia.
[00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:52.900]   Are you with me?
[00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:54.540]   But here's the interesting thing.
[00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:58.940]   Mia had to grow in her comprehension of that love.
[00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:02.220]   It was all there from day one.
[00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:03.660]   In fact, my very first thought
[00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:05.380]   after I saw Mia for the first time,
[00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:06.580]   it's funny how the mind works,
[00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:07.900]   my very first thought was,
[00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:09.980]   I can't wait to walk her down the aisle.
[00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:14.700]   I'm a father now.
[00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:17.380]   And one day, I'm gonna walk her down the aisle,
[00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:20.180]   and I literally, that was my first thought.
[00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:22.380]   We loved her fully, but she had to grow
[00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:25.260]   in her comprehension of that love.
[00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:28.420]   For example, we would carry her for weeks afterwards,
[00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:30.700]   and her limbs would just dangle beside us
[00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:32.940]   'cause she didn't know what intimacy was like.
[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:34.420]   We would walk and hold her hand,
[00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:36.340]   and her hand would just be like this.
[00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:38.100]   My hand would be clasped around hers.
[00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:39.020]   She wouldn't clasp
[00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:42.420]   because she didn't understand love and intimacy.
[00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:45.500]   After about three months of her not really showing
[00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:48.740]   that much love to Chris and I or any intimacy,
[00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:50.380]   Chris and I are standing in the kitchen one day
[00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:52.020]   in our apartment, and we're talking about the fact,
[00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:54.660]   well, maybe Mia's never gonna be an affectionate child,
[00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:55.900]   and we're just gonna have to get used to that,
[00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:56.980]   and that's just gonna be something
[00:36:56.980 --> 00:36:58.860]   that God's gonna have to give us a strength for.
[00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:02.740]   Mia walks in, and she's about knee-high to us at this time.
[00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:03.980]   She walks over to Chris.
[00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:05.460]   She leans forward and goes,
[00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:06.900]   and kisses her on the knee.
[00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:09.220]   It's the first expression of intimacy she's ever done,
[00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:10.460]   and Chris is like, "Mm!"
[00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:14.500]   And I'm standing there like.
[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:22.700]   What about my knees?
[00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:27.900]   And she walks over to me and pecks me lightly on my knee,
[00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:29.860]   and she walks out of the room,
[00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:31.660]   and Chris and I are like, done.
[00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:37.660]   But Mia had to comprehend, learn, be exposed to,
[00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:40.260]   understand love in order to respond to love.
[00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:42.540]   John would write this in one of his letters, wouldn't he?
[00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:46.300]   You are able to love 'cause he first loved you.
[00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:47.740]   And so here is Paul writing to the church,
[00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:50.260]   and he's saying, you are rooted and established in love.
[00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:51.820]   You have the fullness of that love,
[00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:54.460]   but my heart is that you would comprehend that love
[00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:57.500]   more and more and more, and as you comprehend it,
[00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:00.300]   you will respond to it in such a profound and beautiful way.
[00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:02.020]   You have walked through that door,
[00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:03.780]   and your Father is standing there,
[00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:06.140]   and He sees you, and He loves you fully
[00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:07.860]   if you've given your life to Jesus.
[00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:09.820]   But oh, we can grow, can't we,
[00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:13.500]   in our comprehension of that love of God
[00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:17.180]   that is so high, so wide, so long, so deep,
[00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:21.660]   that it can literally transform the brokenness within us.
[00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:24.540]   Which is why he then finishes with this.
[00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:27.100]   He says, "And that you would know this love
[00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:29.260]   "that surpasses knowledge."
[00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:31.660]   He's just said, I want you to have a better comprehension
[00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:32.900]   of this love in your mind.
[00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:35.780]   But then he goes, but that's just not enough.
[00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:37.500]   I don't want you just to grow daily
[00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:39.100]   in your comprehension of the love.
[00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:40.140]   I want you to know it.
[00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:41.980]   He's drawing from the Old Testament once again.
[00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:44.340]   This idea of intimacy, to know someone
[00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:46.140]   was an Old Testament biblical way
[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:48.460]   to speak about intimacy and relationship.
[00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:50.700]   He's saying, I want you to know this love
[00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:52.340]   that surpasses knowledge.
[00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:54.700]   Yes, you can grow in your comprehension of it,
[00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:56.060]   but that's not enough either.
[00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:58.500]   I want you to actually physically experience it
[00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:00.820]   and feel it and know it and grow in it
[00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:03.620]   so that when you both in your mind can understand it
[00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:05.740]   and in your spirit receive it,
[00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:09.820]   you will be transformed to the fullness
[00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:11.380]   of the wholeness of Christ.
[00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:17.660]   All of which is a summary of this prayer here.
[00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:21.260]   You are rooted and established in love.
[00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:24.100]   You can grasp and comprehend its wonder more and more.
[00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:27.220]   And you can experience it beyond just the mere idea of it.
[00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:29.540]   You can know it intimately and personally
[00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:31.220]   right here and now.
[00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:33.540]   This love comes by the Spirit to strengthen you
[00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:37.020]   with power in the places where you are most broken.
[00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:39.020]   So you will become a living example
[00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:41.820]   of what the fullness of God looks like.
[00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:45.060]   That's Paul's prayer for his church.
[00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:46.900]   And we as a leadership would say,
[00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:49.060]   that's our prayer for you.
[00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:51.060]   That's growing big people.
[00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:55.300]   That's for you from us.
[00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:56.820]   If this is your home church,
[00:39:56.820 --> 00:40:00.020]   that's everything why we do what we do.
[00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:05.300]   So that you would come to a profound relationship
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:08.540]   with a inner healing and transformative God.
[00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:12.180]   So that your eyes of the heart would be open
[00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:13.500]   so you could see Him.
[00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:15.700]   Your mind would comprehend His love
[00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:17.340]   more greater than you could ever have thought.
[00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:19.020]   And you would know that love
[00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:20.340]   that surpasses your understanding.
[00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:22.620]   You would feel it and sense it and see it
[00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:25.500]   so that you would know the fullness of Christ in your life.
[00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:28.780]   Oh Lord that you would do that to your church.
[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:31.420]   Yahweh.
[00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:38.380]   May the breath of God's Spirit
[00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:42.260]   break back the lies of the enemy
[00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:45.980]   that would say you are not worthy to be loved.
[00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:50.660]   And may you come to a deeper and more profound realization
[00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:54.100]   out of the glorious riches of Christ.
[00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:56.660]   How much He really loves you.
[00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:59.220]   Can we pray?
[00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:00.060]   Let's pray.
[00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:03.940]   Now I wonder as we pray you could just quieten your heart.
[00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:06.300]   As your eyes are closed,
[00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:12.940]   maybe just take a moment just to come before Him.
[00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:19.100]   For you are rooted and established in love.
[00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:24.380]   And He loves you so, so much.
[00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:30.580]   And I wanna pray for those of you in this room
[00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:32.580]   that are really struggling to know love.
[00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:38.180]   For some of you like I said, that's a human level.
[00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:41.660]   You feel deeply lonely.
[00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:45.140]   Perhaps on the surface your life looks amazing.
[00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:50.540]   Perhaps you have a great job, great husband, wife,
[00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:54.660]   great family, great friends, spirit of influence.
[00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:56.940]   Perhaps on the surface things seem to be great
[00:41:56.940 --> 00:42:00.420]   but nobody really knows that deep down inside of you
[00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:01.820]   you're desperately lonely.
[00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:05.660]   But the Lord sees that.
[00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:10.260]   The Lord's desire is that He would strengthen you
[00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:13.900]   with power by His Spirit in those places.
[00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:18.540]   The places that many people don't know about but you know.
[00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:23.780]   Some of you are lacking that sense of human love.
[00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:26.500]   Some of you in this room
[00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:28.500]   you're lacking a sense of divine love.
[00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:32.940]   You feel like you're unworthy of being loved by Him.
[00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:36.460]   Perhaps you're a sin or you're brokenness
[00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:38.780]   or the mistakes you've made are very, very front
[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:39.940]   and center in your mind.
[00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:45.540]   May Paul's words set you free today
[00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:47.860]   that you are rooted and established in love.
[00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:49.380]   You've walked through that door
[00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:51.620]   and the Father loves you.
[00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:54.140]   And it's a lie of the enemy to say
[00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:55.980]   that you are unworthy of being loved.
[00:42:55.980 --> 00:43:00.460]   And here at the Vine we come against the work
[00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:02.780]   of the enemy in that area over these people
[00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:04.140]   in the name of Jesus.
[00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:06.300]   Out of your glorious riches, Lord,
[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:10.660]   you would strengthen with power by your Spirit
[00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:13.140]   in their inner being, the people in this room
[00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:15.220]   to know your love.
[00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:20.740]   So I wonder whether you would wanna respond to that.
[00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:22.380]   You can just open your hands where you are
[00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:23.340]   and I'm gonna pray.
[00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:29.980]   I'm just gonna invite the Holy Spirit now.
[00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:35.180]   Just whilst we are in this place of receiving.
[00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:37.540]   This is the most important part of the service.
[00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:40.540]   For here on Pentecost Sunday,
[00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:44.780]   that promise of Ezekiel 36 is real and true
[00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:46.500]   and fulfilled in Christ.
[00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:50.540]   And that any hardness of heart,
[00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:52.420]   any hurt and pain,
[00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:57.100]   whatever might be the deepest thing inside of us,
[00:43:57.100 --> 00:44:00.020]   Christ can heal and restore and strengthen.
[00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:04.100]   So come Holy Spirit.
[00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:08.340]   Come Holy Spirit.
[00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:17.540]   Come Holy Spirit.
[00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:20.860]   (gentle music)
[00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:24.660]   Just take some time to receive him.
[00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:29.020]   You are loved.
[00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:33.180]   You are loved.
[00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:41.380]   It's not your fault for how you're feeling unloved.
[00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:46.380]   You are loved.
[00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:48.980]   (gentle music)
[00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:57.500]   Just come Holy Spirit.
[00:44:57.500 --> 00:45:02.180]   Strengthen your church.
[00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:05.940]   Pour out your presence.
[00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:15.740]   What we're gonna do in a moment
[00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:18.420]   is we're just gonna have the prayer team come forward
[00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:21.500]   and they're gonna be here at the front.
[00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:24.220]   And I wanna encourage you,
[00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:26.140]   this has been important to you today.
[00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:28.660]   Have some people come around you today
[00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:30.500]   and just love on you.
[00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:32.300]   Love on you by praying for you,
[00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:35.740]   by speaking truth and life to you.
[00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:39.140]   For some of you in this room,
[00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:41.020]   that's really important for you today
[00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:44.340]   is to receive ministry by the Spirit of God
[00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:46.620]   through somebody else praying for you
[00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:47.740]   and speaking life into you.
[00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:49.820]   So our prayer team are gonna be here now.
[00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:52.860]   So if you're on the prayer team,
[00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:55.180]   I wanna invite you just to be in the front now.
[00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:59.540]   And in a moment, if you would like to receive prayer,
[00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:02.380]   I'm gonna invite you to come and receive prayer.
[00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:04.060]   Some of you may just wanna sit
[00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:07.580]   and you may just wanna sit for another five,
[00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:10.380]   10 minutes or so and just allow the Holy Spirit
[00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:12.100]   to minister to you, just to speak to you.
[00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:13.780]   Maybe it's just personal for you.
[00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:15.980]   Or maybe you've come with someone
[00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:17.100]   and you can pray together
[00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:20.620]   and you just wanna soak in the presence of God
[00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:23.420]   that is here, right here and now.
[00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:26.860]   You're more than welcome to stay and receive from Him.
[00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:30.060]   For those of you that need to leave in a moment,
[00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:31.140]   you're welcome to do that,
[00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:34.140]   but I ask you to do it respectfully and quietly
[00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:37.340]   as we respect the people in this room
[00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:40.020]   who are receiving from the Holy Spirit.
[00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:42.740]   But you're more than welcome to make an exit
[00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:45.060]   when you feel you're led to.
[00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:45.900]   Let me pray for us.
[00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:49.020]   Father, in the gentleness of your presence
[00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:51.420]   that's been here from the start of this service,
[00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:55.860]   would you now continue to minister to our hearts?
[00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:57.860]   Lord, I pray that every person that needs prayer
[00:46:57.860 --> 00:46:59.500]   in this room will receive prayer.
[00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:03.340]   Any person that just needs to sit in your presence
[00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:06.180]   would just receive from you in that way.
[00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:07.460]   For those of us that need to go,
[00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:11.020]   we bless them to go with the love of Christ,
[00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:13.820]   to serve and to live out that love,
[00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:17.580]   to comprehend that love, to know that love more and more.
[00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:20.620]   Come Holy Spirit, come.
[00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:24.740]   So if you'd like some prayer, don't be shy.
[00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:26.860]   Please come forward for prayer.
[00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:27.820]   If you wanna sit, sit.
[00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:29.420]   If you need to go, go.
[00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:30.660]   We love you guys so much.
[00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:33.240]   (gentle music)
