[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   Amen.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:07.500]   You know, when I stop for a moment and think about the incredible things, the blessings
[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.560]   that have been brought into our lives because of Christ, I can't help but stop in my busy
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.680]   life and actually just worship Him like we were doing just a moment ago, just giving
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.480]   Him honor and giving Him praise.
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.800]   I mean, stop for a moment and think about what He has done in your life.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:32.420]   You have been handpicked before the creation of this world, handpicked by God to be in
[00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.320]   relationship with Him.
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.580]   I mean, think about that for a moment.
[00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:43.040]   He has chosen you as an act of grace, chosen you not because you earned it, not because
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.160]   you deserve it, but because out of His great love, He wanted to be in relationship with
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.280]   you.
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.320]   I think of this a little bit like my wife and I and our daughter, Mia.
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.240]   God has adopted you into His family.
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.680]   You know, Mia, our daughter, she didn't choose Chris and I.
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.680]   Chris and I chose her, and in choosing her, she ended up coming into relationship with
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.160]   us and choosing us.
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.860]   And in the same way, you didn't choose God.
[00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.900]   God chose you, and in choosing you, you have now come into a relationship where you are
[00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.120]   now choosing Him and walking with Him, and that's a profound thing, not because you've
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.160]   earned it or deserved it, because He acted first.
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.280]   And here is how He chose you.
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:35.240]   He sent His only Son to die on a cross for all of your sin and all of your brokenness,
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:42.000]   to stand in the gap to create unity between you and reconciliation between you and God
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   once again.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.160]   He did that out of just a place of love and grace.
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.560]   And the reason why He's done that is He wants you to understand what His greater purpose,
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.360]   what His greater will is in this world.
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.920]   Here's His will, that everything on heaven and on earth would all come together under
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.080]   one person, that person being Jesus Christ.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.760]   Again, think about that for a second, that everything in this world, everything that
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:17.880]   is being created would come under one authority, the person of Jesus Christ.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.280]   I mean, that should just blow your mind.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.560]   Think about all the things He has done personally for you.
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.680]   He has chosen you, He has adopted you, He has saved you, He has filled you with His
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.960]   power of His Spirit, and He sent you out to be His hands and feet in the world.
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.300]   That, my friends, is purely grace.
[00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.180]   And because of all of that, here's how I pray for you.
[00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.120]   I pray that you wouldn't just believe in God, but that you would actually live a life
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.000]   that would show the world what that belief truly means to you.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.280]   I pray that you would come to a knowledge of God, or knowledge of all of these incredible
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.240]   things that He has done for you on your behalf by His grace.
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.620]   I pray that the eyes of your heart would be opened so you would come to a realization
[00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.720]   of the inheritance that you have as a believer in Jesus.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.040]   You would come to understand, because the eyes of your heart have been opened, that
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.240]   you would see the hope to which you have been called as a Christian.
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.200]   This hope that everything that God has created in the world, all authorities and powers and
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.520]   principalities, that all of these things sit under Christ Jesus.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.480]   That there is nothing above Jesus.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.220]   That His name is the highest name, and that at His name every knee will bow.
[00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.860]   That God has placed everything under Christ's authority for the power and the glory of the
[00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.860]   church.
[00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.780]   So think about the transformation that has come into your life.
[00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.880]   Because it's true to say that at one point you were spiritually dead.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.500]   You were dead in your sin.
[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.980]   And being dead in your sin, you were separated to God.
[00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.260]   That's what sin does.
[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.900]   It separates us from God.
[00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.420]   And God hates sin, but He looks down on us.
[00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.780]   And out of His mercy and His grace, He reached before us.
[00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.540]   And in the work of Jesus on the cross and the power of the resurrection, Jesus has taken
[00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.260]   the place of sin in us and provided mercy.
[00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.940]   Has taken the place of sin in our lives and now given us grace and forgiveness.
[00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.220]   And everything that He's done is not because we prayed for it.
[00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.740]   It's not because we asked it.
[00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.940]   It's not because we worked really hard to achieve something.
[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.360]   He's done it all out of the wonder of His grace.
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.360]   Think about this.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.060]   Your salvation is by grace and grace alone.
[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.420]   Nothing that you have done has accomplished what Christ has done on the cross.
[00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.120]   He's done it purely out of His grace for you.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:56.380]   You are quite literally a poem of God that God has written so that the world can read
[00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.700]   about that grace.
[00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.860]   You are God's workmanship.
[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.700]   And you've been created in Christ Jesus for these incredible works that He has for you.
[00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:08.700]   Think about that.
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:14.540]   You are His work so that you can go and do His work.
[00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:23.380]   That is the beauty of what Christ has done in His death and His resurrection for you.
[00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.940]   Once you were separated from God, but you're no longer separated from Him.
[00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.620]   He's actually brought you near.
[00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.540]   This is what Jesus' whole ministry and purpose was when He was here.
[00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:40.420]   It was to reconcile the things that were separated from God, to draw the things that perhaps
[00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.240]   shouldn't have been brought together.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.820]   Now bring them together under the reconciliation of God's forgiveness and love.
[00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.860]   That, my friends, is a picture of what the church is all about.
[00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.100]   I mean, if we're honest with ourselves, many of us in here probably shouldn't be sitting
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.780]   in the same room as each other.
[00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:03.540]   The only way that we can do this is because of the reconciling unity and love that Christ
[00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:04.980]   has done on the cross for us.
[00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.060]   I mean, look around this room right now.
[00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:13.220]   I mean, I love this about the vine, that there are local Chinese here in this room.
[00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.320]   There are overseas Chinese.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.740]   There are Asians from almost every Asian country.
[00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.580]   There are foreigners from all over the world all gathered in this room right now.
[00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.280]   There are wealthy people.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.480]   There are poor people in this room.
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.060]   There are those that have great influence and power and leadership in our city in this
[00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.060]   room.
[00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.700]   And there are some of you who live a very quiet life here.
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:41.420]   All of us are able to be together because of the reconciling love of Jesus.
[00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.140]   That is the church.
[00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.140]   Think about it this way.
[00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.100]   We're like an apartment building in Hong Kong, okay?
[00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.180]   We're like an apartment building.
[00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:55.340]   And our apartment building is rooted deep into the Word of God and the teachings of
[00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.980]   the early church.
[00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:01.460]   And we'd be constructed with the bamboo and the cements, if you will, of the power of
[00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.020]   the Holy Spirit.
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:08.260]   And our apartment building has one management team that runs it, the Father, the Son, and
[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.980]   the Holy Spirit.
[00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:13.220]   And each one of us, we have an apartment in that building.
[00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:18.860]   And all together, we share in the same utilities and the same power, but we have our own home
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.900]   and we have our own lives.
[00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.900]   That is the picture of the church.
[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.900]   That my friends, is the gospel.
[00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:33.820]   And this gospel, our city of Hong Kong so desperately needs to hear.
[00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:38.380]   I have given my life on behalf of this gospel.
[00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.580]   And I don't say that because I'm some perfect person.
[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:46.500]   No, I stand here today recognizing the sin that is in my own life, the brokenness that
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:47.800]   I own carry.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.500]   And sometimes that sin tells me that I am not worthy to be doing this.
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:56.180]   Sometimes I think because of my sin that I shouldn't be a pastor, I shouldn't be doing
[00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:57.220]   what I do.
[00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:01.140]   And then I'm reminded that it's not about my abilities, it's not about my effort, it's
[00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:05.260]   not about what I do, it's about the call of God that is on my life.
[00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.780]   He has called me and He that has called me is faithful.
[00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:12.580]   And He has also called you.
[00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:17.620]   He has called you to be wherever it is that He has planted you, to release something of
[00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.380]   His wisdom in the world.
[00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:20.820]   That's what the church does.
[00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:27.660]   We get to represent, to show the world a manifest expression of the wisdom of God.
[00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:30.420]   What an honor that is for us as the church to do that.
[00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:34.700]   And let's face it, sometimes as a church, we're pretty messed up.
[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:35.700]   Sometimes we're pretty broken.
[00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:41.260]   Our apartment building, if you will, is a little bit run down and in need of renovations.
[00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:45.580]   We're the kind of apartment building that most people do not want to rent a flat in,
[00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:46.580]   okay?
[00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:51.220]   We're the kind of apartment building that when a typhoon comes, the windows rattle and
[00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.340]   it gets a little bit leaky.
[00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.460]   But guess what?
[00:08:55.460 --> 00:09:01.220]   God has created the weak things in this world to confound the strong.
[00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:05.380]   God has made those things that don't on the surface appear like they're gonna have any
[00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:10.340]   value at all to be the ones that give hope and value into the world.
[00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:11.420]   That's the church.
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:14.420]   So here is how we pray.
[00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:20.700]   We pray that God would fill us with such strength in our inner being by the power of the Holy
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.300]   Spirit.
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:27.620]   And we pray that for you who already have this idea of the grandeur and the wonder of
[00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:32.540]   love in your life, my prayer is that you would come to see the height and the depth and the
[00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:36.340]   length and the width of that love like never before.
[00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:41.340]   And in seeing that kind of love, it would set your heart alight because you would realize
[00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:48.180]   that He is able to do immeasurably more than you could ever ask or imagine so that His
[00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:53.740]   glory is seen not just through Christ Jesus as beautiful as that is, but also through
[00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:57.780]   the church for His glory.
[00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:02.980]   Now because of all of that, here is what I plead of you.
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:07.140]   Do not waste your life.
[00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:14.820]   Do not treat God like a hobby, like you might go hiking or running or going to the gym.
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:19.140]   God is not a hobby to be segmented into some moment of your life.
[00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:22.460]   God is your whole life.
[00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:27.100]   And because He is your whole life, you are swept up in this wonder and this beauty of
[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.860]   what it is to live His life in this world.
[00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:34.360]   And it will look different for every single one of us, but it will hold these things that
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:42.620]   are values in the kingdom, things like grace and humility and love and kindness and goodness.
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:47.580]   And as we hold to these things together, one another, we will find unity amongst us in
[00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:56.220]   a beautiful way because we serve one God, one spirit, one church, one family, one faith,
[00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:57.220]   one hope.
[00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:01.980]   And in that unity, God moves powerfully.
[00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.780]   You know what He's actually done in the church?
[00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:12.220]   He's actually raised up apostles and prophets and teachers and pastors and those who are
[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:18.460]   able to serve in beautiful ways to help and equip you so that you might become the fullness
[00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:21.020]   of who you've been created to be.
[00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:25.700]   God sends these leaders within a local church body to enable you to be prepared for those
[00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:30.920]   works that He has called you to work in whatever sphere of influence that you have power in
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.100]   this city.
[00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.860]   He wants you to be His hands and feet in a beautiful way.
[00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:35.860]   And guess what?
[00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:40.100]   When you work that way, and when those apostles and those prophets and those pastors and those
[00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:45.060]   teachers and those leaders, evangelists, they also work that way, the whole church is built
[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:51.020]   up into this maturity, this maturity in Christ Jesus and in the knowledge of Him so that
[00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:55.300]   we would come to the fullness of the fullness of Christ.
[00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.300]   What a picture.
[00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:59.260]   I wonder if you could imagine that.
[00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:03.260]   The fullness of the fullness of Christ.
[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:10.460]   And when that happens, no longer are we susceptible to being swayed back and forth by every whim
[00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:13.580]   of teaching, by whatever is trendy and cool.
[00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:20.220]   No, instead, we're rooted in the reality that Jesus is our head.
[00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:21.720]   Think of it here in Hong Kong.
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:24.740]   Think of it like a lion dance, okay?
[00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:25.740]   God is our head.
[00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.580]   Jesus, our head.
[00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.380]   We're the ones who get to be in the tail.
[00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:33.380]   We're the ones that get to run alongside of Him.
[00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:35.900]   We're the ones that actually are in the dance.
[00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:39.540]   We get to make the dance beautiful.
[00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:43.860]   So let me challenge you, put your dancing shoes on.
[00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:45.220]   You're in the dance.
[00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.300]   You're not a bystander.
[00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:50.820]   You're not a tourist with some camera and some fleeting memories.
[00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:53.940]   No, you're actually a local in the house of God.
[00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.440]   You're a part of the team.
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.700]   You're on the dance team.
[00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:01.300]   Put your dance shoes on and get yourself excited.
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.660]   Put on the new self that Christ has paid the price for.
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:07.260]   Put on the new attitudes that Christ has given you.
[00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:12.580]   It's like literally putting on new clothes that you can show the world.
[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:16.660]   Now if you're going to put on some new clothes, that probably means that you might have to
[00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:20.540]   take off some old clothes.
[00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:25.940]   Clothes like anger and deceit and lying.
[00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:31.820]   You should wear clothes that represent what is truly actually in your heart.
[00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:34.100]   And so often we don't do that.
[00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:39.620]   We think we can wear clothes of humility and truth and falsehood and pride at the same
[00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:40.620]   time.
[00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:43.460]   If you try that, you will look pretty stupid.
[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:48.860]   My suggestion to you is to ensure that everything that comes out of your mouth actually represents
[00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:52.020]   what you believe in your heart.
[00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:55.600]   Those of you who have been stealing before, you shouldn't steal anymore.
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.380]   Those of you who have lied before, you should stop lying.
[00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:03.140]   You should correlate the words of your mouth to the beauty that is within you.
[00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:05.740]   This is the simplest way I could say it.
[00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:07.900]   Imitate God.
[00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:09.560]   How do you imitate God?
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:15.980]   You receive the fullness of His love and then you show the world that love.
[00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.860]   How has Christ shown His love to you?
[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:22.620]   He has sent Himself to the cross to die for you.
[00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:27.740]   The question then you should ask yourself is this, what act of self-sacrificial love
[00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.040]   could I show somebody today?
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:34.420]   Do that and you imitate God.
[00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:37.800]   But if you're anything like me, you can end up imitating other things.
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:42.040]   I imitate things like anger at times, bitterness.
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:47.760]   I imitate at times lust, things that I struggle with.
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.920]   And maybe there are some things that you also imitate.
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:55.660]   The reality is we can so end up imitating Satan rather than God and that has no place
[00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:57.100]   in the kingdom.
[00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:00.960]   Instead, you are children of light.
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:03.720]   So live in the light.
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:08.020]   Shine your light brightly in the city of Hong Kong so people would know the gospel that
[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:09.820]   sets them free.
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:13.660]   And if you see any darkness around you, you should know that you're bringing the light
[00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:16.660]   of Christ into that place of darkness.
[00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:21.820]   If you see any injustice around you, you should know that you're living as a child of light
[00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:27.220]   to show gospel and truth and hope and justice in the very places where we see the greatest
[00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:28.300]   brokenness.
[00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:30.980]   That's what it is to be the people of light.
[00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:33.460]   And Christ has called us to do that.
[00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:37.340]   So if you want to act wisely, live in the light.
[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:40.660]   If you want to live in the light, well then you should imitate God.
[00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:45.260]   And if you want to imitate God, you should love like God loves.
[00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.340]   You should probably write that down somewhere.
[00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:53.100]   If you want to act and live wisely, you should live in the light.
[00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:56.580]   If you want to live in the light, you should imitate God.
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:02.740]   And if you imitate God, that is to love like God loves.
[00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:09.300]   Do that and this world truly changes.
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:13.540]   What I want you to do every single morning when you wake up is I want you to think about
[00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:19.660]   this in your relationships because it is living as children of light in the areas of our relationships
[00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:22.020]   that gets transformed the most.
[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:25.700]   I mean you should be speaking words of love and encouragement over one another.
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:30.580]   You should even be singing spiritual songs over one another as strange as that might
[00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:32.500]   sound.
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.060]   Think about the relationships in your lives.
[00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:40.200]   If you're a wife here, you should be thinking about how do you best support and grow and
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.940]   flourish your family.
[00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:45.300]   How do you support your husband and lift him up?
[00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:49.700]   If you're a husband here, you should be thinking about how you can love your wife like Christ
[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.420]   loved the church and gave himself up for the church.
[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:56.060]   You should be thinking about what it is to love your wife like you would love your own
[00:16:56.060 --> 00:17:02.380]   body, caring for her like you would care for yourself, putting her first.
[00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:08.340]   If you're a child here, you need to honor and be obedient to your parents.
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:14.380]   If you're a domestic worker here, you ought to work with an open and loving heart.
[00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:18.620]   If you're an employer here or somebody in leadership or government here, then you should
[00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:22.900]   govern with humility and dignity and love.
[00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:29.100]   When we treat one another like this, we actually show the world something of what Christ has
[00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:32.420]   done in his death and his resurrection.
[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:39.420]   So every morning when you wake up, do this spiritual checklist and do this in order to
[00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:43.740]   protect yourself from the work of the enemy in your life.
[00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:45.540]   Here's the first thing you should do.
[00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:49.140]   Get truth into you like a daily breakfast.
[00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.980]   Eat up God's Word first thing in the morning.
[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:56.660]   Before you jump online, get on email, do Twitter or anything like that, Instagram, get the
[00:17:56.660 --> 00:18:00.780]   Bible open, read his Word, listen to it, put it in your heart.
[00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:05.380]   His Word first, the truth, like a daily breakfast.
[00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:06.380]   Here's the second thing.
[00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:10.020]   You should put on your new identity and wear it proudly.
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:14.540]   Maybe like a comfortable t-shirt that you love, your favorite t-shirt, putting on that
[00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:17.100]   t-shirt to show the world who you are.
[00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:20.460]   That's the new identity Christ has given you, and you should live that out in the world
[00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:22.460]   proudly.
[00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:27.940]   You should think every day thirdly about what it is to walk in peace.
[00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:31.420]   Think about the most comfortable shoes that you have and what it feels like to walk in
[00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.060]   those comfortable shoes.
[00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:37.780]   That's how you should feel every second of the day.
[00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:41.580]   And then have faith that God will protect you.
[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:47.860]   Faith is like your skin, protecting and covering up your organs so they're resisting from decay.
[00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:49.900]   That's what faith will do in your life.
[00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:55.320]   It'll enable you to know that God is with you no matter what it is that you are facing.
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.180]   And then think about this.
[00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:01.260]   I want you to know that God is with you above everything else.
[00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:02.780]   That's like your mobile phone.
[00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:04.740]   Your mobile phone is always with you.
[00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:06.820]   Some of you, it's glued to your hand.
[00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:14.260]   Think about God's presence in your life like a mobile phone, always with you.
[00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:15.740]   And I want you to pray.
[00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:19.820]   I want you to pray in every occasion with every kind of prayer.
[00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:21.100]   And here's the beautiful thing.
[00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:26.540]   When you pray for one another, you will be astounded at the healing you will receive.
[00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:30.500]   And if I had one final request, it would be this.
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:33.660]   I would love it if you would pray for me.
[00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:39.580]   Pray that I would declare the gospel of Jesus Christ in Hong Kong fearlessly as God has
[00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:42.440]   called me to do it.
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.420]   I pray that you would live in grace and peace.
[00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:49.500]   And as you live in grace and peace, you will find the glory of the Lord around you and
[00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:54.860]   you will find yourself safe and comfortable and alive like never before.
[00:19:54.860 --> 00:20:01.900]   And I pray this in Jesus' name, everyone says, amen.
[00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:08.780]   Well in case you didn't realize, that's the whole book of Ephesians from start to finish.
[00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:10.660]   Yeah.
[00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:15.180]   So I wanted to...
[00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:20.460]   We're starting a whole study, a whole sermon series, 15 weeks on the book of Ephesians.
[00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:25.340]   But before we jump into studying it passage by passage, I actually wanted to bring it
[00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:29.300]   to you today just like Paul originally intended it to.
[00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:33.780]   Because when he wrote this letter to the church in Ephesus, a small church meeting in some
[00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:39.540]   houses in the city of Ephesus, a church under great persecution, a church that was struggling
[00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:43.940]   to understand its identity, Paul writes them a letter not to be dissected and studied and
[00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:45.100]   all of this kind of stuff.
[00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:48.860]   He writes them basically a conversation that he's trying to have with them to help them
[00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:54.620]   to understand who they are in Christ Jesus, what Christ has done, and then in that to
[00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:58.760]   live in a way that would honor and glorify Christ in the world.
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:01.020]   That's why he wrote the book of Ephesians.
[00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:04.860]   And I think so often as Christians, we open the book and we go to our favorite section
[00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:09.100]   and we read that little bit, but actually the whole letter was designed to be read in
[00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:10.580]   one sitting.
[00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:14.060]   It was designed to be heard just like you just heard it.
[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:18.060]   And of course I changed it and paraphrased it to make it like Hong Kong because I think
[00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:20.500]   that's what Paul would want me to do.
[00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:25.220]   Because he wrote the letter to people in Ephesus for specific issues that were going on in
[00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:26.220]   Ephesus.
[00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:31.380]   I translated it for us in Hong Kong for the specific issues that we're seeing, but wasn't
[00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:37.580]   it glorious just to sit under the beautiful Word of God.
[00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:44.220]   This idea that there is so much that Christ is doing in our lives, so much that he's done
[00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.540]   that we have not earned.
[00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:51.820]   And when we understand the beauty of that, we're then able to walk out as his representatives
[00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:53.860]   in the world around us.
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:57.300]   That's what Ephesians is all about.
[00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:02.900]   And in the first two verses of the letter, just the first two verses, Paul actually introduces
[00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:07.620]   the two main pivot points of the whole book.
[00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:09.900]   So I'm actually now going to read you the actual book of Ephesians.
[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:11.060]   I'm not going to read the whole thing.
[00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:13.620]   You'll be glad to hear it because I just told you the whole thing.
[00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:15.620]   So let me read you just the first two verses.
[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:16.620]   Is that okay?
[00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:17.620]   All right.
[00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:19.740]   Some of you were like, "What is Andrew doing today?
[00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:21.900]   Did he have a weird curry last night?"
[00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:24.460]   You were thinking like, "This is not like he normally does it."
[00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:26.140]   Anybody felt that way?
[00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:27.660]   Did I turn you off?
[00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:28.660]   Hopefully you stuck with me.
[00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:29.660]   Is that okay?
[00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:30.660]   All right.
[00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:36.620]   Ephesians 1, first two verses, "Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God,
[00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:43.380]   to the saints in Ephesus, the faithful in Christ Jesus, grace and peace to you from
[00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:46.220]   God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:47.420]   I love how Paul begins.
[00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:52.020]   He says, "Grace and peace to you."
[00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:55.400]   This was not just a standard greeting in those days.
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:23:00.500]   This was actually something that Paul formulated and used in almost all of his writings, in
[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:04.100]   almost all of the letters that he wrote to the church, he would often start with this
[00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:07.380]   idea of grace and peace.
[00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:12.300]   And here in the book of Ephesians, the whole book is actually structured around these two
[00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:14.520]   themes of grace and peace.
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:16.780]   This is not Paul just going, "Hey, how are you?
[00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:18.300]   Good to see you."
[00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:23.100]   This is Paul trying to explain something that is central to the heart of God and something
[00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:28.580]   that should be central to every church community, not just in Ephesus, but I think for all time,
[00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:30.420]   grace and peace.
[00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:32.620]   Let me break these down real quick.
[00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:38.980]   Grace is the Greek word here, charis, which comes from the root word kario.
[00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:45.300]   And that word in the Greek essentially means this, an unmerited favor that causes you to
[00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:48.980]   celebrate, rejoice, or be glad, unmerited favor.
[00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:54.860]   In other words, what grace is defined is as a gift, something that you've never earned,
[00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:59.020]   something you don't deserve, even something that you've never asked for.
[00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:04.380]   It's like a surprise that is given to you out of the blue, and you're just blown away
[00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:07.380]   that somebody would be so generous.
[00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:09.660]   That's the idea of grace.
[00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:13.380]   And what's really important for you to grasp just right at the start of the book of Ephesians
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:18.820]   is that this word grace in the Greek comes in the passive form, which makes sense because
[00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:21.820]   it is a passive thing.
[00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:24.400]   Grace is not something you do.
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:27.220]   Grace is something you receive.
[00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:29.360]   Grace is not something you earn.
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.900]   Grace is something you understand.
[00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:36.540]   And as you receive and you understand it, it is something that comes into you, which
[00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:42.060]   causes you to do nothing other than to rejoice and be glad.
[00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:43.060]   That's grace.
[00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:46.860]   And that's why Paul spends all that time in this letter saying you need to understand
[00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:49.740]   that your salvation is not because you did something.
[00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:55.520]   Your salvation is a gift of grace from God to you, unmerited, because He loves you, and
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:25:01.520]   that should cause you to celebrate, to worship, and to praise Him.
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:07.860]   Grace is a surprise of the generosity of God.
[00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:09.440]   Peace is different.
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:12.400]   Peace actually has two words that are associated to it.
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.600]   In the Greek, it's this eriane.
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:18.800]   In the Hebrew, though, which is what it draws from, is the word shalom.
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:23.600]   When we think of peace in the modern context, we think peace is the absence of something,
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.520]   usually the absence of conflict.
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:28.480]   So we might say, "Oh, that home is very peaceful."
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:32.960]   What we're meaning is they're not throwing things at each other in that house, right?
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:39.540]   Or we might pray for peace in the Middle East, and what we mean is that war would cease there.
[00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:43.000]   But in the Hebrew thinking, peace is not about the absence of something.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.600]   It's actually about the presence of something.
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:52.000]   And it's actually about working towards the presence of something, the presence of wholeness,
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:26:00.760]   of completeness, of fullness, of how something ought to be, the presence of safety, of security.
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:04.760]   Another word associated to it means shalom, which is reconciliation.
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:08.720]   There's another word, shalomat, that represents perfection.
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:15.120]   These ideas of wholeness, reconciliation, the way things ought to be, things flourishing
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:20.640]   and being just as God created them to, the presence of that is peace.
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:27.560]   So interestingly, grace is this idea of passivity, "I receive," but peace in the Greek and in
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:29.580]   the Hebrew is an active word.
[00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:35.200]   It's about a doing, it's about a being, and a way we are.
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.040]   We act in peace.
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:40.600]   So we pick up the phone and we call that person that we haven't spoken to for ages because
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:45.120]   we had an argument we never reconciled, and we get on the phone and we try to reconcile
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.120]   it.
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:47.120]   That's an act of peace.
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:51.800]   Or we send that email that we've been meaning to send because we saw somebody was mistreated
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:56.280]   by this company and we want to point that out and stand in the gap for someone who was
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.720]   mistreated.
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:00.000]   That is a work, an act of peace.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.160]   Peace has action and movement towards it.
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:06.100]   And I love the way that Paul begins his letter.
[00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:08.640]   He says, "Here's the whole point of this.
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.960]   There is grace and there is peace."
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:15.080]   In other words, there is something for you to receive and there is something for you
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:16.240]   to do.
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:20.680]   There is something for you to understand in revelation, and as you understand what God
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:26.940]   has done in revelation for you, you then want to live a certain way in the world.
[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:29.200]   There is grace and there is peace.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.800]   Does that make sense to you?
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:34.640]   Does that make sense to you?
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:37.480]   Whoo, good, you're still there.
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:42.480]   So grace and peace is how Paul actually breaks down the whole of the letter of Ephesians.
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:43.480]   Let me show this to you.
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:48.160]   The first three chapters are all the focus on what Christ has done.
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:50.480]   So in there he talks about how all things are under Christ.
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:52.280]   We've been adopted into his family.
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:53.280]   Sin is being dealt with.
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:54.640]   We've been given a new self.
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:56.120]   We can know God now.
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:57.560]   We have a gift of salvation.
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.100]   We are his workmanship.
[00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:01.240]   We have this unity together.
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:05.080]   You probably heard me talk about that sort of stuff in the opening of this message.
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:08.400]   That's the first three chapters of Ephesians.
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:13.460]   That stuff that you are to receive, not stuff for you to do.
[00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:18.040]   But then in chapters four to six, he then speaks on this idea of peace.
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:23.440]   So because of all the grace on the left side, live a life worthy of this grace.
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:24.440]   Build one another up.
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.700]   Strive for maturity in Christ.
[00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:29.040]   Live as light of Christ in the world.
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.400]   Imitate Christ in everything.
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.600]   Build healthy marriages and families.
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:34.360]   Protect yourself from temptation.
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:36.240]   Live in the power of the Spirit.
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:41.880]   He's like, you've got grace, all this stuff Christ has done for you, now in peace, live
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:43.640]   this way.
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:46.840]   You should be inspired, he's saying to his church.
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:50.080]   Once you understand what Christ has done, how can you not then?
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:52.240]   I said this in my little opening bit.
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:54.520]   I said, here's what I plead with you.
[00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.920]   Don't waste your life.
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:01.680]   There's too many Christians that die in old age with a belief in Jesus who wasted their
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.860]   life.
[00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:07.320]   You haven't been saved just so that you can get to heaven.
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:12.560]   Ephesians is about being saved so you can live the new humanity in the world today so
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:18.040]   that others might see the light and be drawn to it.
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:20.640]   Ephesians is ascending gospel.
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:24.720]   Ephesians is about receiving and giving.
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:27.720]   And if there's one thing that we have as a leadership here at the Vine for you over the
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:33.200]   next 15 weeks, as we break down every little segment of this book, you're going to be so
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.060]   full of Ephesians by the end of it, trust me.
[00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:44.140]   As we go through it, my prayer for you right at the start is grace and peace.
[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:50.460]   It was designed so that you would hear the whole thing in one go and see the wonder that
[00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:55.280]   there is in a God who has done all of this stuff and now calls us to live in a radical
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:58.080]   new way.
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:02.060]   So as I began, let me finish.
[00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:09.560]   This is from me, a disciple of Christ Jesus by the call of God to you, my family and friends
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:14.160]   who call the Vine their home church in Hong Kong, who are faithful and trying to live
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:16.100]   a faithful life.
[00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:23.100]   Grace and peace to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now and forever.
[00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:25.960]   And everyone says, "Amen."
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:26.960]   Let's pray.
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:35.960]   Father, I'm so humbled by the swept beauty of your Word, the grandeur of it.
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:41.020]   We thank you that Paul wrote a letter to a church that wasn't supposed to be just dissected
[00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:48.240]   line by line, but he created a letter that was to be read in the church in one sitting
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:51.400]   so that people could hear the glory of the gospel of Jesus.
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:55.620]   Lord, my prayer is that that is something that may have happened for some of us in this
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:31:03.560]   room here today, that as we hear the whole of the story in one, we would be people called
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:05.200]   to grace and peace.
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:09.200]   Father, I know that in this room there are some people in the season ahead of these next
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:13.180]   15 weeks who are going to need the grace.
[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:17.200]   Maybe some of you in this room, you are new to the faith.
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:21.320]   Maybe you came to faith last week at Easter or maybe recently through an Alpha we've done
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:23.480]   or in other ways.
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:27.200]   And you're wondering, "What is it that Christ has really done for me?"
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:31.300]   My prayer for you over the next 15 weeks is that you would come into this beautiful understanding
[00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:35.760]   of the grace of God in your life, that you would truly know what He's done.
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:40.040]   And if you've been a Christian for many, many years, if you're anything like me, it's easy
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:45.080]   to settle into the habit of being a Christian and lose something of the wonder of what it
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:46.960]   is to be a Christian.
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:51.800]   So my prayer is if you've been a Christian for a long time, that as we open up Ephesians
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:56.200]   together you would also be blown away once again by His grace.
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:00.800]   His grace to you, not because you deserve it, but because He loves you.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:05.080]   And Lord, I know that there'll be people in this room where peace is the season you're
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:09.140]   moving them into as we do this series together.
[00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:14.720]   That you're going to be calling them to pick up the phone, to write that email, to have
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:22.320]   a coffee, to actually stretch out and try to reconcile a broken relationship, or perhaps
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:26.840]   to stand in the gap where they see an injustice.
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:29.680]   There'll be some people in this room, Lord, that peace is going to be the season you're
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:34.240]   moving into, and they have a voice and an authority and an influence, and you want them
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:37.560]   now to use it in a new way.
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:44.080]   So Lord, for those in this room where peace, the bringing forth of the flourishing of Christ
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:49.200]   in this world, Lord, if that's their season, I pray you would empower them in the Holy
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:52.600]   Spirit to live that way boldly, Lord.
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:58.240]   Whether it's grace or peace, all of it we submit ourselves under the authority of Christ
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:05.440]   Jesus, and we look forward, Lord, to being that apartment building we spoke about, the
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:14.840]   lion dance that we talked about, being in the game, living life that matters.
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:19.640]   I pray you would release this over the vine in these weeks, and we thank you for this.
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:22.800]   In Jesus' name, everyone says, amen, amen.
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:26.440]   Would you stand with me, and we're going to respond together as a church in words.
