[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Amen. Thank you, Joshua. Can we put hands together for Joshua?
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.520]   (Applause)
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.520]   Hi.
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.160]   Ah, by the way, I really love that song, like, "From the Inside Out."
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.760]   Who grew up listening to Hillsong United?
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.800]   OK. OK, you guys.
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.880]   We're in the same generation.
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.280]   Yes. It's nice.
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.200]   Uh, this past week,
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.360]   uh, Rossini and I, we travelled.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.200]   We were on a little, like, getaway trip
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.880]   after four years of being parents.
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:34.880]   OK, yeah.
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.360]   So, after four years of being parents,
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.360]   we did our first trip, just the two of us on our own.
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.600]   We were in Seoul, Korea.
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.800]   And unlike any previous trips,
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.040]   we almost, like, planned nothing, like, no plans at all.
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.240]   I said it's different from previous trips
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.200]   because if you know us, if you have heard of any stories,
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.080]   if you have ever talked to Rosalind,
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.640]   you probably know how well-planned she is.
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.280]   Every previous trip we had,
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.920]   there would be printed itinerary put in a clear folder,
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.520]   and we would, every day, I'd just look up the folder
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.520]   and I know where I should be at what time, and, uh, wonderful.
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.960]   So, this trip, she saw me, "Oh, you're half-dead,
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.640]   so let's do, like, no plans, just be spontaneous."
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.160]   So, we almost had no plans,
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.400]   except we booked a skiing trip, a one-day skiing trip.
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.480]   So, on Wednesday, like, 7-ish a.m.,
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.440]   we had to take a shuttle bus from downtown Seoul,
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.920]   like, all the way to the snowy mountain,
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.800]   and we got there at around 10 a.m., I believe.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.520]   And she was very kind enough,
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.800]   she booked me an instructor, a skiing lesson,
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.920]   'cause this is my first time skiing, like, ever in my life.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.520]   So, she booked...
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.520]   Yeah, that needs a sound effect, right?
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.800]   First time, boom!
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.280]   First time skiing, I got a ski instructor,
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.840]   but the lesson was at 1 p.m., we arrived at 10,
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.280]   and we only have, like, one day there,
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.920]   and as Asians, Hong Kongers, Singaporeans,
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.920]   'cause we are not gonna just sit there and do nothing, right?
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.480]   And luckily, for my generation,
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.840]   who grew up with Hillstone United, we're millennials,
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.880]   and we know the secret of learning everything in life,
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.040]   which is on this platform called...?
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.360]   - YouTube. - YouTube, you're right!
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.520]   So, on my way there, on the way there,
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.720]   I quickly just look up YouTube,
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.040]   found a nine-minute video for beginners, for skiing.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.240]   So, I spent nine minutes watching the entire video,
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.480]   learning every move, and I'm like,
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.320]   "I got it, I'm ready for this!"
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.920]   Would you like to see a video?
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.160]   - Yeah! - All right.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.520]   Let's see the first one.
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.880]   So, this is Frosted in front of me.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.120]   Oh, we have sound, okay.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.680]   Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.480]   This is my first-person angle.
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.560]   And we have the other one, the third-person angle.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.600]   Let's go ahead.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:15.640]   I was sure I was going straight, moving forward.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.160]   I was so sure.
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.240]   It's like playing bowling, you know?
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:28.360]   So, I was so sure I was moving forward,
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.560]   but I was trying to do everything I learned
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.600]   from my nine-minute YouTube video,
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.520]   but before five seconds passed, that's what happened.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.960]   I just slanted and I hit the net.
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.280]   And, you know, when you ski,
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.040]   you have these super long skis on your feet,
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.520]   and so I got caught in the net.
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.080]   I was surprised that iPhones,
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.920]   the audio quality of iPhone was so bad
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.480]   that this iPhone didn't pick up the laugh of my wife.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.320]   She was laughing so hard.
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.560]   I think she hasn't laughed so hard
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.080]   for like four years in her life,
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.280]   ever since her last trip,
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.000]   and so she was just laughing and laughing
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.440]   and we were having so much fun.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.320]   But then, this was right before,
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.240]   yeah, this was right when I got caught in the net.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.600]   And the next moment, I was trying to get out,
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.280]   I tried to spin my body, and oops!
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.240]   I fell on the ground.
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.880]   If you've ever skied before,
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.080]   if you could imagine with me for a moment right now,
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.680]   you are not with your normal shoes,
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.160]   you're with these skiing boots,
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.360]   which is tightly tied to all the skis, long skis,
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.240]   and just a secret, you basically can't twist your ankle,
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.360]   you can't turn, and so I try every single position I could
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.120]   to pull myself up, or to push myself up,
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.680]   pull or push, I try everything,
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.400]   and trust me, I really try.
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.560]   And my Muay Thai days are way behind me
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.840]   and my core like, (imitates explosion)
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.760]   so anything I try, it didn't help.
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.880]   I was stuck right there,
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.440]   and the whole time my wife was just laughing
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.320]   when she was seeing me try, like,
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.360]   (laughs)
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.200]   and she was just laughing in a much better way.
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.960]   I just can't, yeah.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.960]   So I was stuck and I was a bit hopeless staying there,
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.040]   and I was just kind of like embarrassed
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.520]   'cause people were just skiing by and I was stuck there,
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.320]   and I can't do anything,
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.240]   both my feet was like tightly tied to the ski,
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.000]   try to regain balance, it didn't work.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.920]   So my dream of gliding down the slope gracefully
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.120]   with my wife, soon after five seconds,
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.920]   it became my most humbling experience
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.880]   of frustration and defeat.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.120]   And that, but okay, don't worry,
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.760]   after an hour I took the lesson for two hours,
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.080]   and then yeah, I managed to ski down the slope,
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.160]   but then I wonder in your life,
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.920]   or in your life, or in my life,
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.920]   were there some kind of experience like this,
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.840]   experience where you feel stuck in any way?
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.280]   Maybe you've experienced being physically stuck like me
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.680]   on a mountain, on a slope,
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.840]   or perhaps there are different situations in life
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.080]   that made you feel stuck.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.720]   Maybe it's an unhealthy or even toxic relationship.
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.760]   You know you shouldn't see this person anymore,
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.400]   you should just say goodbye and don't look back,
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.120]   but you just couldn't.
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.280]   Or maybe it's a job that you don't really enjoy,
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.240]   but you were thinking if I try to quit right now,
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.960]   the market is not that great, I may not find another one,
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.800]   so although I really hate my job,
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.880]   I'm just gonna like drag myself
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.120]   into the office every single day,
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.960]   and you're kind of like stuck inside the office,
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.840]   or perhaps you have some sort of habits
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.200]   that you are not very proud of,
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.480]   that you don't really enjoy,
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.200]   you know these kind of habits could
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.640]   either get you into trouble,
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.040]   or it's harmful for your well-being.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.920]   You try every way to shake this habit, but you couldn't.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.280]   Like you're sort of like addicted to it.
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.280]   You try to be healthier, you try to change,
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.240]   but you just couldn't find the motivation
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.840]   or the determination.
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:07.240]   You're stuck in some kind of bad habits.
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.600]   Or maybe, just like the main characters
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.920]   of our sermon series, Joseph.
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.320]   Last week we talk about this, right?
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.480]   Pastor Tim talk about the fact that he was stuck
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.320]   in a dysfunctional family, in that dynamic,
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.080]   and he was caught right in the middle.
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.520]   So Pastor Tim started us off last week
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.280]   with the story of Joseph.
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.840]   He looked at the first 11 verses in Genesis chapter 37.
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.880]   We learned that the 10 brothers of Joseph didn't like him
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.200]   because he was his father's favorite.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.720]   Jacob had this problem of showing favoritism
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.320]   towards Joseph.
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.600]   And it was evident by his gorgeous, like long robe,
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.920]   or some versions of the Bible would translate
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.560]   as the colorful robe, which actually symbolized
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.120]   his leadership, his status in the family.
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.040]   He's the heir of the family.
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.880]   They were like, what the heck, he's the youngest one.
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.720]   Like how come he could have that and we couldn't?
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.600]   So his brothers were furious, were upset about him.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.080]   And it just so happened, this young Joseph,
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.200]   he would see what his brother did,
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.760]   and he would go back to his dad and bad mouth them
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.120]   a little bit, hey, you know, they're misbehaving,
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:17.960]   they're mischieving.
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:21.040]   And just like what any siblings would do to each other,
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.760]   but anyway, the brothers like, no way.
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:27.780]   And he had these, all these dreams,
[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:31.400]   like how the other brothers or his family
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.480]   would eventually like bow down and worship him,
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.600]   or bow down and be fearful of him.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.360]   And so they got so angry, so upset, so pissed off,
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.920]   to a point that the Bible said they cannot speak shalom
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.200]   to him, they cannot speak peacefully to him.
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.920]   They're in this tension in their relationship,
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:56.100]   and that's where we begin the story of today.
[00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.500]   So I'm not gonna read every single verse in our passage,
[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.480]   we're gonna cover the rest of chapter 37.
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.280]   There are like over 20, 30 verses,
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.460]   I'm not gonna read all of them,
[00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.840]   but let me just paraphrase the first part of it.
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.280]   So from verse 12 onwards, it says,
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.880]   these brothers, they were shepherding the flock
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.940]   of the father of Jacob, and Jacob decided to send Joseph
[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.480]   to go look out for them and check if they
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.980]   and the flock are shalom.
[00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.740]   So Joseph said, yes, here I am, I will go.
[00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:30.040]   And the first thought, you know, at first, sorry,
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.280]   at first he thought they were in this place called Shechem.
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.560]   Shechem is about 15 miles from where they stay,
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.080]   where their home was.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.880]   And so he had to walk a few days,
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.800]   and he arrived at Shechem, and he couldn't find them.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.480]   Oh, they must be hanging out somewhere,
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.840]   having a party elsewhere.
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.880]   So someone pointed him to the place called Dothan.
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.760]   It's another like 15 miles away,
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.720]   so he walked, walked, walked, walked, walked,
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:56.000]   and then the Bible told us this.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.880]   As Joseph, he was approaching this place,
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.440]   Dothan, verse 18, it says this,
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:06.080]   but they, the brothers, saw him, Joseph, in the distance,
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:09.760]   and before he reached them, they plotted to kill him.
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.840]   Here comes the dreamer, they said to each other.
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.680]   Come now, let's kill him and throw him
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.840]   into one of these cisterns or pits,
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.600]   and say that a ferocious animal devoured him,
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.200]   maybe the big bad wolf,
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.760]   then we'll see what comes of his dreams.
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.960]   When Reuben heard this, he's the eldest,
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.240]   he's the oldest brother, he said,
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:33.360]   he tried to rescue him from their hands,
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.040]   said don't take his life.
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.000]   He said, don't shed any blood,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.960]   throw him into the cisterns here in the wilderness,
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.400]   but don't lay a hand on him.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.240]   Reuben said this to rescue him from them
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.320]   and take him back to his father.
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.080]   So when Joseph came to his brothers,
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.680]   they stripped him of his robe,
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.560]   the ornate robe he was wearing,
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:57.000]   and they took him and threw him into the cistern or the pit.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.920]   It was empty, there was no water in it.
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.920]   In those days, in Jacob's days,
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:06.040]   these kind of like deep cisterns or pits,
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.400]   they were either natural,
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:11.160]   or sometimes they were dug out pits to store rainwater.
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.920]   So it's water storage,
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:16.800]   but it's so deep that if you throw a person inside,
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.360]   that person will not be able to get out.
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.960]   So it's perfect to be a holding cell.
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.480]   And some of these brothers suggested killing him,
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.400]   and they even came up with a cover-up story.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.000]   Oh yeah, there's a big bad wolf coming,
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.840]   I mean, like an animal who ate him,
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.680]   and they made up this story.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.600]   The passage didn't show us
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.360]   who initiated that idea of killing him,
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.240]   but I would guess, if you let me guess,
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.320]   I would guess it's Levi and Simeon,
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.520]   'cause a few chapters back,
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.240]   they just slaughtered a whole town of males
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.040]   in the place of Shechem,
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.560]   which is where they were supposed to be.
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.000]   So they slaughtered the entire city.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.160]   They were totally capable of taking someone's life,
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.280]   of that level of violence.
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.480]   Then this eldest brother, Reuben, he counter-proposed,
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.520]   hey, why don't we just leave him in the pit?
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.280]   He's gonna die anyway, there's no water, there's no food.
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.840]   He'll die eventually.
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:09.840]   And then they said, yeah, okay,
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:10.760]   we can just leave him there.
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:14.560]   But the author, he revealed his intention,
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.840]   Reuben's intention to us.
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:20.040]   He was trying to save him, bring him back to his father.
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:23.920]   But nonetheless, when Jacob, sorry, when Joseph came,
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.400]   he was thrown into the pit.
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:32.080]   So for the very first time in Joseph's life, he was stuck.
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.760]   He was trapped in a pit so deep he couldn't escape.
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:39.320]   His freedom was taken away from him.
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.880]   His status, which was symbolized by his rope,
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.400]   was stripped away from him.
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:50.400]   But this was worse, that his understanding of family,
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.520]   his trust in those who were supposed to be his protectors,
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:00.400]   who were closest to him, who would draw near him,
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:04.480]   who would protect him, who were supposed to care for him,
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:08.800]   that kind of trust was lost the very moment
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.500]   he reached the bottom of that pit.
[00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:14.640]   The people he should trust the most betrayed him,
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.640]   threw him into that place.
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:21.640]   This pit or that pit, it's a place of loss.
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.600]   Joseph lost his brothers, his family,
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.160]   his right to live as a free man,
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:31.720]   and he lost his future inside that pit.
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.400]   You know, he would have become the heir
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:38.440]   to Jacob's inheritance, and he must have grown up
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.560]   listening to his father talking about the blessings of God,
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.280]   first to his great-grandfather Abraham,
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.840]   and then to his grandfather Isaac,
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.600]   and then to his father Jacob.
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.720]   And now when I grow up, when I reach a certain age,
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.800]   I will receive that blessing
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.840]   from the laying of hands of my father,
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.000]   and I am gonna become the leader,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.720]   or the patriarch of this whole clan,
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:05.720]   and I am going to be someone that others respect.
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.240]   People would pay attention to what I say,
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.240]   I would inherit a big fortune, I'll have my own servants,
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.600]   people will listen to me,
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.800]   and even other leaders in the region,
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.960]   they may want to make peace with me,
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.040]   I will become a powerful man.
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.760]   That was supposed to be his future,
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:24.240]   that was his trajectory, but that was gone
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.360]   the moment he reached that pit.
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:30.640]   And all that he could grasp right now
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:34.120]   is just the dry, dirty mud in that pit.
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:38.200]   So in those days, family was actually
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:42.640]   more than just a source of nurture or provision,
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.440]   it was the foundational social structure
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.720]   that guaranteed security and survival,
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.640]   that's why they stay as a big clan, as a big family.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.640]   Family is not just your daddy and mommy,
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:53.680]   and brothers and sisters,
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:56.920]   it's normally a big group of people living together,
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:00.320]   that's what a family looked like in those days.
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.840]   It's a social structure that makes sure
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.640]   people are safe, they can survive,
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:08.440]   and the family was a primary unit of subsistence.
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:13.240]   And all family functions served the goal of survival.
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:18.200]   What an irony it was that Joseph's very own family,
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:22.360]   those meant to provide him with security and survival,
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.320]   they're the one instead who condemned him
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.040]   to suffering and slavery.
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:32.920]   They're supposed to give him survival and security,
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.560]   but now instead they gave him slavery,
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:35.760]   they gave him suffering.
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.680]   I guess some of us in this room,
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.800]   we could have similar experience
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:46.320]   of being stuck in a pit, a place of loss in our lives.
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.040]   It could be perhaps a financial loss
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:52.120]   that is so great that you know you cannot recover from,
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.480]   or maybe it could be a loss of health,
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.760]   you know you're in a serious sickness,
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:00.560]   or maybe you lost someone that is so dear to your heart,
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:04.160]   or maybe like Joseph, you experienced betrayal
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.840]   by those who were so close to you,
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.640]   and you lost the ability to trust people again
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.280]   in that experience.
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:17.920]   I think what made this narrative,
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:21.120]   the narrative of Joseph so relatable,
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:24.040]   was the fact that if you read this chapter,
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.440]   chapter 37 of Genesis,
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:30.360]   God's name was not even mentioned once.
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:34.760]   In all the chaos, when all the chaos unfolded,
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:37.560]   you don't see God's name, you don't see what he was doing,
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.480]   you don't see him move.
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.840]   It was as though he was silent.
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:45.080]   He was hiding behind the curtain,
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:48.880]   pretty much like what you and I might have felt
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:51.720]   when we were stuck in our own pit,
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.840]   when our world was falling apart
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.480]   and you were asking questions like,
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.280]   "Where's God?
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.800]   "Why is this happening to me?"
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:07.160]   And the awkward, simple truth here is this, church,
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.080]   if you ever ask that question,
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:13.280]   when God is with us,
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.600]   it doesn't mean bad things can't happen.
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:20.240]   I hope you have made peace with this truth in your life.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.640]   Let me say that again.
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.480]   When God is with us,
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.840]   it doesn't mean bad things can't happen.
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:33.120]   But the story of Joseph should remind us
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.760]   that the flip side of it, the opposite, is also true.
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.960]   When bad things happen,
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.920]   it doesn't mean God is not with us.
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:46.800]   If we could embrace this truth,
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.560]   if we could live with it, if we could wrestle with it,
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:53.080]   I believe it's gonna get us out of
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:56.200]   some very difficult situations in life.
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.320]   And spoiler alert, for the story of Joseph
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.400]   and for our own lives,
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.120]   it's true in all human life
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.800]   that the presence of God
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:07.360]   and the presence of troubles in life,
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.320]   they're never mutually exclusive.
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:13.520]   Presence of God, all my troubles,
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.440]   they coexist perfectly in our lives.
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.400]   Isn't that true?
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.520]   Isn't that true for you?
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:24.160]   But church, we should know one thing.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.840]   The reading and the understanding
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.880]   of the entire story of Joseph
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:31.600]   should give us confidence about one thing,
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.080]   that the presence of God is right there
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.880]   with Joseph in that pit,
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.640]   even though it wasn't mentioned in the Bible.
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.680]   And likewise, his presence,
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.840]   it's also right here with you
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.480]   when you are in your pit.
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:48.280]   That's what we need to know.
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.640]   That's what we need assurance of today,
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.480]   walking away from the story of Joseph.
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.320]   But church, there's something else
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.200]   we need to recognize from the story.
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.760]   Joseph is not the only person
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:02.960]   who is stuck here.
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.640]   Yeah, his 10 brothers,
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.760]   they might be seated outside the pit,
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:10.160]   but they were just equally stuck
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.200]   in this dysfunctional family.
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.760]   To be specific,
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.880]   they were stuck in the hurt
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.280]   and the brokenness
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.400]   caused by their father's favoritism
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.720]   towards Joseph.
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.280]   And so they were stuck in jealousy.
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:26.320]   They were stuck in resentment,
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.840]   their aggressive behavior towards Joseph
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:29.880]   was evident,
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:32.920]   that there are unresolved issues in their life,
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.600]   and their insecurity,
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.720]   their feelings of unworthiness,
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.240]   or maybe I'm not worthy of my father's love.
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.640]   These are the issues going on in their hearts.
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.800]   And they have been carrying that
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.120]   with them inside all along.
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:49.360]   When they failed to earn their father's love,
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:53.320]   instead of addressing it directly with their father,
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:56.400]   they displace their anger
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.600]   and frustration on Joseph.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.240]   They let it out on him.
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.240]   Hey, it's you.
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.760]   You are the one who took away that daddy's love.
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.480]   So we're doing this to you.
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.480]   They displace that kind of feeling on Joseph.
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:13.320]   And sometimes I realized in my life,
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.480]   harboring bad feelings,
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.880]   harboring negative feelings,
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.920]   emotions, keeping them to ourselves,
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.600]   it's so much easier than to talking about it
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.160]   and resolving it with a person
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:26.640]   or people who are concerned, right?
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:29.840]   And yet these feelings,
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:30.840]   sooner or later,
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:33.000]   they start to manifest in our speech.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.600]   Would you like to go to lunch?
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.560]   Oh, go to lunch,
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.200]   depends on who, with whom.
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:42.120]   It's somehow, it will come out in your language,
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:43.640]   come out in your gesture,
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.800]   come out in your facial expression.
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.400]   It becomes your attitude,
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:48.640]   becomes your behavior.
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:49.880]   You will show it.
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:53.520]   We call it passive aggressive sometimes.
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:56.560]   And then it could become verbal violence,
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.080]   verbal abuse,
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:59.480]   gets worse,
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.000]   becomes physical violence,
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.920]   different kinds of violence or abuse.
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.640]   If we let that feeling,
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:08.720]   let that emotions harbor deep inside of our hearts,
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:09.760]   sooner or later,
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.200]   it's gonna affect what's inside here
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.960]   and affects what's outside,
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:14.800]   what we're doing,
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.280]   what we're saying.
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:18.280]   And we could be stuck for years
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.920]   in a brokenness
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.400]   or the patterns of thoughts and behaviors
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:25.320]   due to an unhealthy relationship
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:29.600]   or due to some sort of emotional brokenness we experience.
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:31.680]   But church, we need to know this.
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:33.840]   There is no shame to admit
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:37.960]   that we're stuck in emotional or relational brokenness.
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.320]   There is no shame.
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:40.360]   Why?
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.600]   'Cause we all experienced that.
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.560]   We all had those problems.
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:46.800]   Well, I'm not saying that we should have a party
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.040]   and compare our sufferings,
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:48.880]   our brokenness,
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.000]   we don't have to do that.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.440]   But we can just share with people
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.040]   as a broken person to another broken person,
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.720]   hey, this is what I've been through.
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:58.560]   Oh yes,
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.400]   maybe I haven't been through the exact same thing,
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.400]   but I know what it is to be heartbroken.
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.160]   So I'm here for you.
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.400]   I'm here to support you.
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.520]   We don't need to compare,
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:10.080]   but it's okay to admit,
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:15.080]   it's okay to tell people about our own emotional brokenness
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:17.400]   or relational brokenness.
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:22.160]   Or what some psychological professionals,
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:25.400]   they would call this unfinished business in our lives.
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.200]   The story of the sons of Jacob,
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.080]   it's a perfect reminder for us
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:32.800]   to be self-aware of how we might have been
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:35.040]   emotionally wounded in the past
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:38.520]   and how it might be still affecting us right now.
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:44.920]   But I do want to point out the hope in this tragic story.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.080]   Behind the brothers' plan to harm Joseph
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.480]   lie the two dreams of Joseph.
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:53.080]   Everybody bowing, in the family bowing,
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.040]   and they hated that dream so much,
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:57.680]   they even start calling him, oh, this dreamer.
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:00.000]   And they even said when they try to harm him,
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:00.840]   when they try to kill him,
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:04.000]   they said, let's see what's happened to those dreams.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.840]   They were so angry about what's gonna happen
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:11.480]   if those dreams would come to pass.
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.000]   And they tried to stop that,
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   but they could never imagine that the very plans
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.440]   that they were scheming to stop those dreams
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:23.240]   were actually the same plans
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:26.080]   that lead to the fulfillment of those dreams.
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:28.960]   Because they decided to sell him to someone,
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.040]   and then Joseph ended up in Egypt,
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:32.880]   and then he ended up become the prime minister
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.640]   or the number two of the country.
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:38.640]   And then they had to come for food and come and buy food,
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.960]   and so they had to bow down before him.
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.360]   It was their own doing.
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.960]   They tried to stop that dream from coming true,
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:49.480]   but then their own plans made that dream come true.
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.800]   But that's not all.
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:57.520]   So this is what Joseph told his brothers in chapter 50,
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:58.720]   towards the end of the story,
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.520]   which Pastor Tim read to us last week.
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:04.760]   He says, "You intended," you meaning the brothers,
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:08.600]   "You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:11.680]   "to accomplish what is now being done,
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:15.560]   "the saving of many lives."
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.960]   The beauty in this sentence
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:22.200]   is that those many lives that were saved
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.880]   actually included the very lives of the 10 brothers.
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.480]   What does that mean?
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:31.760]   In other words, these emotionally broken,
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:35.480]   wicked, violent people were included
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:38.800]   in God's salvation plan through the very person
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.280]   they tried to harm and kill.
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.400]   They tried to do something bad,
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:47.440]   but their action actually became part of God's plan
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:49.320]   to bring forth salvation,
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.760]   not just for Joseph or those good people,
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:54.960]   but even for these bad people themselves.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:58.960]   So I'm confident that even in our emotional brokenness,
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.880]   in our relational brokenness,
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:05.040]   even when we're affected by those brokenness nowadays,
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.520]   maybe we have harmed people around us,
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.280]   maybe we have hurt people around us,
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:13.600]   but even when we are unconsciously doing that,
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:16.520]   we're still part of God's plan of salvation.
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:17.920]   God is still in charge.
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:22.640]   He's still doing something to help, to rescue, to heal.
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.320]   We're never out of His plan.
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:26.720]   He's still here for us.
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.800]   He's still here with us,
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:33.800]   and that's the good news in this broken, this tragic story.
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:38.040]   But I must say that that doesn't give us permission
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:40.360]   to harm anyone in our own brokenness.
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.200]   Please don't go away saying,
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.480]   "Oh, Pastor Chapman said this,
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.920]   "so I don't think it's a problem if I hurt you today."
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.160]   Please don't go out and do that, all right?
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:51.240]   I may lose my job, but so don't do that.
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:53.880]   Don't go out and say, "Okay, now I can harm people freely
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:55.480]   "'cause I have my own brokenness."
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.400]   No, the point is not that.
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:01.920]   The point is, it's not the permission
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:04.320]   that we can get to harm people in our brokenness.
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:07.520]   The point is that it should gives us reassurance
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:10.400]   to the hope in our Savior
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.680]   that whatever we're going through,
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:13.760]   whatever mess we're in right now,
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.240]   He can still bring healing,
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.000]   He can still bring restoration,
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.880]   and He's gonna still transform us into a new creation,
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.120]   and that's the point of this story.
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:23.480]   Can I get an amen for that?
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:26.300]   Okay, that's good.
[00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:27.760]   I think I can keep my job.
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:30.080]   All right, let's finish up this story.
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:34.800]   Again, I'm just gonna paraphrase these next 20 verses.
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:37.640]   So in the end, the brothers didn't kill Joseph.
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:42.520]   Judah actually came up with an idea to sell him.
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:43.680]   The rest is history.
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:47.040]   They decided to move along with that plan,
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:50.080]   and they earned two years of wage,
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:52.480]   two years of shepherds' wage,
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.360]   and so they took his rope,
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.160]   dip it into some animal blood,
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:57.400]   took it back to the father and say,
[00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:00.840]   "Oh, dad, our younger brother is dead.
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:03.480]   "Some animal ate him."
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.600]   And the father bought it and said,
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.960]   "Oh, my son is dead, my son."
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.720]   And he was in his grief.
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.700]   He was so sad, he was crying,
[00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:16.740]   to a point that the Bible says he refused to be comforted.
[00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:18.400]   When his children come and try to comfort him,
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.040]   they said, "No, I don't want your comfort."
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:24.720]   Here we have the third person
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:29.080]   or the third party being stuck in grief,
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:30.320]   and that's Jacob.
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:36.200]   But Jacob, he's not only stuck in his grief.
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:39.880]   There was something else that he was actually stuck in.
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:45.000]   You see, if we look at the wider picture
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.780]   of the Genesis narrative,
[00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:50.640]   we would begin to see the family history
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.880]   of Joseph and Jacob and the father and the grandfather,
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.440]   and we would actually see this.
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.680]   Can I have the next slide, please?
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.680]   So we have Joseph and his brothers.
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:02.600]   We know that Jacob is showing favoritism
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:05.320]   to Joseph and neglect his brothers.
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:08.000]   But if we look one level up,
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.480]   we have Isaac with the two sons, Jacob and Esau.
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.840]   And we know that Isaac, as the father,
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.360]   he actually loves Esau,
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:18.920]   and the mother, Rebecca,
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:20.600]   whose name is not here on the board right now,
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.820]   but he actually loves Jacob.
[00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:26.560]   They each show favoritism towards one kid.
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:31.120]   And so that means Jacob, ever since he was born,
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:35.200]   he grew up in a family that's been showing favoritism.
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.560]   That's all he knew about a family.
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:39.320]   Family has always been like that.
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.980]   You love one kid, you hate the other.
[00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:43.840]   But that's not the end of the story.
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:45.440]   Let's go up one more level.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:46.680]   We have Isaac.
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:49.120]   Isaac actually has a brother called Ishmael.
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:51.680]   If you know the story of Abraham,
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.480]   God promised him, would give him a son.
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.520]   Abraham, like, I can't wait, I can't wait.
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:57.760]   I believe you, but I can't wait,
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.320]   so I'm gonna make a son on my own.
[00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:02.160]   And ta-da, we have Ishmael.
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:04.280]   And after only 13 years, God says,
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.440]   no, no, no, no, no, Ishmael is not the kid
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:09.320]   I'm gonna give you, I'm gonna give you this Isaac.
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:11.400]   And so Isaac was, ta-da, was born,
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:14.100]   and then they push Ishmael away.
[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:19.140]   The moment Isaac was born, he experienced favoritism.
[00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:22.800]   So what we see here, it's what we call
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:27.800]   a generational pattern of favoritism,
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:31.360]   or a generational pattern of brokenness.
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:34.160]   You see, this favoritism actually passed down
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:38.880]   through generations, and Jacob, being born in a family,
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:42.220]   that favoritism has been the norm for generations.
[00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:46.200]   For him, of course, if Joseph and the brothers
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:49.320]   are suffering from him, that's a guarantee,
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:52.020]   because that's how it runs in the family.
[00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:56.080]   We're seeing this brokenness in every single generation
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:56.920]   in this family.
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:59.640]   So Jacob and all his sons right now,
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:04.320]   they're actually stuck in this kind of generational pattern
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:05.800]   of brokenness.
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:11.440]   But nonetheless, God still call himself,
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:14.480]   I'm the God of Abraham, I'm the God of Isaac,
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.600]   I'm the God of Jacob.
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:20.600]   Every generation, I am their God, I will be with them.
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:23.180]   I'm here, my salvation is with them.
[00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:25.200]   My plans are not done with them yet.
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.960]   I know my plans for them.
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:29.760]   It's not plans to harm them, it's the plans to prosper them.
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:32.560]   Every single generation, every single one in the family,
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:35.640]   even those who were cast away from the family,
[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:39.040]   they were still taken good care of by God.
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:41.840]   God still send angels to supply their needs
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.680]   or give them places to live.
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:47.740]   God is still a good God to every single generation.
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:52.140]   So church, today, in one story,
[00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:55.160]   we three different stories of brokenness,
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:58.360]   or three different stories of being stuck.
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:01.780]   We have Joseph, he was stuck in a physical pit,
[00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:03.200]   he was physically stuck.
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:06.220]   He was stuck in a place where he lost everything.
[00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:09.040]   That pit symbolizes the loss in his life.
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:11.520]   Basically, he lost everything overnight.
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:15.900]   His status, his freedom, his future, his family,
[00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:19.120]   his friendships with his siblings, everything was gone,
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:21.480]   everything was stripped away from him overnight.
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:26.360]   We have someone who is stuck in a pit like that.
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:27.680]   We have a group of brothers,
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:30.320]   they were stuck in their emotional brokenness
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:33.000]   because of what they have experienced from their father
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.240]   or from their family.
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:38.360]   And this emotional brokenness manifested in a way
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:40.800]   that it becomes a harmful behavior.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:43.600]   It becomes aggressive, violent behavior
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:47.520]   towards someone they don't enjoy the company of.
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:51.440]   And we also see someone who is stuck
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:55.920]   in what we call generational pattern of brokenness.
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:32:01.520]   And I feel today, if we allow the Holy Spirit
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.320]   to come and speak to us,
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:06.320]   if we allow him to come and talk to us,
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:07.880]   if we try to listen to his voice
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:10.480]   like we learned last week from Pastor John,
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:14.200]   I think maybe he would gently remind us
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:18.040]   where we may be at in one of these three buckets.
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.240]   Maybe somewhere we're stuck.
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:23.240]   Maybe we're stuck in our own loss in our lives.
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:26.840]   We're stuck in past experience like betrayals.
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:30.740]   We've been stuck with things that we have lost.
[00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:33.980]   Maybe we're stuck in all this emotional hurt in the past
[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:36.760]   that is still affecting us right now.
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:40.200]   Maybe it changed our attitude towards other people.
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:44.580]   Maybe now I can't fully 100% trust anyone around me.
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:49.480]   Maybe now I'm a little bit hostile towards people,
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:51.240]   just normal people I've never met,
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:53.120]   but my default right now,
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:56.560]   it's being slightly more on the hostile end
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:58.560]   rather than the friendly side
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:00.480]   because of my past experience.
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:02.960]   I allow my experience in the past,
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:06.160]   those harmful, hurtful experience to reshape who I am today.
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:09.440]   Or perhaps we're from families
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:13.480]   that struggles with generational curse,
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:17.440]   generational sin, generational patterns of brokenness.
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:20.340]   Being here in Asia is one of the good example.
[00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:22.880]   We have been living in a culture
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:25.440]   that we like male more than female.
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:28.080]   I'm so sorry for all the lovely sisters in the room.
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:30.480]   You all are perfect and amazing,
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:32.560]   but we're in a very broken culture here.
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:36.360]   We value guys more than girls
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:38.240]   just because guys can go out and work,
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:39.800]   do more like hard work in the past
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:42.760]   and they can earn a little bit more income for the family.
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:48.360]   But we pass that idea down every generation.
[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.920]   I know maybe in Chinese culture,
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:52.840]   I know there are women, they were born
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:55.120]   and they were not liked
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:58.600]   'cause their parents only wanted a son.
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:01.300]   But when it came out, oh, it's a daughter.
[00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:03.280]   They would even name their daughter
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:07.160]   with a Chinese character that symbolizes brother
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:10.480]   to express their wish of having a son.
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:14.920]   We know how all these generational weird ideas
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:17.280]   have been affecting maybe every family
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:21.680]   have their own stories and some families particularly.
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:24.600]   I know addictions could pass down through families.
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:27.400]   I know there are bad things that could pass down,
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:29.080]   poverty that can pass down through families,
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:32.440]   but when we're stuck there,
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:34.560]   we need to know there is good news.
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:37.480]   We need to know the same God who is with Abraham,
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:40.120]   with Isaac, with Jacob, with Joseph.
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:43.320]   He's even right now here with us through his Holy Spirit
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:46.880]   because we have come back to him through Jesus Christ.
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:49.640]   He's with us, he's for us,
[00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:53.460]   and he's determined to change that, to transform us
[00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:56.360]   so that we would become born again, new creation.
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.620]   He's determined to do that.
[00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:04.040]   And so I wonder where you are today, church, my friends,
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:06.420]   whether you're like Joseph being stuck in a place
[00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:09.200]   because of your loss in your life,
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:10.520]   or maybe you're stuck in a place
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:15.520]   where past emotional hurts, sufferings have shaped you.
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:18.560]   You know there are some things inside of you,
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:19.520]   you were not like that,
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:21.100]   but because you experienced certain things,
[00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:24.080]   now you behave a certain way, you say things certain way,
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.480]   and you know that's not you.
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:30.800]   Or maybe there are things even from a broader source,
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.400]   tradition from generations or culture
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:34.320]   that's been passed down,
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:36.320]   and you just accepted those values,
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:38.640]   or maybe you don't even like those values.
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:40.280]   Maybe you even think that doesn't make sense,
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:42.680]   but somehow you don't know being part of the family
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:45.640]   means you have to believe that, you have to hold on to that.
[00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:51.660]   I think today God wants to set us free from any of those.
[00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:58.380]   I think today if we come before him with all our hearts,
[00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:01.300]   if we come before him knowing that there's no shame
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:02.600]   to admit our brokenness,
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:05.340]   there's no shame to admit that we're stuck,
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:10.120]   and even inviting his Holy Spirit into our hearts,
[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:13.040]   I believe he's gonna do something amazing here today
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:15.120]   for you and for me.
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:17.040]   Shall we pray?
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:28.880]   I just wanna divide a prayer time today
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:33.280]   into three different sections for each of the scenario
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:35.420]   or each of the buckets of,
[00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:38.000]   pockets of people that we need to pray for.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.400]   First, I would love to pray for all you guys can remain,
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.640]   you know, eyes closed.
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:49.360]   Let's just have this space and time for God to work in us.
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:51.760]   If any one of you, you know that's you,
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:54.460]   you have suffered something, you have suffered a loss,
[00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:59.180]   any kind of loss, you know you're stuck in a pit,
[00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:01.520]   like Joseph, something that is precious,
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:04.140]   that is important to you have been taken away.
[00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:06.000]   Now you're in a place of loss.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.880]   Maybe now your life is in chaos,
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:15.200]   maybe your health, your finance, your job,
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.720]   your family, relationships,
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:18.560]   someone who is very important to you,
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:21.280]   you know, without that,
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.740]   now your life is in a bit of a chaos.
[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:29.600]   I want you to know that even though
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:33.360]   in the story of Joseph in chapter 37,
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:36.220]   God's name was never mentioned once,
[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:38.820]   it does not change the fact that he's there with him
[00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:40.740]   and he's here with you right now.
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:46.540]   Even with God in your life,
[00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:51.120]   bad things can happen, do happen.
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:55.820]   But then at the same time, even when bad things happen,
[00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:58.260]   it doesn't change the fact that God is with you.
[00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:03.440]   So if you know that is you
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:04.960]   and you would like to be prayed for,
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:09.000]   I just simply ask you to open your hands.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.440]   It's as though you're receiving something from God,
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:14.800]   it's just a gesture, it's nothing fancy or special,
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:16.720]   it's just a simple gesture of heart
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:19.220]   that God, I wanna receive your presence right now.
[00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:28.400]   Holy Spirit, I pray you would just gently come upon
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:32.780]   all those who yearn for you right now.
[00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:36.880]   Say, God, I know I've been through some mess in my life,
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:39.320]   I'm in a pit right now, but I know,
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:43.800]   or I want to know, I want to experience that right in my pit
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:46.600]   that your presence is with me.
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:50.600]   Father, I pray that you would make your presence known
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:55.600]   to these friends and brothers and sisters today
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:39:00.240]   or in the coming days and weeks,
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:02.720]   you would fill them with your presence.
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:06.000]   They would know having that assurance,
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.160]   knowing that you are there with them.
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:15.520]   I pray for your comfort, I pray for your strength for them.
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:22.720]   Now, the second group of people,
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:27.720]   maybe you know you've been emotionally hurt in the past,
[00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:29.920]   things that have been said over you,
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.640]   people, whatever they've done over you,
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:36.040]   you know you're hurt and you know that actually changed
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:37.880]   something inside of your heart.
[00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:39.800]   You know that emotional brokenness,
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:42.320]   actually, it has an effect on you.
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:46.300]   The way you think, the way you feel, the way you react,
[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:48.700]   the way you hang out with people,
[00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:51.280]   the way you say things or do things in your life,
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:55.920]   you know, and God is willing to heal you today
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:57.480]   if you are willing to let him.
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:02.440]   So if that's you, I just gently invite you to,
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:06.640]   you can open up your hands or in any way,
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:09.440]   you just note, you just indicate that to God and say,
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.280]   "God, I want your healing today.
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:13.480]   "I don't want to let this or that event
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:15.120]   "or what that person did to me,
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:17.080]   "I don't want that to define who I am.
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:18.200]   "I don't want that to define
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:19.640]   "how I'm gonna treat other people.
[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:22.800]   "I don't want to let that define how I'm gonna treat myself
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:23.960]   "from now on."
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:30.160]   And so Father, I just pray for your healing
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.520]   over them right now.
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:35.520]   Come Lord Jesus.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.480]   Come and make the broken heart whole again.
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:53.040]   I pray for your shallow,
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:57.680]   the wholeness.
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:03.500]   I pray for the soul of the hearts today in Jesus' name.
[00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:08.680]   Last but not least, I want to pray for,
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:12.320]   if you know you are suffering from what I've explained
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:15.960]   as the generational pattern of brokenness,
[00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:18.760]   or you know there are generational sin in your family,
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:21.560]   I know sin is a big word, but bear with me for a moment.
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:24.720]   If you know there are things going on in your family,
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:26.640]   like in your parents' generation,
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:29.040]   your parents' parents' parents' parents' generation,
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:31.880]   and you actually know something is going on,
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:36.000]   and something is undesirable, you know it's wrong,
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.720]   you know it's unbiblical, you know it's a sin,
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:40.180]   if you know that, I encourage you,
[00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:43.640]   you can bring that to God today.
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:45.360]   You can simply say, "Dear God,
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:51.200]   "I know in my family, my ancestors,
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:55.800]   "they have done this, or they have believed this,"
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:58.860]   and you can fill in the blanks for whatever that is.
[00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:07.240]   I know that was sinful, I know that was not right.
[00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:13.160]   So in Jesus' name, I renounce that in my family today.
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:18.440]   In the name of Jesus, I declare that from today onwards,
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:21.120]   in my life, I'm not gonna pass that on
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:22.720]   to the next generation.
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:27.720]   It ends today in my family, in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:33.000]   Let's continue to pray and worship.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.580]   (gentle music)
[00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:38.160]   (gentle music)
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:48.160]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
