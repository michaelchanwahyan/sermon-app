1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
 Amen, amen.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,560
 Have a seat, have a seat.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,340
 We're continuing our series in Ephesians here this morning

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,620
 and as we do so, we come to what I consider

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,960
 the pivot passage in the whole of the book.

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,840
 There's a saying that says that big huge doors

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,460
 swing on small hinges.

8
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,980
 And we're only gonna be looking at, say,

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,100
 four verses of text this morning,

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,700
 but a big huge door swings on just this small hinge

11
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,700
 we're gonna be looking at.

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,500
 This pivot passage is found right in the heart

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,940
 of Paul's letter to his church in Ephesus.

14
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,620
 And if you were with us in the first week,

15
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,660
 you would have heard me talk about how I think Paul

16
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,860
 structures the letter into two halves.

17
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,340
 There's the half of grace and the half of peace.

18
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,740
 The first three chapters is Paul's way of sort of saying,

19
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,340
 here's all the things that Christ has done in his grace.

20
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,300
 The first three chapters are a theological treaties

21
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,320
 of the grace and the wonder and the power

22
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,340
 of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.

23
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,580
 It's one of the most profound things.

24
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,540
 And over the last number of weeks of this series,

25
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,300
 we've preached through almost verse by verse

26
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,700
 all the things that Paul is teaching to his church

27
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,260
 about the grace of Christ.

28
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,260
 It's a deep and rich theology.

29
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,420
 But he's about to now move into the second half

30
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,140
 of the letter from chapters four to six,

31
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,440
 where he's gonna talk about peace and what it's like

32
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,820
 to now live out of this grace that he's just talked about.

33
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,340
 And he's gonna challenge them with some pretty tough words.

34
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,340
 He's gonna talk about what it is to be in marriage,

35
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,060
 what it is to be parents, what it is to be children.

36
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,480
 He's gonna talk about the unity that he's expecting

37
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,060
 to see in the church.

38
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,820
 He's gonna talk about the need for the armor of God

39
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,100
 so that we can be equipped and fully ready

40
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,900
 for all the attacks that are gonna happen

41
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,100
 in the spiritual realm out there.

42
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,580
 He's got some pretty important things to say

43
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,820
 about practical Christian living,

44
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,020
 but he's finding himself in the passage

45
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,340
 we're looking at this week between the two.

46
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:07,740
 It's like he said, here's all the stuff that Christ has done.

47
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,140
 Here's how you should now live.

48
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,820
 But before we get there, we need to stop.

49
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:17,300
 And Paul realizes before he gets to what he wants to say

50
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,740
 in chapters four to six, he has to first pray.

51
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,460
 And he has to pray because Paul understands

52
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,620
 that there is no way we can move from a theology

53
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,400
 to a living out in the way that Paul has a vision

54
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,400
 for his church without that being a sovereign move of God.

55
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,620
 It's gotta be the work of the spirit.

56
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,980
 All the theology that he's just talked about,

57
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,500
 as important as that is, as important as good,

58
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,700
 sound doctrine is, it's not gonna do much to help us

59
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,740
 to move into being the people of God.

60
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,620
 He realizes that's a move of the spirit.

61
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,940
 That's gotta be a move of the heart of God,

62
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,340
 restoring and changing his people.

63
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,020
 And so he's like, before I get there, we need to stop.

64
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,920
 And you need to let me pray for you,

65
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,340
 he's saying to the church.

66
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,900
 You need to let me pray for you

67
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,220
 because this is not a work of me.

68
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,600
 It's not a work of a pastor.

69
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,020
 This is not a work of a church.

70
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,700
 The only way this is gonna happen

71
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,340
 is if the spirit of God does something

72
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,500
 that I cannot do, Paul is saying to the church.

73
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,860
 So before we get on to talking about all this stuff,

74
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,300
 we first have to pray.

75
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:28,220
 We have to ask that God would come in his power

76
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:33,140
 and transform us from the inside out, he says.

77
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:37,080
 Oh, look at all this crazy, beautiful grace

78
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,800
 that Christ has given us.

79
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,920
 Look at how we should live.

80
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,320
 But if it doesn't happen in here,

81
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,320
 none of it is worth anything.

82
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:52,200
 Paul understands that we have to be encountered

83
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,920
 before we can be an encounter.

84
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,640
 He knows that we have to be deeply transformed

85
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,500
 before we can hope to be a transforming agent

86
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,480
 of the spirit of God in the world.

87
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,520
 And so he prays, and boy, does he pray.

88
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,600
 He prays one of the most passionate,

89
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,380
 one of the most heartfelt, one of the most deepest,

90
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,000
 one of the most profound prayers

91
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,280
 that we find in the whole of the New Testament.

92
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,040
 'Cause for Paul, this is where the rubber hits the road.

93
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,800
 This is where life really matters.

94
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,720
 And he desperately wants to see his church alive.

95
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,240
 This is the pastoral presence of Paul for his people.

96
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,240
 Oh, if only Christ would come and fill you with his love.

97
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,120
 I'm also quite passionate about this prayer

98
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,920
 in case you haven't realized so far.

99
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,920
 And the reason being is because everything

100
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,680
 that Paul prays in this prayer is exactly

101
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,120
 what would be on my heart for you here at the Vine.

102
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,400
 In fact, our whole vision here at the Vine,

103
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,000
 which is growing big people,

104
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,160
 the idea that whether you're with us for two weeks,

105
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,080
 two months, two years, two decades,

106
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,280
 we want you to grow in Christ Jesus.

107
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,120
 We want you to mature in your relationship with him

108
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,640
 so that you can come to the full measure,

109
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,960
 the fullness of Christ,

110
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,320
 as Paul's about to teach us in Ephesians 4.

111
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,560
 But before he gets there, before we get there in this series,

112
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,360
 we have to pause and we have to realize

113
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,040
 that the prayer that he prays

114
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,000
 captures the heart of that vision.

115
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,440
 Without this prayer, that vision is nothing.

116
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,280
 With this prayer, that vision can come.

117
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,000
 This is why, funnily enough,

118
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,340
 I'm emotionally connected to this today

119
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:29,320
 because at the very first Sunday that I became senior pastor,

120
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,700
 the 3rd of November, 2013,

121
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,280
 it was this passage that I chose to preach from.

122
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,800
 And I preached from this passage

123
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,120
 because it was a summary of my heart to you at the church.

124
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,400
 And some 11 years later,

125
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,760
 as I'm unpacking this for myself again

126
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,040
 over the last month or so,

127
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,720
 as I'm preparing for this message,

128
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,400
 that same heart resonates inside of me.

129
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,040
 If there's one thing I want for you,

130
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,080
 it is these verses that we're looking at here today.

131
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,480
 And so as we teach this, as I open it up,

132
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,960
 as I do my best to perhaps show you

133
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,240
 what I think was on Paul's heart for his church,

134
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,920
 and you get a glimpse of what I think

135
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,720
 is on God's heart for you,

136
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,840
 my prayer is that this isn't just some teaching.

137
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,000
 My prayer is that there is an impartation

138
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,120
 that takes place for you from the heart of the Father

139
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,080
 for what he has in your life.

140
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,100
 I believe that there is so much

141
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,320
 of what Ellison spoke about just a moment ago,

142
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,800
 this idea of him coming and meeting us in our hearts

143
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,880
 that he wants for us.

144
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,600
 This is why we do the Vine.

145
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,400
 Not so you would come here and be tickled in your ears

146
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,440
 and entertained on a Sunday,

147
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,240
 but so that the Spirit of God

148
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,140
 would transform you from the inside out.

149
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,920
 Amen? - Amen.

150
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,960
 - So I wanna read you this prayer,

151
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,800
 but I'm gonna do it in a way that we don't normally do here.

152
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,120
 I want to actually pray it over you.

153
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,560
 I'd love for you to stand with me.

154
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,520
 Would you stand?

155
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,200
 And if you're comfortable,

156
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,280
 I'd invite you just to close your eyes,

157
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,220
 and you can open your hands before you,

158
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:03,640
 because this is Paul's prayer for his church,

159
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,500
 but it is also our prayer for you.

160
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:12,560
 For this reason, I kneel before the Father

161
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,280
 from whom his whole family in heaven and on earth

162
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,500
 derives its name, and here's what I pray.

163
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:24,000
 I pray that out of his glorious riches,

164
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,720
 he may strengthen you with power

165
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,860
 through his Spirit in your inner being.

166
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,860
 I'm gonna pray that again for you.

167
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,320
 This is what we want for you here at The Vine.

168
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,360
 We pray that out of God's glorious riches,

169
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,880
 he may strengthen you with the power

170
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,960
 through his Spirit in your inner being,

171
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,440
 so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith.

172
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,240
 And we pray that you who are rooted and established in love

173
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,840
 may have the power together with everybody in this room

174
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,040
 to grasp how wide and long and high and deep

175
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,820
 is the love of Christ, and to know this love

176
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,820
 that surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled

177
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:12,820
 to the fullness, the full measure of the fullness of God.

178
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:17,660
 In Jesus' name, everyone says, have a seat.

179
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,180
 When was the last time somebody prayed that prayer,

180
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,140
 a prayer like that over you?

181
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,580
 When was the last time you prayed a prayer like that?

182
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:27,600
 When was the last time I prayed a prayer like that?

183
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,220
 What a stunning heart, pastoral heart Paul has

184
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,020
 for his people.

185
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,940
 I love how he begins the prayer.

186
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,580
 He does something that was not done in that time.

187
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,900
 He says, I bow my knee, or I get on my knees

188
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,900
 before the Father.

189
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,820
 Now, here in modern Christianity days,

190
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,540
 we think about being on our knees in prayer all the time.

191
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,900
 It's a very common thing in our time,

192
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,640
 but in the first century, it was a very uncommon thing.

193
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,620
 In fact, prayer, whether that was in the temple,

194
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,100
 or whether that was actually done in the house churches

195
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,500
 at the time, prayer was predominantly done standing,

196
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,500
 and standing with your arms stretched out

197
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,140
 towards the heavens.

198
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,780
 In fact, as a leader of the temple,

199
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:15,140
 or a leader in the church, this was the posture you prayed.

200
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,460
 Jesus spoke about this when he gave the parable

201
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,180
 of the tax collector and the Pharisee

202
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,700
 coming into the temple to pray.

203
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,380
 They're both pictured standing before the Lord,

204
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,880
 and they're raising their hands out,

205
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,180
 and they're acknowledging a confidence,

206
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,300
 and a faith, and a trust in God.

207
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,460
 That was the posture.

208
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,340
 But Paul flips it on its head,

209
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,220
 and he does something that was rare,

210
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,540
 and was hardly spoken about, hardly done in that time.

211
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,860
 He gets on his knees.

212
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:47,620
 Now, Paul does this because he has a deep and rich

213
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,980
 theological understanding of the Old Testament.

214
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,900
 Remember, he was a Hebrew of Hebrews,

215
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,800
 a Pharisee of Pharisees before he came to know Christ.

216
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,480
 And his deep rooting in the Old Testament,

217
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,480
 understanding of scripture and theology

218
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,820
 roots him even in this prayer.

219
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,640
 It's fascinating, in the Old Testament,

220
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,400
 the word bless is the Hebrew word barak.

221
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,440
 And barak actually comes in a number of different forms.

222
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,600
 In one particular form, barak actually is better translated

223
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,040
 to break yourself down, or to bend your knee.

224
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,720
 It's a posture of humility and surrender.

225
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,640
 One of the most famous places in the Old Testament

226
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,920
 that the word is used that way is Psalm 103, verse one,

227
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,360
 where it says, "Bless the Lord, O my soul,

228
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,960
 "and all that is within me, bless His holy name."

229
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,560
 When we normally read that, we think of this

230
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,000
 as a worship psalm, as a proclamation psalm,

231
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,520
 as if the psalmist is standing there

232
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,200
 with his hands open to the heavens,

233
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,980
 and saying, "Bless the Lord, O my soul,

234
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,080
 "and all that is within me, bless His holy name."

235
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,120
 In other words, worship and praise Him.

236
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,160
 But actually, the word barak here is in the cognate form

237
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,400
 that means to bend the knee.

238
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,440
 Here is what the psalmist is actually saying.

239
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,880
 He's saying, "Bend the knee, O my soul,

240
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,520
 "and all that is within me,

241
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,640
 "bend the knee to His holy name."

242
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,560
 In other words, this is a psalm not of worship,

243
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,520
 it's a psalm of holy surrender.

244
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,560
 It's a psalm of recognizing that we are nothing

245
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,340
 before the holiness of God.

246
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:23,100
 Paul starts his prayer in an uncommon posture.

247
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,300
 He blesses the Lord at the start by bending his knee,

248
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,620
 and what he's saying is, "God, this has nothing

249
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,420
 "to do with me.

250
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:37,060
 "I may be the pastor over these people

251
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,260
 "in this church in Ephesus,

252
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,340
 "but this has nothing to do with me.

253
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,380
 "It's not about my strength, it's not about my theology,

254
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,860
 "it's not about everything I know.

255
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:49,820
 "I bend my knee, everything within me bends itself now

256
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:54,540
 "to you because only you can do what I'm about to pray.

257
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,780
 "There's no strength within me,

258
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,540
 "there's no ability that I have.

259
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:02,080
 "Nothing can actually happen in my church

260
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,320
 "the way that I long to see it happen,

261
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,160
 "unless, God, there's a sovereign move of your spirit

262
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,180
 "so I will get on my knees."

263
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,820
 This is a radical thing,

264
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,500
 'cause he was expected to be standing

265
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,780
 and bold and strong, offering confidence before the Lord,

266
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,820
 and he says, "Before the whole church,

267
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,780
 "I declare I am nothing."

268
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:29,820
 He then prays to the Father, to the Father,

269
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,280
 which again, in our New Testament kind of Christian sense

270
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,460
 in this modern day and age, we understand that,

271
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,620
 but again, in his time, he's rooting that back

272
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,460
 to the Old Testament.

273
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,940
 We actually learned this in the Exodus series last year,

274
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,540
 where we saw that the first time God refers to himself

275
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,020
 as a father is in Exodus chapter four,

276
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,220
 where he's speaking through Moses and Aaron

277
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,980
 to speak to Pharaoh for the first time,

278
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,900
 and in that passage, he actually says, "Israel is my son."

279
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,860
 It's the first time that God actually uses the metaphor

280
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,100
 as a father over his people Israel.

281
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,780
 He declares that they are his son,

282
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,700
 making him the father of that nation.

283
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,700
 Now, here's the interesting thing.

284
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,540
 This happens just one chapter

285
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,860
 after Moses has come to God at the burning bush

286
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,220
 and said, "What is your name?

287
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,820
 "How do I refer to you?

288
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,300
 "How do I understand you?"

289
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,300
 And in that moment, God says, "I am that I am."

290
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:29,220
 The famous sacred name of God for the Jewish people

291
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,240
 is spoken in that time.

292
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,760
 We come to understand that as Yahweh.

293
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,620
 It's the L-O-R-D in capital letters in your Old Testament.

294
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,300
 Anytime you read that in your Old Testament,

295
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,340
 it's actually the sacred name that's being spoken,

296
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,940
 this Yahweh.

297
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,300
 I wanna show you how it's spelt in the Hebrew.

298
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,060
 It's spelt like this.

299
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,060
 They are two consonants,

300
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,500
 and these particular consonants are very unique

301
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,620
 in the Hebrew language.

302
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,460
 They're the only two consonants

303
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:03,100
 that when pronounced properly do not require you

304
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,300
 to move your mouth or to move your tongue,

305
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,900
 and they're specifically designed that way

306
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,620
 to be used in the sacred name

307
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,900
 so that when the sacred name is spoken,

308
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,820
 it's almost like you're inhaling and exhaling.

309
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,780
 It's almost like it's breath.

310
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:26,500
 Let me demonstrate by trying to pronounce it

311
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,460
 as best I can like this.

312
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:33,220
 (breathing heavily)

313
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,220
 (breathing heavily)

314
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,860
 Can you hear it?

315
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,940
 Okay, I want you all, don't move your mouth,

316
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,260
 don't move your tongue.

317
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,060
 I want you all now, breathe in.

318
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,340
 Breathe out.

319
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,180
 Keep going.

320
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,820
 Keep going.

321
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,540
 Stop, people are not doing it.

322
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:58,540
 Okay, we're gonna try it again.

323
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,660
 We're all gonna do it.

324
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,140
 Honestly, this will blow your mind.

325
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:02,980
 Breathe in.

326
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:06,780
 (breathing heavily)

327
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:11,060
 Can you hear it?

328
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:15,860
 The sacred name of the Lord, Yahweh,

329
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,020
 designed specifically to be like breath

330
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:22,020
 of which links in the Old Testament to his name,

331
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,620
 which Paul now links to him being a father,

332
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,820
 which is why he says every family on earth

333
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,540
 derives its name from this father.

334
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,380
 Yahweh.

335
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:38,460
 Because the very first word that ever came out of you

336
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,980
 was the sacred name of God.

337
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,660
 And the very last word that will ever come out of you

338
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:47,820
 before you die will be the sacred name of God.

339
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:52,460
 Your first breath, your last breath, you declared.

340
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,300
 Yahweh.

341
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:59,220
 And Paul is on his knees before his church

342
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,740
 and he knows the importance of what he's about to pray

343
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,660
 and it's like he takes a breath.

344
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,500
 Yahweh.

345
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:11,980
 And he centers himself before the father

346
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,060
 of who everybody derives his name.

347
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:18,260
 Anything that has ever taken its breath,

348
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:22,020
 connected to the one who is the sacred name,

349
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:25,540
 the I am that I am, the Lord Yahweh.

350
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,700
 We're connected in through that and he takes a moment,

351
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,940
 humble before his church, breathing in, breathing out,

352
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:35,140
 to then pray something for them.

353
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,420
 Isn't that amazing?

354
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:42,500
 Can you get a sense of Paul's pastoral heart for his people?

355
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,780
 He's like we're all connected to this God.

356
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,260
 We've been connected from the very beginning.

357
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:49,460
 We're still connected and here's what I pray

358
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,660
 that this God would do.

359
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:55,060
 He says I pray that out of his glorious riches,

360
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:59,460
 he would strengthen you with power through his spirit

361
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,500
 in your inner being.

362
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,780
 Is there not any more beautiful verse

363
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,780
 in the whole Bible than that?

364
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:09,300
 That he would strengthen you with power in your inner being

365
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,500
 out of his glorious riches.

366
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,500
 Paul starts here by saying this,

367
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,940
 out of his glorious riches,

368
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,700
 out of this incredible amount of love,

369
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,860
 this incredible amount of mercy,

370
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,300
 this incredible amount of grace,

371
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,660
 all the stuff that I've just been talking to you about,

372
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,100
 how you've been adopted into his family,

373
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:26,980
 not because you did anything,

374
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,300
 but just because he loved you,

375
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,140
 how he went to the cross to die for you,

376
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,260
 how he resurrected your dead spirit

377
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,220
 and made you alive by grace, not by works.

378
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,660
 All of that stuff, the glorious riches of a God

379
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,180
 who was willing to bring himself to this earth

380
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,980
 to die on your behalf 'cause he so loves you.

381
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,700
 Out of all of that work,

382
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,580
 I now pray that he would come and do something for you.

383
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:53,580
 Paul does not say out of my great life, I pray.

384
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:58,740
 He doesn't say out of the fact that I'm your pastor, I pray.

385
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,340
 He doesn't say it's got anything to do with me.

386
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:05,060
 He says out of his glorious riches, 'cause I am nothing.

387
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,100
 I'm even in prison, he's just told them in chapter three.

388
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,260
 He's like, I got nothing to offer you,

389
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:14,420
 but I know the glorious riches of Christ

390
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,540
 are overflowing with love.

391
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,380
 And it's out of the storehouse of his riches

392
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,780
 that I feel this ability to now pray

393
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,180
 that he would do something in your life.

394
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,460
 Oh, may that change your prayer life.

395
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:33,380
 You always have a reason to pray out of his glorious riches,

396
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,340
 out of his glorious riches for you.

397
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:40,340
 You have to understand that when he's saying this,

398
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,580
 what he's doing is he's rooting every move of the Spirit

399
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,180
 out of those glorious riches.

400
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,700
 I mean, think about this for a second.

401
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,620
 Anytime you have ever encountered the work of the Spirit

402
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:54,700
 in your life, it has happened for no other reason

403
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,940
 than the scandalous idea that God loves you.

404
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,820
 Have you thought about that?

405
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:05,820
 No other reason than the reality of his love for you.

406
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,740
 Anytime that there's been a move of the Spirit in your life,

407
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,420
 anytime you've opened the scriptures and they've come alive,

408
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:14,060
 anytime that you felt the wind of the Spirit in you,

409
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,780
 it's because he's saying, I love you.

410
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,140
 I love you, I love you, I chose you, I made you,

411
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,100
 I formed you, you're not perfect, but I love you.

412
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:26,300
 Out of his glorious riches,

413
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:30,380
 you have and are able to make your being.

414
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:34,100
 And out of this place, he says this,

415
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,780
 he says that you would be strengthened by power

416
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,900
 through his Spirit in your inner being.

417
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,100
 The idea of being strengthened in power here,

418
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,220
 it's not talking about,

419
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,500
 I hope that you will become a more powerful person.

420
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,740
 He's not getting Caesar or empire imagery here.

421
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,660
 He's not saying, I hope you become the best banker

422
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,700
 you could ever be, the best lawyer you could ever be.

423
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,740
 I hope you get much more wealth and prosperity

424
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,820
 and you enlarge the territory of your influence

425
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,300
 and you will be super powered.

426
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:05,700
 When he talks about being strengthened by power,

427
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,780
 what he's talking about is healing and restoration.

428
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:13,740
 He's talking about healing and restoration.

429
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,980
 But by the mere fact that he says my prayer for you

430
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,980
 out of the glorious riches of Christ

431
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,740
 is that his Spirit would work in you to strengthen you.

432
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,100
 What he's saying is all of us have areas of weakness,

433
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:23,940
 don't we?

434
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,700
 He's saying all of our hearts have somewhere

435
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,460
 where it's weak, our inner being is weak.

436
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,340
 This is his pastor, Oral Hartford's church.

437
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,420
 He's like, I know you.

438
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:37,500
 And I know that some of you are suffering with shame.

439
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,940
 Some of you are struggling with guilt.

440
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,900
 Some of you are overwhelmed in fear.

441
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,020
 I can see it in you.

442
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,580
 I can feel it in you, he's saying.

443
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,780
 And so my prayer is that out of the glorious riches

444
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,580
 of Christ, his Spirit would be at so much work in you

445
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,740
 that you would be strengthened where you're weak.

446
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,500
 You would be healed where you're weak.

447
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,500
 Where right now you're feeling fear,

448
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,420
 my prayer is that you would know power.

449
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:02,620
 Where you're feeling pain, my prayer is that you would have

450
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,260
 a healing and restoration in the area of your heart

451
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,540
 that feels pain.

452
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:09,180
 My gosh, he's saying, that you would only know

453
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,020
 that the Spirit of God could fill you completely.

454
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:17,620
 Again, he's linking back to Old Testament rooting here.

455
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,580
 He's saying, do you realize the move of the Spirit

456
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,020
 that's happened in redemptive history?

457
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,500
 At the beginning, the Spirit of God appears to Moses

458
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,940
 in a bush, then appears to Moses on a mountain,

459
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,460
 the fullness of God's presence on a mountain.

460
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,780
 Then it was found in the tabernacle,

461
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,900
 and God's people would crowd around the tabernacle

462
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,140
 and witness the power of God inside a tent.

463
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,020
 Once the temple was constructed, it was found

464
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,900
 in the Holy of Holies within the temple,

465
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,540
 this powerful sense of God's presence with his people.

466
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,260
 And his people would come into the temple,

467
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,980
 but they couldn't get too close because of his holiness.

468
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,420
 They had to stand on the outside.

469
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,940
 The only person that could go in was after a year

470
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,940
 of sacrifice to get himself ready to get in there.

471
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,140
 And then the Babylonians come in the sixth century,

472
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,300
 destroy the temple.

473
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,420
 God's people are in exile in Babylon.

474
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:06,180
 70 years later, they'll come back out of exile,

475
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:10,220
 and the prophets begin to speak again of God's Spirit.

476
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,020
 But now it's different.

477
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,620
 Where God's Spirit used to be in a mountain,

478
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,740
 in a bush, in a tabernacle, and in a temple,

479
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:21,020
 the prophets begin to speak of a new time.

480
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,900
 The best example is Ezekiel 36.

481
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,020
 I'm gonna read this to you.

482
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,740
 I will give you a new heart and a new spirit in you.

483
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,780
 I will remove from you the heart of stone

484
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,580
 and give you a heart of flesh.

485
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,940
 And I will put my Spirit in you and move you

486
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:38,140
 to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws.

487
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,380
 Ezekiel says, "A time is coming where God

488
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,580
 will no longer be on a mountain, in a tabernacle,

489
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,180
 in a temple, he'll be within you."

490
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:48,860
 And when he's within you, the stone,

491
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,500
 remember the law was given on the mountain in stone,

492
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,940
 "The stone of your heart will become like flesh," he says.

493
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,660
 And here's Paul years later going,

494
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,340
 "I've had that experience.

495
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,900
 I was on the road to Damascus.

496
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,180
 I was on my way to kill Christians,

497
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:06,020
 and I was so overwhelmed by the Spirit of God

498
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:10,660
 that inside my inner being, I was transformed forever."

499
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:13,660
 He wasn't there in the upper room at Pentecost,

500
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,140
 but he knows the stories from the disciples.

501
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,540
 And he knew that the Spirit of God had so poured out

502
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,300
 in power in Pentecost in the upper room

503
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,900
 that they began to speak in tongues

504
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,900
 and people came to faith and it was amazing.

505
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,100
 And here's Paul's prayer.

506
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,260
 He's saying, "That's what I want for you.

507
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:33,780
 I want you out of the glorious riches of Christ

508
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,820
 that you would so know inside of you,

509
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,820
 you would be strengthened with power

510
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,180
 by the Spirit in your inner being."

511
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:45,540
 He's saying, "Oh man, there is nothing more valuable

512
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,540
 in the world than that."

513
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:52,620
 I love Paul's pastoral prayer for his church.

514
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:55,540
 Paul does not pray for Johnny to stop smoking.

515
00:23:55,540 --> 00:24:00,340
 He doesn't pray for Anita to stop worrying.

516
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,140
 He doesn't pray for Jamie to finally deal

517
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,420
 with his porn habit.

518
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,420
 No, no, Paul's actually interested

519
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,140
 not in the surface of things.

520
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,580
 He's interested in the things that are much deeper than that

521
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:14,420
 because he knows that that's where God starts.

522
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,060
 And while it might be important to try to sort out

523
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,700
 some of those surface things,

524
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,620
 Paul's not praying for God to show up

525
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,580
 and give a band-aid to his church.

526
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,980
 He wants God to show up and do surgery

527
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,420
 in the lives and the heart of his church

528
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,980
 'cause he sees their brokenness.

529
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,300
 He sees their pain.

530
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,020
 He sees the hardness of their hearts at times.

531
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,220
 And he knows that he can't do anything about it.

532
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,540
 But out of the glorious riches of Christ,

533
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:41,300
 the Spirit might be able to come and transform his church

534
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:47,060
 so that they would know that they are so deeply loved

535
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:50,020
 and so deeply new people in him

536
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,740
 that their whole lives are changed.

537
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,020
 And they'll probably deal with that porn habit.

538
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:58,180
 Not out of some, "Oh my gosh, I better fix this thing

539
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,940
 to be a better Christian."

540
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,620
 But out of suddenly a place of,

541
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:07,140
 "Oh my gosh, the Lord loves me so deeply.

542
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,900
 He has changed my life.

543
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:12,740
 How can I not serve him with everything within me?

544
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,580
 Open the eyes of my heart, Lord,

545
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:20,820
 so that I can see you, be you,

546
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,580
 live out what Ezekiel was talking about here

547
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,340
 where he says a new heart

548
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:29,060
 so that we can live out your law in love,

549
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,020
 not in some sort of thing."

550
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,300
 See, so many people think that Christianity

551
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,260
 is a behavior modification religion.

552
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:39,100
 That's so many people in the world think

553
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,140
 that that's what our faith is.

554
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:40,980
 And to be honest with you,

555
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,820
 there's a lot of people in the church

556
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,900
 that think that that's what our faith is as well.

557
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,980
 That actually Christianity is all about

558
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,300
 having something with God

559
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,300
 and there's rules and regulations and restrictions.

560
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,500
 And if I adhere to the rules, regulations and restrictions,

561
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,940
 then I'll be a better person.

562
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,580
 I'll be more loved by God

563
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,940
 and I'll be able to succeed more in life.

564
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,300
 And Paul's saying, "No, no, no, no.

565
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,460
 We've got this all wrong.

566
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,460
 Christianity is not a behavior modification religion.

567
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:08,540
 Christianity is a relationship that brings inner healing

568
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,260
 that leads transformation."

569
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:13,260
 It's actually the opposite of the direction we think.

570
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,420
 We think we can just deal with the surface stuff

571
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,300
 and everything's gonna be okay.

572
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,700
 God is not five tips to help you control your drinking.

573
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,220
 He's not an Instagram reel.

574
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,740
 Come on, church.

575
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,660
 Jesus was here today.

576
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,900
 He would not be making those kinds of Instagram reels.

577
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,740
 Okay?

578
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,460
 Five tips to deal and control your drinking habit.

579
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,340
 Instead, here's God.

580
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:38,980
 God is like, "I wanna get to the very place of the shame,

581
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:42,700
 the hurt and the guilt and the insecurity

582
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,380
 that is causing you to drink excessively

583
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,260
 in the first place.

584
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,100
 That's what I wanna walk with.

585
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,140
 That's where my heart is for you.

586
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:53,900
 I wanna so radically transform the hardness

587
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,860
 and the darkness and the struggles and the pains

588
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:59,420
 and the hurts of your heart that you literally

589
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,620
 become a new person from the inside out."

590
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,140
 Isn't that beautiful?

591
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,660
 Wow, I'm hot.

592
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:10,340
 It's really beautiful.

593
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,260
 Notice what he says next.

594
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,620
 I mean, he's only just getting started.

595
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,140
 He then says this.

596
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,980
 He says, "Now you need to understand that you,

597
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:20,180
 being rooted and established in love,

598
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,420
 may go on to have the blah, blah, blah."

599
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,780
 But he starts, "You're rooted and established in love."

600
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,220
 This is really important for Paul.

601
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,780
 He wants you to understand that the Spirit is gonna come

602
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,780
 and do this incredible work within you.

603
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,860
 Only the Spirit can do that out of his glorious riches.

604
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,140
 But he needs you to know where your starting point is.

605
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:38,420
 You're rooted and established in love already.

606
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:41,700
 In fact, from the very moment that you gave your life

607
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,260
 to Jesus, you find yourself rooted in it.

608
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,100
 This is a metaphor he's using.

609
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,300
 One is a agricultural metaphor.

610
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,060
 It's for the rural people out there.

611
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,860
 The other one is an architectural metaphor

612
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,340
 for the urban people out there.

613
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:56,700
 He uses both to help to connect to his wide audience.

614
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,860
 And he's saying both of those things mean the same thing.

615
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:03,060
 You have a firm foundation in Jesus's love.

616
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,140
 That's your starting point.

617
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,260
 Love is our starting point.

618
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:10,100
 It's not the thing that we attain and gain years

619
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,100
 down the line when we've done some behavioral modification

620
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,260
 that earns that love.

621
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,820
 He's saying you need to understand

622
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,260
 that you are at the very beginning,

623
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:20,460
 rooted and established in love.

624
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,620
 It's your firm foundation.

625
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:24,020
 It's the thing that you can put your whole hope in.

626
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,980
 Your feet are embedded in the love of Christ.

627
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:30,620
 And from there, all good things can grow.

628
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:36,460
 All good things can be built up, to use the two metaphors,

629
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:39,900
 if you're rooted and established in love.

630
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,380
 That's important for some of you in here,

631
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,660
 because my sense is that for some of us,

632
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,100
 we really struggle with this.

633
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:50,860
 I felt just before this service in particular

634
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,580
 that there's quite a few of us

635
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,980
 where it's been a long time since we felt loved.

636
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:59,140
 Maybe that's the reality on a human level for you.

637
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,340
 It's been a long time since you felt loved

638
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,500
 and accepted on a human level.

639
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,820
 My guess is for some of us in this room,

640
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,100
 it's a divine level.

641
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:10,740
 And maybe because of some of those surface things

642
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:14,620
 that are going on in your life, things that are important,

643
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,620
 but because of those surface things,

644
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,980
 you feel like God can't love you.

645
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,580
 You feel unworthy to be loved.

646
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,940
 You feel like he is distant from you.

647
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:25,260
 And Paul is writing to a church

648
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:28,380
 where he knows all the brokenness in his church too.

649
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,180
 And he's seen all the surface stuff,

650
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,980
 and he's like, "My prayer is not there.

651
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,060
 "My prayer is in their hearts.

652
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,820
 "And my prayer is that they would understand

653
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:38,420
 "from the very beginning, they are rooted

654
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,780
 "and they are established in love."

655
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,100
 And as your pastor here,

656
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,500
 that is ultimately my prayer for you today.

657
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,500
 For those of you who feel like you are not loved,

658
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,740
 I need to say that that is a lie of the enemy.

659
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:53,420
 The enemy's greatest strategy against Christians

660
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,780
 to keep them away from the intimacy of God

661
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:58,740
 is to convince them that they cannot be loved.

662
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:05,420
 Paul says you're rooted and you're established in love.

663
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:08,780
 If you have a faith in Jesus here,

664
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:12,100
 you are fully, completely, totally, and absolutely

665
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,940
 rooted and established in love.

666
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:16,140
 You can take that to the bank.

667
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,140
 That's who you are.

668
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:21,140
 And from that place can flourish so much growth,

669
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:24,700
 which is why he uses a metaphor of the rooting

670
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,540
 and the establishing, the agricultural and architectural,

671
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,700
 'cause what he's trying to say is,

672
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,540
 hey, seeds get planted in soil,

673
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,100
 not so that they remain seeds,

674
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,300
 so that they grow and become something.

675
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,140
 We pour cement in the ground,

676
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,900
 not so that we can just have cement in the ground,

677
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,620
 so that we can build a building on top of it.

678
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,180
 So he's talking about growth here,

679
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,140
 which is where he now takes the prayer.

680
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,420
 Now that he's established for them,

681
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,660
 that they're rooted and established in love,

682
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,740
 look what he says here.

683
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,220
 This is so beautiful.

684
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,060
 He says that you would have the power together

685
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,820
 with all the saints to grasp how wide and long

686
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:57,620
 and high and deep is the love of Christ,

687
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,940
 and to know this love that surpasses knowledge,

688
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,220
 that you may be filled to the whole measure

689
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,860
 of the fullness of God.

690
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,380
 Oh man, preachers have tripped themselves up

691
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:09,620
 all over the place to try to define what Paul means

692
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:14,100
 by high, wide, long, and deep is the love of Christ.

693
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,380
 There have been countless numbers of sermons

694
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,820
 to help to articulate and exegete

695
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,940
 what Paul must have been thinking,

696
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:23,900
 as if high love was talking about his divine love.

697
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,420
 Wide love must have been the love

698
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,460
 that covers a multitude of sin.

699
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:30,100
 Long love must be the eternal love that he has.

700
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,380
 The deep love must be about uprooting

701
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,420
 the deepest brokenness within us.

702
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:37,220
 And I think, sure, I'm sure all of those are biblical,

703
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,620
 all of those make sense,

704
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,020
 but I don't think that's what Paul's

705
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,420
 trying to communicate here.

706
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:45,660
 I think actually Paul's being far more simple than that.

707
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:48,340
 I think all Paul's doing is saying this.

708
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:54,580
 God's love is more vast and broad and big

709
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,060
 than you have ever realized.

710
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:03,020
 His love is greater than you have ever comprehended.

711
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:05,420
 And his love for the church,

712
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,980
 his heart, Paul's heart for the church,

713
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,940
 he wants his church to grasp, he uses this word grasp,

714
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,260
 it means to take hold of,

715
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,460
 take hold of in their mind to comprehend

716
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,820
 how amazing is the love of God,

717
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:20,060
 how big and vast and huge it truly is.

718
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,780
 Paul's saying, whether you've been a Christian

719
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:24,180
 for 50 years or a Christian for five minutes,

720
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:27,260
 there's more of the love of Christ for you to understand,

721
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,860
 for you to grasp a hold of,

722
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,500
 for you to understand in your mind.

723
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:35,420
 He wants you to grow in your comprehension

724
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,780
 of the vastness of the love of Christ.

725
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:42,780
 And every day you wake up, you can know that love more.

726
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,620
 - That's right.

727
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:47,980
 - Which is a great encouragement,

728
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,140
 but we have to be really careful here

729
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,180
 that we don't get Paul wrong.

730
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:54,540
 What Paul's not saying is that when you became a Christian,

731
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,260
 you got a small amount of love,

732
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,860
 and now you just need to grasp a hold

733
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,260
 of more and more amount of love.

734
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,820
 That's not what he's saying.

735
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,860
 What he is saying is, when you became a Christian,

736
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:09,180
 the wholeness, you are rooted and established

737
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,340
 in the wholeness of his love,

738
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:14,220
 and yet I want you to continue to mature

739
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,540
 and grow in your comprehension,

740
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:19,140
 your understanding of that love

741
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,300
 that is already fully yours.

742
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:25,340
 Let me help explain that by sharing a story

743
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,260
 out of Chris and I's life.

744
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,180
 So Chris and I couldn't have our own children,

745
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,780
 went into the adoption process.

746
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,740
 After a long period, we finally got a phone call.

747
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:35,020
 We've matched you to this amazing kid,

748
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:38,460
 half Nepalese, half Indonesian, 16 months old.

749
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,220
 We're not gonna show you a photo.

750
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,820
 We can't tell you much about it,

751
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,580
 but you need to say yes or no.

752
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,780
 So we said yes.

753
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:49,540
 Now, just the day before we met our daughter

754
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:52,300
 for the very first time, we met with our social workers,

755
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,020
 and our social workers, who had been brilliant

756
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,180
 throughout the whole process,

757
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,380
 our social workers said this.

758
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,460
 They said, "Now, we need to prepare you for tomorrow.

759
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,300
 "We need to prepare you because the chances are

760
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:04,620
 "you will not love this kid straight away.

761
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,100
 "You need to be prepared that you will not love them

762
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,540
 "because this is not like a biological thing.

763
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,700
 "This is not like you've had nine months with this child,

764
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,700
 "and the child comes, and all this pain,

765
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,940
 "and kind of celebration of childbirth,

766
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,940
 "and there's this immediate emotional connection

767
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,420
 "between you and the child."

768
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,860
 They're like, "No, no, adoption is kind of a bit more

769
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,740
 "sort of, you know, not particularly emotional.

770
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:27,380
 "And so you need to be prepared when you meet this person

771
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,140
 "tomorrow for the first time,

772
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:31,900
 "chances are you will not love them."

773
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,860
 Chris and I left that meeting,

774
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,340
 and our first thought was, "Get behind me, Satan."

775
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,180
 'Cause we were like, "Nuh-uh,

776
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,060
 "that's not gonna be our story."

777
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,980
 Now, we appreciate what the social workers

778
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:47,300
 were trying to say, but we were like, "Nah, nah, nah, nah.

779
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,380
 "We believe in a God who can do all things,

780
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:52,940
 "a God who can strengthen us with power in our inner being.

781
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,580
 "We're gonna come tomorrow, and I tell you what,

782
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:58,020
 "I'm praying that the Lord will so fill me

783
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,620
 "with a love for this child

784
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:02,780
 "that it will be like literally this child came from Chris."

785
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:06,740
 So we show up the next day, sitting in this room,

786
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,940
 there's a glass door in front of us,

787
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,740
 the child comes down with the social worker,

788
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,260
 we can't see it properly yet,

789
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,860
 but there's a silhouette of this 16-month-old girl

790
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:15,980
 wearing a tutu.

791
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:20,020
 And as we're looking at the silhouette,

792
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:23,420
 we're already loving this child.

793
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,500
 And then the door opens, and Mia walks into our lives,

794
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,300
 and immediately, 100%,

795
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,780
 I have never loved anything in this,

796
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,980
 other than my wife, I had to say this this morning.

797
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:38,460
 I have never loved anything inside of me,

798
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,140
 and Chris had never loved anything inside of her

799
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:46,140
 more completely and fully than that child in that moment.

800
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:51,380
 It was an instant, full, all of our love to Mia.

801
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,900
 Are you with me?

802
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,540
 But here's the interesting thing.

803
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:58,940
 Mia had to grow in her comprehension of that love.

804
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:02,220
 It was all there from day one.

805
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,660
 In fact, my very first thought

806
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,380
 after I saw Mia for the first time,

807
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,580
 it's funny how the mind works,

808
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,900
 my very first thought was,

809
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,980
 I can't wait to walk her down the aisle.

810
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:14,700
 I'm a father now.

811
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,380
 And one day, I'm gonna walk her down the aisle,

812
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:20,180
 and I literally, that was my first thought.

813
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,380
 We loved her fully, but she had to grow

814
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,260
 in her comprehension of that love.

815
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:28,420
 For example, we would carry her for weeks afterwards,

816
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,700
 and her limbs would just dangle beside us

817
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,940
 'cause she didn't know what intimacy was like.

818
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,420
 We would walk and hold her hand,

819
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,340
 and her hand would just be like this.

820
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,100
 My hand would be clasped around hers.

821
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,020
 She wouldn't clasp

822
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:42,420
 because she didn't understand love and intimacy.

823
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:45,500
 After about three months of her not really showing

824
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,740
 that much love to Chris and I or any intimacy,

825
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,380
 Chris and I are standing in the kitchen one day

826
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,020
 in our apartment, and we're talking about the fact,

827
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,660
 well, maybe Mia's never gonna be an affectionate child,

828
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,900
 and we're just gonna have to get used to that,

829
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:56,980
 and that's just gonna be something

830
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,860
 that God's gonna have to give us a strength for.

831
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:02,740
 Mia walks in, and she's about knee-high to us at this time.

832
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,980
 She walks over to Chris.

833
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,460
 She leans forward and goes,

834
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,900
 and kisses her on the knee.

835
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,220
 It's the first expression of intimacy she's ever done,

836
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,460
 and Chris is like, "Mm!"

837
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:14,500
 And I'm standing there like.

838
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:22,700
 What about my knees?

839
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:27,900
 And she walks over to me and pecks me lightly on my knee,

840
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,860
 and she walks out of the room,

841
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,660
 and Chris and I are like, done.

842
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:37,660
 But Mia had to comprehend, learn, be exposed to,

843
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:40,260
 understand love in order to respond to love.

844
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,540
 John would write this in one of his letters, wouldn't he?

845
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:46,300
 You are able to love 'cause he first loved you.

846
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,740
 And so here is Paul writing to the church,

847
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:50,260
 and he's saying, you are rooted and established in love.

848
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,820
 You have the fullness of that love,

849
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:54,460
 but my heart is that you would comprehend that love

850
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:57,500
 more and more and more, and as you comprehend it,

851
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,300
 you will respond to it in such a profound and beautiful way.

852
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,020
 You have walked through that door,

853
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,780
 and your Father is standing there,

854
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:06,140
 and He sees you, and He loves you fully

855
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,860
 if you've given your life to Jesus.

856
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,820
 But oh, we can grow, can't we,

857
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:13,500
 in our comprehension of that love of God

858
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,180
 that is so high, so wide, so long, so deep,

859
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:21,660
 that it can literally transform the brokenness within us.

860
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:24,540
 Which is why he then finishes with this.

861
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:27,100
 He says, "And that you would know this love

862
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,260
 "that surpasses knowledge."

863
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,660
 He's just said, I want you to have a better comprehension

864
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,900
 of this love in your mind.

865
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,780
 But then he goes, but that's just not enough.

866
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,500
 I don't want you just to grow daily

867
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,100
 in your comprehension of the love.

868
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,140
 I want you to know it.

869
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,980
 He's drawing from the Old Testament once again.

870
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:44,340
 This idea of intimacy, to know someone

871
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,140
 was an Old Testament biblical way

872
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,460
 to speak about intimacy and relationship.

873
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,700
 He's saying, I want you to know this love

874
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,340
 that surpasses knowledge.

875
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,700
 Yes, you can grow in your comprehension of it,

876
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,060
 but that's not enough either.

877
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:58,500
 I want you to actually physically experience it

878
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,820
 and feel it and know it and grow in it

879
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:03,620
 so that when you both in your mind can understand it

880
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,740
 and in your spirit receive it,

881
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:09,820
 you will be transformed to the fullness

882
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,380
 of the wholeness of Christ.

883
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:17,660
 All of which is a summary of this prayer here.

884
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:21,260
 You are rooted and established in love.

885
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:24,100
 You can grasp and comprehend its wonder more and more.

886
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:27,220
 And you can experience it beyond just the mere idea of it.

887
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,540
 You can know it intimately and personally

888
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,220
 right here and now.

889
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,540
 This love comes by the Spirit to strengthen you

890
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:37,020
 with power in the places where you are most broken.

891
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,020
 So you will become a living example

892
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:41,820
 of what the fullness of God looks like.

893
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:45,060
 That's Paul's prayer for his church.

894
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,900
 And we as a leadership would say,

895
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,060
 that's our prayer for you.

896
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:51,060
 That's growing big people.

897
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:55,300
 That's for you from us.

898
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,820
 If this is your home church,

899
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:00,020
 that's everything why we do what we do.

900
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:05,300
 So that you would come to a profound relationship

901
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:08,540
 with a inner healing and transformative God.

902
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:12,180
 So that your eyes of the heart would be open

903
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,500
 so you could see Him.

904
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,700
 Your mind would comprehend His love

905
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,340
 more greater than you could ever have thought.

906
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,020
 And you would know that love

907
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,340
 that surpasses your understanding.

908
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:22,620
 You would feel it and sense it and see it

909
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,500
 so that you would know the fullness of Christ in your life.

910
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,780
 Oh Lord that you would do that to your church.

911
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:31,420
 Yahweh.

912
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:38,380
 May the breath of God's Spirit

913
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:42,260
 break back the lies of the enemy

914
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:45,980
 that would say you are not worthy to be loved.

915
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:50,660
 And may you come to a deeper and more profound realization

916
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:54,100
 out of the glorious riches of Christ.

917
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,660
 How much He really loves you.

918
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:59,220
 Can we pray?

919
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,060
 Let's pray.

920
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:03,940
 Now I wonder as we pray you could just quieten your heart.

921
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:06,300
 As your eyes are closed,

922
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:12,940
 maybe just take a moment just to come before Him.

923
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:19,100
 For you are rooted and established in love.

924
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:24,380
 And He loves you so, so much.

925
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:30,580
 And I wanna pray for those of you in this room

926
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,580
 that are really struggling to know love.

927
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:38,180
 For some of you like I said, that's a human level.

928
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:41,660
 You feel deeply lonely.

929
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:45,140
 Perhaps on the surface your life looks amazing.

930
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:50,540
 Perhaps you have a great job, great husband, wife,

931
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:54,660
 great family, great friends, spirit of influence.

932
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,940
 Perhaps on the surface things seem to be great

933
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:00,420
 but nobody really knows that deep down inside of you

934
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,820
 you're desperately lonely.

935
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:05,660
 But the Lord sees that.

936
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:10,260
 The Lord's desire is that He would strengthen you

937
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:13,900
 with power by His Spirit in those places.

938
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:18,540
 The places that many people don't know about but you know.

939
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:23,780
 Some of you are lacking that sense of human love.

940
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:26,500
 Some of you in this room

941
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,500
 you're lacking a sense of divine love.

942
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:32,940
 You feel like you're unworthy of being loved by Him.

943
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:36,460
 Perhaps you're a sin or you're brokenness

944
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:38,780
 or the mistakes you've made are very, very front

945
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:39,940
 and center in your mind.

946
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:45,540
 May Paul's words set you free today

947
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,860
 that you are rooted and established in love.

948
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,380
 You've walked through that door

949
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,620
 and the Father loves you.

950
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:54,140
 And it's a lie of the enemy to say

951
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,980
 that you are unworthy of being loved.

952
00:42:55,980 --> 00:43:00,460
 And here at the Vine we come against the work

953
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:02,780
 of the enemy in that area over these people

954
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,140
 in the name of Jesus.

955
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:06,300
 Out of your glorious riches, Lord,

956
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:10,660
 you would strengthen with power by your Spirit

957
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:13,140
 in their inner being, the people in this room

958
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:15,220
 to know your love.

959
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,740
 So I wonder whether you would wanna respond to that.

960
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:22,380
 You can just open your hands where you are

961
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,340
 and I'm gonna pray.

962
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:29,980
 I'm just gonna invite the Holy Spirit now.

963
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:35,180
 Just whilst we are in this place of receiving.

964
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:37,540
 This is the most important part of the service.

965
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:40,540
 For here on Pentecost Sunday,

966
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:44,780
 that promise of Ezekiel 36 is real and true

967
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:46,500
 and fulfilled in Christ.

968
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:50,540
 And that any hardness of heart,

969
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:52,420
 any hurt and pain,

970
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:57,100
 whatever might be the deepest thing inside of us,

971
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:00,020
 Christ can heal and restore and strengthen.

972
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:04,100
 So come Holy Spirit.

973
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:08,340
 Come Holy Spirit.

974
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:17,540
 Come Holy Spirit.

975
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:20,860
 (gentle music)

976
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:24,660
 Just take some time to receive him.

977
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:29,020
 You are loved.

978
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:33,180
 You are loved.

979
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:41,380
 It's not your fault for how you're feeling unloved.

980
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:46,380
 You are loved.

981
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:48,980
 (gentle music)

982
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:57,500
 Just come Holy Spirit.

983
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:02,180
 Strengthen your church.

984
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:05,940
 Pour out your presence.

985
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:15,740
 What we're gonna do in a moment

986
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:18,420
 is we're just gonna have the prayer team come forward

987
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:21,500
 and they're gonna be here at the front.

988
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:24,220
 And I wanna encourage you,

989
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:26,140
 this has been important to you today.

990
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:28,660
 Have some people come around you today

991
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:30,500
 and just love on you.

992
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,300
 Love on you by praying for you,

993
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:35,740
 by speaking truth and life to you.

994
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:39,140
 For some of you in this room,

995
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:41,020
 that's really important for you today

996
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:44,340
 is to receive ministry by the Spirit of God

997
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:46,620
 through somebody else praying for you

998
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:47,740
 and speaking life into you.

999
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:49,820
 So our prayer team are gonna be here now.

1000
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:52,860
 So if you're on the prayer team,

1001
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:55,180
 I wanna invite you just to be in the front now.

1002
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:59,540
 And in a moment, if you would like to receive prayer,

1003
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:02,380
 I'm gonna invite you to come and receive prayer.

1004
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:04,060
 Some of you may just wanna sit

1005
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:07,580
 and you may just wanna sit for another five,

1006
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:10,380
 10 minutes or so and just allow the Holy Spirit

1007
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:12,100
 to minister to you, just to speak to you.

1008
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,780
 Maybe it's just personal for you.

1009
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:15,980
 Or maybe you've come with someone

1010
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:17,100
 and you can pray together

1011
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:20,620
 and you just wanna soak in the presence of God

1012
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:23,420
 that is here, right here and now.

1013
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:26,860
 You're more than welcome to stay and receive from Him.

1014
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:30,060
 For those of you that need to leave in a moment,

1015
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:31,140
 you're welcome to do that,

1016
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:34,140
 but I ask you to do it respectfully and quietly

1017
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:37,340
 as we respect the people in this room

1018
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:40,020
 who are receiving from the Holy Spirit.

1019
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,740
 But you're more than welcome to make an exit

1020
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:45,060
 when you feel you're led to.

1021
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:45,900
 Let me pray for us.

1022
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:49,020
 Father, in the gentleness of your presence

1023
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:51,420
 that's been here from the start of this service,

1024
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:55,860
 would you now continue to minister to our hearts?

1025
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:57,860
 Lord, I pray that every person that needs prayer

1026
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:59,500
 in this room will receive prayer.

1027
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:03,340
 Any person that just needs to sit in your presence

1028
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:06,180
 would just receive from you in that way.

1029
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:07,460
 For those of us that need to go,

1030
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:11,020
 we bless them to go with the love of Christ,

1031
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:13,820
 to serve and to live out that love,

1032
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:17,580
 to comprehend that love, to know that love more and more.

1033
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:20,620
 Come Holy Spirit, come.

1034
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:24,740
 So if you'd like some prayer, don't be shy.

1035
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:26,860
 Please come forward for prayer.

1036
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:27,820
 If you wanna sit, sit.

1037
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:29,420
 If you need to go, go.

1038
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:30,660
 We love you guys so much.

1039
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:33,240
 (gentle music)
