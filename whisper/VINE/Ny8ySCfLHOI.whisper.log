[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720]   Amen, amen.
[00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:02.840]   Thank you, Carla.
[00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.720]   And wow, good morning to the 11 o'clock service.
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.720]   You guys can sing.
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.680]   That's great, and welcome also to those online
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.020]   who are with us today.
[00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.640]   Normally we worship in the nine o'clock,
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.600]   so this is our neighborhood over here,
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.160]   but this is okay over here too,
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.000]   but this is where we sit,
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.480]   and it's just great to be celebrating here
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.600]   with the 11 o'clock service.
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.000]   And thank you, Carla, for those words.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.240]   And also, Emma, for that word again, trust.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.240]   You know, a little bit of homework
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.640]   just to get us started right away is
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.440]   trust is a powerful word.
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.760]   And we're gonna talk about it a little bit
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.280]   in the sermon today,
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.440]   but you might just write that word down every morning,
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.480]   like on your journal or maybe by your computer or something
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.640]   because it's a powerful word.
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.920]   And amen, we do not worship a God of scarcity.
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.440]   We worship a God of generosity
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.040]   who's more than enough,
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.400]   and you are always more than enough too
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.560]   with our character leadership, with our students.
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.920]   It's one of the things we send the message to them,
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.960]   that you are enough,
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.200]   as much as the world tries to make us think otherwise.
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.040]   Amen?
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.860]   - Amen.
[00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.320]   - Okay, so we've heard some good words already.
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.640]   Also, Dad's, happy Father's Day.
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.840]   It's Dad's Day.
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.080]   My daughter, our daughter, our middle daughter
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.080]   is living in New York, and she has a film production company
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.080]   so I'm always telling her, tell good dad stories.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.040]   The world needs more good dad stories, amen?
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.440]   So yeah, we need probably less dad jokes,
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.400]   but we need more good dad stories.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.040]   Actually, you can never have enough dad jokes.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.960]   Keep them going, dads.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.840]   We'll keep going.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:53.260]   So what I will do this morning is just share
[00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.720]   a little bit from the word of God.
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.040]   We're gonna look at a passage together,
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.320]   and also just share something of what I've been learning
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.840]   at the university, learning in life here in Hong Kong.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.840]   And there's a professor at Harvard, Arthur Brooks,
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.920]   and he says that all research is really me-search.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.200]   So all research is really me-search
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.320]   because the researchers are actually
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.900]   trying to figure out a question or a problem
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.640]   that they're really interested in
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.520]   or that they're struggling with, right?
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.080]   So that's what he kinda says, and as a researcher,
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.080]   I would say it's pretty similar to sermons as well,
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.960]   that oftentimes sermons are ones that the pastor,
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.200]   the preacher is also working through
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.200]   in questions that affect all of us,
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.360]   and that is definitely the case today
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.240]   because God is working on me in this sermon,
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.560]   and I want to share a little bit of what he's saying.
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.960]   Vision Sunday, Pastor Andrew gave us this word,
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.440]   uncharted, uncharted.
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.840]   What does it mean to be in uncharted territory,
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.840]   unfamiliar territory?
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.880]   And the passage that we're gonna look at today
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.400]   has a lot to do with how we can respond in uncharted times.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.920]   And last week, as Carla said, we finished up
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.040]   the sermon series on the Holy Spirit,
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.120]   but today we'll hear again about the Holy Spirit
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.040]   'cause the Holy Spirit is the one that guides us
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.680]   in uncharted times.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.680]   But the primary way I believe he guides us
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.120]   is through the word of God.
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:36.080]   So don't let Sunday be the only day
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.660]   you open the word of God, amen?
[00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:44.880]   Open it up in the morning before you go out into our world
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.640]   and open yourself to it, and you will find something
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.640]   for you or, and something for someone else.
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.180]   Few weeks ago, I had breakfast with a leader
[00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.240]   here in Hong Kong, and I've admired him for some time.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.880]   We've had the honor of kind of working together
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.160]   in little places, and I've always admired him,
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.080]   but particularly I've admired him
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.480]   how in the toughest of times, in the meetings
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.680]   that seem to, or the situations that seem
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.320]   the most complicated, he's always calm,
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.240]   and he has wisdom, and he's kind.
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.320]   Kind of kind, calm, and confident, you know?
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.520]   So I thought, I think I'll have a breakfast with him
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.080]   and try to find out a little bit, you know,
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.120]   how he does that and just get to know him
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.760]   a little bit better, and also to ask
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.400]   for some of his prayers.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.600]   And so we got together for breakfast,
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.600]   and I found out that he has memorized over 1,000 verses.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.040]   Wow, that's a high bar, right?
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.960]   And he's an accountant, so he's not exaggerating, right?
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.700]   Numbers are important to him.
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:57.160]   But he started young, and it's coming through his life.
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.080]   So we're gonna look at the word of God
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.500]   and say, what does it have to say to us this morning?
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:11.680]   When our family was young, we were living
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.640]   in Switzerland, and at that time,
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.800]   that's where I started my theological education,
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.640]   there at the University of Zurich.
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.160]   So at one point in the University of Zurich,
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.000]   which Zurich is German-speaking,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.840]   I was studying Greek in German, okay?
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.160]   So I was studying (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.760]   Now, here's the problem.
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.860]   My Greek was not that good, right?
[00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.440]   And my German was not that good either.
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.840]   So every day in my translations,
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.000]   there was a new heresy, right?
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.940]   But the main thing is it was taking me forever
[00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.120]   to kind of get through the courses, right?
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.860]   And so I thought, man, I'm not gonna finish this
[00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.960]   before Jesus comes back.
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.960]   And for some reason, that was important to me, right?
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.300]   So Marian and I talked, and what we decided is
[00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.360]   that I would transfer.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.960]   So I transferred to Princeton Theological Seminary.
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.760]   We flew there with our family.
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.120]   About two days after we landed there,
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.840]   then I was on the playground with our daughter,
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.480]   young daughter, she was about three years old at the age.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.780]   We're on the playground, we're doing the dad thing, right?
[00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.920]   We're pushing swings, we're doing duck under
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:25.760]   and all that, you know?
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.200]   And we're having fun there, but someone calls my name.
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.360]   And then I look across the playground,
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.440]   and this guy's running towards me.
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.720]   I recognize him, his name's Tomas.
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.960]   He was from the Czech Republic,
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.160]   and he came up to me, and we started kind of joking
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.640]   and laughing, and Tomas has like long brown hair.
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.080]   He's a young PhD student.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.640]   Beard, kind of a rugged face.
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.240]   And so we're just laughing and joking.
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.680]   I'd met him, yeah, just like I said, a couple days before.
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.400]   And then, but I noticed that the whole time
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.920]   I'm talking with Tomas, our daughter, my daughter,
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.480]   cannot take her eyes off of him.
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.440]   And she's just got these big eyes looking at Tomas.
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.560]   And so we talk a little bit, someone else calls Tomas name,
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.520]   he goes running over there, and I turn back to my daughter,
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.480]   and she says to me, where did Jesus go?
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.000]   [audience laughing]
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.680]   And I thought, good, my daughter thinks I have
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.200]   such a great relationship with Jesus
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.660]   that we can laugh and joke, and he knows my name,
[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.320]   and this is good, this is good, right?
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.480]   I was quite flattered.
[00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:39.460]   But that question, where did Jesus go, is a tough one.
[00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:48.560]   It's one probably we've all asked at some point,
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.720]   we've been following Jesus.
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.960]   It's also maybe one we're asking right now.
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:58.080]   It may be one that we will ask, or someone we know
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:01.960]   and love is asking right now, because it's a tough time.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.280]   We can't see what Jesus is doing,
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:08.420]   where Jesus is, where is God in this situation.
[00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:12.660]   Maybe it's uncertain times, uncharted times.
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:15.180]   We just don't know the way we should go.
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:18.940]   Maybe we're overwhelmed at work with everything
[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:22.300]   that's going on and put on us, the demands on us.
[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.060]   Maybe it's in the family, maybe it's an illness,
[00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:29.060]   maybe even worse, it's the illness of someone we love.
[00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:33.120]   I don't know what it is, but we go through these times
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.740]   where they're definitely uncharted,
[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.920]   and they're also the times where in the night often,
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:42.520]   we're lying there and we're saying, God, where are you?
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:48.460]   I was following you, and then I've lost you.
[00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.540]   Where are you, Jesus?
[00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:51.380]   Amen?
[00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:55.120]   So the word of God has a word for that,
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.020]   and some strategies that if we're finding ourselves
[00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:03.060]   in that situation, I've found to be helpful,
[00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.580]   and I hope they can be helpful to you as well.
[00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:09.300]   So we're looking at Acts chapter 16,
[00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:14.300]   and from 25, verse 25 to 34.
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:18.860]   And we'll just look through and then kind of allow ourselves
[00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.720]   to be open to what the scripture is saying.
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:26.380]   Now, the scripture starts with about midnight,
[00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:29.660]   Paul and Silas were praying.
[00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:33.160]   But let's stop there, because we need to know
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.220]   what happened before about midnight,
[00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.100]   because about midnight, something's going on.
[00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.420]   Midnight is the darkest part of the night.
[00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.540]   Metaphorically, it's the part where we cannot see.
[00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:45.900]   It is the part where we are only walking by faith
[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:46.940]   and not by sight.
[00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.820]   It's a dark night, right?
[00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:50.460]   And so what happened before then?
[00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.780]   What happened before then is about earlier,
[00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:54.740]   I don't know how long, maybe a couple weeks earlier,
[00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:59.060]   the Paul and Silas have arrived in Philippi,
[00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.120]   where the letter of Philippians was going to.
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.300]   They've arrived in Philippi.
[00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.980]   They've met a businesswoman named Lydia.
[00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:09.340]   She's a trader of purple cloth, so she's doing quite well.
[00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:11.060]   They meet her.
[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.980]   She opens her home to have the church in her home,
[00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.460]   and they're out on the street, worshiping publicly,
[00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:19.860]   and preaching publicly, and healing.
[00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:23.740]   And one of the individuals they heal is a slave girl.
[00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:26.340]   And this slave girl, because of possession,
[00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:30.100]   had the ability to foretell the future.
[00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.980]   And so her owners, her masters, were
[00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:35.180]   making a lot of money off her.
[00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:37.740]   And when they healed her, that left.
[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:41.620]   And so you can kind of follow the money, right?
[00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:45.300]   So the owners are furious.
[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:50.860]   And so what they do is they accuse Paul and Silas
[00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:53.660]   of public disorder, and they call the magistrates,
[00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:55.700]   and they create this huge ruckus.
[00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:59.380]   And what ends up happening is, without any justice,
[00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:03.020]   without any trial, Paul and Silas are beaten,
[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.780]   and they're taken, and they're thrown in jail.
[00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:09.860]   And the jailer is told, put them in the deepest, kind
[00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:14.140]   of the darkest, the dankest, the very middle of the prison,
[00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:15.380]   and put them in stocks.
[00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:21.620]   That's what happened before, about midnight.
[00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:27.220]   So now our verse starts, "About midnight, Paul and Silas
[00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:31.300]   were praying and singing hymns to God,
[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.380]   and the prisoners were listening to them.
[00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:36.460]   And suddenly, there's a great earthquake,
[00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.860]   so that the foundation of the prison was shaken.
[00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.900]   And immediately, all the doors were opened,
[00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:46.060]   and everyone's bonds were unfastened."
[00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:48.620]   OK, let's stop there, because I think there's already
[00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:52.420]   a couple of strategies of what you and I can do if we find
[00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:56.100]   ourselves in a time of uncertainty
[00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:58.060]   in uncharted times.
[00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:00.860]   The first thing is, write the first three words.
[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:04.580]   So we read there, Paul and Silas.
[00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.620]   If you had a marker, underline "and,"
[00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:07.740]   because that's the key word.
[00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.460]   The first thing is, when you're in a tough time,
[00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:12.740]   when you're in uncharted territory, when you don't know
[00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:15.220]   which way to go, find your "and."
[00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:17.940]   We have Paul and Silas.
[00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:21.380]   Earlier, we would have had Paul and Barnabas.
[00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:23.940]   Later, we're going to have Paul and Timothy.
[00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:27.980]   This is the way Paul lived and worked.
[00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:34.140]   For 41 years, Marian has been my "and."
[00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:37.980]   And she's been my "and" through tough times then.
[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:43.140]   She's in my "and" right now during uncharted times.
[00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:45.660]   I have reached the prestigious age
[00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:50.060]   of being the mandatory retirement age at HKU.
[00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:55.340]   So I'm about to step into uncharted territory.
[00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:57.620]   Remember what I said about me-search?
[00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:59.420]   This is about this.
[00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:01.180]   We're dealing with this as well.
[00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:04.060]   And Marian and I will go through as an "and."
[00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:05.900]   And you know I'm in pretty good hands there,
[00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:07.320]   because if you've met Marian, you
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:12.500]   know she is the significantly better half of the equation.
[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:16.340]   But it's not about "and"s just in the personal life.
[00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:20.180]   It's about a way of life.
[00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:23.180]   Finding your "and" is a way of life.
[00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:25.060]   And it'll happen in different spheres.
[00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.820]   Because if you're like me, it's probably not just one area.
[00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:30.260]   There may be one area that you're most concerned at.
[00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.700]   But there's a lot of other areas that challenge us as well.
[00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:35.900]   And so like at the university, where
[00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:39.300]   we were helping start the character leadership
[00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:42.900]   program for undergraduates, it was uncharted territory.
[00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.340]   So I had a co-leader.
[00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:46.860]   And he and I co-led.
[00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:50.060]   And we've just handed over to two very gifted uprising
[00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:50.900]   scholars.
[00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:53.040]   And they will co-lead.
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.180]   One of the things we tell our students is,
[00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:58.220]   don't do life alone.
[00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:00.220]   Find your "and."
[00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:05.020]   Marian and I have been here 16 years now in Hong Kong.
[00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:08.420]   And during that time, first month I was here,
[00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:12.660]   I met a pastor by God's kind of gift.
[00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:14.460]   He lived right next door to me.
[00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:17.180]   And so we started having a coffee one month.
[00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:18.460]   We had a coffee the next month.
[00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.300]   And for the next 16 years till now,
[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:25.580]   we're trying to-- we have a coffee or a lunch every month.
[00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:27.380]   And we're each other's "and."
[00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:29.820]   Encouraging each other, building each other up,
[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:31.940]   laughing together with each other.
[00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:34.980]   There's two theologians, Harawats and Pinchas.
[00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:36.620]   And I think they say this beautifully.
[00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:37.860]   So it's a long quote.
[00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:42.620]   But I want to show you this quote and read you this quote.
[00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:45.660]   Starts with, "Returning once again,"
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:50.260]   they write, "to our metaphor of the moral life as a journey,
[00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.580]   it's obvious," as Aristotle himself notes,
[00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:56.680]   "that a journey is better undertaken with companions
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:57.780]   than alone.
[00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:59.740]   At the very least, we need others
[00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:02.180]   to sustain us along the way.
[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.180]   But further," and this is important,
[00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:06.860]   "and more strongly, traveling with others
[00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:09.860]   is crucial not only to relieve our boredom
[00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:13.740]   or supply a hand to hold in the dark and narrow places,
[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.500]   but as well, the journey requires
[00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:19.100]   that we ourselves be transformed.
[00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:23.100]   And we cannot do this without friends."
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:26.100]   Our "and" is not only just to help us.
[00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.740]   It's to help us become who we are.
[00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:31.900]   And we become who we are during the tough times.
[00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:36.820]   Crucible moments not only develop our character,
[00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:38.900]   they reveal our character.
[00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:42.020]   And we have that "and" working there with us.
[00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:43.940]   This is not new.
[00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:48.460]   Jesus sent his disciples out two by two.
[00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:51.260]   And he's still doing that.
[00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.540]   That's still a way of life for him.
[00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:55.080]   He sends you out.
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:57.300]   So we find our "and."
[00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.420]   I mean, last weekend, I had a chance
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:02.520]   to kind of work with our CG leaders.
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.220]   We were just doing some leadership training,
[00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.340]   and it was great meeting them.
[00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:06.380]   They're wonderful people.
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:10.020]   They all lead their groups with two or three or at least two
[00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:11.260]   in leadership.
[00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:12.140]   And here's the thing.
[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:15.020]   There's 60 of those groups going on here at Divine.
[00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:18.500]   So if you're thinking, who's my "and" or who could be my "and,"
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.180]   you don't have to think about it anymore.
[00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:23.420]   You can just go right out here to the Connect Hub
[00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:28.500]   and find out, because they're all open to receive new people.
[00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.380]   Find your "and," and why not today?
[00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:33.980]   Amen?
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:38.060]   OK, so we've covered about five words right now.
[00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:41.340]   And so at this pace, I hope you guys brought a packed lunch,
[00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:43.140]   and we're going to all be together.
[00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:44.720]   And we're going to have to pick it up.
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:48.460]   So first strategy, find your "and."
[00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:52.740]   The second strategy as we go into untartered territories
[00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:56.580]   or we find ourselves there is choose to sing.
[00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:58.460]   Choose to sing.
[00:16:58.460 --> 00:16:59.860]   So let's go back to our passage.
[00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.540]   It says, "About midnight, Paul and Silas
[00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:06.380]   were praying and singing hymns to God,
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:11.180]   and the prisoners were listening to them."
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:12.780]   OK, we'll stop there.
[00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:18.580]   Second strategy, choose to sing.
[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:23.380]   Augustine is purported to have said, "He who sings,
[00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:25.060]   prays twice."
[00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:27.380]   "He who sings, prays twice."
[00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:30.480]   It's in his writing about the power of hymns and worship,
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.460]   which we just experienced, right?
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:33.780]   Because we know that.
[00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:36.380]   Whether Augustine said it or not,
[00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:39.140]   we know it to be true because we've just experienced it,
[00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:40.060]   right?
[00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:43.060]   We're just holding our hands high a few minutes ago,
[00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:46.180]   and we're singing, but we're praying, aren't we?
[00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:47.900]   And there's that praying and singing.
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.420]   We're praying twice.
[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:51.660]   It's kind of happening as we're singing.
[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:57.340]   And we're calling out this, "The one I can trust is this one.
[00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:01.240]   I sought the Lord, and he answered me with that trust."
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.760]   That's the praying and the singing going together.
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:07.160]   When you're in a hard time, it's a hard time to sing,
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.000]   but choose to sing.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.600]   In the community church, which I was leading here
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:18.440]   in Hong Kong for a while, we had a prison ministry.
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:19.640]   And I was part of that team.
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.200]   And once a month, we would go to Lai Chi Kok.
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.560]   And we would be in Lai Chi Kok, and we would basically just
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:25.720]   be with the brothers.
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:26.920]   We'd do some teaching.
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:27.920]   We'd do some singing.
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.880]   We'd do small groups together, basically just
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:34.000]   to encourage each other, be each other's and in that moment.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.320]   And I always was encouraged by them,
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:39.240]   because it's not like we bring Christ into the prison, right?
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.320]   Jesus is already in the prison.
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:44.000]   He says, "You visited me in prison," right?
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.880]   So we just come and get to be with him there.
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:50.520]   But it was a tough time at Christmas,
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:53.680]   because our brothers, obviously, who are there right now,
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:57.880]   even as we're here, they're there, and they can't leave.
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.760]   And so to Christmas time, that was tough.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:03.200]   And so we would do songs, and we had some great worship people
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:03.960]   leading us.
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:07.000]   And one year, I remember it specially,
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.480]   because that year, we tend to happen--
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.680]   because we'd be about 30 or 40 people at that time.
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:15.440]   We tend to have quite a number from South America.
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.400]   So we were singing "Feliz Navidad," right?
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.400]   Now, "Feliz Navidad" is good, I think, any time of the year.
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:24.880]   But "Feliz Navidad," we're just belting it out.
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.000]   And that year, we were in the canteen
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.240]   at Lychee Cock, which is on the higher floors.
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.160]   The windows are open, if you imagine.
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.040]   We're here, windows out there.
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:36.960]   And then down below are the basketball courts.
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.280]   And we're just singing at the top of our lungs,
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:40.680]   "Feliz Navidad."
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.000]   And most of it's in Spanish.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.200]   I don't know what I'm singing, but we're just
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.920]   belting it out, right?
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:49.040]   And then later, the people tell us
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:52.680]   that the basketball players, they were listening.
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:54.600]   Did you hear what Paul--
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.720]   or what Acts says about Paul and the other prisoners
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.200]   who were listening?
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:07.480]   Never underestimate your ability to encourage others around you
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:10.960]   when, in a tough time, by the grace of God
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:15.800]   and the power of the Holy Spirit, you choose to sing.
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:18.080]   Because we don't know what everyone's going through,
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:22.560]   but we know someone, everyone, is going through something.
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:25.480]   Philo of Alexandria, he said this.
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:31.400]   He said, "Be kind, because everyone you meet
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.440]   is facing a battle."
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.120]   Just look around this room.
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.240]   This room is full.
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:40.680]   How many battles do we have going on in here, right?
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:42.760]   So we be kind.
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.360]   That's another way of singing.
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:48.160]   When I say choose to sing, it could be literal singing.
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.120]   And that's important.
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.600]   And research has shown we can build our character.
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.640]   There's playlists for characters.
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:56.960]   I mean, there's songs that build up our courage, right?
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.960]   Like, this is my fight song.
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.040]   Take back my life song.
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:03.120]   I mean, you know, this is like-- right.
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:05.360]   And that's kind of-- before I go into meeting,
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:06.360]   I listen to that song.
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:06.880]   No.
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:10.320]   But we know the power of music.
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:13.120]   But there's other ways to choose to sing.
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.240]   One is being kind.
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:19.960]   Other is maybe giving thanks to God,
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:24.280]   when you don't feel like giving thanks to God,
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.280]   because there's power in that.
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.700]   We were in a meeting the other day.
[00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:29.320]   And one of the professors said, there's
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:32.920]   something kind of almost defiant by our saying,
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:35.880]   thank you, God, in this situation.
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:36.560]   Why?
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:39.040]   Not thank you for the situation, but we
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:42.720]   thank him because, as we sing, we can trust him, right?
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.000]   So maybe-- here's some more homework.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.520]   We've already got one homework, another homework coming.
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:52.160]   But maybe tomorrow, when you go into whatever your work
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:56.400]   situation is, maybe it's the dining room table.
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.560]   Maybe it's an office.
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:59.360]   Maybe it's a studio.
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:00.840]   Maybe you're in front of students.
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.560]   Maybe-- I don't know where--
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:06.720]   but right before you start, maybe just write down,
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:11.800]   thank you, God, for this time and place.
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.680]   Because you can do that.
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:18.240]   I've done that sometimes when I wasn't really that thankful.
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:21.000]   But I was thankful when I thought about what it is
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.520]   and what God was doing.
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:25.320]   That's a choosing to sing.
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:29.040]   That gives courage to you, but also encourages others.
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.520]   But be very clear.
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:37.200]   It is a choice to sing.
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:42.160]   We do have a choice of how we respond, even
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:45.800]   to the worst of situations.
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:50.920]   Viktor Frankl, who has also found himself
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:52.920]   in the worst of the worst of the prisons,
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:57.360]   and that is in a concentration camp in Nazi Germany.
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:02.240]   And when most did not survive, he said, as a psychologist,
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.920]   he said, they can never take away
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:09.040]   your power of how you respond.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:10.960]   You choose that.
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.600]   Is it a hard choice?
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.320]   Yes.
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.320]   Do you feel like, I think I'll sing right away?
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:17.680]   No.
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:18.600]   It's a hard choice.
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:21.240]   In fact, for some of us, it's harder than others.
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.240]   I'm not really that good at this.
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:26.800]   But some of my aunts are very good at this.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:31.040]   Marianne's quite good at this in terms of facing things
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:33.360]   with joy.
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.200]   Choose to sing.
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.840]   That's a second strategy.
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.600]   OK, so now we've finished one verse,
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.520]   and we've still got a ways to go.
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.080]   But here's this.
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.920]   Is this making sense?
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:46.560]   Is this helpful?
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:47.040]   Yeah?
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:47.680]   All good?
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:51.920]   OK, I'll trust you.
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:54.360]   There you go, please.
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:57.040]   Let's go on then to the third, the third strategy
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:00.440]   which our verse, our passage tells us.
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:03.120]   And I think to understand the rest,
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:06.240]   and we'll take the rest of the verse or the passages
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:09.240]   all together, because it's like they're all connected.
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:12.000]   And when it starts to flow, it doesn't stop until the end.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   And so we'll take all those together.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.400]   But there may be two stories that
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:18.000]   would be helpful for you before we
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.200]   get right into that scripture.
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:24.520]   The first thought that might be helpful to you
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:31.160]   is that when we're on uncharted territory--
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.840]   and I have been in that uncharted territory.
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.240]   I'm about to be in it again.
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:38.880]   But five years ago, I was in that uncharted territory.
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.280]   Because I went from being in a church where
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:46.400]   I had been for about 20 years, leading in some capacity.
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.120]   And so it was familiar, right?
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.840]   And then I went to the university,
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.640]   which was uncharted for me.
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:53.800]   Uncharted for me, right?
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.040]   It was unfamiliar to me.
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:57.640]   And God, in his grace, gave me a verse.
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:58.980]   And this is the verse he gave me.
[00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:02.000]   He gave me Galatians 5, 25.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.680]   And the verse is, "If we live by the Spirit,
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:08.760]   let us stay in step with the Spirit."
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:13.180]   If we live by the Spirit, let us stay in step with the Spirit.
[00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:15.560]   That's a great verse if you don't know where you're going,
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:17.400]   which I didn't, right?
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:21.400]   My dad, who's a medical missionary for half his life,
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:22.800]   and then he's a microbiologist.
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:27.120]   And so, second half, he was as a dean of science
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:28.600]   in a university.
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:32.720]   But he liked to paraphrase this Galatians 5, 25.
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:37.200]   And he would say this, "If the Lord is the source
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:42.200]   of your life, let him direct the course of your life."
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:47.720]   So if the Lord, or the Spirit, is the source of your life,
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:51.160]   then let him direct the course of your life.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.360]   And I think this is quite beautiful.
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:56.400]   So I thought, you know, I'd put dad there on Father's Day.
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.360]   Thought he might like being with Augustine
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:02.120]   and fellow of Alexandria, dad of Austin.
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:07.120]   So, but he's right.
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:12.840]   Then, another little vignette that might be helpful for you
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.520]   in understanding the passage really comes
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:18.800]   from on HKU campus a few years ago.
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:21.880]   We were introducing the service aspect
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.560]   of the character leadership program.
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:25.880]   So we're trying to teach, there's about 600 students
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:28.200]   involved in the program now, all four years.
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:30.240]   It's going to a two-year program next year,
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:32.200]   or actually started this year.
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:35.640]   And, but we're trying to teach them character leadership.
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:37.400]   How do you develop your character?
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.600]   One of those ways that we were doing it at the beginning
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.040]   was really to have service projects.
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:44.600]   Because obviously, if you're serving someone else,
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:46.160]   then you're building your character.
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:48.260]   And we tell our students, it's not about you.
[00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:49.140]   If you think it's about you,
[00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:50.840]   you're never gonna be happy, right?
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:52.000]   If you think it's about another,
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.280]   you have a chance of finding that happiness.
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:59.480]   So, but we thought, who can we ask to come and speak to us
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:03.080]   on service leadership, right?
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:07.200]   And so we immediately thought of Jackie Pullinger, right?
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.500]   Now what you may not know is that Jackie Pullinger
[00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:13.160]   has an honorary doctorate from HKU.
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.740]   So that works really well.
[00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:16.680]   But she also, and most importantly,
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:21.280]   has dedicated her life and is continuing to serving others.
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.040]   And so we invited her to come on.
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:24.440]   And so we were interviewing her.
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:25.720]   So there's a stage, and if you imagine
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:28.060]   you're all the students, and then there's up here,
[00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:31.220]   my co-leader was interviewing her, Frances Choi.
[00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:34.320]   So Frances Choi starts the interview by talking to Jackie,
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:37.320]   and he says, "Jackie, you have done so much in your life,
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.360]   "and you are doing so much in your life.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:42.880]   "You must be a very driven person."
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:46.280]   And then Jackie says this.
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:49.440]   She says, "I'm not driven, I'm led."
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:54.120]   Now if you know Jackie, you know how she said that, right?
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:57.920]   "I'm not driven, I'm led."
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:02.920]   And that makes all the difference, if you think about it.
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:06.120]   And for our students, it really struck home,
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:08.040]   because they feel driven.
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:11.040]   They feel driven to meet the expectations of others.
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:12.880]   They feel driven to get the best job.
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.320]   They feel driven.
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.520]   It ran home to me.
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:18.800]   I'm like taking notes in the back, right?
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.940]   Because sometimes I feel driven.
[00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:26.100]   And maybe it resonates with you.
[00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:29.960]   Maybe there's parts of you that feel more driven than led.
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:34.720]   But in Jesus Christ, we are not driven, we are led.
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:35.560]   Amen?
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:37.660]   Very simple.
[00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:40.400]   Jesus as a good leader condensed it down
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:42.700]   to two words of what we're supposed to do.
[00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:45.200]   Follow me.
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.200]   That's the plan.
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:50.820]   That was the plan then, that's the plan now,
[00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:52.420]   is that we follow him.
[00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:58.740]   We are not driven by him, we are led by him.
[00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:04.080]   And Galatians 5.25 has this imagery of a dance, right?
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:08.420]   And it's like stay in step with the Holy Spirit.
[00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:12.220]   So the Holy Spirit's dancing, and we're staying in step.
[00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.100]   Some years ago, Miriam and I thought we would do
[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:17.700]   a couple dancing course, and it was fun.
[00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:20.300]   We had a fun time doing it.
[00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:23.340]   But we had a problem because it was couples dancing,
[00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:24.980]   so someone has to lead, right?
[00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:27.940]   And we're both leaders, so this was a trouble, right?
[00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:29.220]   No one wanted to follow.
[00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:35.260]   But it's not a question in the Holy Spirit.
[00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:38.460]   We follow the Holy Spirit, and trust me,
[00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:42.040]   he has a better plan than I do or you do, right?
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.840]   So we follow the Holy Spirit.
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.640]   Now, think about those two things,
[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:48.040]   following the Holy Spirit, think about we're not driven,
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:50.320]   we're not led, and then let's read through the rest
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:52.640]   of this passage as we get into it.
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:56.700]   So we begin again, and we pick up with verse 27.
[00:29:56.700 --> 00:30:00.400]   When the jailer woke and he saw that the prison doors
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:03.960]   were open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself,
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:06.880]   supposing that the prisoners had escaped.
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:09.240]   But Paul cried out with a loud voice,
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:12.040]   "Do not harm yourself, for we are all here."
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:14.280]   And the jailer called for lights and rushed in,
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:17.120]   and trembling with fear, the jailer fell down
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:18.720]   before Paul and Silas.
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.280]   This is a turn of events.
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:22.360]   And then he brought them out and said,
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:25.080]   "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:28.000]   And that word there, saved, literally means,
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.920]   it means rescued, it means wholeness,
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:35.180]   complete healing, well-being, it means life overflowing,
[00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:36.920]   as Carla was talking earlier.
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:39.440]   What must I do to be saved?
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:42.780]   And they said, "Believe," and that word is literally trust,
[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:44.560]   "in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved,
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:45.560]   "you and your household."
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:47.680]   And they spoke the word of the Lord to him.
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:49.800]   Do you see how this and is working?
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:51.640]   It doesn't say Paul or Timothy,
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:52.820]   they're just working together.
[00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:54.660]   They spoke the word of the Lord to him.
[00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:56.280]   And he took them the same hour of the night,
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:59.880]   and he washed their wounds, and he was baptized.
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.960]   So now we're seeing a conversion experience
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.880]   of the jailer, right?
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:08.840]   He's making reparations, he's making right for his wrongs,
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:11.560]   he's washing them, there's the water of baptism,
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:14.060]   then it goes on, and he invites them into their home,
[00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:17.760]   there's hospitality, he sets food on the table for them,
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:19.960]   right, this is where we like it as Hong Kongers, right?
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:22.300]   There's food now, and of course, when food comes,
[00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:23.840]   then also joy comes, right?
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:27.880]   And then it says after that, then there's joy, joy,
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:32.160]   unbelievable joy, and I don't think we talk enough
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:36.720]   about joy and salvation together, but there's joy.
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:49.060]   When I came to the Lord in northern Nigeria,
[00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:54.460]   it just was an experience that I knew this is right,
[00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:55.540]   and there was joy.
[00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:59.300]   So let me say this, if there's anyone here
[00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:02.460]   who has not yet said, "I wanna follow him,"
[00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:06.280]   like we've just heard, why not now?
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:09.080]   Why not even today if the Lord is speaking to you?
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.980]   Because there's always this invitation, follow me.
[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:14.260]   And all we have to do is kinda crack the window
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:17.700]   a little bit of our hearts, and this joy and change
[00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:19.500]   and rightness comes sweeping in.
[00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:23.100]   But we do have to act, we do have to say yes,
[00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:26.740]   'cause he's not someone who's gonna force himself on anyone.
[00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:31.700]   And so we say yes, it's the easiest thing in the world to do
[00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:36.540]   'cause all you have to do is give everything to Jesus.
[00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:40.220]   It's the hardest thing in the world to do
[00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:43.800]   'cause all you have to do is give everything to Jesus.
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:47.100]   But trust me, it's worth it.
[00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:52.540]   And if you're online, also you're invited.
[00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:59.420]   But most of us in this room probably have said yes.
[00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:01.840]   And we've been following, sometimes it's been in the dark,
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:03.700]   sometimes we're not sure exactly where it's going,
[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:05.740]   Jesus is going, but we followed him.
[00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:10.140]   And so the dance for us is not the dance of salvation,
[00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:14.700]   the dance for us is the dance of staying in step
[00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:16.040]   on a daily basis.
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:18.220]   Now if the dance metaphor is not working for you,
[00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:19.820]   that's fine, we can choose another one,
[00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:23.460]   you can say like music with maybe it's an orchestra
[00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:25.400]   and the leader is guiding everybody
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:29.260]   from what could be cacophony to beautiful music and joy.
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:31.620]   Maybe it's basketball, maybe you're imagining
[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:33.940]   that you're part of the Pacers, you're part of the Thunder
[00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:35.940]   and you're kind of tracking that
[00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:38.260]   and they're just moving so beautifully in step
[00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:41.420]   with each other, maybe it's just you're taking a walk
[00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:44.680]   and you're with someone you love and you're just in step.
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:51.660]   Whatever, the call for all of us is to stay in step
[00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:53.260]   with the Holy Spirit.
[00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:55.300]   So how do we do that?
[00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:58.720]   So I'm just gonna tell you one way that I have found helpful
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.600]   and offer it to you.
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.400]   Here's one way we can do it.
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:05.900]   We go back to Galatians 5.25.
[00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:11.680]   Galatians 5.25, if we live by the Spirit,
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:14.820]   let us keep in step with the Spirit, okay?
[00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:16.900]   So here's how we work with it.
[00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:19.540]   So tomorrow, it's homework number three,
[00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:21.260]   sorry, I've gotta get out of the university, right?
[00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:23.500]   But anyway, there's homework number three,
[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:28.500]   is tomorrow, when you go in, before you go in,
[00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:32.580]   so that would be today, if we live by the Spirit,
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:35.740]   let us keep in step with the Spirit, memorize it.
[00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:38.440]   Memorize it, it's easy to memorize.
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:41.060]   Actually better, learn it by heart
[00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:42.780]   because there's a difference.
[00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:45.740]   It's not just head knowledge, but learn it by heart.
[00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:47.340]   While you're memorizing it,
[00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:49.420]   thinking about how it applies in your life, right?
[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:50.860]   That's step one.
[00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:54.620]   Step two, you go in, you sit down wherever you are,
[00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:56.620]   or you stand up wherever you are at work,
[00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:58.540]   and you just say a prayer.
[00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:00.740]   Jesus, help me stay in step with you today.
[00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:05.260]   And then just keep your eyes open.
[00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:09.020]   Attentiveness is one of the highest forms of love.
[00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:12.440]   So be attentive to the movements of the Holy Spirit tomorrow
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:14.580]   as you love Jesus, right?
[00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:16.020]   And just see what happens.
[00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:18.740]   Sometimes what I find is I just run into random people.
[00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:19.660]   They're not random at all,
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:22.500]   but they're people I did not expect to run into on campus,
[00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:23.460]   but I do.
[00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:25.660]   And then maybe a thought comes, or a call comes,
[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:27.960]   or a text comes, or I feel prompted
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:30.460]   to send a text of encouragement to someone.
[00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:31.660]   That's part of the dance.
[00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:34.220]   That's part of staying in step with the Holy Spirit.
[00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:37.300]   So I found that helpful, and I offer it to you.
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:43.300]   Something that I think the Spirit can give us.
[00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:46.940]   Spirit is spiritual, but very practical.
[00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:49.100]   (silence)
[00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:54.980]   So where did Jesus go?
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:58.660]   That was the question.
[00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:01.500]   And sometimes the best questions come from children.
[00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:03.660]   Out of the mouth of babes, we get this beautiful wisdom.
[00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:05.460]   It's a tough question.
[00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:10.460]   But I have found that if I am going through those times,
[00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:15.020]   if I ask and find my and,
[00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:18.820]   seek and find my and, then it's better.
[00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:20.960]   Don't do life alone.
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:24.980]   And then I've also found that if I choose to sing,
[00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:29.620]   then it is a choice that I can make
[00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:31.100]   by the power of the Holy Spirit
[00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:33.060]   and the grace of the Holy Spirit.
[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:36.840]   And then, stay in step.
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:41.100]   We are not driven in Jesus Christ.
[00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:42.620]   We are led.
[00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:47.620]   Let him lead you into this beautiful life that is life.
[00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:49.900]   Amen?
[00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:52.560]   Okay, will you pray with me?
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:37:05.940]   We're just gonna take some time of giving you time
[00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:08.620]   to pray if you want to pray.
[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:11.980]   If you're not a follower, either online or here,
[00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:12.820]   that's okay.
[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:14.380]   I mean, you can still pray if you want to,
[00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:17.840]   or you can just reflect on what we've been talking about.
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:22.220]   But if you're here and you're a follower of Jesus Christ,
[00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:26.260]   if there was something that spoke to you,
[00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:29.360]   maybe more than other, go there.
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.980]   And when you go there,
[00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:34.280]   begin to have a conversation with God.
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:38.660]   So let me pray for you as you start that conversation.
[00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:41.000]   Jesus, I pray for humility,
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.540]   that in whatever that there place is for us,
[00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:45.260]   we would be humble to receive
[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:49.260]   and to know that we need to receive.
[00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:51.020]   And I pray for courage,
[00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:52.980]   courage that we would then receive
[00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:55.920]   and courage that we can know what to do.
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:59.560]   You tell us that blessed are those who don't hear,
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:02.260]   but blessed are those who do the word of God.
[00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:05.800]   We want to be blessed, Jesus.
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:10.420]   So just where you are, heart to heart with God,
[00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:13.160]   quiet your conversation.
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:16.440]   Let's pray to God.
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:19.020]   (gentle music)
[00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:21.600]   (gentle music)
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:25.180]   (gentle music)
[00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:27.760]   (gentle music)
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:37.760]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
