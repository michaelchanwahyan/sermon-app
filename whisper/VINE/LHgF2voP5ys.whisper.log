[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Well, Church, I'm really excited. We are in week two of our Post-Traumatic Growth series.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.600]   It's a series where we wanted to start 2021 focusing on this amazing idea that's been discovered in psychology recently,
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:23.400]   that in the worst moments of our lives, we can actually experience the greatest moments of our humanity,
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:34.400]   that we can actually change and transform and grow and be renewed in ways that would not have been possible unless the trauma had happened itself.
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:41.800]   That actually that trauma, that hardship, that pain, that suffering is actually the catalyst to our greatest moments of who we are,
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:48.600]   that we don't actually get defined by that trauma, that it doesn't become the place where we settle and put our roots down,
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:56.000]   but the trauma actually meets us in a place where we can find the hope of Christ rising us out of it in such a way
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.600]   that we couldn't have experienced the hope of Christ in that way unless we had been in the place of that trauma to begin with.
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:13.400]   You know, the research suggests, and I spoke about this last week, that that growth and that transformation happens in us in predominantly five main ways.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:25.200]   It takes place in the idea of our appreciation for life, in our relationships with others, in new possibilities for life, in our own personal strength,
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.400]   and finally, in our own spiritual transformation, our own spiritual change.
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:38.000]   And in this series, we're going to take a look at each one of those this week and over the next four weeks ahead, and we're going to unpack each one for you.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.800]   But as I was thinking about and praying about, what's the one that actually is the foundation of this series?
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:50.600]   What's the one that I think is most pertinent that we can speak to right up front to help prepare you for that change in your life?
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.600]   For me, it was new possibilities.
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.000]   And right here at the start of the message, I want to speak this over some of you.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.600]   Some of you are primed today by the Spirit of God to be woken into new possibilities in your life.
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.600]   When I was praying for this series, and particularly praying for this Sunday,
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.600]   I saw a picture for us as a church and for us individually that I want to share.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.000]   I saw a picture of a red traffic light.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.800]   It was just a very clear, very bright red traffic light.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.400]   And right in front of this traffic light, there was this bus.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.000]   And the bus was filled with people, and the bus was stopped, of course, at the traffic light.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.600]   But what was interesting in the picture was that the bus had been there for a very long time.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.600]   You could see dust on the top of the bus.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.800]   You could see that it was worn out and getting a bit rusty.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.000]   The tires of the bus were beginning to deflate.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.200]   You could see in the picture that the red light had been there for a long period of time,
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.400]   and the bus had been stuck in that place.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.000]   And what was amazing to me in this picture is I could see the people on the bus,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.800]   and the people themselves looked almost like they had resigned themselves to this place.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.600]   That because perhaps they'd been stuck at the red light for so long,
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.400]   that the bus and the journey and the destination didn't matter anymore.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.200]   They were stuck right there.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.600]   And because they'd been stuck for so long, they had begun to be comfortable in that place.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.200]   Almost as if that was the place that they were supposed to be,
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:23.200]   and they had long forgotten the destination that they were actually journeying towards.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.200]   I want to just speak on this right now,
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.200]   because I think that will resonate with some of you watching this.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.000]   Because of all the stuff that had taken place in 2020,
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.200]   maybe some of the personal trauma that you're actually carrying yourself,
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.400]   maybe some of the hardship that you've been facing.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.200]   I know many of us have lost jobs during this pandemic.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.000]   We've actually lost family members and loved ones.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Many of us have struggled with some of the hardest moments in life.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   And when we're like that, when we're in a place of trauma,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.400]   it can almost feel like a red light is in front of us.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.200]   A stop sign is right there, and it sticks to us.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.800]   And we become almost weighted in that place.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.800]   Almost like we put roots down in the place that we're stuck in.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.000]   And we think that we can't go forward. We can't move on.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.800]   And the idea of post-traumatic growth almost seems funny to us.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.400]   It's like, how can I grow in the mix of the place that I'm stuck in?
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.000]   I want to speak to you right now and tell you this right up front.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.600]   You were not created for the red light.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.600]   Listen to this. You're going to experience red lights in your life.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.800]   We're all going to experience them,
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.000]   and we've experienced some of those in the past 12 months.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.800]   But you were not created to put roots down in the place where you're stuck.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.100]   And in fact, actually the Spirit of God is at work,
[00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.700]   I believe, in this series and everything that we want to do through it
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:42.500]   to begin to take you from that place of being stuck and move you forward.
[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.500]   I believe the word that sits over the vine this year is to move forward.
[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.300]   And if you're feeling stuck today,
[00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.300]   I pray that what we're about to unpack in this message about new possibilities for you
[00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.300]   will be an encouragement and a powerful prophetic change for you
[00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:04.900]   to actually begin to move towards the destination that God had always planned for you.
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.300]   I want to inspire you about new possibilities today by sharing with you a story.
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.300]   It's a story that's famous to us.
[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.700]   It's a story from Scripture, the story of Simon Peter.
[00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.800]   And to help us to understand that story, I want to actually show you something.
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.500]   So just come with me for a sec.
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:29.700]   I want to show you the four primary elements that are found in the story of Peter's life.
[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:36.400]   And these four things are a net, they're a sword here, they're a fire and a sheep.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.200]   Let me show you those again.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.900]   Net, sword, fire and a sheep.
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.900]   And those four things are what actually comes to define the person of Peter.
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.600]   And those four things become actually the thing that we begin to see
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:56.200]   to shape the transformation of Peter into the new possibilities that Christ had for them.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.200]   So let me tell you the story of Peter's life.
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.100]   We first meet Peter actually on the shores of the Sea of Galilee.
[00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.000]   This is right towards the beginning of Jesus's teaching ministry.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.900]   And Jesus at this point in his life hadn't called any of the disciples to him.
[00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.300]   And he's teaching one day right there on the shores of the Sea of Galilee.
[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:21.000]   And in fact the crowd around him is so large that he begins to get swamped by that crowd.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   And he's so hemmed in by it that he looks around to see how he can kind of move away from them.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.900]   And he sees that there are two fishing boats right there.
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:34.400]   And he calls one of the fishing boats over and that boat belongs to a fisherman by the name of Simon.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.100]   And Jesus stands in the boat and he pushes a little bit out from shore.
[00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.400]   And he in that space can begin to teach the crowds.
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:47.400]   Now the Simon who's the fisherman who owns that boat is kind of a bit overwhelmed by what's taking place.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:52.900]   He's just been out all night fishing and him and his friends have not caught anything.
[00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.300]   And they've just come back right here at the early part of the day.
[00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.900]   They're tired. They're worn out. They've just come back.
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.500]   And suddenly this rabbi has gone in his boat told him to push out from shore.
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.400]   You can almost sense that there's Simon kind of sitting in the boat going like,
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:10.700]   "Okay, come on buddy, you know, like let's get this going. Let's get this done. Let's move on."
[00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:15.000]   Well, Jesus finishes teaching the crowds and then he turns to Simon
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.800]   and perhaps understanding the frustration that Simon's feeling.
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:24.200]   He says, "Hey, why don't you head out back into the heart of the lake and put your nets down one more time."
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:29.200]   Now Simon's an expert fisherman and he's not been able to catch anything all night.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.500]   He knows that this is just one of those days where the fish are not biting.
[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:37.200]   But perhaps out of respect to the rabbi, perhaps out of the fact of the crowds that were around,
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:42.000]   Simon obeys him, goes out into the middle of the lake and I can almost sense that he throws the nets out.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.300]   He's probably thinking, "Look, I'll prove to you that there's no fish here."
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:51.300]   And of course, we know the story. Peter catches the largest amount of fish that he has ever done.
[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.700]   I mean, it's so hard that they can't even seem to pull the nets in.
[00:07:54.700 --> 00:08:00.000]   And Simon suddenly realizes that this person sitting in his boat is not just some traveling speaker.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.900]   He's not just some rabbi. This person is a holy man.
[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:07.100]   What's taken place is a miracle of God.
[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:17.900]   And so Simon falls on his knees before the rabbi and he says, "Lord," he says, "go away from me, for I am a sinner."
[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:24.700]   Simon realizes in the light of this miracle and in the power that was obviously of God in this person,
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:30.400]   he was ashamed of the things that were sticking in him, the things in his life, the way that he was living his life.
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.200]   And he said, "I'm a sinner. You must leave me."
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:40.200]   And Jesus, in a moment of compassion that we'll see take place throughout the gospel stories,
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.800]   leans over and places his hand on Simon's shoulder.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:52.600]   And he says this, he says, "You do not need to be afraid, for from now on, you'll catch people."
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:58.200]   You're not going to be a fisher of fish. You're going to be a fisher of people.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.400]   That's now your destiny.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.300]   And here's Peter, thinking that his life revolves around this lake.
[00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:08.600]   And suddenly this rabbi, this holy man of God, calls him into a new possibility,
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:14.000]   calls him into a new time to leave his nets behind and begin to minister and walk out
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.700]   and try to reach the Jewish people, beginning to be understood that a rabbi,
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:22.100]   if a rabbi calls you and asks you to follow after him,
[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:26.500]   it was one of the most precious, important things that you could hope for as a young Jewish person.
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:30.200]   And so Peter and his colleagues, they move up to the shore.
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.300]   They leave the boats behind. They store up the nets.
[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:38.300]   They walk away from them and they start to follow Jesus.
[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:44.400]   And over the next three years, they encounter some of the most unbelievable events.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.100]   They see miracle after miracle.
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:51.000]   They see this one do things that they thought would never be possible before.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.100]   Turning water into wine, feeding five thousands, walking on water.
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:01.500]   And Simon begins to wrestle with the idea that this is more than just a prophet,
[00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:02.800]   more than just a rabbi.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:07.800]   Perhaps this one might be the long-awaited for Messiah that we were hoping would come.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:12.600]   And Jesus, eventually sensing this in Simon, turns to him one day and says,
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.000]   "Who do you actually think I am?"
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.900]   I mean, not what the crowds think I am, not what disciples think I am.
[00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:21.000]   Who do you personally think I am?
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.900]   And Simon turns to him and he says, "You are the Christ of God."
[00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:29.300]   I mean, you are the Messiah. He names it. He sees it.
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.600]   And in faith, he proclaims it.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:37.100]   And Jesus turns to him and says, "Okay, up until now, you've been called Simon,
[00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.200]   which in Hebrew means listener.
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:44.000]   I'm now going to call you Peter, which in the Hebrew means rock.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.800]   And this new name now classifies who you are, another new possibility for you.
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.900]   You are now going to be the foundation of my church.
[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:57.000]   Upon this rock, I will build my church.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.600]   The revelation of me as a Messiah and you now, Peter,
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:07.400]   as the one that I call to found and to build my church."
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:11.800]   The Bible tells us that as soon as that proclamation of the Messiah of Christ happens,
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:15.200]   and soon as Jesus changes his name,
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:20.700]   Jesus and the disciples begin to walk specifically towards Jerusalem.
[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.300]   And you can imagine for Peter how excited he would be.
[00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.100]   He's heard the stories.
[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.500]   He knows what's going to take place when the Messiah gets to Jerusalem.
[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.600]   He knows it's going to be a moment of great celebration.
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.200]   He knows it'll be the time when the Messiah will take his throne
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:39.700]   at the evil Greco-Roman Empire that had been so oppressing the people would be pushed back.
[00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:45.300]   He understood that this would be the moment where actually sin would be once and for all dealt with,
[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.600]   that there would be literally heaven on earth.
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.300]   It was a time of victory, of celebration.
[00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:57.700]   You can imagine how excited as they crest up that hill and they glimpse on Jerusalem for the first time.
[00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:04.000]   And then they walk into the city and nothing is as Peter had predicted.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:12.300]   I mean, Jesus, the conquering victorious Messiah, doesn't do anything that Peter thought he was going to do.
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:17.200]   He goes into the temple and he annoys everybody and pushes out the people that were trading there.
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.000]   He begins to teach the crowd about his death.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.500]   He begins to speak in ways that people are claiming he's blasphemous.
[00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:30.600]   I mean, here's Peter thinking that they've come into the place where finally the Romans are going to be pushed aside.
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:34.200]   And it actually seems like Jesus is getting pushed aside.
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:40.800]   Rumors are beginning to be said that actually Jesus might get arrested and killed.
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:44.200]   And Peter is thinking, "You cannot kill the Messiah.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:49.500]   I mean, that doesn't make sense. Like none of this is adding up."
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:54.700]   And then one evening, they're in this upper room and they're sharing in the meal of the Passover.
[00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:57.700]   And it's just Jesus and his 12 closest disciples.
[00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.300]   And there's Peter right next to him.
[00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:05.100]   And in the meal, Jesus begins to speak of the reality that in just a few days,
[00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:10.500]   most of them in that room is going to deny and betray him.
[00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:14.100]   And they're all sitting there and they're thinking, "That is not going to happen."
[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:18.100]   And Peter being the kind of boisterous one he was, he kind of jumps up and he says,
[00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:24.200]   "Lord, I'm prepared to go to prison. I'm prepared to die for you.
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:29.000]   Even if everybody here fails you, I will not fail you.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.900]   I mean, I am willing to even die with you.
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:37.500]   I will do that before I will ever disown you."
[00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:41.300]   Jesus, perhaps a little bit like that time on the boat,
[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:46.300]   leans over and puts his hand there on Peter's shoulders and he looks him in the eye.
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:53.200]   And he says, "Peter, before even this day breaks, before a rooster crows,
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.100]   you're going to deny me three times."
[00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:00.900]   And Peter's like, "There is no way that it's ever going to happen.
[00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:05.100]   I will die for you."
[00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.000]   That evening, they're out on the Mount of Olives
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.200]   and they're sleeping out there in the shadow of the temple.
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.200]   And as they're sleeping, a large army arrives,
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:18.300]   soldiers from the servants of the high priest.
[00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:21.600]   And they're carrying weapons and they all wake up and there's Peter.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.200]   And you can see that suddenly there's a confrontation
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:28.200]   that Rome and the Jewish authorities have come to arrest Jesus.
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.400]   And Peter does what he had said he was going to do in that upper room.
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:35.800]   He finds a sword that was lying nearby and he jumps forward.
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:39.300]   And one of the servants of the high priest is right there, also armed.
[00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:44.100]   And Peter swipes and he cuts off the ear of the servant.
[00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.500]   And Jesus sees this and he's so overwhelmed.
[00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.700]   He jumps forward and he rebukes Peter.
[00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:50.600]   Not the first time he's done that, by the way.
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.500]   He rebukes Peter and he says,
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.300]   "No, we will not do it this way."
[00:14:55.300 --> 00:15:00.700]   And he picks up the ear and he prays and he restores it on the servant's head.
[00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:04.200]   And then he does something Peter never would have expected.
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.900]   He allows himself to be arrested.
[00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:10.700]   No fighting, no violence.
[00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:14.100]   He actually gives himself up to the authorities
[00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.100]   and the authorities take him and bundle him up
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:20.500]   and walk him out away from the Mount of Olives.
[00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:23.400]   And there's Peter trying to comprehend everything.
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.000]   This is the Messiah.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.300]   This is the Christ.
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.100]   This is the one that we thought would change everything.
[00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:35.000]   And the ruling oppressive power has now arrested him and taken him away.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   And almost like Peter's in this daze, in this place of shock.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.400]   He follows after Jesus.
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.200]   He follows after the crowd that's leading Jesus away.
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.400]   And they take him to the high priest's house in Jerusalem.
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:49.400]   And they enter into this outer large courtyard.
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:53.900]   And then beyond the courtyard, a small crowd takes Jesus into the house.
[00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:58.100]   And Peter finds himself standing there on the outer courtyard
[00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:01.600]   trying to comprehend everything that's just happened.
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.600]   Now it's really early in the morning.
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.800]   It's super cold that night.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:12.500]   And he sees a charcoal fire at work just in the corner of the courtyard.
[00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:15.700]   And Peter finds himself walking over to the fire
[00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:20.400]   that is surrounded by a bunch of the servants of the high priest.
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:24.800]   And just standing there trying to warm himself on this fire.
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:28.600]   Peter's trying to comprehend and work it all through in his head.
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:32.600]   And he suddenly finds himself in a place of his greatest trauma.
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.700]   That everything he'd hoped for, everything he thought Jesus was going to be
[00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:39.500]   doesn't seem to be working out how he expected.
[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:44.500]   He realized that he's just been arrested and no doubt is going to go to trial.
[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:49.400]   And no doubt just a few days later is going to be executed.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.400]   And Peter's standing around that fire thinking to himself,
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:57.300]   this Messiah is about to be killed in the worst way that's possible.
[00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:02.100]   That the Romans had actually engineered this execution, crucifixion on the cross
[00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:04.200]   to be the most painful thing that it could be.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:07.000]   He's going to be crucified for a heretic.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.700]   And Peter's there thinking, hang on, if they're going to do that to the Messiah,
[00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:17.900]   imagine what they would do to one of his little followers.
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:22.800]   Right about that moment, a servant girl who's standing around the fire
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.400]   looks at Peter and recognizes him.
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:29.400]   And she says to everybody else there, she says, this was one who was with him.
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:33.200]   And Peter immediately says, woman, I do not know him.
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.400]   Denying him the first time.
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.600]   The woman, the servant girl persists.
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.700]   No, she said, no, I can tell in your accent that you're not from here.
[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:43.800]   You're a Galilean. You're part of his tribe.
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:48.000]   And again, Peter denies having ever known him.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.800]   By this time, the crowd had gathered around.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.100]   The other servants were there.
[00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:55.000]   They could see in the firelight his face.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.500]   And one of the relatives of the servant of the high priest who had had his ear cut off
[00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:03.900]   comes forward and recognizes that it was Peter who had done that.
[00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.600]   And again, he says, no, you are the one.
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.800]   You are the one who cut off the servant's ear.
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:12.300]   And Peter stands back from that moment and he says with a loud voice,
[00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:16.500]   I tell you, I never knew the man.
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.400]   The third time that he denies him.
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:25.900]   And immediately in the distance, a rooster crows for the break of a new day.
[00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:31.200]   Peter immediately remembers the words that Jesus had spoken on that day in the upper room.
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:36.800]   The Bible tells us that he ran out of the courtyard and he wept bitterly.
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.800]   That he realized for all that fighting words he'd had in the upper room,
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.900]   for all that bravado, I'm willing to go to prison.
[00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:43.300]   I'm willing to die for you.
[00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:46.800]   There it came to the very moment where he could have actually lived up to that
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:51.000]   and he denies even knowing his best friend.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.100]   He turns his back on Jesus in a moment where perhaps Jesus needed him the most
[00:18:56.100 --> 00:19:00.900]   and Jesus had never done that to him.
[00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:02.700]   And here's Peter weeping bitterly.
[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.500]   The Bible tells us the word there means he was in anguish,
[00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:09.500]   crying out, could not understand what he had just done.
[00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:14.100]   He felt such shame and embarrassment.
[00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:19.300]   That he would be so feeble in the moment when he should have stood up to be counted.
[00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:24.000]   He folded like a deck of cards.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.600]   The inevitable takes place, the trial and then the crucifixion on the cross.
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:33.700]   And then three days after that, people start to say that this Jesus is not dead.
[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:38.100]   That he's been resurrected, that he's come back from life, that he's alive.
[00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:42.600]   And Peter hears this and you can imagine how that might have felt for him.
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:45.000]   Well, you might have thought that that would be filled with joy.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.300]   Could you imagine Peter going, I don't know if I can face him.
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:54.100]   I mean, how can I stand before my best friend who I turn my back on on his darkest hour?
[00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:58.000]   How could I ever bring my, I mean, I'm as bad as Judas.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.600]   I betrayed him. I can't ever face him.
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:06.100]   I'm not worthy to be his disciple. I'm not worthy to be his friend.
[00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:11.000]   I am disqualified from everything that I ever thought would ever take place.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.400]   In the trauma that he's feeling, in the anguish and the shame.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:21.400]   Peter doesn't want to ever, ever put himself in the place
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:27.200]   where he might have to encounter the one that he had betrayed and denied.
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:31.100]   And it's there that I want to pick up the story.
[00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:33.900]   No one ever said the Bible was boring. That's not a boring story, is it?
[00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:37.300]   Don't ever let anyone tell you the Bible is a boring document, right?
[00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:41.400]   Let me pick up now the point of the story right here
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:45.000]   when Peter is overwhelmed and wondering what is next
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.800]   and wondering how he could ever face Jesus.
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:52.200]   This is from John chapter 21 starting in verse 1.
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:58.300]   "Afterwards, Jesus appeared again to his disciples, this time by the Sea of Galilee."
[00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:02.000]   "It happened this way, Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus,
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.700]   Nathaniel from Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee,
[00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:10.400]   and two other disciples were there together.
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:15.000]   'I'm going out to fish,' Simon Peter told them.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.700]   And they said, 'Well, we'll go with you.'
[00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:23.300]   So they went out, got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing."
[00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:26.900]   Notice the words here. Peter in front of his friends says,
[00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:29.400]   "I'm going to go out and fish."
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:33.800]   In other words, everything I thought was the thing that I was called into,
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:39.800]   everything thought that I was going to be, none of that I deserve anymore.
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.400]   Peter has gone right back to where he began.
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.800]   He's retreated right back to his old days,
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.800]   right back to the place where he was before Jesus called him.
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:52.100]   He's defaulted himself, got himself stuck right back at the very beginning,
[00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:54.400]   feeling that he is not worthy to do anything else
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.300]   other than go back out and be a fisherman.
[00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:58.700]   I might have left those nets behind before,
[00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:01.700]   but now those nets will become my life again.
[00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:05.200]   I don't even know how I could ever lift my head up in pride
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.100]   and even look Jesus in the eyes.
[00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:09.000]   I'm going to go out and fish.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.200]   It's the only thing that I deserve to do.
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:15.100]   And guess what? Once again, he goes out on that lake.
[00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:18.800]   He slaves all night and he catches nothing.
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:22.000]   This is what trauma does to us.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.500]   Trauma and the stress of it will always cause us
[00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:29.100]   to want to fall back to what we've always known
[00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:32.800]   rather than press on into the thing that we may have been caught into.
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:37.100]   Trauma and grief will always cause us to root ourselves backwards,
[00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:39.400]   will always cause us to think that we don't deserve.
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:44.200]   The stress creates what's talked about in psychology as fight or flight.
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.100]   And we've seen Peter do both in the story.
[00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:48.900]   The time where he picked up that sword to fight
[00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:52.000]   and then the time when he's gathered around that charcoal fire
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.400]   in the outer courtyard and he flees from knowing Jesus.
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.500]   And now here again, just days into the resurrection,
[00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:03.500]   he's fled again onto the shores of the Sea of Galilee
[00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:06.400]   to the place where he thinks he's the most comfortable
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.600]   doing what he thinks he should do
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:12.700]   because he feels he's disqualified from the thing that Jesus called him to do.
[00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.100]   I want to speak to some of you watching this right now
[00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:17.600]   because I get a sense that I was praying for this message
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:22.100]   that there's a bunch of us who are acting exactly like Peter right now
[00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.400]   where maybe something's taking place in your life.
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:28.200]   Maybe like Peter, you've done something that you're not happy about.
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.200]   Maybe you've done something that you're ashamed of.
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.500]   Maybe there's a sin in your life.
[00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:33.700]   Maybe you've hurt somebody that you're close to.
[00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:36.000]   Maybe you've acted in a certain way or done something
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.400]   and you are ashamed of it.
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:41.400]   You're embarrassed about it and you've actually had to pay a price for it.
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:45.100]   Maybe it's hurt the loved ones around you and you're really struggling
[00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:48.600]   and maybe there's been some consequences for that for you
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.900]   and because of those actions in the past,
[00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:54.200]   you feel like you are no longer qualified to do the things
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:57.500]   that you had on your heart that God had called you in to do.
[00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:02.100]   Maybe you've actually self-condemned yourself back to the old habits,
[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:06.400]   the old ways because you don't think you're worthy of the new
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.100]   or perhaps something's happened to you.
[00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:09.700]   Maybe not by your own fault,
[00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:12.700]   but something outside external to you has taken place
[00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:15.500]   that's caused you to feel like you're stuck,
[00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.700]   to feel like you're at that red light,
[00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:20.800]   to feel like this is the only place now that you deserve to be,
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:24.600]   that all the hopes and the dreams and the promises that you had are now gone for you.
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:27.700]   Perhaps that's the place where you feel like you're standing.
[00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:29.800]   If that's you, I want to say this.
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:32.200]   God stands over you in this moment and he says,
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:35.100]   "You need to remember I am in control.
[00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:38.300]   You need to understand that I have not distanced myself from you.
[00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:39.900]   I have not left you,
[00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:43.700]   that the place where you are right now is not your permanent home.
[00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:47.800]   You are not disqualified," says the Spirit of God to you.
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:51.900]   You are not disqualified ever from the kingdom of God.
[00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:56.900]   Peter felt like he deserved nothing other than to go back and be a fisherman
[00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:59.500]   and Jesus is about to show up and tell him,
[00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:03.400]   "You are never disqualified from my kingdom."
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:05.700]   Never disqualified.
[00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:07.500]   I want you to notice this.
[00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:10.600]   What happens next is that this figure shows up on the beach
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.900]   and there's Peter having done his fishing and caught nothing
[00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:16.000]   and they see this figure and the figure cries out and says,
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.400]   "Hey, did you catch anything?"
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:20.600]   Probably a common thing that was said in those days.
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:23.700]   Peter honestly replies back, "No, we caught nothing."
[00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:25.900]   And this one says something quite simple.
[00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:29.300]   He says, "Hey, why don't you throw the net on the other side of the boat?"
[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:33.200]   And Peter, perhaps going, "Well, we tried everything else,"
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.100]   throws his net on the other side of the boat
[00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:38.400]   and once again, there is a catch that they can't even pull in.
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:43.100]   The Bible says 153 large fish almost breaking the nets
[00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:46.100]   and in that moment, everything comes back for Peter.
[00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:49.400]   He's taken right back to that very first moment where Jesus met him,
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:52.500]   took him out on the boat, caught that miraculous set of fish.
[00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:56.100]   Now here he is all that time and he sees this person and he goes,
[00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:58.100]   "This is Jesus."
[00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:02.300]   I mean, the only person who can ever fill my nets like this is the Son of God
[00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:03.700]   and there he is and I love this.
[00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:04.700]   This is so Peter.
[00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:09.100]   Peter literally jumps out of the boat and begins to swim as fast as he can
[00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:13.700]   to get to the shore to meet with his Messiah and his friend.
[00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:18.000]   And I want to pick up now the moment in the passage where they actually get to the shore.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.200]   It's found in verse 9.
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:26.100]   It says this, "When they landed, they saw a fire of burning coals
[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:30.000]   where they had fish, where Jesus had put fish on it and some bread.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   Jesus said to them, 'Bring some of the fish that you have caught.'
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   Simon Peter climbed aboard and dragged the net ashore.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.500]   It was full of large fish, about 153, but even with so many the net was not torn.
[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:45.600]   Jesus said to them, 'Come now and have breakfast.'
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.400]   None of the disciples dared ask him, 'Who are you?'
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.800]   For they knew that it was the Lord."
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:54.300]   I want you to see what Jesus does here.
[00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:58.800]   Here he is on the beach and he's created what the scriptures say to us here
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.800]   as a charcoal fire.
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:07.600]   That phrase, a fire of charcoal, is only ever repeated one other time in the New Testament.
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.000]   Do you know when?
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.300]   When Peter was in the courtyard of the high priest, cold on that night
[00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:18.800]   and sees a charcoal fire and goes over and warms himself.
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:23.200]   Jesus creates the same environment for Peter
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:27.500]   and welcomes him back into the worst moment of his life.
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:31.800]   Now that might seem on the surface like a pretty harsh thing to do,
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:34.400]   but I want you to catch what Jesus is doing here.
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:38.600]   He's actually reframing the narrative of Peter's trauma.
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:44.200]   In creating a charcoal fire before him and actually inviting Jesus into that space,
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:48.000]   he's taking Peter right into the place where he denied him three times.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.100]   But in that moment, Jesus is now saying,
[00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:55.200]   "Let me take you back and actually reframe the narrative of your trauma.
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:59.300]   What you thought was the place of your worst moment
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:04.100]   is about to become the place of your greatest moment of humanity.
[00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:10.800]   I'm about to actually reframe everything you thought around the very charcoal fire
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:16.000]   where you denied me is about to become the place of your greatest redemption."
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.200]   I want you to know that this is very important in the idea of post-traumatic growth.
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:24.000]   We said last week that our growth from trauma does not take place
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.500]   by ignoring our trauma, by trying to walk away from it,
[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:31.100]   by trying to bury it or by trying to kind of bury the feelings that it creates in us.
[00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:33.700]   Jesus doesn't try to ignore what's taking place.
[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:37.800]   At the same time though, Jesus doesn't beat it over his head.
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:44.600]   Jesus gently, graciously brings him into the place of owning the reality of the moment,
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:49.600]   but not so he can feel shame, but instead so he can be redeemed,
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:52.600]   so that there can be a changing point for him.
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:55.100]   And that's what takes place in this conversation.
[00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:57.800]   Let me read it to you from verses 15 onwards.
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:00.200]   "When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter,
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:04.000]   'Simon, son of John, do you truly love me more than these?'
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.300]   'Yes, Lord,' he said, 'you know that I love you.'
[00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:08.500]   Jesus said, 'well then feed my lambs.'
[00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:12.000]   Again, Jesus said, 'Simon, son of John, do you truly love me?'
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.100]   He answered, 'Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.'
[00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:17.700]   Jesus said, 'well, take care of my sheep.'
[00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:21.100]   The third time he said to him, 'Simon, son of John, do you love me?'
[00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:25.100]   Peter was hurt because Jesus had asked him a third time, 'do you love me?'
[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:29.500]   He said, 'Lord, you know all things, you know that I love you.'
[00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:33.400]   Jesus said to him, 'feed my sheep.'
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:37.300]   Notice what takes place in that place of trauma.
[00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:40.300]   Three questions about whether he loves him
[00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:43.600]   for the three denials that took place in that courtyard.
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:48.600]   Three times where Peter is able to say out loud in that moment,
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:51.000]   'I do love you.'
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.300]   See, this is the powerful thing about Jesus.
[00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:56.300]   And this is the powerful pivot point for post-traumatic growth.
[00:29:56.300 --> 00:30:00.900]   See, Jesus is not interested in shaming Peter for his past mistakes.
[00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:04.800]   Instead, he wants to know what's on his heart right in that moment.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:08.600]   'Do you love me right now?'
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:11.700]   Like Jesus is not saying that was the worst thing.
[00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:14.500]   He's saying, 'what is in your heart right in this moment?'
[00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:17.100]   And Peter is there going, 'you know I love you.'
[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:18.900]   I love actually what he says right at the end.
[00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:23.300]   He says, 'Jesus, you know all things.'
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:26.000]   This is Peter's way of saying to Jesus,
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.900]   'you knew everything that took place in that courtyard.
[00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:31.200]   You know the trauma that I've been through.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:33.600]   You know the fact that I denied you three times.
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:36.200]   You know the fact that that has torn me up inside.
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:40.100]   You know the fact that I have retreated back here to the shores of the Sea of Galilee,
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:43.100]   doing the thing that I thought I was only responsible for.
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:46.900]   You know how terrible I feel about myself.
[00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:49.100]   You want to know what I think of you?
[00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:50.700]   I love you.
[00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:56.300]   I love you because I know that even in how terrible I feel,
[00:30:56.300 --> 00:31:00.500]   you're here right now, reaching out to me.'
[00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:04.300]   Peter understood that Jesus had not given up on him.
[00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:07.600]   And in saying those three times, 'I love you.
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:10.500]   I love you. I love you.'
[00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:14.300]   Peter was prophetically standing against the enemy's rule
[00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:17.400]   to try to keep him locked down in the red light of his life,
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:20.800]   to keep him stuck there in the place that was his past,
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:23.900]   rather than move forward into the thing that was his future.
[00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:27.900]   And Jesus knows that he needs to reframe the narrative of his trauma
[00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:31.100]   by speaking to him about his personhood, his identity.
[00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:33.900]   I want you to see here in this passage, it's quite a beautiful thing.
[00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:37.200]   Jesus refers to him as Simon, son of John.
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.000]   He doesn't mention Peter here.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   He actually goes back to his original name.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.400]   He says Simon, which means listener.
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:44.900]   And then he says son of John.
[00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:49.900]   See, Jesus is actually centering Peter in his true identity.
[00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:52.600]   He wants him to know who he truly is.
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.300]   He wants him to get right to the place of his identity
[00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:58.300]   and say the trauma has not defined who you are.
[00:31:58.300 --> 00:31:59.400]   You want to know who you are?
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.900]   You're Simon, son of John,
[00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:04.800]   who I changed the name to be Peter, which means rock.
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:07.900]   You are not what your trauma says you are.
[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:10.800]   You are this one right here, the one I love,
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:12.800]   the one who's sitting with me around this fire,
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:15.500]   restoring and redeeming the narrative of your trauma.
[00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:19.500]   You and your identity is not linked to the worst moment of your life.
[00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:21.300]   I need to preach this to someone right now.
[00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:26.600]   The sum total of who you are is not the worst moment of your life.
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:30.200]   And Jesus is getting into the very heart of the identity for Peter.
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:32.500]   And he's saying, Peter, do you want to know who you truly are?
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:35.100]   Simon, listener.
[00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:37.300]   That's who you are. You listen.
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:39.300]   You've heard my word. You know who I am.
[00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:41.700]   You just declared that you love me.
[00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:42.800]   And guess what?
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:49.500]   I am now releasing you out of a place of a restored identity into new possibilities.
[00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:52.600]   Note this. Every single time that Jesus speaks to him,
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:57.700]   he says, feed my sheep, feed my lambs, feed my sheep.
[00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:00.700]   Remember what took place in the very first time they met?
[00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:03.200]   Jesus says, oh, you don't need to be afraid.
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:06.300]   From now on you will catch people.
[00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:09.500]   Now Jesus takes it a step further.
[00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:13.000]   He says, hey, your identity is not just to catch people.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.300]   You're going to be the shepherd of my people.
[00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:19.800]   I want you to go from here and I want you to love my people
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:22.100]   with the same way that you love me in this moment.
[00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:25.300]   I want you to go from here out of the place of your trauma.
[00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:28.300]   And guess what? The fact that you felt shame,
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:32.300]   the fact that you were embarrassed, the fact that you thought you were nothing.
[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:34.900]   That's the people you're about to encounter out there.
[00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:38.400]   And as you go and start my church, as you found my church,
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:41.400]   I don't want you to go there just simply as a fisher of people.
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:45.000]   You need to go there as a pastor and you're going to be able to pastor my people
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.200]   because you felt brokenness yourself.
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:54.300]   Your trauma is the very thing that's going to be the root and the power of your ministry, Peter.
[00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:59.400]   This is Jesus redeeming him out of the place and saying nothing is going to be wasted.
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:03.500]   You're going to be able to go and pastor a group of people in such a powerful way
[00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:09.700]   that you would not have been able to do if you had not experienced the trauma in the first place.
[00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:16.100]   This is Jesus releasing Peter to the new possibilities of his life.
[00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:21.100]   And Peter from this moment will go and we see in church history what he does.
[00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:24.200]   He goes and preaches to the crowds of boldness and fire.
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:26.800]   Over 3,000 coming to Jesus in one day.
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.400]   He's a wounded healer.
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:34.200]   He goes and heals people in Jerusalem, just like Jesus healed people in the shores of Galilee.
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:38.600]   He goes and starts and founds the early church, the first church in Jerusalem,
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:40.500]   and passes it for many years.
[00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:43.600]   He writes letters, pastoral letters to his people
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:47.100]   that explains the beauty of forgiveness and the transformation of life.
[00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:51.800]   Why can he do all that? Because he's been forgiven himself.
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:58.100]   And Jesus is releasing him to new possibilities because of the trauma that he had been through.
[00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:04.900]   Now is the time, Peter, for you to become the one that I had always created you to be.
[00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:12.600]   So, a net, a sword, a fire, and then sheep.
[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:16.300]   Peter's story is also our story.
[00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:23.700]   The same God who met Peter is the same God that's alive in my story and your story.
[00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:27.300]   And I want you to know you are never distant from God.
[00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:30.700]   I want you to know that that red light that you feel like you're sitting in front of
[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:33.000]   does not define who you are.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.600]   I want you to know that as real as trauma is, as hard as it can be,
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:41.000]   it does not shape the fullness of your identity.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.900]   I believe that Jesus wants to show up at each one of our beaches.
[00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:48.600]   He wants to show up at your beach right now.
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:52.900]   After you have struggled over your long, dark night of trauma
[00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:54.700]   and felt like you have received nothing,
[00:35:54.700 --> 00:36:00.400]   Jesus will come and stand on the shore of that beach and He will tell you He is in control.
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:04.200]   He will actually assert His authority over your life again.
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:09.100]   He will actually invite you to that place of your moment of identity and who you are.
[00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:12.800]   He will begin to speak new possibilities over you,
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:16.300]   begin to take you from a place where you were to a place where you're going to be.
[00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:20.700]   And He knows that the scars that you carry from the trauma that you're in right now
[00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:25.700]   is going to be the very thing that's going to bring healing to the many that He wants to bring into your life.
[00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:29.700]   What happens to Peter also now becomes a part of our journey.
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:33.300]   That's true post-traumatic growth.
[00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:35.600]   New possibilities for you.
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:37.600]   Some of you watching this right now,
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:42.800]   there are new possibilities for you in the workplace that you have never allowed yourself to think about.
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:46.200]   Maybe you've never been willing to take the risk in a new adventure
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:49.400]   or a new investment or a new opportunity at work.
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:54.100]   And maybe some of you have wanted to change jobs for a long time and just haven't had the courage
[00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:57.700]   and God stands over you in this time of trauma of pandemic
[00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:01.200]   and He says, "You want to know what's ahead for you? Open your heart to me again.
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:06.200]   I want to speak to you and give you courage and boldness for new possibilities."
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:09.200]   Some of you, those new possibilities are in relationships.
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:11.900]   Some of you, you've got fractured relationships in your life,
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:15.300]   maybe because of some things you've done or because of what others have done to you.
[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:17.400]   And I feel like Jesus stands over you right now
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:20.500]   and welcomes, invites you into new possibilities,
[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:23.200]   maybe to repair relationships that are broken
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:26.600]   or it might be to launch you into some new relationships
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:30.500]   that you thought you would never want it once again, ever receive.
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:36.700]   Actually, as I'm saying this right now, I feel like some of you feel like you cannot be loved.
[00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:40.900]   I feel like right now, some of you feel that you can't be loved.
[00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:42.000]   Maybe you've done something wrong.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.300]   Maybe someone's done something to you
[00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:48.700]   and it's left you in a place where you think, "I can't be loved anymore."
[00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:52.300]   And I want you to know that there are relationships ahead of you
[00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:54.600]   that are filled with new love for you,
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:59.300]   new possibilities of relationships that you've not allowed yourself to even consider
[00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:03.200]   because you feel like you're not worthy to be loved by someone else again.
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:07.700]   I feel like that's really important for some people who are divorced watching this right now.
[00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:10.400]   You feel like you're on plan B.
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:14.200]   And I feel like the Holy Spirit's saying right now, there's new possibilities for you.
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:19.400]   New possibilities for you to be loved in a way that you perhaps never anticipated or expected.
[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:22.900]   And perhaps for some of you, that new possibility is in your faith.
[00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:26.800]   Maybe this year is the year for you to take that step forward in faith.
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:28.900]   Maybe you know that God's been calling you into something
[00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:32.300]   and you've been holding back, thinking maybe you're not worthy or deserving of it
[00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:34.800]   or maybe just afraid of it.
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:37.200]   I pray that the Spirit of God would fall on you right now
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:41.000]   and fill you with something that would enable you to have the courage to step out.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.100]   Be strong and courageous, I hear the Lord say.
[00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:47.900]   I hear the Lord say, "I'm not worthy of you, but I'm calling you to step out."
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:50.800]   And I pray that the Spirit of God would fall on you right now
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:54.800]   and fill you with something that would enable you to have the courage to step out.
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:57.600]   Be strong and courageous, I hear the Lord say.
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:00.300]   Be strong and courageous, I hear the Lord say.
[00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:03.600]   And I pray that the Spirit of God would fall on you right now
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:07.800]   and fill you with something that would enable you to have the courage to step out.
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:10.800]   Be strong and courageous, I hear the Lord say.
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:14.100]   And I pray that the Spirit of God would fall on you right now
[00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:18.100]   and fill you with something that would enable you to have the courage to step out.
[00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:21.100]   And I pray that the Spirit of God would fall on you right now
[00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:25.100]   and fill you with something that would enable you to have the courage to step out.
[00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:28.100]   And I pray that the Spirit of God would fall on you right now
[00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:32.100]   and fill you with something that would enable you to have the courage to step out.
[00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:35.100]   And I pray that the Spirit of God would fall on you right now
[00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:39.100]   and fill you with something that would enable you to have the courage to step out.
[00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:42.100]   And I pray that the Spirit of God is here for you to move you forward.
[00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:45.100]   Can we pray together? Let's pray.
[00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:49.100]   Father, we just thank you for this moment.
[00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:52.100]   Lord, I want to pray for everybody in this room.
[00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:55.100]   I want to pray for everybody who's watching online.
[00:39:55.100 --> 00:40:01.100]   I want to ask that your Holy Spirit would come and minister to us new possibilities, Lord.
[00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:05.100]   Some of us, like Peter, we've run backwards.
[00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:10.100]   That picture of being stopped at a red light resonates with us deeply.
[00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:14.100]   Would you hear the Holy Spirit today saying, "This is not the place I've designed you to be.
[00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:19.100]   I've not designed you to put roots down at the red light."
[00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:24.100]   Some of you have gone back to fishing.
[00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:28.100]   And I feel like the Lord is saying over you, "Drop the nets.
[00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:31.100]   It's time for you to move forward again.
[00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:35.100]   Don't let the enemy define who you are through your trauma,
[00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:42.100]   but allow the trauma to actually be the deposit of the things that the Holy Spirit is going to use most for his glory ahead.
[00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:44.100]   For those of you that feel like you're no longer lovable,
[00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:50.100]   the love of Christ speaks over you against the lie of the enemy to hold you back.
[00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:54.100]   For some of you who feel like you can't move forward in a calling that God has for you,
[00:40:54.100 --> 00:41:01.100]   I come against the enemy's strategy to put you on the boat on the lake rather than on the shore moving forward.
[00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:05.100]   For some of you who feel like you're at an end point,
[00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:09.100]   I pray new possibilities in the name of Jesus over you.
[00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:11.100]   Father, we don't do this in our own strength.
[00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:13.100]   We don't do this because we try to be better people.
[00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:15.100]   We do this because of a work of your Spirit.
[00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:19.100]   So Spirit, break out. Spirit, break out.
[00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:21.100]   Heaven, come down.
[00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:27.100]   Lord, would your presence and your Spirit fill me and change me, renew me and send me forward
[00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:29.100]   into the person that you've always created me to be.
[00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:34.100]   Not in my own effort, but in the grace of the power of the Spirit of God.
[00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:38.100]   And we pray that over every person at the Vine, over every person watching this,
[00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:40.100]   and we thank you that you release us into this.
[00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:44.100]   In Jesus' name. In Jesus' name.
[00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:46.100]   Everyone says, "Amen."
