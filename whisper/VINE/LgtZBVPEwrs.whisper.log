[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120]   Welcome to everybody. If you're joining us online, welcome to you too.
[00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.960]   And out in the overflow, we're glad that everybody's here this morning.
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.560]   I do, I have problems remembering things.
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.880]   It was encounters with God, but for some reason I keep on saying encountering God.
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.800]   Last, a couple of weeks ago when I was preaching,
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.880]   kept on saying persevere instead of press, anyway, okay, forget about it.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.640]   Okay. I have many problems. Okay. Is that what I'm trying to say? Okay.
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.520]   One particular, apart from the obvious, right?
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.400]   Things I am working to improve about myself. Okay.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.200]   There's honestly, there's one thing, one area that I see
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.880]   that I really don't like, but I'm trying to improve.
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.080]   Okay. And this problem is this.
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.760]   My problem is that every time someone starts giving me instructions or directions,
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.400]   my brain shuts down. Okay.
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.760]   Now you could see it's like a male thing. Okay. I don't know. Okay.
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.560]   I don't do it on purpose. Okay. I don't think I do,
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.640]   but it's weird because, you know, I think I'm a relatively good listener.
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.920]   I like to be helpful. I like people. I generally think I'm quite teachable.
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.480]   You can ask Carla and my colleagues if that's the case. All right.
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.840]   But for whatever reason, when someone describes, starts describing something to me,
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.360]   or especially when it comes to directions, how to get somewhere,
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.400]   or it's an instruction book or a recipe, I suddenly stop listening to words.
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.480]   Like the words just don't make sense. And it all sounds like,
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.480]   right. And my brain goes off. You know, those dream lands when people go off to in the movies,
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.800]   like, I'm thinking about like paddling on the ocean or whatever else. Right.
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.680]   Anything but listening to the instructions.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:42.000]   Now, the most messed up thing is sometimes I'm the one that asked for the instruction
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.320]   in the first place. Right. Even then my brain shuts down. Right.
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.360]   But okay. The skill, I'm not sure if you could call it a skill, right.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.600]   The trick is I look like I'm engaged. Okay. So I'll be nodding my head.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.880]   Yep. Wow. That's interesting. Wow. Wow. That's wild. You know,
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.560]   also works when you want to pretend to be listening to your significant other and
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.520]   they're saying things, you know, it's like, wow, that's crazy. Right. Those kind of phrases. Okay.
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.680]   But if you ask me, like, what did that person just say? Or, you know,
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.200]   what were the instructions? If you wanted me to repeat that, forget about it. Okay.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.920]   Now it's kind of funny and sometimes, but I think for me, this really gets me in trouble when I start
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.520]   hearing from God. Because many times when I talk to God, I'm talking to God because I feel like I
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.400]   need some sort of guidance, some sort of instruction. But then my problem is, okay,
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.760]   when God responds and he answers, when he's giving me good instruction in what to do,
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:48.320]   am I willing to listen and to obey? And in our journey, in this series of encountering God or
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:54.880]   encounters with God, we are looking at today, the story of Joshua. And if I could turn up,
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.880]   if I could sum up the story of Joshua in just one phrase, it would be this,
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:06.880]   remember the importance of obedience. So let's take a look at the story and see what it has to
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:14.400]   say. Now, the story of Joshua sort of serves as a turning point in the lives of the Israelites.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.040]   Last week, Promise talked to us about Jacob and how God changed Jacob's life. He wrestled with
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:29.040]   Jacob and he changes his name to Israel. Well, now Jacob, aka Israel, then goes on to have 12 sons
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:36.240]   and one daughter. And the sons go on to establish what becomes known as the 12 tribes of Israel.
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:43.040]   And so the beginnings of a new nation are already starting to be formed. Now through one of Jacob's
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:50.480]   sons, Joseph, they all end up in the land of Egypt. But it's interesting because Egypt is not
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.080]   their land. They're starting to become a nation, a great big people group, but they don't have their
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:02.080]   own land. That's been promised to them ever since Abraham, but God is yet to fulfill this promise.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:08.880]   And so the Israelites start to grow and prosper in Egypt, but the Pharaoh then becomes threatened
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.800]   and decides to take them into slavery. This group of people, they're growing, they're not our own
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.640]   people. We need to keep this under control. And so the Israelites get taken into captivity,
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.760]   into slavery. And whilst they're in slavery, they cry out to God for help. They cry out to God,
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.520]   you know, where are your promises? Where are you Lord? And so God raises and sends Moses to deliver
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:37.680]   them out of slavery. So Moses leads the Israelites out of Egypt into freedom through the wilderness.
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.400]   And through the time in the wilderness, they continue to see God work and provide for them
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:49.520]   in miraculous ways. Things like parting the Red Sea, giving them the daily bread and meat,
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:55.040]   making water gush out from the rocks. He helps them defeat the enemies around them when they're
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:01.680]   attacked. But the most important thing God does with them at this time is to make a covenant.
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:08.000]   And within this covenant, there are rules, instructions, and directions on how to live
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   their lives so they can live as an example to the nations around them and demonstrate what God is
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.800]   like. This is their calling, right? You're God's chosen people set apart. This is how then I want
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:27.760]   you to live as my people. This is what the covenant is about. And so all this time, they are
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:33.040]   slowly stumbling the way towards the promised land where God will eventually settle them.
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:39.600]   Now Moses, their leader at the time, however, is not able to lead the Israelites into the promised
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:45.840]   land. He actually dies just before he can see it happen. And so the book of Joshua starts as the
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.720]   Israelites are on the cusp of entering the new land, entering this promised land that God has
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:58.240]   given to them. And Joshua takes up the mantle to become Israel's new leader. This is the turning
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:07.200]   point. Now put yourself in Joshua's shoes for a minute. Think about what this moment has been.
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:13.680]   Again, if you remember the story, Joshua had actually seen the promised land before.
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:20.880]   Way back in the day when Joshua was a younger man, he was a spy sent by Moses along with 11
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:26.960]   other spies to check out the promised land. Now if you know the story, the 12 spies come back,
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:32.960]   10 of them give a bad report. It's like, "Aya, too big a people, too strong. We cannot enter
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:38.560]   the land. We're too weak. They're too big." Okay, it's not going to happen. We're not able to defeat
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:46.480]   them. But two of the spies, Joshua and Caleb, God says had a different perspective. They had a
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:52.800]   different spirit. They had faith. And they knew that if God was the one who had told them to take
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:59.440]   the land, yes, the enemy might be strong. Yes, it might look like it's impossible. But if God had
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:06.480]   said it would happen, then nothing would be able to stop them. And so as a result, God said the
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:11.440]   other spies and that generation of people who did not believe would not be allowed to enter into the
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:18.080]   promised land because they didn't obey God, because of the lack of faith. And only Joshua and Caleb
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:24.080]   would in the end end up entering into the promised land. And so what happens is they end up roaming
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:30.400]   around in the desert until this unbelieving generation had died off. But now, as I said,
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:37.200]   the moment is here. Joshua is ready. You can sense his anticipation. It's palpable.
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:44.480]   The promised land awaits. And God reassures him with these famous words, Joshua 1.9. You probably
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:51.440]   have a coffee mug with this on it, right? "Have I commanded you, be strong and courageous. Do not
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:58.640]   be afraid. Do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go."
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:06.160]   So Joshua starts making preparations. There's a battle ahead, right? Because even though this
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.720]   land has been promised to them, like I said, they are cities and strongholds. There's people
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:18.800]   already living there that need to be defeated. And the first city he needs to take over is the city
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:24.960]   of Jericho. Now, Jericho was a big, strong, fortified city. A city that did not worship
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:30.320]   God. They worshiped the pagan gods, who religious practices involved the evils of things like child
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:36.400]   sacrifice, right? Things like that. They definitely did not follow the God of gods, the king of kings.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:43.120]   A big, strong city, though. Thick walls. From the outside, it looked strong, unshakable. It looked
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:50.640]   like an impossible challenge. And so Joshua, being the good military leader that he is, he had some
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:55.600]   tactics. He had some plans in mind. And he sent spies to check out what the situation is there.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:00.000]   But when the spies come back, this time, the report is a bit different.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:07.920]   So during the spy mission, the spies are helped by a woman called Rahab. Rahab is a Canaanite
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:14.080]   prostitute that lives within the walls of Jericho. And through Rahab, they realize that the whole
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:19.520]   city is, in fact, terrified of the Israelites. They're terrified because they have heard the
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:24.320]   stories of the Israelites, right? How God defeated the Egyptians, how God parted the Red Seas,
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:31.360]   how God helped them with the different nations. And so Rahab begins to realize who this God is.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:39.040]   Rahab recognizes, these are words, that the Lord your God is God in heaven and above and on the
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:46.640]   earth below. And so Rahab promises, "I will help you, spies. I will help you. I'll keep you hidden.
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:52.720]   I'll keep you safe. If, in return, when the time comes for Jericho to be destroyed,
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:58.720]   me and my household, those in my house, we're going to be spared." And the spies oblige. They
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:05.040]   say, "Yes, if you help us, you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours. Good guanxi, good Chinese
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:14.000]   practice." The spies oblige, and so they move on. Now, there is one more situation, though,
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.160]   that the Israelites need to face before finally entering into Jericho. The entire nation of Israel
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:27.760]   has to once again cross over a body of water. This time, it's the Jordan River. And God is faithful.
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:36.400]   Just as God parted the Red Sea, God does the same thing. The waters of the Jordan River are parted,
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:42.800]   and the Bible tells us the Israelites are able to pass through on dry ground. The entire nation,
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:48.880]   the millions of people are able to pass through on dry ground. And so the Israelites celebrate,
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:53.600]   "God is faithful, God is good." They build an altar in the middle of the river to remind them
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:11:00.480]   of this moment. It only serves, though, to remind the surrounding nations around Israel at this time
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:07.760]   who God is. And it says, "When all the Amorite kings west of the Jordan and all the Canaanite
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:12.240]   kings along the coast heard how God had dried up the Jordan before the Israelites until they
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:19.200]   crossed over, their hearts melted in fear, and they no longer had the courage to face the Israelites."
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:28.000]   So the enemies are shaken, but the Israelites are celebrating. Now, why are we recalling all of this?
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.400]   It's always good, I think, for us to take a moment and remember God's faithfulness in the past,
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:42.000]   just as Emma encouraged us to do just now. Because, yes, the task at hand for Joshua was big,
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.440]   and seemingly impossible. But look at what had God done for them in the past.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:53.200]   Look how faithful God has been. Whenever the Israelites had something that needed,
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.600]   God was there for them. Whenever God gave them instruction and told them what to do,
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:04.880]   and they listened, things go well for them. Even the impossible situations, God always comes through.
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:10.720]   It's only when they disobey and turn away from the laws, turn away from the government,
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:14.800]   from the covenant that they have made with God, that things start going badly.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:22.640]   It's a reminder for us today. As we live our lives, as you look ahead, are you facing challenges? Are
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:27.200]   you noticing some things that are coming up that are going to be tough, that are going to be hard?
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:35.840]   Take time. Think back to how God has guided you in the past. Remember that there was one point in
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:40.640]   your life, I'm sure we've all been there, a point where you thought this is the lowest of the low.
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:46.240]   There is no way I'm moving on from here. But by the grace of God, here you are sitting today.
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:52.160]   Let that be an encouragement to how he will continue to walk with you and be with you in
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:57.920]   the future. I think this is exactly what Joshua would have been thinking. Like I said, on the
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:03.920]   cusp of entering into the long-awaited promised land, like the boxer on the eve of the biggest
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:10.080]   fight of his life, recalling all the past battles and all the past pain, it's about to be worth it.
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:15.280]   From growing up as a slave boy in the land of Egypt, seeing God rescue them in the most
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:20.560]   miraculous of ways, fighting alongside Moses. Now, of course, he's going through the grief,
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:29.600]   burying one of his mentors and his best friends. 40 years later, Joshua's moment arrives.
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:35.280]   The new Israel, the new leader, finally seeing the fruit of his faith.
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.800]   Remember what promise was saying last week about the waiting?
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:46.960]   Sometimes that waiting might take 40 years. 40 years, Joshua waited.
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:51.280]   For those of us waiting on things that God has promised you,
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:59.440]   hopefully this is an encouragement too. Your time is coming yet. And God is not slow to
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:05.360]   fulfill his promises as we understand slowness, but God will always be faithful.
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:14.000]   And in this moment, just before entering into Jericho, the Bible tells us Joshua has an encounter
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:21.760]   with God. Now, when Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:29.520]   with a drawn sword in his hand. Now, this would have been quite an unusual sight indeed. Doesn't
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:34.000]   really tell us what Joshua was doing. Maybe he was taking like one more scouting, one more trip,
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   you know, I'm really ready for the next day. Remembering the situation, right? He is about to
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:47.200]   go into war. He's just outside of enemy territory. And Joshua himself, a military man, a warrior,
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:53.920]   so seeing a man with a drawn sword would have put him on high alert. A drawn sword was a sign that
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:59.680]   this person was ready to fight. It's, you know, I'm about to engage in battle. Why else would you
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:06.160]   draw your sword? But I don't think this was ever supposed to be an act of aggression. I think this
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:13.360]   was God's unique way of trying to capture Joshua's attention. You see, God did the same thing to his
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:20.080]   leader, to his mentor Moses a few years ago. The whole thing is the echo of what Moses experienced
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:25.280]   in his wilderness. When God first called Moses, he too was walking around in the wilderness
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:31.840]   looking after the sheep. He sees a strange sight, right? A bush that's on fire but doesn't burn up.
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:36.480]   So in his context, this is strange. I've been in the wilderness all this time,
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:40.080]   you know, a bush that doesn't burn up that's on fire. I'm going to go and check it out.
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:48.320]   God uses something he knew would capture Moses's attention to draw him close. And Moses responds.
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:55.440]   And in the same way now, God is trying to capture Joshua's attention. And he too does it in a way
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:16:01.040]   that he knows Joshua will notice. A man with a drawn sword would have captured the attention
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:10.240]   of a military man. And so Joshua responds. Our question for today, church, I wonder how
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:17.680]   God might be trying to grab your intention and initiate an encounter with you. This is a reminder
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:21.920]   for us to be on the lookout for these moments. Okay, they're probably not going to happen all
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:27.200]   the time, but God knows you and he knows the things that are going to grab your attention.
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:32.560]   The question is, will we have the eyes to recognize these moments? And when we recognize them,
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:41.280]   will we then have the heart to respond? And we see that Joshua is ready. He sees a man and he
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:49.280]   responds by engaging with the man and asking him a question. Are you for us or for our enemies?
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:57.280]   It's beautiful. I love how direct Joshua is in this moment. His heart reflects the heart of a
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:03.680]   warrior and a leader. He doesn't back down. He stays true to his calling as God gave him, right,
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:09.440]   to be strong and courageous. Because as the leader of Israel now, there is a certain sense of
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:14.960]   a responsibility on him, right? He needs to know what he's dealing with here. Because if this
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:20.480]   person is for them, then maybe he could invite them, invite him to join them and help in his
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:26.560]   fight. But if he's part of the enemy, this is going to be a problem, right? You have your sword,
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:30.000]   okay, I'm going to draw my sword. Let's throw down right now, okay? So he's thinking these
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:39.040]   things, right? He is relishing his role as the leader. He's ready. But what he's not ready for,
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:43.440]   I think, what he didn't think was going to happen was the answer that this man gives.
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:49.120]   And the answer the man gives makes Joshua realizes, actually, this isn't just a normal
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:55.600]   person I'm talking to. But he's having an encounter with someone who is truly divine.
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:02.960]   The response is this, neither or no, he replies. But as a commander of the army of the Lord,
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:09.360]   I have now come. Then Joshua fell face down to the ground in reverence and asked him,
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:16.320]   "What message does my Lord have for his servant?" Now, if you look through commentaries,
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:21.120]   that's a lot of questioning as to the identity of this person, who he really is.
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:26.480]   There's a common understanding, this is an example of the theological term for this,
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:33.760]   is a theophany, meaning this was an example of God himself manifesting in human form. Maybe a bit like
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:38.960]   what Jacob experienced last week, or Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the fiery furnace,
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:44.160]   there's a fourth person with them, that kind of a thing. Some people say that this was maybe a
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:50.480]   high-ranking angel in the Lord's army. We know that God has legions and legions of angels ready
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:56.080]   to fight on his behalf at any moment. Some people think it was an angel representing God, so sort of
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:02.560]   like a heavenly spokesperson. No matter who it is, there is no doubt that this is not a human being.
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:11.200]   But this was God's way of encountering Joshua. And so his first response is to fall in worship,
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:15.680]   probably the only appropriate thing he could have done.
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:23.600]   Now, as I was reading this, it made me wonder, how would I respond, or how would we respond,
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:31.600]   if we suddenly found ourselves face-to-face with God? I mean, on a comical sort of level,
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:36.240]   I wonder if we could even handle it. I've seen people lose their minds when they encounter
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:43.280]   celebrities. I remember when I was about probably eight or nine years old, I was swimming at the YMCA,
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:51.600]   and Andy Lau suddenly appeared. Back then, this was the early '90s, dating myself a little bit,
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:57.840]   but Andy Lau was probably the most popular pop star, movie star in Hong Kong at that moment.
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:03.840]   It's such a vivid memory. I remember what he was wearing. He wasn't wearing normal
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:08.800]   swimming shorts. He was wearing a bathing suit for men. So he had the straps that went down,
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:13.680]   like a mankini, I guess is what you call it. It was black and white stripes. Now,
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:19.360]   girls were going absolutely crazy. "Wah, wah, wah!" Literally flocking towards him,
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:24.960]   trying to push him into the pool. Literally, the girls were going crazy for Andy Lau. And I thought
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:29.760]   to myself, "I've got to get into myself one of those swimming costumes, okay? Maybe that's what's
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:36.720]   working for him. I don't know." But we react when famous people come into it. If Taylor Swift
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:42.160]   walked into this room right now, we would go nuts. This place would be bonkers with all over YouTube,
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:47.280]   all over the news. She would start singing. We would sing along. It would be crazy.
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:53.360]   Sometimes I think we think that's what encountering God is going to be like. "Oh,
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:58.720]   yes. It's going to be amazing. It's going to be so exciting, so cool. It's going to be so great."
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:05.280]   But I think we might have to take a step back and think again if that's what's in our minds.
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:11.120]   Because here's the thing. We say we want to have these encounters with God,
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:19.040]   but are we really ready for them? We say we want to see God's glory,
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:27.360]   but do we really know what seeing God's glory really means? Because when we look back through
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:33.680]   Scripture, a lot of times when people have these encounters with God, two things happen. First,
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:40.880]   there's the initial reaction. Often this includes things like fear and trembling, like Joshua
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:47.520]   falling face down is a common reaction. Being unable to move is a common reaction. Realizing
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:52.800]   that we are sinful in the presence of holiness and a sense of impending doom upon our lives,
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:59.680]   that's a common reaction. But the second thing is this is usually followed. An encounter with God is
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:08.240]   also almost always followed by a command. Something we are to do. Something we need to follow.
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:17.280]   Something that's going to require our obedience to Him. So let me ask this again. Do we really
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:23.280]   want to have an encounter with God? Because having a true encounter with God will most
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:30.480]   likely demand something from you and end up changing your life. Sometimes I think
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:37.280]   we want to encounter with God because then we can finally have Him where we want Him.
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:42.720]   We can tell Him what we want and He'll give it to us. We want God to come into our space.
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:49.840]   We think we want to encounter God because that's the way to get God on our side. But when we look
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:54.800]   at God's response to Joshua, it's a reminder for us. This is a truth that maybe we don't talk about
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:23:00.800]   very often. Let me remind you, Joshua asked the questions, "Are you for us or for our enemies?"
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:10.400]   God's answer is, "No, neither." I beg your pardon. These are the Israelites. These are God's people.
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:16.720]   Hasn't God been leading them precisely to this time and place? And yet before the biggest battle
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:22.640]   they're ever going to face, God is saying, "I'm not actually on your side." What happens
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:30.240]   with the promise that He would be with them wherever they go? Sometimes as human beings,
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:35.600]   we want to give God our agenda. This is something we've become very good at. We want to drag God
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:41.200]   into our preferences and our ideas, claim that God is on our side because we want to make God fit
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:47.040]   into our plans, to what we think is right. But really, church, it needs to be the other way around.
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:56.720]   God is reminding us He doesn't take sides. God stands alone. He is holy. He is set apart.
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:06.080]   And God's purposes are not subject to human agenda. God is not a God that can be manipulated
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:13.280]   into acting on our behalf and for our benefit. Now, this stands in stark contrast to what the
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:18.800]   worshippers of the pagan gods believed. They were of the belief that there are certain rituals. If
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:23.520]   you do this, if you give certain offerings, you can manipulate the gods into answering your prayers,
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:31.120]   into doing whatever you ask them to do, whatever it is. And actually, we still play out in Hong
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:36.400]   Kong today. In our modern-day context, some of this thinking still prevails. We're just at the
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:40.640]   tail end of the Hungry Ghost Festival, right, Yulanti? At the tail end of the Hungry Ghost
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:46.800]   Festival. And what's all that about? Burning offerings and incense and food and all these
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:52.240]   effigies of different things, appeasing these hungry ghosts and spirits so that we can
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:57.520]   manipulate them into actually not coming near us or staying away from us or blessing us in some way.
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:08.240]   Not so with our God. God will not be manipulated. Our God is the one true God. He is not one that
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:13.680]   can have his mind changed with gifts and offerings. No, we do not try and make God align with us.
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:16.960]   We are called to be fully committed to him.
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:23.440]   This is an important part for us to rest on because unless we understand this,
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:27.840]   we'll spend hours and hours in prayer, doing good deeds, giving tithes and offerings,
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:31.520]   not because we are actually worshipping and submitting to him. Rather, we're trying to
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:38.720]   twist God's arm, but that's not how it works. The most beautiful thing about Joshua's response is
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:45.520]   he immediately realizes that this isn't about him. He doesn't say, "Okay, now I have you, God.
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:49.200]   This is what I want you to do. These are the enemies. This is how I want you to fight the
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:56.880]   battle." Instead, he says, "God, what message do you have for me? What do you want me to do?"
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:04.000]   Joshua fell face down to the ground in reverence and asked him, "What message does my Lord have
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.800]   for his servant?" The commander of the Lord's army replied, "Take off your sandals for the
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:15.760]   place where you're standing is holy." Joshua did so. There are three things that Joshua does here
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:21.840]   that I think we should adapt for ourselves when we ask for and when we find ourselves having an
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:29.280]   encounter with God. Firstly, like I said just now, it's this, worship, face down in reverence.
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:35.360]   Worship has to be the first response to God. When we realize we're in the presence of the holy,
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:40.880]   almighty God, the first thing we do is bow down in worship to him.
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:48.160]   Secondly, though, it's submission. What message does my Lord have for his servant?
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:55.440]   Joshua gives up his agenda so he can hear from God. I can almost guarantee you that if God said
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:27:02.160]   at that moment, "Joshua, you are not ready. The nation is not ready. Turn around. Go back into
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:11.600]   the wilderness until I call you again," Joshua would have done it. Obedience. God calls him to
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:19.680]   take off your sandals, and Joshua did so. He obeys because he knows he's in the presence of a holy
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:28.960]   God. Church, the question for today is this. Will this, too, be our response? Will we be a people
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:35.600]   who are willing to live in total worship, submission, and obedience to our holy God?
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:42.560]   Because if we really want to see God move in our lives, if we want to see victory in the challenges
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:47.840]   that we're facing, if we want to see God do the impossible to bring the walls down, then this
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:54.400]   is how we need to live. Now, the problem is we might say yes at first. Even in that, okay, yes,
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:28:00.080]   it's exciting. But what if living, because living this way might not make sense to us, though. We
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:06.720]   have to be ready for that. What if living this way means that you are no longer in control of your
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:13.280]   lives? What if living this way means you're going to look absolutely silly and ridiculous and stupid
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:18.960]   to the rest of the world? This is sort of what happens to Joshua in the next chapter, in chapter
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:26.320]   six. The battle for Jericho finally begins. Only the tactics that God gives to Moses sound completely
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:35.280]   ridiculous. Listen for yourself. This is how you bring the most fortified city in the area down
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:40.240]   right now, okay? This is what God says. "March around the city once with all the armed men.
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:45.440]   Do this for six days. Have seven priests carry trumpets of ram's horns in front of the ark.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:49.760]   On the seventh day, march around the city seven times with the priests, blowing the trumpets.
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:54.160]   When you hear them, sound a long blast on the trumpets. Have the whole army give out a loud
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:29:00.320]   shout. Then the wall of the city will collapse, and the army will go up, everyone straight in."
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:07.200]   What? Okay, I'm not military trained, but no matter how you see it, this makes no sense,
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:14.240]   right? There is no military strategy, whatever, that God gives, but that's precisely the point.
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:23.040]   Jericho was already ready for the taking. Like we found out just now, everyone was already scared.
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:28.480]   The battle was already won by God. Everyone inside was already shook with fear.
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:34.800]   God is saying, "I'm not interested, Joshua, in your leadership skills or your military knowledge
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:42.320]   and your power. My heart is to find out if you are indeed a people that represent my name. Are you a
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:49.280]   people that are really willing to follow and obedient to me, no matter what I call you to do?"
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:58.240]   It's the same for us today. If we want to be God's people, if we want to represent his name well,
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:01.280]   if we want to encounter him, if we want him to work in our lives,
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:09.440]   we must be willing, church, to be obedient. Being obedient is going to mean that at times,
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:17.200]   our actions are going to be strange and unusual to those around us. It's not just this. The Bible
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:23.200]   is full of examples about people willing to do ridiculous things in the Lord's name because God
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:30.560]   told them so. Noah was told to build an ark when the earth had never even seen rain before. Abraham
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:36.640]   was told to get up and go without knowing where he was going. Daniel ate nothing but vegetables,
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:41.760]   but yet still became bigger and plumper and fatter than everyone else around him. How's that
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:51.840]   for the Daniel diet? Ezekiel was told to lie on his side for 360 days. Hosea was told to marry
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:58.320]   a prostitute. Isaiah preached naked for three years. Attendance would go down to zero.
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:02.640]   John the Baptist lived in the desert and ate locusts.
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:10.800]   Zacchaeus gave people back four times the amount that he took. Jesus went to the cross
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:16.880]   and gave his life. None of what these people did makes sense from our perspective,
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:24.160]   yet they did so out of their obedience to God. You see, this was never about God preferring
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:28.960]   the Israelites over another group of people. This was always about God seeking those who are
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:36.640]   obedient to him. To prove this point, look what happens to Rahab. Rahab, who was part of the enemy,
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:41.520]   part of the Canaanites living in Jericho, Rahab would have been destroyed with the rest of Jericho,
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:47.920]   but God keeps his promise to Rahab because she and her household were willing to be obedient to God.
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:55.600]   And what does Rahab go and do? She features in the lineage and the genealogy of Jesus himself.
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:59.280]   What about you?
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:06.160]   You see, as Christians, obedience is going to be a roadblock that we're going to run into.
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:12.480]   We have these goals in our lives, goals that we want to reach, things we want to see happen,
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:17.040]   walls that we want to see brought down and removed, prayers that we want to see answered.
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:21.600]   But yet when God gives us instructions on how to overcome them and how to reach our goals,
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:25.680]   sometimes I think we become like what I said I was in the beginning. We don't want to follow
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:29.040]   his guidance. We don't want to follow his instructions. Like, okay, okay, Lord, whatever.
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:34.080]   I'm just going to do it my own way. We think we can do it better ourselves. So we strive and we
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:38.400]   try and we stumble and we fall. And then we have the audacity sometimes to go back and blame God
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:44.640]   and said, why didn't it work out for me? The story of Joshua, though, reminds us
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:53.680]   God's thoughts are not our thoughts. His ways are not our ways. And the wisdom of the world is
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:33:02.640]   foolishness in God's sight. What God is looking for are people who are willing to be obedient.
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:10.480]   And we have to think what that means in our context, in our culture, in our society for today.
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:18.000]   And I don't know, it could be a bunch of stuff. But for example, it might be choosing to reserve sex
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:21.600]   within the context of a marriage relationship.
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:27.840]   Maybe it means loving your enemies and praying for those who persecute you,
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:31.360]   instead of attacking them and drawing these divides that we so have.
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:37.200]   Maybe it's being truthful in the way you conduct your business when all the other businesses around
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:40.720]   you are known for leaving figures out and skimming off the top and all that kind of stuff.
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:46.560]   Maybe God is calling you to give faithfully, even if it's at a sacrifice to you.
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:52.480]   Things like this might make you look strange. Things like this are not easy to do,
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:57.920]   but it's obedience to God. And today, if you hear this message,
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:02.960]   how is God asking you to be obedient to him?
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:08.720]   The point of Joshua's encounter wasn't that God would give him victory over the enemies.
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:14.560]   Like I said, that was already a given. But what it gave him was a deeper heart
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:23.280]   a deeper understanding and a deeper desire to be obedient to God and see him working in his life.
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:29.200]   It helped Joshua to understand that God's work in our lives isn't about how big or good,
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:34.800]   how strong and how great our plans are. But rather, it's how devoted we are
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:38.000]   to doing whatever God has called us to do.
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:45.840]   And our prayer for us, church, this morning is the same. That as we encounter God,
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:52.320]   our hearts will be turned, our hearts will be changed, and that he would give us hearts that
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:57.120]   are more obedient to follow him, no matter where he leads us to go.
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:03.360]   So if you would, church, just close your eyes. Let's pray for a moment.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:17.440]   [Praying]
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:22.080]   One thing that I know we haven't talked about yet, but as we pray about it,
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:27.680]   the word obedient triggers so many things in our hearts and minds, I feel like.
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:31.760]   Because often we feel like obedience to do with punishment.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.200]   [Praying]
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:37.600]   And I can hear the words ringing in my head.
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:40.080]   [Praying]
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:43.760]   You're not listening to me again. You didn't do what you're supposed to do.
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:44.800]   Now I'm going to punish you.
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:47.920]   [Praying]
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:50.080]   I want you to know that's not God's heart today.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:56.160]   He's not using your lack of obedience as an opportunity to chastise you.
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:03.120]   [Praying]
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:08.000]   But it's a call back towards him. And yes, there might be some pain in that,
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.240]   leaving things that we're not supposed to behind, that we've become so attached to,
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:17.040]   will have pain. And there are consequences to disobedience, as we've said.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:21.520]   But God's heart in calling you back close to him,
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:24.720]   calling you to be obedient to him, is because he loves you.
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.080]   [Praying]
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:28.800]   It's because this is what you were created for.
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.320]   [Praying]
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:31.280]   To represent him.
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:32.640]   [Praying]
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.120]   To do the good works that he has prepared for you to do.
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:36.800]   [Praying]
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:38.400]   To praise and to worship him.
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:41.200]   [Praying]
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:44.640]   That's where true life is found, no matter who we are.
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:47.760]   [Praying]
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:50.480]   And so, Jesus, I pray that above all things,
[00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:52.560]   [Praying]
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:55.680]   we would look to you.
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:56.080]   [Praying]
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:57.680]   We thank you for your example,
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.280]   [Praying]
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:03.280]   that you were willing to be obedient even to death, and death on a cross.
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:05.760]   [Praying]
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:09.120]   And so, Father, I pray that you would shape and mold our hearts in the same way.
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:14.560]   [Praying]
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:20.720]   That as you call us, we would be willing to give up whatever it is that we have,
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:24.720]   whatever it is that we have been holding on to,
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:25.840]   so that we can have you.
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:30.240]   [Praying]
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:33.360]   So, Holy Spirit, I pray that you would guide us in this endeavor as well.
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:34.800]   It is a challenge.
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:38.960]   It is not something we are going to be able to muster up our own will and power to do.
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:43.280]   But only when accompanied by the power of the Holy Spirit
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:47.040]   can we walk in line with how God has called us to live.
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:52.080]   May this, Lord, be what we are known for,
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:55.120]   a people, a church, a body of Christ,
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:38:00.400]   in total submission and obedience to what you have called us to do.
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:06.160]   We pray in Jesus' loving, powerful, saving name.
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:07.360]   Amen.
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:12.240]   [Music]
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:14.820]   (gentle music)
[00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:17.400]   (gentle music)
