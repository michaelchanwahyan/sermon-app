[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440]   He has a special gift and talent to bringing people around him
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.000]   and just to make people feel so welcomed
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.200]   when they're with him, hanging out with him.
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.000]   So, really blessed to have Leslie speaking in the front
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   and welcoming everyone in today.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.400]   So, many of you know that I used to be a teacher.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.600]   So, I'm going to give you a test and ask you a question.
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.600]   One day, a student gave me this during class.
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.600]   Ta-da!
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.400]   And why? Why did they give this to me?
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.000]   So, let's see if you can figure it out.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.400]   A. They used it and want me to throw it away for them.
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.600]   Happens all the time. Is it the case?
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.000]   B. They found it on the floor, didn't know whose it was
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.600]   and wanted me to help find the owner.
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.600]   Every little thing is precious to them. So is this one.
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.600]   C. It was something they made as a gift for me.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   A, B and C. All of them happened in class.
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.000]   What about this one?
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.200]   Who thinks it is A?
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.800]   Yep, yep. Happens all the time.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.400]   What about B?
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.600]   No. C?
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.600]   You are right. Let's give yourself a big hand.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.000]   This time, it was C.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   So, as I was teaching writing,
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.200]   I'm trying to get them to write a whole piece of letter, right?
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.400]   And then in the middle of it, a child came up to me and go,
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.800]   "Ms. Chan, I'm going to give you this."
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.200]   I go, "Why? Why?"
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.600]   And then the girl sitting next to her said,
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.600]   "Oh, because she made it all lesson.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.200]   "She used the whole lesson just to make this
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.800]   "and wanted to give it to you."
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.600]   And I asked her, "What is it?"
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, this is a mop.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.600]   This is a mop.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.200]   So, well done. Well done. Thank you for the effort.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.000]   But I'm so thankful that she cared for me so much.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.600]   But could you not do this in the middle of class?
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.800]   Not when I'm trying to get through something, right?
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.400]   But this is how kids are.
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.600]   They seem to have a sensor that they sense that you are in a hurry
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.000]   and you want to do something,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.200]   and they want to do something opposite.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.200]   You want to get them out of the house, they want to pee.
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.000]   I hear a loud "mm."
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.600]   When you want them to go wash, to go shower,
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.800]   they want to read a book.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.400]   When you want them to be out of the shower, they say no.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.600]   This is how kids are.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.600]   They are very creative, they are very impulsive,
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.000]   and they have a special energy around them.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.800]   And so working with them takes a strong heart, you know?
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.000]   Because they look so cute on the outside,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   they're cute on the inside too, just to say.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.600]   But they are very direct.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.800]   When they don't want to hang out with you, they just say no.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.000]   Sometimes they just forgot to say no,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.600]   and they just turn and run away.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.200]   And you still have to smile because you can't be too mean to kids.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.400]   I try not to be too mean to kids sometimes, right?
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.800]   And so, but God actually, through a lot of His passage,
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.000]   and a lot of His sermon,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.200]   tells us that we need to value them because God values them.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.800]   Kids are so direct and so impulsive,
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.200]   but Jesus often used the qualities of children
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.800]   to remind us to be more like Him.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.800]   He taught us not to look down on any child
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.200]   because God values them deeply,
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.000]   even revealing the secrets of His kingdom to them.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.400]   For example, whoever welcomes one of these little children
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.200]   in My name welcomes Me,
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.400]   and whoever welcomes Me does not welcome Me,
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.600]   but the one who sent Me.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.400]   See that you do not despise one of these little ones,
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.200]   for I tell you that there are angels in heaven
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.000]   always see the face of My Father in heaven.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.400]   At that time Jesus said,
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.600]   "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.600]   because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.600]   and revealed them to little children."
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.400]   So as the series emphasized,
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.400]   when we are called to be a church that is multi-ethnic,
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.800]   multicultural, and intergenerational,
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.400]   a church that truly lives out God's unity,
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.600]   how do we walk with children?
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.200]   When Jesus repeatedly tells us to learn from children,
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.800]   and even says anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.200]   like a little child will never enter it,
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.000]   then what kind of community should we be?
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.200]   So that instead of suppressing
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.400]   the unique qualities of our children,
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.200]   we actually are embracing and learning from them.
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.800]   Today our scripture comes from Mark 10, 13 to 16.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.400]   In verse 13 to 14 it says,
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.800]   "People were bringing little children to Jesus for Him
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.000]   to place His hand on them,
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.200]   but the disciples rebuked them.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.000]   When Jesus saw this, He was indignant."
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.200]   This indignant emotion was not simply like,
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.400]   "Oh, my father, I broke my father's fast,"
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.400]   or "I broke my father's fast," she was indignant.
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.200]   It was not that simple.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.400]   Actually, in the original Greek, it's a much stronger word.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.000]   It means extremely displeased.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.800]   This word is rarely used in the New Testament.
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.400]   It is one of the strongest terms to describe Jesus' emotion.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.800]   According to scholars like R.T. Franz and Greg Evans
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.400]   in the original language,
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.600]   this word is typically used to describe righteous anger
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.600]   when justice is violated or God's will is being ignored.
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.000]   This story, seemingly like a very simple story,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   someone approached Jesus when He's teaching
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.400]   and then the disciples say,
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.600]   "Shh, don't come, don't come right now."
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.800]   Jesus was indignant.
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.400]   The culture of the kingdom culture
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.800]   and God's justice was being violated.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.400]   What happened there?
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.600]   What is there for us to learn?
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.000]   This isn't just some any ordinary disappointment.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.400]   This actually is a deep sensitivity to God's heart.
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.600]   And you see this kind of emotion in the New Testament,
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.800]   also at Lazarus' tomb,
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.200]   when Jesus sees the devastation death has brought into humanity.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.600]   And in Gethsemane, when God's heart...
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.000]   when Jesus is deeply grieved by the disciples' weakness,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.400]   it's closely related to God's love, justice, and mercy.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.400]   It's a righteous anger when God's heart
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:38.000]   and the culture of God's kingdom are being violated.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.600]   So what aspect of the kingdom culture did the disciples violate?
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:50.000]   First, the disciples thought they could be gatekeepers for the Lord,
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.800]   deciding who was worthy to receive blessing and who's not.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.200]   So in Jesus' time, it was a tradition
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.000]   where fathers would bring their children to the local synagogue
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   and there the synagogue elders and the fathers
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.600]   would pray a blessing over the little children.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.200]   Now the people bringing their children to Jesus,
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.600]   they were simply wanting to continue this tradition of blessing,
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:20.600]   except this time that they want Jesus to do the blessing directly.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.600]   But the important point this time
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.600]   was not about people bringing children to Jesus.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.400]   It's actually more about the disciples' reaction.
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:34.000]   The text said the disciples rebuked them.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.200]   And we have to ask, why did the disciples rebuke them?
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.400]   Didn't the disciples, didn't the people want children to be blessed?
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:50.000]   In Romans' law and culture at that time, children have very low status.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Very different from now where we like or try to provide
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.800]   all the things that we could for the baby.
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.400]   We want the best for them.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.800]   We put a lot of emphasis and attention to our little children.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.600]   But at that time, children's status were low.
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:08.800]   Why? Because they couldn't bring anything to the table right now.
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.800]   They couldn't help with the family right now.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.200]   There's nothing that they could do right now.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:17.800]   And so the children up to age 14 has a very low status.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:23.400]   The father has a total authority over the children, even life and death.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.200]   Children have no independent legal rights.
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.000]   And most of the time, they were only valued
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.600]   for what they might contribute in the future.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:39.600]   This mindset deeply influenced how society and individuals see value.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.400]   Meanwhile, Jesus was in the middle of teaching
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.600]   and the Pharisees were present, challenging him with questions
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.600]   and asking him about the law.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:52.800]   The disciples saw that Jesus was doing something important.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:57.400]   How could Jesus' work be interrupted at that moment?
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:02.400]   So, according to their own thinking and judgment,
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.800]   the disciples put up a barrier,
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:09.000]   dividing the people into those who can approach Jesus
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   and those who could not.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.400]   In doing so, they're actually creating a spiritual hierarchy
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.200]   between assuming that adults have more qualification
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.000]   than children to approach Jesus.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.200]   Maybe sometimes with the children ourselves,
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.000]   we felt that, "Oh, I don't really understand that."
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.400]   Or people think that, "Oh, they don't really understand that."
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.000]   Let them come to this event next time.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.400]   When they're ready, they can come.
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.400]   We're actually assuming what they know or what they are
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.600]   according to our judgment and our value,
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.000]   and we are creating barriers.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.600]   But in God's kingdom, there's no place for hierarchy.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.800]   There's no place for barrier.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:52.600]   No one is higher or lower than one another.
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.600]   So the disciples' reaction is like a mirror,
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.400]   reflecting the choices that we make in our heart
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.200]   about what we consider is important,
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:06.200]   about knowledge, and about relationship.
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:10.000]   The Pharisees are important, so the children can't come.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.400]   Knowledge is more important, so blessings can wait.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.200]   When can they come?
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.800]   Only when they're old enough to understand.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:22.000]   When they grow up, then they can come.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.200]   We often hear that very positive children is our future,
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:32.400]   as if their value only lies in what they might become.
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:36.400]   But Jesus see them as valuable now.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.600]   Though children may not serve in obvious way,
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.800]   but their presence, their faith, and their service
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:47.000]   is just as important as any adults.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.200]   I know that I need to work on my patience.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.400]   I know that from a long time ago in the invention of WhatsApp.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.400]   In WhatsApp, you send a message,
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.400]   and I expect that to be replied within three hours.
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.200]   Well, it's been a few hours.
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.000]   You need to--you have seen it.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   You should reply to me.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.200]   But I realized that my impatience
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.600]   was actually my self-centeredness.
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:12.800]   I want things to happen in my way according to my time,
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.400]   and I did not think about any other people.
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.400]   And so I really prayed to God and said,
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.200]   "God, I really want to--
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.600]   I want you to bless me with patience.
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.400]   I want you to bless me with gentleness."
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.400]   And he did through a student.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:31.400]   So actually, the student is in primary four.
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:35.400]   He has a mild case of autistic traits
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:39.400]   so that when during primary one to primary three,
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.000]   they have the same class, they have the same classmate,
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.400]   they have the same class teachers.
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.600]   But in primary four, everything changed for him.
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.400]   New classmate, new class teacher.
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.800]   So he really couldn't handle it.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.200]   What would he do?
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.400]   He would throw things across the class.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.600]   He would scrunch up my worksheet
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.200]   and just threw it across the classroom
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.000]   and say, "I don't want to do this."
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.800]   He would spat at teachers and at kids.
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.400]   He would shoot rubber bands,
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.800]   and he would violently, forcefully
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.000]   shake his desk and chairs,
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.600]   hurting himself and even others.
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:17.200]   So myself and the social workers are always on call.
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.200]   If anything happened during subject lessons,
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.200]   we are there to help take him away.
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.600]   But what makes it challenging
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.800]   is that you can't break through his stubbornness
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:30.800]   through lecturing him, through telling him what to think,
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.600]   because he couldn't process any, you know,
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.400]   discussion and reasoning.
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:39.200]   The only way that you can work with him at that time
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.400]   was through patience and gentleness.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.400]   And more patience and more patience
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.400]   while you're still holding a boundary until you have none,
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.800]   and then you need to give some more.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.000]   At the end of the year,
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.400]   we finally found a way that we can work with each other.
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:13:00.200]   But I realized that not only this incident has helped me,
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.000]   actually, I was on the verge of breakdown as well,
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   every single day, with the workload and with everything,
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   but I realized that God was using this child
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.800]   to answer my prayer.
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.200]   He did not use this child's intelligence
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.800]   or inspirational speech or his pure heart to change me.
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:23.200]   No, he used his whole life, the kid's life,
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.200]   to impact my life.
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.200]   There's nothing wrong with him,
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.800]   and there's nothing wrong with me,
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.000]   but as life collides,
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.600]   sparks came out and we're able to affect one another.
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:39.000]   And I think that's the beauty of working with children,
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.600]   because they're so unknown,
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:44.000]   because God has created them so beautifully
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.800]   that when we open our lives to them,
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:52.800]   they actually inspire me and help me in such a powerful way.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.800]   And it's not just him.
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.000]   Every single child that I've met,
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   whether it was, has influenced me,
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.600]   maybe it's their encouragement,
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.000]   maybe it's their cooperation,
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.400]   maybe sometimes they are not cooperating
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.200]   or they are not encouraging,
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:14.000]   but whenever I worked with them,
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.600]   they triggered reflection in my head.
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.800]   And I go, "Why did I respond that way?
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.000]   What happened to me just then?
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.800]   Why was I feeling that?"
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.800]   And in so, my life was changed.
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:31.000]   And that was often seen in K4C,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   where we would open up a space for kids to encounter Jesus
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   and listen to His Word.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   And they would actually hear God
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.600]   and encourage me in that way.
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.000]   So I'd like to share two videos with you today.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   Let's have a look.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.200]   So in class today, we read Psalm 23
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.800]   and God spoke to some students.
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.800]   So Derek, would you like to share with us
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.000]   what did God tell you?
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   So the sentence from Psalm 23,
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.800]   "He gives me everything I need,"
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:07.800]   is like a situation that I really need help for.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.800]   And I think God would give me a solution for it.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.800]   Awesome. Thank you so much, Derek.
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:17.200]   So Adelina, what did God tell you today?
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.400]   That He gives me strength
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:24.800]   and that He will guide me through everything that I need.
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:30.400]   That He will guide me through the things that are hard for me.
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:36.200]   That He will understand what I go through.
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.600]   Thank you so much.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.600]   Let's give a big hand to those children.
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.600]   (audience applauding)
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.600]   I needed that word at that time.
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.600]   I needed God to remind me that God will provide for me,
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.600]   that God is my Savior.
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.200]   I didn't teach them anything,
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.600]   so they came up with these reflection.
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.800]   I just opened up a space for them,
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.200]   helping them to connect to Jesus
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.400]   and Jesus will speak to them.
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:02.800]   The Holy Spirit inside the children
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.600]   are not baby Holy Spirits.
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.800]   There are no baby Holy Spirits.
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.000]   The Holy Spirit that you and I receive
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.800]   is the same as the children receive.
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.000]   When we connect them to Jesus,
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   when we allow them to listen to the Holy Spirit,
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.200]   God will talk to them and we listen.
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:25.000]   And so God didn't wait for these children to grow up,
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.200]   to be knowledgeable or capable
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.200]   before using them to change our communities.
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:34.600]   God used children in the present to accomplish His works.
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:37.400]   Our children are not just our future.
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:40.600]   They are part of our present.
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:45.200]   God uses each of us as part of the body of Christ
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.000]   to serve one another.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.400]   And He's also using our little ones
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.600]   to serve every one of us here.
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:56.000]   The unity of church isn't just about adults,
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.600]   but the unity across ages, background, and abilities
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:05.600]   where everyone can be seen, heard, and blessed.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:08.200]   After Jesus rebuked the disciples,
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.200]   He continued speaking.
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:13.000]   In verse 14 to 15, it says,
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.200]   "Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them.
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:21.000]   For the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.800]   Truly I tell you,
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.800]   anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:29.800]   like a little child will never enter it."
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.200]   God isn't talking to the parents and say,
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.000]   "Don't worry about them. Let them come. Let them come."
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.600]   He's actually talking to the disciples,
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.600]   telling them, "Don't hinder them."
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.400]   This is not--oh, hang on.
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.000]   "Just bring your little children here."
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.400]   Jesus was speaking very directly to His disciples.
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:50.800]   He was saying, "Why are you blocking them from coming to me?
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:54.200]   Don't you see that the people who enter my kingdom
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:57.600]   must be like these little children?"
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.600]   When you hear the phrase "become like children,"
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.400]   what comes to your mind?
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.200]   Their cuteness?
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.400]   That's too bad. I'm too late for that.
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.000]   Their innocence?
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.800]   But Paul also said, "When I become an adult,
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.800]   I put away childish things."
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:18.600]   So if God's message was, "Be like a child."
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.000]   If you don't get what you want, just throw a tantrum
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.600]   and do whatever you want and don't care about consequences.
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.200]   Then imagine heaven having a group of adults
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.200]   throwing tantrums on the floor.
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.800]   That doesn't really work.
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.800]   But I believe that when Jesus talks about
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.000]   having childlike faith,
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   He is pointing to two important qualities.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.200]   First, children need help.
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:47.000]   At the core of Christian faith is to admit that
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.600]   before God, we are completely helpless.
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.800]   We don't have the strength to always do what is right
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.800]   or know what is right.
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.800]   We are living in a very confusing world right now
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:02.000]   where everyone has a voice to speak about different things.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.600]   Everything is impossible.
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:07.200]   And as a parent or as an adult or just a person
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.200]   trying to live in the world,
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:13.200]   it is hard and we are helpless in that way.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.600]   Or we do not have the spiritual power
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.600]   to live a perfect and disciplined life.
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:23.400]   Our emotions aren't always mature
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:27.000]   and we can't always be able to respond to others
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.200]   with love and compassion.
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.600]   The truth is, on our own,
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:36.200]   we simply can't live the true Christian life.
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.000]   Just like a newborn baby
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.600]   who can't survive without someone to care for them,
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:45.600]   we can't survive living in this world without God.
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.000]   We are helpless before God.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.600]   So real faith means recognizing our helplessness
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:55.600]   and giving up trying to do everything by our own strength
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:00.400]   and resting fully in God's arms.
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:04.800]   The second quality, children are dependent.
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:09.400]   Since we're helpless, we must rely completely on God.
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.000]   The Lord is our provider.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   Everything in our lives, both now and forever,
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.200]   comes from His grace and His provision.
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.600]   You think about that.
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:23.200]   When I was in school and I was thinking about the promotion
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.200]   or getting this and that,
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:30.000]   I realized at that moment that I was able to get that job
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   not because I backed for it,
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.600]   not because of the qualities that I think I have on my resume.
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:39.600]   It was because God has opened doors for me
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.400]   and letting me to be in this position.
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.200]   When I think about living in this world
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.800]   and I worry about finance
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.600]   and I think about all the things I need to take care of,
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:52.800]   at the end of the day, who puts bread on my table?
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:56.000]   At the end of the day, what door opened?
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.200]   What people did I meet that I'm able to do what I'm doing now?
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:02.600]   It's not through my striving.
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:07.800]   It was totally and completely on God's grace and provision.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:09.600]   And so to enter God's kingdom,
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:13.000]   we must become like children to omit our helplessness
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.200]   and to learn to depend on Him.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:19.000]   And this is how truly we inherit God's kingdom
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.200]   and experience abundance life.
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.200]   And the way children serve among us
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:27.400]   is not just about moving tables or making coffees
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.200]   or playing the guitar or the drums,
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.400]   but rather, every time we serve them,
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:37.800]   it reminds us that we too can ask for help.
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.800]   We too can be the little children who said,
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:44.000]   "I can't do this, God. I need your help.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.200]   I don't know how to respond to that.
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:50.200]   You need to help me. I rely on you to help me."
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.400]   Whenever the children can't do something,
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.600]   they let us know and we should do the same
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:58.000]   and let God know that I feel frustrated right now.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.200]   I know that you've placed this purpose, this task in my heart,
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:07.600]   but I failed. I screwed up. I was impatient.
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.800]   God, please come and help me.
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:16.400]   This relationship is what gets us into the kingdom of God
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:20.000]   because the kingdom of God is not by our own strength,
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:26.600]   but knowing that Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:29.800]   Children in our midst are indispensable.
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.800]   It's not about saying, "All right, we can bring you along.
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:34.600]   Just keep up and hurry."
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:37.200]   Or, you know, somehow, sometimes you see parents
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.800]   taking the hand of the children.
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:42.600]   Very sweet, very protective, very nice, right?
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.600]   But they're actually dragging the children.
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:48.800]   Not a way of protection, but just hurry up and get there.
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:52.600]   We're not supposed to walk with our children that way.
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.600]   They are slower. They need our help.
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:00.800]   But perhaps what we really need is for them to slow us down,
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:06.000]   to remind us that we are not a community just to get things done,
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.400]   but we are a community to become family together.
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.600]   Let me say this again.
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:15.200]   Perhaps what we really need is for them to slow us down,
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:20.400]   to remind us that we're not a community of just to get things done,
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:24.400]   but a community for becoming family together.
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.400]   We need time to grow as a family.
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:30.400]   We need to look out for each other like a family.
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:34.600]   We need to work hard to be inclusive in a family,
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:39.800]   to see, to love, and to connect.
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:44.000]   So what does Jesus call us to do as a community?
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.400]   What does it really mean to let the little children come to me
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:51.400]   and to not hinder them?
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:56.400]   If the disciples' original mistakes was to let their own way of thinking
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:00.800]   and standard to decide who was worthy to come near Jesus,
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:04.600]   now Jesus is saying to them, "I want you to let me
[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:09.600]   and these children connect directly without barriers."
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:13.200]   Back in the day, I used to have people to come and observe my class,
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:17.000]   you know, for appraisal and many other different things, right?
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.200]   My class was actually okay.
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:22.000]   You know, the things that I planned should work out okay.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   But the biggest unknown are the children.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.400]   When strangers come, when they see something different,
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:32.000]   they either get really, really happy and joyful and wanted to perform.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.800]   There's this one time when I was being observed in my Primary 1 class,
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:42.800]   the principal came in and the girl wants to sing to her in my class.
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:48.000]   Or they could either respond very passively and very scared
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.200]   and very shy and very self-conscious.
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:54.200]   So I will be teaching the same class, but they will have no response
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.600]   as if I've never taught them anything.
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:00.200]   I mean, like, come on, this is my peers, this is a peer observation.
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.400]   You are not answering any questions.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.800]   I've taught you something, remember?
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.600]   They don't, they don't.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:11.800]   But that's...so before lesson observation, this is what I always do.
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:17.000]   To the really cute little class, I would say, "Please try to calm down.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   There will be someone coming in.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.200]   Calm down.
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:23.400]   If you have questions, try to hold it,
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:27.000]   like you're holding yourself to the toilet, just hold it."
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.400]   Or I would pre-teach them a little something
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:33.600]   so that they won't totally don't know what I'm doing
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.000]   and not be responsive at all.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.200]   But isn't it sometimes it's like that for us as well?
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.400]   We are trying to be good.
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:45.200]   We're trying to fix ourselves before we go to Jesus.
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.600]   We're trying to say, "Oh, I haven't learned enough.
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.200]   Let me learn more so I can pray for others.
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:52.600]   Oh, I haven't prayed enough.
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:55.600]   Let me pray more before I pray for other people.
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.600]   Oh, I haven't fixed myself yet.
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:02.800]   I am so self-conscious about who I am right now."
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:07.000]   God isn't saying, "Let those well-behaved come to me."
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.200]   He is not saying, "Let those who can memorize Bible verses come to me."
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:15.000]   He's saying, "Just come.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.200]   Just come. Come as you are."
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:21.600]   No matter they are little kids or older kids
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:26.200]   or ourselves right now, we do not have to pretend.
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:31.400]   We do not need to live another life before we approach our Jesus
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:38.600]   because Jesus said, "Just come."
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:41.200]   And that is not just a calling for parents.
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:45.000]   It's a calling for all of us as His disciples.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.800]   Like the Proverbs that says,
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:50.200]   "It takes a whole village to raise a child."
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.800]   The spiritual growth of child, of children,
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:56.200]   isn't just the responsibility of parents,
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:59.800]   but the whole community, the whole church,
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:03.400]   how we walk with each child and the family.
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:06.600]   And that's why we have baby dedication ceremonies.
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:09.000]   It is our collective response.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   Through this ritual, we bring each child before the Lord together.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   Many of you actually have been through one of these baby dedications before, right?
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.400]   Do you remember what you have promised?
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:26.400]   So we're going to have a look and see what does it mean for the church,
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:33.200]   for the parents, ourselves to respond to the calling of walking with children together.
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:37.400]   So to the parents, we have asked them a series of questions.
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:40.600]   Can we have the slide, the next slide? Yes.
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:48.400]   Are you willing to let the kids grow up in God's unconditional love?
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:54.800]   It is hard when we haven't experienced unconditional love ourselves when we were growing up.
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:59.200]   But are we willing to try to work on ourselves and go,
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:06.200]   "Hey, this is unconditional love. What is it? How can I work towards that for my child?"
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:11.000]   Will you do your best to teach the kids the right path to walk?
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.600]   But most importantly, in the community,
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:18.600]   are we willing to let others to do that for us as well?
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:25.800]   I've been in a school situation where two kids were fighting while actually one is hitting the other.
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.600]   The kid A said, "Yes, I did it. I'm so sorry."
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:33.800]   You call the parents and the parents said, "Oh, you made him admit that he was doing wrong."
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:39.200]   And it was in such an opposition that it was hard for me to work with the parents and go,
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:43.000]   "Hey, actually, we're just trying to bring up the children together."
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.600]   We are actually in a cooperation way to work together.
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:53.000]   So as parents, I know that there are different styles of understanding.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   But are we willing to open our hearts and try to put ourselves in the village?
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.200]   We can't live in a village unless we admit that we are in one.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:08.600]   So it is a thinker. It doesn't mean that we have to do all of that, by the way.
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:11.000]   We just talked about we're helpless.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.200]   We are. As a parent, we are.
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:16.400]   As a member of the church family, we are also helpless.
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:19.600]   How do we work towards that?
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:26.200]   Thirdly, will you teach the kids about Jesus Christ and His love for them and for all people?
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:33.000]   And will you pray for the kids that they would become a child God can use for His glory?
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.200]   They are all very big questions.
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:39.800]   And this responsibility doesn't just rest on you.
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:48.000]   Be in the village. Open up and see how we as a church can walk together and build this up together.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   But what about the others, the rest, to the follower of Jesus Christ?
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:03.600]   Are you willing to commit to supporting these parents in raising their child?
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:09.400]   I understand talking to children is not everyone's forte.
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:13.000]   Kids have their own energy and their own way of saying and thinking.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.200]   But I would encourage you to talk to the parents and ask them,
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:20.400]   "What can I do for you today? How are you doing?"
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:23.800]   And often as I ask these questions, they will tell me,
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:28.800]   "Oh, actually, I just need someone to keep an eye on him while I rehearse for worship."
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:35.600]   Maybe it's just, "Oh, I need to go to this training or that training, and I just need to get lunch for my kid."
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:38.400]   These are some of the support we can do.
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:44.000]   It's not always about children, but actually it's the family that needs support.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.800]   Spend some time. Be their friend. Be their friend.
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:52.400]   Sometimes a parent needs conversation outside of child-rearing.
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.200]   Can I get an amen for that?
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:31:01.400]   We need to have conversation with friends to make us feel like human again.
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.000]   That's what I feel like when I was a teacher.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.400]   I don't always just want to talk about teaching stuff.
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:10.000]   I have other interests. I have other joy and passion as well.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.200]   Be our friend and ask us what we need support with.
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.600]   Let's have to look at the next question.
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:23.800]   Will you be patient, listen to them, and help them when needed?
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:28.000]   I am so happy. I'm so grateful for myself as well.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.800]   Well done, June, that we were actually a very patient church,
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.200]   that we recognize that there are children in our midst,
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:40.200]   and they do cry, and they need to all recognize their own emotions.
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:43.400]   And we're okay, and we give time and space for them.
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:46.800]   And I think we can continue on and ask ourselves,
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:49.000]   how can I grow from there?
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.200]   What else can I do to support the children when they have needs?
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.200]   Or how can I support the family?
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:00.600]   Can I be more patient to the families that have children, right?
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:08.800]   And also, the third one, will you also strive, us all,
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:11.000]   to be a model of Christ's love,
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.600]   so that the kids can grow up in an environment and community
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:21.200]   that always points them to their creation?
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:26.600]   Our vision for K4C is just what today's scripture described.
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:29.400]   It is a place where we remove all the barriers,
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:32.000]   and we connect the children to God.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.400]   And we want to do that, not only connecting them to God.
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:42.800]   The vision for our kids' ministry here is to connect them to God,
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:46.000]   to their peers, because they will grow up together,
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.200]   and they will walk together, but also to you guys.
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:54.400]   My volunteers, the lesson plan that I designed,
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:57.000]   always ask them to share their own stories,
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   because I want kids to know that
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.200]   being a Christian is not easy.
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.800]   It has challenges.
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:05.000]   And while you share your stories,
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.800]   they get to see what a real Christian looks like.
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.800]   That it is challenging, we fail, we are discouraged,
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:13.600]   but God always loves us.
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.000]   God will always help us.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.400]   And through these stories,
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:19.000]   they get to know that there are people who love them.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.600]   There are people in this community that they know.
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:24.600]   When they grow up and they start to rebel against their parents,
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:26.800]   because we all do that,
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:30.800]   they know that they can go to you for help if they need.
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:34.200]   And so, are you willing to open up yourself,
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:36.600]   and just to get to know the family,
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:39.800]   and get to know the kids, and share your stories with them,
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:42.800]   so that they grow up to be a person,
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:45.200]   to be in an environment and a community
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:49.000]   that will always point them to Jesus?
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.800]   Serving in K4C is not the only way,
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.600]   although it is the most direct way.
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:56.400]   And I really want to say thank you to all the K4C
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:58.000]   teachers and assistants,
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.200]   and people who have been serving in all the Kids Ministry events.
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:04.200]   I just really want you to give them a big hand.
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:10.200]   I am truly so grateful and so honored to work with these people.
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:13.600]   Each of the teachers and assistants
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:17.800]   really put in all their time, a lot of their time and energy
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:22.000]   into serving the children, into getting to know the Scripture.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.200]   Every month, they would have to leave this hall
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:29.400]   where we can sit and enjoy and bring and bask in God's Word.
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:32.400]   And they go in and share God's Word.
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:35.400]   I remember a time when I was teaching the Bubbles class,
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:36.800]   the kindergarten class.
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:39.600]   There was one sermon where I was talking about
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:42.200]   Jesus healing the blind.
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:47.000]   And God spoke to me that day about God giving me an identity.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.600]   And it was in those moments that I realized that
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:55.600]   when we're sitting here and we enjoy being in God's presence,
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:58.000]   the teacher and assistants there,
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.600]   God is using, they're speaking through them to the children.
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:05.000]   And I hope that if you are inspired,
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.600]   that you have an urge to do a little bit,
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.000]   feel free to let me know.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.400]   But serving in K4C is not the only way
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:17.600]   that we can work with children together in this church.
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:21.400]   As I've said before, getting to know the families,
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:23.400]   supporting them, listening to them,
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:26.600]   is actually a great way and very important way
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:31.200]   to get to know the kids and to support the kids' ministry as well.
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:35.800]   And K4C needs your prayer.
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:38.600]   Our children need your prayer.
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:40.400]   Our family needs your prayer.
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:43.600]   So right now, I'd like the worship team to come up.
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:47.800]   And I'd like all of you to find two or three people around you.
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:49.200]   Or you can pray on your own,
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:53.200]   but I would love you to find two or three people
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:58.000]   to pray for K4C, our kids' ministry, and our children right now.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.600]   So get connected.
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:10.600]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
