[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   This week has been an incredible emotional roller coaster for me.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Last week we started this new series called "When the Journey is Too Much"
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   looking at mental health, and I shared with you very honestly and openly last week
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   about my own journey in mental health.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   And I shared with you about my anxiety and the crippling anxiety that I've had in my life
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   and how much of my adult life has been defined to a degree by the reality of that anxiety.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   And I was very honest and open with you guys.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   And Sundays are always draining for me.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Sundays are always emotionally draining.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   They're always physically draining doing this over three services, and I love it.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   But I was really drained at the end of last Sunday.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   And emotions are funny things because they come out of the blue sometimes.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   And as I left here at the end of our third service on Sunday, I felt completely naked and vulnerable.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   And I felt like all the thoughts started to go through my mind, right?
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Like, why did I tell everybody about that?
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   And I began to second-guess so much of it, and I began to feel bad about the whole day,
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   and all of these emotions were there.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   And I literally had to go home, and I had to find my wife and my daughter,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   and I had to get them, and I had to talk with them for a couple of hours
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   just to be able to kind of find some stability again in the sense of how I was feeling
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   and to try to realize that the way I was feeling was not actually the reality of what was happening
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   or the reality of what had happened, but I was still feeling all of this way.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   And emotions, they're funny things, aren't they?
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   And emotions can kind of sneak up on us sometimes and begin to define and kind of dominate us.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Emotions are these things that it's hard sometimes for us to get our head around.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   And it's interesting because emotions, at one and the same time, are your greatest gift
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   and also your greatest challenge.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   And your ability to understand your emotions, to recognize them, and to process them
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   is probably the defining factor in your life for how you'll be able to understand
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   your overall status of your mental wellness.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   I'm going to say that one more time because it's super important.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Your emotions and your ability to see them, understand them, recognize them, process them in your life
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   will be the determining factor that will actually end up shaping your own mental wellness.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   So many of the mental health issues that we see in society are the result of people
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   being overwhelmed by the reality of their emotions.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   And if humans are anything, we are emotional beings.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   In your lifetime, the average human being, and I'm going to assume that all of you are average here.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   You're much better than average, but I'm just going to say.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   An average human being over their lifetime experiences some 34,000 different emotions.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   On every single day, you're likely to experience 6 to 27 different emotional contexts.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   So we are definitely emotional beings.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   I want to start today by kind of mapping out a couple of things for you that I think might be helpful
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   for us to understand the way in which we are when it comes to the reality of our emotions
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   and how those emotions are at work in us to try to define who we think that we are.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   I'm going to draw for you a human being.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   You're welcome.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   I was at M+ yesterday. If you haven't been to M+, a plug for M+.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   It's an amazing museum.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   I still reckon that is better than a lot of what I saw yesterday.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Now, here's what happens for us as human beings.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   We have three primary contexts within which our emotions are at work.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   The first is what's called the psychological.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   And the psychological is our thinking.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Oh man, I cannot write.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Our thinking, our thoughts.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   And this is largely understood of or spoken about in terms of the head or the brain.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Now, also, there is this thing that flows from the heart, which is our emotional state.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   So as well as a psychological state, every human being also has this emotional state.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   That is our feelings and our affections, our passions, those sort of things.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   And that's commonly considered and thought of in the area of our heart.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   And then finally, there's a third context that all human have.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   And I'm going to draw this from the shin, but I'm actually meaning the foot.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   And this is the physical context.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   And the physical context is our behavior and it is our action.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   And this is largely represented, like I say, by the feet.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Or you might even want to say the hands, something like that.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   But it's the things that we do.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Okay, here's what I want you to see.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   These three things are always at work shaping how you feel.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Shaping the way in which you experience emotions.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   And the important thing to know is that each one of these impacts the other.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   This is an incredibly complex thing.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   In other words, the way you feel is not just down to how you think.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   The way you act is not just down to the way in which you are emoting at that particular moment in time.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   No, this is an incredibly complex system.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   So your psychology impacts your emotions and your behavior.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Your behavior impacts your emotions and your psychology.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Your emotions impacts your psychology and your behavior.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   And all of this is at work in you all of the time.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   It's an absolute complex system that is at work inside every human being.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Now, here's the critical thing you need to know about this system.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   This system, at all times, is trying to define for you who you think you are.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   In other words, the way in which you feel, the way in which you think, the way in which you behave,
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   is always trying to define how you think you are.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   I call this the will of our emotions.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   And I want you to notice that this is trying to say, "This is who I think that I am."
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Or, "This is who I feel that I am in any particular given moment of time."
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Now, notice I'm choosing my words specifically,
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   because this stuff is trying to tell you what you think that you are,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   rather than actually who you are.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Come on, church.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   It's trying to define what you feel like you are,
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   rather than perhaps who you actually are, because those two things can be different.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   And so we need to recognize that sometimes this complex system that's at work in our lives
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   is trying to conform us, it's trying to tell us something,
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   and ultimately it's trying to shape us to its will.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Now, because this is a reality for all of us,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Scripture has a lot to say about this complex system.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Scripture invites us into a fresh journey of understanding actually who we are,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   not driven by the way we think, not necessarily driven by our emotions,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   and not necessarily driven by our actions,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   but who we are driven by how God sees us, by God's determination, by His will, by His Spirit,
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   all shaping the person that we truly are.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   Are you with me still?
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   So we need to be really understanding about what the emotions are all about,
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   not just from a physiological reality, but from a Scripture reality.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   So the first thing I want to do is actually give you a bit of a theology of emotions.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   I don't know if you've ever sat in church ever and heard a theology of emotions,
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   but I want to do this because I want you to begin to really understand what it is that's at work in you.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Here's the first thing. God is in and of Himself an emotional being.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   God is actually an emotional being.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Now I know on the surface that might sound like, "Yeah, okay, cool."
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   But here's what we so often think.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   We so often think it's us who are emotional,
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   and we've put these emotions onto God so we can better understand Him.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   But you need to understand that God is not made in our image. We're made in His.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   So by saying that God is an emotional being, we're actually saying something fundamentally important.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   We're saying that emotions are not primarily in the first instant a human characteristic.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   They are actually a divine characteristic.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   And if that is true, then our ability as humans to experience emotions to some degree helps to connect us to the divine.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Are you guys here?
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   Now because God is an emotive being, and the Bible will explain this to us,
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   we see emotions that God has. He has love. He has joy. He has anger. He has frustration.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   He has compassion. He has all these things that we see in the Scripture.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   Because God is an emotive in that way, here's the second thing.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Therefore, our emotions are inherently a good thing. Emotions are inherently a good thing.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   And again, I think so often we think as Christians, "Oh, I need to just suppress my emotions."
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   But actually that's not true. Emotions are inherently a good thing.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   And because we are made in the image of God, humans are also emotional beings.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   And we're emotional beings because we're made in His image.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   He's emotional, so the way He's created us is to express something of the divine inside of us.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   So we also are emotional, and our emotions are a beautiful reflection of who God is in us.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   Are you with me still?
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   So it's okay to be emotional.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   I want to just lift that one off you. You can come to the Vine, and you can be emotional.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Let me tell you why that's important.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   I was at a conference just about a month ago, speaking at a young adults conference here in Hong Kong.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   And before I was going to speak, we had this little dinner time,
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   and I was sitting on this table with a bunch of people who didn't know who I was, which was awesome.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   And they were talking about the next speaker that was coming up.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   And one of the young adults on the table goes, "Oh, he's from the Vine. That's the emotional church."
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   That was one of those times in life where I had to hold in the thing that I was thinking in my head.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   But here's how I reflected afterwards. I'm like, "That's awesome. That means the Vine is just like God."
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   So you can come here and be emotional, and we will say, "Praise the Lord. Welcome to the Vine.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   It is good to have you with us."
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   If you want to be unemotional, there are other churches that you can go to where you cannot be like God.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   That's what I wanted to say, but I didn't say that.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   But we also need to be really careful.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   And this is actually a really important part of the theology of emotions.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   We have to recognize that our emotions are deeply impacted by humanity's fall into sin.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   And because our emotions are deeply impacted by humanity's fall into sin,
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   we have to realize that our emotions are not always incredibly trustworthy.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   See, this is the thing that differentiates humanity and the divine.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   See, God's emotions are not complicated by sin.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   God's emotions are always good. They are always holy. They are always just. They are always right.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   But humanity, our emotions are not always good. They're not always holy.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   They're not always just, and I'm going to be honest, they're not always right.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   And because of that reality, we have to understand a few things about how God has designed emotions
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   so that we can align ourselves to what the good reality is of these emotions
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   that help to connect us to the divine, and what are the bad parts of these emotions
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   that are now sometimes at work in us to try to get us to think, to feel, and to act in a way that is not glorifying to God.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   Here's a couple of things. God has designed emotions to be gauges, but not guides.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   Emotions are created by God to gauge us, to help us to gauge society and the world around us.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   In other words, to report to us, but not direct us.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   But the world right now will tell you, "Hey, if it feels good to you, just do it."
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   You know, like, "Hey, if this feels right to you, don't let anybody else tell you what's right or wrong.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   If this feels good to you, then you should do it.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   Likewise, if you don't feel like doing it today, I know you made a commitment.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   I know you gave your word, but hey, if you don't feel like doing it, don't do it at all. It's fine."
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   So the world has this very much this thought that our feelings should drive us,
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   but God has created and designed feelings not to be our leader,
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   but to be something that helps us to gauge society and environments around us.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   Are you with me still? Here's the second thing.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   Our emotions are feelings. They're not facts.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   Your emotions are feelings, but they're not facts.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   What that means is your emotions are not always truth.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   So in other words, the way you feel is not always reality.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   This was my experience when I left here last Sunday, and I felt all these things that I felt,
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   and in a way, understandable to feel those things, but I needed to get home and sit with my wife and my daughter for a while
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   for me to understand that the way I was feeling was not fact.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   See, our feelings will try to often try to dominate that to us.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   Now, sometimes feelings are factual, and this is the tricky things with your feelings.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   If you're standing in a road and a bus is driving towards you and you feel afraid for your life,
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   that's a true feeling, that's a factual feeling, and that is speaking truth.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   But at the same time, a lot of the times, our emotions are trying to tell us things
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   that are not actually the way that God sees us or sees that entity or that thing that we're reacting to.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   Are you still with me?
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   Here's the final thing. In Christ, we can have God-honoring, God-centered, and God-glorifying emotions.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   In other words, even though our emotions are tainted by sin, in God, we can actually find those things redeemed within us.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   In Christ, we can find that redemption of our sin.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   Here's the way that happens.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   At the Vine here, we have a mission statement, a vision statement called "Growing Big People."
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   What that basically means is if you come to the Vine, we want you to grow in Christ Jesus.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   We want you to grow to become more and more like Christ Jesus.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   And if Christ Jesus and Christ-likeness is actually the goal of His followers,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   then that means Christ-likeness not just in thought and in action, but in our emotions as well.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   My great desire for you is that you would have Christ-like emotions in your life.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   Because those emotions are good, and they'll align you to the beauty and the power of God for you.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   But those Christ-like emotions come in us as we learn to journey in our Christ-likeness in other ways.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   It's not just about trying to be like Jesus in how we think, trying to be like Jesus in how we act.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   We also want to try to be like Jesus in the way we emote things.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   Jesus had right emotions about everything that He encountered as a human in this world.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   And there's much we can learn from the ministry of Jesus for how we can also hold right emotions.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   There were times where Jesus actually kept His mouth shut when He wanted to say something.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   There were times where Jesus realized that an emotion He was feeling, He shouldn't act upon.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   Likewise, the Bible is filled with stories who act upon their emotions and get themselves into really big trouble.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   But the good news for us is that in Christ we can be redeemed in all of these areas of our emotions.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   Is that helpful? That's a bit of a theology of emotion.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   Now here's why I've given you that today. It's because of this.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   The thing that we have been created for as human beings is the two great commandments.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   To love the Lord your God with all your mind, heart, soul and strength.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   And love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   Those are the two things that God has placed upon the call of humanity.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   If we do those two things well, we spread the gospel.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   And here's the reality. You cannot do those two things unless you are an emotional person.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   Love the Lord your God with all your mind, heart, soul and strength.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   And love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   So in order for us to fulfill those great commandments, God has given you the thing that you need to be able to do it.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   His love, His peace, His guidance, His spirit, His emotions inside of you.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   So that you can fulfill that love and fulfill that love and begin to walk out the gospel.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   So here's the critical thing.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   When we hold our emotions in right balance and in right sort of judgment,
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   then we're able to actually have the greatest tool we need to work the gospel out in a broken and hurting world.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   We get to and we are enabled by God to care for the things that He cares about.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   So emotions are good. Emotions are important.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   Emotions are designed to help you to fulfill the great commission and the great calling that God has placed on your life.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   But we need to make sure we bring these emotions, as I say here, in right balance and right perspective.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   And that's the great question that I think sits over us when it comes to mental health and all of our ongoing mental wellness.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   How do we bring our emotions, how do we bring all of this stuff right here into right balance and right perspective?
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   Because if we can learn to do that, then I think we can become alive for the gospel in our city like never before.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   Is this okay? So how do we do it?
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   How do we get right balance and right perspective in the world of our emotions?
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   Well, to unpack that, and we're going to unpack that over the next three weeks,
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   I want to take you over these three weeks to the story of Elijah.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   Elijah is found in 1 Kings chapter 17 to about 25.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   And in these chapters, we get to see Elijah be called by God in a critical moment of Israel's history.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   Israel at this time is led by King Ahab and his wife Jezebel.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   And they have done a terrible thing.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   They have brought the worship of Baal and Asherah into the consciousness of Israel.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   Not just the consciousness, but actually the religious life of Israel.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   And because of that, there is this whole situation where there's all this worship happening of all these gods called Baal and Asherah.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   And in fact, what King Ahab and Jezebel do is they raise up 850 prophets to praise and to worship these gods
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   to try to get all of Israel to follow these gods.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   And by the time that God comes and calls Elijah, the whole of Israel is swept up in this idol worship.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   And rather than 850 prophets, God calls one.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   He says to Elijah, "I want you to go to the king and his wife,
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   and I want you to tell them to turn from their dark and wicked ways and to start worshipping Yahweh.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   And if you can do that, then everything will change.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   We'll get a revival back in Israel."
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   And Elijah is passionate about this revival.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   There's everything inside of him that wants to see that revival happen.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   But time and time again, King Ahab refuses to listen to him.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   Turns his back on him, doesn't listen to him, casts him out.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   And Elijah has a terrible, frustrating ministry.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   With this burning desire given by God through the spirit for revival,
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   and always seeing walls and doors shut in his face,
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   seeing himself coming up against the worst of the worst,
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   and he's completely frustrated, and he's getting really angry about all this.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   And many times he comes to God and he's like, "Why? Why did you choose me?
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   Why are you asking me to do this?"
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   And he has these huge emotions inside of Elijah,
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   because he feels like he's a failure the whole time.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   Until this one moment, where he goes up a mountain,
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   and he calls the 850 prophets of Baal and Eshurah,
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   and they build an altar on top of this mountain.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   I call this the Mountain Showdown.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   And he says, Elijah pours all this water on the altar,
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   and then he says to the 850 prophets, he says, "Make this altar come alive.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   Cool down fire from your gods in heaven to set this altar alight."
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   And they do. They kind of dance around,
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   and they do all their kind of incanting in their prayers,
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   and nothing happens at all, of course.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   And then Elijah does a simple prayer, and God, Yahweh, brings fire from heaven,
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   burns the altar, all the altar comes aflame,
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   and the Bible tells us this amazing thing happens.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   Everybody in Israel starts praising Yahweh again.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   Everybody starts singing Yahweh's praises, starts singing to the Lord.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   And this is the moment where Elijah sees victory,
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   the victory he's been longing for for so long,
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   fulfilling the calling that God had given on his life.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   He's so excited. He takes the 850 false prophets,
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   and they're slaughtered in that moment.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   And then he's so filled with adrenaline, so filled with emotion,
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   that he runs down the mountain faster than the chariots are able to be driven by horses.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   I mean, this is a guy who's so pumped up, so emotional, so excited.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   Finally, all those long, hard years of slaving away has paid off,
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   and revival can now come to Ahab, to Jezebel, and Israel, and then this happens.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   Let me read this to you from 1 Kings 19, verse 1.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   "Now Ahab told Jezebel everything Elijah had done,
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah to say,
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   'May the gods deal with me, be it ever so severely,
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   if by this time tomorrow I do not make your life like one of them.'"
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   Jezebel refuses to bow down.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   In fact, she even says here, she says, "May the gods," plural, "still deal with me."
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   She's still worshipping Baal and Eshur.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   And so, by implication, is Ahab.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   And suddenly, Elijah is faced not with what he thought was revival breaking out on the land,
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   he's now faced with the reality that it's still idol worship.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   He's suddenly hit with the worst sense of failure that he's ever felt before.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   I mean, you cannot go from hero of the nation to enemy of the state faster than that.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   And he's told that a hit has been put out on him, that there are people coming to kill him.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   And he is completely turned upside down by this.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   I wonder if you can get a sense of the emotional journey that Elijah is on here,
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   from this moment of great ecstasy on the top of the mountain,
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   to now knowing that the king and his wife want him dead.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   I want you to see what he does next.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   Verse 3, "Elijah was afraid," there's the emotion, "and he ran for his life."
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   "When he came to Beersheba in Judah, he left his servant there,
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   and while he himself went a day's journey further into the desert, he came upon a broom tree."
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   And on this tree, he decides that he would sit down under it.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   And notice what it says here.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   "He sits down under it, and he prays that he might die."
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   "I have had enough, Lord."
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   I wonder if anybody else has prayed that prayer here.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   "I have had enough, Lord. I'm done with this. This is over. I don't want anything else.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   I am fully at my limit. I'm completely burnt out."
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   This is basically Elijah saying to God, "I'm emotionally exhausted."
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   He says, "Take my life, for I am no better than my ancestors."
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   Then he lay down under the tree, and he fell asleep.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   Now, I would like to lie down there and fall asleep, because I'm pretty tired too,
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   but I will get up and finish my sermon.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   I want you to see what happens here, because this is what's really critical in this whole process.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   What Elijah goes through is the absolute spiral of all of this.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   First of all, he feels fear. There's an emotion that's happening there,
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   which causes a behavioral action, which is to run and to flee.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   As he runs and flees, his psychology, his thinking is, "I have to be alone.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   I have to get alone. I'm all alone."
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   Therefore, he wants to die. His emotion is, "Just kill me, God."
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   He's having suicidal ideation. Not that he's going to take his own life.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   He's asking God to take his life for him.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   All of this is spiraling out of control.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   What it's telling him is, "You're a failure."
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   What it's telling him is, "You should just go. You're done. It is all over."
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   What it's telling him, the person that he's now thinking he is, is an absolute failure.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   "I got it all wrong."
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   Elijah does two things here that I think all of us do when we're feeling overwhelmed emotionally.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   These two things cause a lot of emotional exhaustion in our life.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   I want to tell you about these two things.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   I think if you can understand these two, it might set you free a little bit
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   in how you manage your emotions as well.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   Here's the two mistakes Elijah makes in this moment.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   The first is that he's trusting his feelings over fact.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   He's trusting his feelings here over fact.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   Because here's the fact.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   The fact is God's just done one of the most powerful things that God does
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   throughout the whole of the Old Testament.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   Maybe only the parting of the Red Sea is even greater than this moment right here,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   where God comes and takes 850 prophets and shows them up
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   and brings fire down in such a powerful and an amazing way.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   I mean, that has just happened.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   Here's fact number two.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   The people have turned to worship Yahweh.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   The revival that he wants has actually begun.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   That revival is going to continue.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   In fact, this is actually an inflection point for Israel.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   And the rest of the narrative here tells us a story of how Israel comes back
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   to the worship of Yahweh.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   It starts in this moment. That's a fact.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   Here's another fact.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   If God can send fire down on a mountain, God can stop people from killing Elijah.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   So all these facts are there before him, but he's not seeing any of the facts.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   He's just feeling these incredible emotions, which are telling him far more who he is
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   than the reality of what God is doing around him.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   How many of us in this room, when we're overwhelmed with our emotions,
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   like me on Sunday evening last week,
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   allow those emotions so much to tell us what the reality is,
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   rather than actually how God sees what's happening?
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   Are you with me still?
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   Here's the second mistake he makes.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   The second mistake he makes is he's comparing himself to others.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   Comparison is one of the most dangerous things that we can ever do.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   Because either it will make us feel terrible about ourselves,
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   or it will so puff up our pride that we become actually arrogant.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   And I want you to show what he says here is something really important.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   He says, "I've had enough, Lord. Take my life. I am no better than my ancestors."
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   He's comparing himself to his ancestors.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   When Elijah was called into ministry, he actually said,
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   "I don't want to be like my ancestors, who weren't able to turn God's people back to revival with him.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   I'm going to be different from them."
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   And now he's sitting under this tree, feeling completely depressed and burnt out,
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   and he's saying, "If I compare myself to my ancestors, I'm no better than them.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   I haven't done any better. I haven't succeeded anymore.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   I'm still as terrible. I'm as bad. I haven't helped at all.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   This is all bad." He's comparing himself.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   And I want you to know this.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   When you compare yourself, comparison is perhaps the greatest tool that the enemy will use
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   to keep you locked in a painful, emotional prison.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   Come on, church. This is so true.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   Your comparison will be one of the great tools the enemy will use
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   to keep you locked in an emotional prison.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   And God's about to change all of this now for Elijah.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   I want to show you the three things that God does.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   Let me read on. It says this.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   "All at once an angel touched him and said, 'Get up and eat.'
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   He looked around and there by his head was a cake of bread baked over hot coals and a jar of water.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   He ate and drank and laid down again.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   The angel of the Lord came back a second time and touched him and said,
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   'Get up and eat, for the journey is too much for you.'
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   So he got up and ate and drank, and strengthened by that food,
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   he travelled forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb, the mountain of God."
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   God does three things here for Elijah that I believe are the three things he can do for all of us
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   when we're overwhelmed emotionally.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   Here's the first thing he does.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   He comes in form of an angel and he physically touches Elijah.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   He didn't need to do that.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   He could have just showed up in angel form and stood over him and said some nice words to him.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   But he actually touches him. In fact, it says that he does it twice.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   He touches him twice. Why?
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   Because this is God coming and immediately addressing the psychological turmoil
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   that is going on here for Elijah.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   Because Elijah thinks that he should be alone.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   Elijah feels like he's alone.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   And so when God comes and touches him, it changes something in his physiology,
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   in his thinking, in the psychological way that he thinks.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   And God's saying, "This touch communicates to you that you're not alone.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   This touch communicates that the thing that you're thinking, 'I'm all alone,' is not fact.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   Let me show you physically that I'm right here with you. Are you with me?"
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   So the first thing God does for any of us when we're in an emotional turmoil place
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   is he comes up to us and says, "I'm with you. I'm not distant. I'm here with you.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   I touch you. I'm physically here with you. My spirit is here with you.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   We are present together. You are not alone."
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   The greatest enemy and the lie that the enemy would try to tell you emotionally
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   is that you're all cut off. You're all alone. There's no help for you.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   And God comes and he touches Elijah.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   And I believe if you want it, he will come and touch you
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   to let you know that you're not alone.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   The second thing he does is he feeds him, gives him food and drink.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   In other words, he provides for the sustenance of his body.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   This is God coming and ministering to the physical elements of what's in turmoil in his life.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   And you need to understand when you're in a bad emotional place,
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   your body is also in a bad place.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   And there's chemicals and things in your body that are making you feel even worse.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   And again, feelings aren't fact. They're reality.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   And these things in our body can do that.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   And God understands that and he comes and says, "The first thing I need to do,
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   let you know that you're not alone because I want to change your thinking.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   But now I'm going to come and feed and drink and give your body sustenance
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   because that will get you stability for you to be able to then begin to deal with your emotions."
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   You need to know that if you're ever dealing with depression,
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   psychologists will tell you that 85% of the journey towards healing for somebody who's depressed
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   is to begin to deal with the physical side of things.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   Exercise, nutrition, food at the right times,
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   bringing that body back to life is a major step forward in all of the other healing.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   And God shows up and says to Elijah, "I've got you and I'm going to physically now work with you."
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   But then he says this, most important.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   He says, "Get up and eat for the journey is too much for you."
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   Notice this. He says, "The journey is too much for you."
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   This is God now dealing with the emotional part.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   Perhaps the most central bit of all.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   And I want you to hear what God says. He says, "The journey is too much for you."
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   What he's not saying is this, "Man, the journey is too much for you. You suck.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   I wish you were stronger. I wish you were better.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   Like, man, this journey is too much for you."
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   It's not like that at all. Here's what he's saying.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   He's saying, "Man, I get it. The journey is too much.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   The journey is hard, but I'm here."
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   This is like what I shared last week when I talked about what my counselor said to me in the counseling room.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   When he said, "Andrew, it's okay to not be okay."
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   God shows up and he says to Elijah, "I get it. I see it, man.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   It's been a long, hard road. I understand that you're feeling disappointed.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   I get it. I feel it too. Man, this journey is overwhelming. Isn't it, Elijah?"
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   And this is so critical because God's doing something that is so important here.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   He's actually doing something that will enable Elijah to redefine his relationships with his emotions.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   I want you to see what he's doing here.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   By God coming and saying, "Hey, it's okay to not be okay, Elijah.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   It's okay to feel what you're feeling."
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   What he's actually doing is he's trying to create space between the person of Elijah
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   and what all of this complex system is trying to tell him.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   God's creating a space here and in this space, it's going to enable Elijah to take stock of everything that's happening
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   and begin to redefine his relationships with this complex system that's at work.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   Hey, basically, here's what's going to happen for Elijah.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   He's going to go from, "Oh man, I'm feeling this way and it sucks and I want to die."
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   He's now going to go, "I'm feeling this way and it sucks, but God feels it with me
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   and he validates the reality of that emotion in my life.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   And because he does, I have space now to redefine my relationship with those emotions."
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   Are you with me, church? Come on.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   This is so important that God would say, "Hey, I feel what you're feeling.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   I get it and I touch you and I feed you. I provide for you, but I also am here and I feel what you feel,"
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   which enables Elijah to go, "There's some distance between what all this is trying to say to me
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   and how I can now observe my thinking, observe my emotions, observe the physical things that are happening in me
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   and realize that what they're trying to tell me is not the wholeness of truth.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   There's now space for something else to be there.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   Psychologists call this space the observing self.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   It's the self being able to observe the things that are happening inside of the person.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   But I like more the way that the Bible talks about it.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   Let me show you one quick verse and we're going to pull things up around about here.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   But let me go to Romans chapter 12, starting in verse 2.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   It says, "Do not conform any longer to the patterns of this world,
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is, His good, pleasing and perfect will."
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   This is such a powerful verse.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   Paul's saying, "Hey, you want to get back to where things are supposed to be?
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   You want to actually begin to see your emotions as they should?
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   You want to be able to think in the right ways?
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   Well, here, you don't have to be conformed anymore to the patterns of the world,
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   the will of your emotions.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   You can be transformed by the renewing of your mind.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   Why? So that you can then discern," and he says this,
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   "You can discern what God's perfect will is."
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   I'm going to write, "The will of God, His good, pleasing and perfect will,
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   which brings your thinking, your emotions and your body, your behavior, your actions,
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   all into alignment in Christlikeness."
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   Isn't that great?
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   If only we could realize that all of this is trying to define us,
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   but actually it's the work of the Spirit of God that creates a space in us.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   Not that all of this is evil.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   Remember, emotions are given by God, that they are actually part of His characteristic,
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   that it's not wrong for us to feel.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   It's not that we suppress all this stuff.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   It's just that we gain a fresh perspective on it through the lens of the will of God,
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   which defines our thinking, defines our emotions, and defines our physicality,
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   so we can then be more like Christ in the world.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   And the Bible says the ability, the thing that creates this space,
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   and it helps us to understand and discern God's will, is the Spirit of God.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   The Spirit, which is already inside of you, works to align you to the will of God,
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   so you can redeem your psychology, your emotions and your physical self,
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   so that this comes in alignment with this.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   That's the Bible's answer for how we then journey in our emotions.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   The Spirit of God at work in you, and that Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   faithfulness, gentleness, and the ultimate one, what's the last one?
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   Self-control.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   It amazes me that God has placed inside of us the very thing
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   that can bring all of this under self-mastering control.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   Not that all of this is evil and wrong and bad.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   There is so much good that happens inside of this.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   But if this determines and defines this, then we've got ourselves out of whack.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   And emotional exhaustion is possible.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   But when this enables this to come under self-control,
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   well then we're able to live as Christ has always caused us to.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   May I encourage you to redefine your relationship with your emotions,
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   so that you can bring all of it under control.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   Know that God touches you, provides for you, and He speaks to you,
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   and says, "I know what you're going through. I'm here with you.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   But together we can do this right."
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   That's my hope for you, that you would know a God who sets you right.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   Can we pray?
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   Maybe you can just open your hands where you're sat.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   Father, I just thank you so much for the people in this room.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   And I thank you so much for this journey that you've invited us into now.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   We thank you for our emotions. What a gift they are.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   We thank you that our emotions are reflected and found and sourced by you.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   You are an emotive being.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   Lord, we recognize that in our emotions and in our sin,
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   these things can so often attempt to define us.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   And we know, every single one of us in this room,
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   that we've made really poor decisions in our lives based on our emotions.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   Father, we want to come now and just bring that to you.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   Father, we thank you that there is another way,
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   that you come to Elijah and you touch him to say, "You're not alone."
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   Even though your feelings and your emotions are saying you're cut off,
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   you are not alone.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   And I want to say that over some of you in this room,
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   because this is really important.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   Some of you feel alone all the time, and that feeling is not fact.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   And God wants to come and touch you today like he did Elijah and say, "You're not alone."
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   God wants to provide for you sustenance and strength for the journey ahead.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   And God speaks over you.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   Sometimes the journey is too much, but it's okay.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   I'm with you.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   We're going to do this together.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   I feel you.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   And I've got you.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   If you'd like the Holy Spirit to transform your mind,
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   to renew your mind, so that you would be able to discern God's will,
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   so that you'd be able to see your life with a fresh perspective,
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   can I just invite you to just open your hands now?
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   You don't have to do that, but if you want to respond to this message now,
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   if you feel like this is for you,
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   you know your emotions have been defining you more than God's will,
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   more than God's Spirit, more than the fruit of that Spirit that's at work in you.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   Just open your hands.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   And I want to pray that the Spirit of God would come now and minister.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   I want to pray that you would receive His touch, His words, His love.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   Elijah at the end of his robe, "Kill me, Lord. Take me. This is just too much."
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   Maybe you're sitting here today and that's your feeling too.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   Invite God to come.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   I pray you would minister now.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   I'm going to invite the team in a moment just to begin to worship over you.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   But I want you to allow yourself just this time, precious time,
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   to have the Holy Spirit to speak to you,
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   to meet you in your emotional world right now.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   For Him to create some space between all of that emotion and what it's trying to say to you
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   and what He says to you and how He sees you.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   And I pray you would hear His voice for you again.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.580]   (gentle music)
[00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:20.580]   [MUSIC]
