[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.560]   So Jesus, as your rivers of gold flow through, Father, we surrender everything to you, as
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.720]   Susanna was saying just now, as we've been worshipping, as we've been praying, as we've
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.340]   been singing.
[00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.280]   The good things, Lord, we give you praise and thanks for and say, Lord, you are worthy
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.120]   of all our praises.
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:29.600]   Thank you for being the great and powerful God that we've been singing about.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.520]   The name above all names, the one and true God.
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.360]   And for the broken things, Lord, as we continue to hand them to you and knowing that you can
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:48.440]   do the impossible, that things that are broken and final, Lord, you have the final say and
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.560]   you have the final word.
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:58.160]   And ashes can turn into beauty and dead things can come to life, that bones can become flesh
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.420]   when you speak your word, when you're at work, Lord.
[00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.120]   And so we just pray that you will be the one, your love, your kindness, your goodness, your
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.960]   power will be what holds everything together.
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:18.400]   And the way we embrace that is by fully surrendering to you, Jesus.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.900]   So we do say, Lord, we surrender.
[00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:26.120]   We surrender this time, we surrender our worship, we surrender everything we have about ourselves
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.080]   so that we can have you, Jesus.
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.960]   So that we can, yeah, so that you can work in our lives, Holy Spirit.
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.720]   So Lord, we praise you and we thank you.
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.680]   Continue to be with us as we continue this worship service through the word and throughout
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.720]   our week later, Lord, may you continue to be fully glorified in all that we do.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.600]   We surrender to you, Lord, in all that we do.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.640]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.640]   Amen.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.320]   Thank you, worship team.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.320]   Thank you, church.
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.320]   Please take a seat.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.320]   Welcome.
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.320]   Good morning.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.960]   If you're in the overflow, big welcome to you as well.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.280]   If you're watching online, hello.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.680]   If you have a seat next to you, I encourage you to maybe scooch up a little bit so we
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.680]   can free up some seats.
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.600]   There's some people standing in the back.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.240]   There's some people in the overflow that would love to come sit down.
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.560]   So if you have a seat next to you, it's time to release that so that people can come and
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.560]   sit next to you.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.240]   There's a few down here, so our hosts will come and try and fill up our seats as well.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.000]   As always, good and honored to be here with everybody to bring God's word.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   I'm a Hong Kong boy.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   I grew up here in Hong Kong.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   How many of you guys grew up here in Hong Kong?
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.360]   Did you get a wave of hands?
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.360]   Okay.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.360]   A lot of us.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.360]   Really cool.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.360]   Okay.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.200]   So I think you can agree, a really fun and exciting place to grow up as a kid.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.640]   One of my favorite pastimes, maybe you resonate with this too, was to go to the video games
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.160]   arcades that used to be everywhere.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.160]   Right?
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.160]   [inaudible 00:01:50]
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.160]   Right?
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.720]   That was one of my favorite things to do back in the day.
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.720]   Right?
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.160]   Before home consoles were popular, before we had mobile phones with all kinds of games
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.840]   on them, the arcade was the place to hang out.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.840]   Right?
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.840]   If you wanted to play video games, you wanted to spend time with your friends, you would
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.640]   go to the arcades.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.640]   And they would be everywhere.
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.720]   There used to be so many arcades.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.720]   Right?
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.400]   Street Fighter, Final Fight, Initial D, Dance Dance Revolution.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.800]   You look like an idiot trying to step on all those arrows.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.800]   It was so much fun.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:19.800]   Beatmania.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.800]   Right?
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.160]   You would go to the arcades and DJ and make music and stuff like that.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.160]   So much fun.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.160]   Right?
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.160]   After school, you take your lunch money.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.040]   You're supposed to buy lunch with it, but you didn't.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.040]   Right?
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.440]   So you go to the arcade, you go up to the counter, you change your money for the one
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.640]   dollar coins, and that was your afternoon sorted.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.640]   Right?
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.200]   The best extracurricular activity you could do.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.200]   Okay?
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.160]   However, there was a problem.
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.160]   Right?
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.240]   Because these arcades actually had an age requirement.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.760]   And so technically, technically you had to be 16 year old to go in and play these games.
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:53.760]   Right?
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.320]   So, you know, let's travel back in time.
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.320]   Imagine it's 1996.
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.320]   Okay?
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.320]   12 year old Ellison.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.840]   I'm just into secondary school.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.880]   I'm like 4'5" at the time.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:02.880]   Okay?
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.360]   Trying to pass as a 16 year old.
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.360]   Okay?
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.360]   You can judge for yourself.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.280]   This is a picture of me at 12 years old.
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.280]   Okay?
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.280]   Right.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.480]   I look about 9, probably.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.480]   Okay?
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.480]   And I know it's paid off now.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.480]   Okay?
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.480]   I still look young.
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.480]   I still don't raisin.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.480]   Right?
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.480]   That's what they say.
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.480]   But back then it was ultra frustrating.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.480]   Right?
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.880]   Because I would walk into the arcade and the manager would take one look at me and say,
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.160]   "There is no way this little boy is 16 years old.
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.160]   Right?
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.160]   You need to get out."
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.160]   Right?
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.160]   So desperately I tried to make myself look older.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.160]   Right?
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.160]   I would try to put on glasses.
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.160]   Right?
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.160]   Put on spectacles to make myself look more mature.
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.160]   Right?
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.160]   That never worked.
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.560]   You know, put on certain clothes to make myself look older.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.560]   That never worked.
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.080]   Or a walk-in weary confident.
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.320]   That never worked until I found one way around this.
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.360]   I discovered fake IDs.
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.360]   Okay?
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.880]   Now, I'm not proud of this.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:53.880]   Okay?
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.160]   But desperate times call for stupid decisions.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.160]   Okay?
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.320]   So I thought if I had a fake ID, it wouldn't matter how I looked.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.360]   I could just show the ID and I would be, you know, playing games all through my afternoon.
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.360]   Right?
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.480]   The more idiotic part of this plan, I had no idea how to get a fake ID.
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.480]   Okay?
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.360]   I mean, my dad's a policeman, you know, so it was like, it was a really big problem for
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.360]   me.
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.360]   Okay?
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.440]   So I decided to make it myself.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.440]   All right?
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.760]   I had it so I wish I could show you a picture of it.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.200]   It was like red with like lightning bolts in the background.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.200]   Okay?
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.200]   I used Microsoft Word.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.200]   Okay?
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.640]   Amazing Word art, graphics, all that kind of stuff.
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.640]   And I became Jarvis.
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.640]   I don't know why I chose the name Jarvis.
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.640]   Okay?
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.240]   Jarvis Lee, 16 years old.
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.240]   Okay?
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.360]   Attending Washington Heights International School.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.360]   Okay?
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.360]   It was just completely made up.
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.160]   I thought it was legit, like laminated and everything.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.160]   Right?
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.120]   And to my surprise, it would sometimes work.
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.000]   Only if the lady behind the, you know, the arcade manager was an old Chinese lady who
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.120]   didn't read any English.
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.120]   Okay?
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.000]   That was the only situation it would work.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.240]   You know, but as I was reflecting on my childhood and reflecting on this passage, some of these
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.800]   things made me think about some questions that I had.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.760]   Because so often in life, right, we judge things.
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.760]   We have to judge things.
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:16.100]   We often judge things based upon the way it looks.
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.080]   And often this leads to us having a fear of other people's judgment.
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.080]   Right?
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.880]   And because of other people's judgment, what we think they might think about us, we want
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.240]   to change the way we are.
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.880]   Or maybe I'll ask it this way.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:35.760]   Have you ever wished you could be, or you were, or you look like someone else because
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.840]   of what other people's expectations of you were?
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:39.960]   Right?
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:45.200]   We were in week two of our sermon series and we're starting 2025 Strong Together.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.440]   And we're looking at these passages in the book of 1 Samuel.
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.520]   And we're discovering, right, we want to see how we can begin well.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:57.880]   But we're shifting our focus from intimacy last year into action.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.520]   And we recall, you know, last year Andrew talked about us not letting the things of
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.680]   the past, right, these emotional barriers of hurt, disappointment, regret, shame, and
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:12.440]   failure hold us back because these things often stop us from moving forward to where
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.920]   God wants us to go.
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.360]   And so today I want to talk to us about our choices.
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.520]   And this is an important step to take because we've moved, right, we've been moved and motivated
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.520]   into action.
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.520]   Right?
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.520]   That's the whole point.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.580]   Together as a body of Christ we hear God calling us into action.
[00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:34.800]   But in order to act well, we have to choose well.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:41.240]   But this is the issue, right, we very much make choices based on outward appearances.
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.400]   Right?
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:47.220]   From like fruit at the wet market to the people we meet every day, we are constantly making
[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:52.080]   judgments based upon the way things look and then based upon our judgment of them we'll
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.320]   make certain choices.
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.960]   There's academic studies done about this, right, we'll tell you that no matter how much
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.960]   we embrace, you know, the mantra of don't judge a book by its cover, the truth is we
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:08.600]   go about our daily lives responding to a lot of people based upon their physical appearance.
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.920]   And the sad truth is that if you're deemed to be more attractive, you're often treated
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.960]   more favorably or so I've been told.
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.400]   I don't know, maybe you can ask Nathan.
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.400]   Is that true?
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.400]   Yeah?
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.480]   Going around as a handsome man?
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.280]   We're going to look at the passage today, right, and as we continue tracing Samuel's
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:31.540]   journey, my prayer is that it would challenge us to shift our perspective, right, to open
[00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:36.720]   up our eyes to the fact that if we are truly to follow God with our lives, we have to see
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.000]   things from his perspective.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.640]   And we must learn to embrace the things that he values so we can live the lives and make
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.120]   the choices that God wants us to make.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:52.880]   Because at the end of the day, that is our goal, right, as followers of Jesus.
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.880]   That is where we find our significance.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.960]   That's where we find our meaning in lives.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:02.620]   That's where we want to put our efforts into beginning and acting not with our agenda,
[00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.060]   but with God's heart for us.
[00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:10.340]   And true significance, true action is going to come when you discover and embrace God's
[00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.660]   direction for you.
[00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:18.240]   So we're going to go to scripture, 1 Samuel 16, 2 to 13, and we're going to pick up from
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.740]   where Andrew left off last week.
[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.540]   I'm going to read, it's a longish passage, so bear with me.
[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:25.540]   You can read together and let's see what God says.
[00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:28.580]   "But Samuel said, 'How can I go if...'"
[00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.420]   Sorry, let me start again.
[00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:32.820]   "But Samuel said, 'How can I go?
[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.660]   If Saul hears about it, he will kill me.'
[00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:41.620]   The Lord said, 'Take a shepherd with you and say, 'I have come to sacrifice to the Lord.
[00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:45.620]   Invite Jesse to the sacrifice and I will show you what to do.
[00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:49.340]   You are to anoint for me the one I indicate.'
[00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:51.260]   Samuel did what the Lord said.
[00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.860]   When he arrived at Bethlehem, the elders of the town trembled when they met him.
[00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.660]   They asked, 'Do you come in peace?'
[00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:02.740]   Samuel said, 'Yes, in peace I have come to sacrifice to the Lord.
[00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:05.460]   Consecrate yourselves and come to the sacrifice with me.'
[00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:10.200]   Then he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:16.200]   When they arrived, Samuel saw Eliab and thought, 'Surely the Lord's anointed stands here before
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.200]   the Lord.'
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:21.940]   But the Lord said to Samuel, 'Listen, do not consider his appearance or his sight, for
[00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:23.740]   I have rejected him.
[00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:26.740]   The Lord does not look at the things people look at.
[00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:31.900]   People look at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.'
[00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:35.460]   Then Jesse called Adimadab and had him pass in front of Samuel.
[00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:38.800]   But Samuel said, 'The Lord has not chosen this one either.'
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:44.180]   Jesse then had Shammah pass by, but Samuel said, 'Nor has the Lord chosen this one.'
[00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:48.780]   Jesse had seven of his sons pass before Samuel, but Samuel said to him, 'The Lord has not
[00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:50.100]   chosen these.'
[00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.980]   So he asked Jesse, 'Are these all the sons that you have?'
[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.540]   'They are still the youngest,' Jesse answered.
[00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.700]   'He is tending the sheep.'
[00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.160]   Samuel said, 'Send for him.
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.740]   We will not sit down until he arrives.'
[00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.900]   So he sent for him and had him brought in.
[00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:09.620]   He was glowing with health and had a fine appearance and handsome features.
[00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:12.380]   Then the Lord said, 'Rise and anoint him.
[00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.340]   This is the one.'
[00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:18.700]   So Samuel took the horn of oil, as he did last we remember with Saul, and anointed him
[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.620]   in the presence of his brothers.
[00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:25.260]   From that day on, the Spirit of the Lord had come powerfully upon David.
[00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.580]   Samuel then went on to Ramah.
[00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:31.620]   So a quick recap of the story so far.
[00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:36.220]   Israel had had the first taste of what it's like to have a king rule over them.
[00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:40.900]   And with Saul as a king, what started off as a good thing, has very quickly turned sour,
[00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:44.140]   just as God had warned them that it would.
[00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:49.620]   And ultimately, Saul disobeys God, he makes some really, really silly, really bad choices,
[00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:54.500]   and as a consequence, he is rejected as the king of Israel.
[00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:58.140]   But I think to get an even fuller picture of what's happening, we need to go even further
[00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:59.520]   back.
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:03.900]   Because the whole reason the Israelites wanted a king in the first place was because they
[00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:06.420]   too had made a pretty bad choice.
[00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:10.940]   A new nation, a new group of people emerging out of slavery into the Promised Land, they'd
[00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:15.260]   been wandering in the wilderness, they looked around them and they saw that every single
[00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:19.900]   other country, all the other people around them, had a physical king, an actual dude
[00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:23.580]   that they could look to, a person they could see to lead them.
[00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:28.380]   And so they started to think, "Well, we actually, we want to be just like them."
[00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:31.980]   In fact, the very words of the people were, "We want a king over us.
[00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:36.420]   Then we will be like all the other nations with a king to lead us, to go out before us,
[00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:39.980]   and to fight our battles."
[00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:44.380]   And we mentioned this last week a little bit as well, but I want to revisit it because
[00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:48.020]   this baffles me every time I read it.
[00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:53.940]   Just to think, after all that God had brought them through, out of slavery, into the wilderness,
[00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:59.780]   looking after them with food and miraculously, like manna and quail and water gushing from
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:04.820]   the rock, parting the Red Sea, bringing down the walls of Jericho, countless miraculous
[00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.580]   victories over their enemies.
[00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:11.780]   Time after time after time, God proving his faithfulness to them, and time and time again,
[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:16.580]   God proving to them that he is the greatest, the strongest, more powerful than any human
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:20.420]   king or any other God could ever be.
[00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:25.420]   And yet, Israel said they would rather have a human king rule over them other than God.
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:29.940]   They had forgotten their role as the chosen people, as the ones who had been set apart
[00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:30.940]   by God.
[00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:38.420]   I mean, just think, if Samuel felt rejected, how do you think God felt in that moment?
[00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:44.620]   The Israelites made a terrible choice because they forgot their first love.
[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:48.940]   They forgot who it was that had given them everything they had, and instead they wanted
[00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:54.300]   to conform and become like everyone else.
[00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.860]   But how about us, church?
[00:13:56.860 --> 00:14:02.020]   When we look back at our own lives, and as we point through and as we recall all the
[00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:07.100]   things God has guided us through, maybe some of us in this room were once enslaved to sin,
[00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:09.860]   but God has set you free from that.
[00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:13.540]   Maybe once we were in a season of wilderness, wondering where to go, now God has led us
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:16.140]   to a promised land.
[00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:21.340]   Maybe God has helped you overcome and defeat enemies that you thought would destroy you.
[00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:26.380]   But now that things are good, perhaps we've been looking around and thinking to ourselves,
[00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:30.140]   "Actually, you know, maybe there actually is a better way.
[00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:32.660]   A lot of people around me don't follow God.
[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.820]   A lot of people around me aren't about Jesus.
[00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:38.220]   Maybe it would be better to be like everyone else."
[00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:41.540]   It seems like sometimes when we look at people and the way they live their lives, we don't
[00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:44.060]   know God, they have more freedom.
[00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.540]   They can just do whatever they want to do.
[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:48.960]   Maybe that's the way to live.
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:53.740]   Or maybe you're suddenly feeling a bit self-conscious about your relationship with Jesus, and because
[00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:58.780]   it's a bit different, you're starting to feel a bit weird and feel like you stand out a
[00:14:58.780 --> 00:14:59.900]   little bit.
[00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:04.220]   And so you try to fit in and you want to conform and look like everyone else rather than representing
[00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:07.620]   Jesus with how you live your life.
[00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:11.740]   And I feel like as we do this, if we make these sort of choices, God's heart is grieved
[00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:16.940]   when he sees his children walk away from him in this way.
[00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:22.420]   Let me be a reminder for us this morning, I'm preaching to myself as well, church, okay?
[00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:25.340]   Stay faithful to God.
[00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:28.020]   There is no other way.
[00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:34.420]   The best choice you can make in your life is to keep being obedient to Jesus.
[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:41.340]   Now, this might be the best choice, but as we've probably discovered, it's not going
[00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.760]   to be easy.
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:47.860]   And I think there's one big barrier that holds us back from starting off this journey, from
[00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:54.060]   making this choice to being obedient to Jesus, holding us back from faithfulness.
[00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:58.980]   And this is the fear, the question of what if.
[00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:04.580]   It's the fear of what if that actually initially holds Samuel back when God tells him to go
[00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:09.020]   and anoint one of Jesse's sons to be the new king of Israel.
[00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:10.020]   Listen to it again.
[00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:11.860]   He says, "How can I go if?"
[00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:12.860]   What if?
[00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:17.060]   If Saul hears about it, he will kill me.
[00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:19.220]   If Saul hears about it, he will kill me.
[00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:20.220]   And you know what?
[00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:23.700]   He had some legitimate grounds for his fears.
[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:28.180]   Saul had just been told, and the Bible tells us he had just been removed as king, so he's
[00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:31.820]   very conscious of what's happening with his role.
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:32.820]   He's angry.
[00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:33.940]   He's emotional.
[00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:37.340]   He's the kind of guy that's very capable of taking someone's life.
[00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:40.160]   Actually, the whole nation is afraid.
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:45.900]   When Samuel comes to the elders of the village, they say even they're trembling about what's
[00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:49.220]   going to happen next.
[00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:52.020]   And we can apply this to our own lives too.
[00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:56.100]   But when God charges us with something, when God tells you to do something, maybe it's
[00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:58.140]   something a bit challenging.
[00:16:58.140 --> 00:16:59.260]   Maybe it's something a bit tough.
[00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:03.540]   Maybe it's going to take a little bit of courage, a little bit of a risk.
[00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:06.820]   But how do we respond?
[00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:12.280]   I know often in life, my own answer to this starts with a what if.
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:15.740]   I'm not sure, you know, in the church, if you relate to that.
[00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:19.940]   I wonder how many of us are stuck in this what if, and I wonder how many of these what
[00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:25.580]   ifs hold us back from what God really wants to do through us.
[00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:30.420]   I wonder how many of us are letting our what ifs stop us making the right choice to be
[00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:33.380]   obedient to God.
[00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:40.080]   Because listen, if we focus on what ifs, the list could go on forever.
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:46.200]   There is always going to be the question of what if whenever God asks us to do something.
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:50.840]   This is what Moses struggled with, when God told him to go back into Israel, to free your
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:52.520]   people, let the people go.
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:55.400]   What if was one of the first things Moses responded.
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.440]   What if they don't believe me?
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.400]   What if the Pharaoh, you know, I'm not a good speaker.
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:01.680]   What if, what if, what if?
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:05.440]   What if I never find anyone else ever again?
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.480]   What if I fail?
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:08.680]   What if people make fun of me?
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:09.760]   What if I get rejected?
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.840]   What if it doesn't work out?
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:15.760]   These echo the five emotional barriers that Andrew talked about last week, right?
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:23.320]   The hurt, disappointment, regret, shame, and failure, all can be rooted in the what ifs.
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:28.600]   And if we just focus on what ifs, it will spiral us down into a deep, dark pit that's
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:32.280]   very, very difficult to climb out of.
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:36.140]   I know in my own life, one of the biggest what ifs came when we were deciding to start
[00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.760]   a family and have children.
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:41.280]   All right, let me explain a little bit what I mean by that.
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.080]   When I was born, I was born with a genetic condition, right?
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:48.000]   It was an unexpected thing, and no one else in my family has it.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.320]   And it's one of these things that progresses over time, right?
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.600]   And it progressively can get worse.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.400]   It's actually very, it's a bit unusual.
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:59.000]   You never really know how it's going to turn out, but it does progress over time as you
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.920]   get older.
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:05.160]   And one of the things is that it's a 50/50 chance whether or not you pass it down to
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.600]   your kids.
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.960]   And so as we were deciding about having kids, you know, we were fostering, do we adopt,
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:14.000]   do we have our own biological children, right?
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.640]   What if was a huge question, right?
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:23.520]   And we asked ourselves, I asked myself, what if our kids inherit my disorder?
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.640]   What's life going to look like for them, right?
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:29.720]   What if they have to suffer through all the turmoil, the emotions, everything that I had
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:30.720]   to go through?
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:35.560]   The last thing I would want them to go through is what I went through myself, right?
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:40.320]   What if it affects them in ways that we can't even see coming right now?
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:47.000]   Now, just to be real, right, my wife and I, we have two children, two boys, and both our
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.520]   boys have indeed ended up inheriting my genetic condition.
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:57.720]   In other words, my, our, what if became a reality.
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:03.560]   Like the thing I feared most became a reality in our lives.
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:06.840]   But you know what we came to realize in this process?
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:10.640]   What we realized in this process is that, and what I, as I was looking at this passage
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:16.480]   and reflecting, is that our God isn't a God of what ifs.
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:20.240]   Our God is a God of even if.
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:22.040]   Amen?
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:25.480]   And as Brittany and I reflected back on this journey, she was really the one who reminded
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:29.800]   me that actually God never promised that everything would be okay.
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:35.800]   Right, God never promised that our boys would be born without this genetic disorder.
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:39.400]   Even though that's what we fasted and prayed for, this is, we would gather people around
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:43.520]   and we prayed and we prayed and we prayed.
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:49.000]   And Brittany reminded me that we realized that the only promise that God gave was that
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.960]   he would be with us even if.
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:59.720]   And what we have now is beautiful and it's exhausting, but my family is a choice that
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:04.400]   I would make over and over and over and over again.
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:10.560]   Now, just to keep it real with you too, do I still hope and pray things could be different?
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:11.560]   Yes.
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:16.040]   Are we constantly praying for healing over myself and my sons?
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.040]   Of course.
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:20.040]   Every single night, that's my prayer for them.
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:25.800]   But even if, even if God doesn't answer those prayers, I'm going to give thanks for the
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:31.200]   beautiful gift that he has given us in our family and in our children.
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:37.320]   Listen church, don't let your what ifs hold you back.
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:41.560]   This is what Daniel and his friends were facing in the fiery furnace, right?
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:46.280]   And they decided that even if they were going to be burned alive, they would stay faithful
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:48.080]   to God.
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:51.320]   I have no clue what you guys are going through.
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:57.360]   I've sat and been with you and sat with you through some of us in this room today.
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:02.200]   And I know some of us here are going through unimaginable things right now.
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:09.680]   But what I do know is this, even if the worst case scenario in your mind comes true, even
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:16.840]   if then God is with you and if we are faithful and obedient to God, he assures that he will
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:21.080]   never leave us or forsake us.
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:23.280]   And this is what Samuel does, right?
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:29.080]   He responds in obedience, even if he had the potential for him to be, to end up dead.
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:33.960]   Scripture tells us Samuel did what the Lord said.
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:39.140]   Church, will this be our response?
[00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:45.440]   Even if it's the hard thing to do, are we willing to do what the Lord says?
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:49.520]   Because if we're going to embrace this year as a year of action, it means that the Lord
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:52.200]   is going to call us to do something.
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.560]   And more often than not, it's going to be challenging, right?
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:59.560]   The things that God calls us to do are not going to make sense from a worldly perspective.
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:05.240]   It's going to take an even if mindset for us to go forward in these things, right?
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:09.480]   What if Jesus tells you to give your money away to this or to that, would you be willing
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:10.920]   to do it?
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:14.560]   What if the Holy Spirit impresses on you that you need to forgive that person who has hurt
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:18.280]   you so profoundly, would you be willing?
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:21.320]   What if God says you need to go and share the gospel with that colleague that you've
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:26.280]   been sitting next to for three years that you've never talked to about Jesus, would
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:30.040]   you be willing to do it?
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:36.600]   Samuel's about to discover that God does things in his own and amazing ways.
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:43.720]   And he obeys God and God sends him to Jesse's house because he has a task to anoint one
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:49.040]   of his sons as the next king of Israel.
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.400]   And so Samuel arrives, let's go back to the story.
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:58.400]   When they arrived, Samuel saw Eliab and thought, "Surely the Lord's anointed here stands before
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.400]   the Lord."
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:04.200]   But let me remind us again, "The Lord said to Samuel, 'Do not consider his appearance
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.800]   or his height, for I have rejected him.'
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:10.920]   The Lord does not look at the things people look at.
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:14.560]   People look at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.'
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:18.200]   Then Jesse called Edim-ed-dab and had him pass in front of Samuel.
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.720]   And Samuel said, 'The Lord has not chosen any of these sons.
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:24.040]   The Lord didn't choose any of his seven sons.'
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:29.280]   So Jesse asked, 'Are these all the sons that you have?'"
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:32.880]   So in my mind when I read this passage, it was like a scene out of America's Next Top
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:33.880]   Model.
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:38.640]   Two beautiful models stand before me, but only one can become America's Next Top Model.
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.840]   I do a pretty good Tyra Banks impression.
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:45.520]   Anyway, that's for another time.
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:48.440]   So big brother Eliab stands up.
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:52.600]   He is tall, he is handsome, he's the man.
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:58.600]   This is the very reason Samuel thought Eliab was the man, because Saul had very similar
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.600]   features, we find out.
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:03.360]   Saul was also tall and handsome.
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:07.240]   One Samuel chapter 9 tells us that Saul was tall and handsome, a handsome young man, as
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:09.880]   tall, a head above everybody else.
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:16.000]   And Samuel is so impressed by what he sees in this beautiful specimen of a person.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.200]   And he says, "Surely, surely this has got to be it.
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:24.080]   What I'm looking at, he's so handsome, he's so tall, he's so beautiful.
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:28.160]   It couldn't possibly be anyone else."
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.960]   But God had other plans.
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.600]   And maybe this has been you.
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:36.340]   Maybe you've seen something and it looks good.
[00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:37.560]   It makes you feel good.
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:40.060]   It's attractive, it's desirable.
[00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:44.200]   And because it looks so good, you've come to the decision that surely this is what God
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.720]   wants for me.
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:49.560]   Or this relationship, it feels so good.
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.960]   Surely this is the right person for me.
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:55.200]   This boy I met is so handsome, he has to be it.
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:58.680]   This girl I met is so pretty, or surely she's the one for me.
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:02.000]   This job, it pays so well, I get to work in Central.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   This must be the right place for me to do my work.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:13.640]   Listen, just because it looks good doesn't mean it is good.
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:18.160]   And there are so many things that look good and we think will be good for us, but it is
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:22.440]   not what God wants for our lives.
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:26.560]   My son Isaiah could eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner, ice cream, every single meal,
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:30.760]   but obviously that's not good for him.
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:34.280]   God challenges Samuel, change your perspective.
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.920]   Don't look at the things other people look at.
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:40.720]   Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him.
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:43.800]   For a short guy like me, that's music to my ears, right?
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:47.140]   Always overlooked because of being short.
[00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:49.360]   But listen seriously how God speaks, right?
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.240]   This is strong language.
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.160]   Do not consider.
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:55.960]   In other words, God says don't even think about it.
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:27:00.480]   Don't let what you can see with your eyes make your decision for you.
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:03.040]   He might be big, he might be tall, he might be handsome.
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:06.680]   In the world's opinion, he looks the part.
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:12.560]   He might look exactly what you have in mind as a king, but he is not the one.
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:16.720]   And God goes far to say that actually he has rejected Eliab as king.
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:21.000]   This is the same word he uses when he removes Saul from his power position as king.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.080]   He uses the same word, he is rejected.
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:27.760]   I have rejected this man as the king of Israel.
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:32.920]   In other words, what God is trying to get Samuel to know is that despite how he looks,
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:36.720]   despite your own judgment, like I said, he's not the man.
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:37.720]   Why?
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:42.640]   Because the Lord does not look at the things people look at, and we should give a hallelujah
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:46.280]   to that.
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:48.720]   But let's think about this for a moment.
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:52.240]   What is it that we find so important?
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:54.400]   What are some of the things that we look at?
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:28:00.160]   What are some of these outward appearance things that we put so much weight and importance
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:01.160]   upon?
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.760]   Again, don't hear me wrong.
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.680]   I'm not saying don't take care of yourself.
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:10.520]   Of course, keep fit, work out, put some makeup on, choose a nice outfit, get a haircut.
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:13.440]   All this stuff is not bad in and of itself.
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:19.080]   However, it becomes bad when we only use these earthly things and this earthly perspective
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:24.320]   to make judgments about other people and how we make our decisions.
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:30.160]   And what becomes a problem is it becomes bad when we only use these things to judge how
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.840]   we make our choices.
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:38.200]   But so often this is how society, and maybe even us, we live our lives.
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:42.240]   We talked about this a little bit just now, but very much we live in a day and age when
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:47.280]   we totally judge things based upon outward appearances.
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:52.560]   The things people look at, like how you look, of course, the car you drive, the watch that
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:57.640]   you're wearing, the job you hold, where you live, how much money you appear to have, the
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:02.080]   partner you're with, the places you go eat, the places you go on holiday, how much money
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:06.920]   you have, how much money you spend on your handbag, your education level, things like
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:07.920]   this.
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:13.920]   But even the more important things are things like your ethnicity, the color of your skin.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:18.680]   And we as a people are so prone to make judgments based on these outward appearance things.
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:22.400]   And Hong Kong as a society is systemic for this.
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:27.240]   And the problem is it leads to us making really, really horrible choices when we live like
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.240]   this.
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:31.520]   Firstly, it affects the way we treat each other.
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:35.480]   We see an important looking guy, we see a rich looking person, and a poor looking person,
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:41.000]   and we begin to treat the rich looking person better.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.760]   We see a person who appears to be less educated or less successful and we immediately make
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.920]   certain assumptions about them.
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:52.520]   We see someone of a different ethnicity or skin color and immediately our mind is filled
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:56.840]   with prejudice and racist and discriminatory thoughts.
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:59.800]   So it affects the way we treat each other.
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:03.200]   But it also affects the way you treat yourself.
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:08.200]   And often we will go to painstaking lengths to appear a certain way to try and impress
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.880]   other people.
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:14.120]   Maybe you're trying to force your body to make a certain way, causing harm to your personal
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:15.800]   health.
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:19.480]   Maybe you're going deep into debt, you're buying all this stuff and going on holidays,
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:23.880]   eating all these fancy things just to give the impression that your life is good and
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:24.880]   perfect.
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:31.040]   And we compromise our dignity and values and relationships just so that we can feel and
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:34.600]   be accepted.
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:38.280]   But listen to what scripture tells us, church.
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:40.960]   Charm is deceitful.
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:43.640]   Beauty is vain.
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:50.080]   And don't forget that even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:54.320]   In other words, even the most evil things sometimes can have the appearance of looking
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:55.320]   good.
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:31:02.160]   And you know, actually it's easy to make yourself look good.
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:03.880]   To keep up an appearance.
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:08.720]   To make your social media look like your life is perfect.
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:11.920]   But it's all just a facade.
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:15.920]   And this is exactly the things that frustrated when Jesus looked out at the world when Jesus
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:16.920]   was here.
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:18.040]   He saw the Pharisees, right?
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:22.960]   One of the most frustrating things about them was that Jesus said they were like whitewashed
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:23.960]   tombs.
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:26.840]   Good on the outside, but rotten on the inside.
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:32.640]   You justify yourself in front of others, but God knows your heart.
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:37.120]   What people value highly is detestable in God's sight.
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:46.280]   Outwardly you appear righteous to others, but within you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:50.840]   This isn't the people we've been called to be, church.
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:54.480]   We haven't been called to be people that just look good on the outside.
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:58.360]   We haven't been called to be people that make choices based upon outward appearances.
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.360]   Well, let me say it this way.
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:06.040]   Jesus didn't die on the cross just so that we could appear to be good, right?
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:10.320]   And one of the dangers we face at the beginning of the year is that we focus all our energy
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:13.880]   into making choices so we can appear to be good on the outside.
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:19.080]   And as long as I appear to be good, everything is going to be fine.
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:23.920]   But come on, do we really want to live like this?
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:28.000]   It's kind of easy, but it's also super exhausting.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.440]   And you're going to fool some people for some time, maybe even for yourself for a while.
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:38.800]   But again, let's be reminded, God, the Lord, does not look at the things people look at.
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:45.280]   People look at outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:48.960]   The Lord is after our heart.
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:50.680]   He sees our motivations.
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:51.880]   He knows your intentions.
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:53.180]   He sees others.
[00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:56.160]   He sees things others don't see, right?
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:00.320]   Your character, your values, the places you've been, the thoughts you hold in your mind,
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:02.440]   your desires, your hopes, and your dreams.
[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:06.360]   The psalmist will even say he knows when you rise up and he knows when you sit down.
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:09.360]   He knows everything about you because he created you.
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.120]   He is your heavenly father.
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:12.960]   There is no hiding.
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:17.560]   There is nothing that goes unnoticed when it comes to God's knowledge of us.
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:22.560]   And that includes what happens inside your heart.
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:25.480]   So the question for us this morning, church, is this.
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:28.680]   How is your heart?
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:30.440]   Is it clean?
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:32.140]   Is it pure?
[00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:36.560]   Is it set on the things that are above and not on the things of earth?
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:41.480]   Do you have a heart of flesh instead of a heart of stone?
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:43.600]   Does your heart meditate on the word of God?
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:47.000]   Is it full of the joy of the Lord?
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   Is it wise?
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.500]   Do you have a heart that seeks to please the Lord?
[00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:53.680]   Does it come alive at the hearing of God's word?
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:58.480]   You have a heart that God would be after.
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:03.640]   These are the things that we should be concerned with most.
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:04.640]   Things of the heart.
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:08.060]   And yes, this is the harder choice to make.
[00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:13.720]   But when we take a good look at our hearts and squeeze it and test it, is it the things
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:16.340]   of God that comes out?
[00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:19.700]   Because this is the kind of church that Jesus is looking for.
[00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:21.600]   This is what he went to the cross for.
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:28.480]   Not superficial change, but for hearts that are longing for his presence in their lives.
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:31.860]   You see, the world might overlook the importance of the heart.
[00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:35.700]   We see that Samuel and Jesse almost did.
[00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:40.060]   And these seven sons come before them and all of them probably are tall and handsome,
[00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:44.320]   but none of them are the one that God has chosen.
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:48.820]   It's kind of funny in this story because he goes saying, "You have only seven boys.
[00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:49.820]   Only seven sons?
[00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:50.820]   You have any more?
[00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:51.820]   Maybe not enough."
[00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:52.820]   Right?
[00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:54.980]   Now, Jesse was probably thinking, "It must be one of these.
[00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:57.540]   It can't possibly be David."
[00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:01.140]   He didn't even bother calling David in in the first place until he was reminded, "Oh,
[00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:02.140]   yeah.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:03.140]   I have one more son.
[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:05.180]   He is out tending the sheep."
[00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:10.340]   And so from out in the fields, away from everyone, David is called in.
[00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:11.860]   He's the youngest, Jesse answered.
[00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:14.620]   He is tending the sheep.
[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:18.100]   So he's sent for, he's brought in, he's glowing with health.
[00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:20.300]   It says he has fine and handsome features.
[00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:22.540]   And the Lord said, "Rise up and anoint him.
[00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:23.540]   This is the one."
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:30.060]   So Samuel takes a horn of oil and anoints him in the presence of his brothers.
[00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:32.700]   There is still the youngest.
[00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:35.020]   This is also translated as the smallest.
[00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:39.300]   For Samuel, this was like a turning point.
[00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:40.540]   This is what the Lord's been saying.
[00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:42.500]   He's been telling me, "Don't look at this height.
[00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:45.340]   Here comes this little guy now.
[00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:47.300]   Maybe he's the one."
[00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:51.860]   And into the story, introduced to David, the shepherd boy.
[00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:54.300]   Glowing, healthy, and handsome, it says.
[00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:57.500]   Now again, let me explain for a minute because it sounds a bit contradictory.
[00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:59.580]   God just said, "Don't consider his outward appearance."
[00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:03.220]   Now scripture divides and describes David as fine and handsome.
[00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:05.060]   So what's up with that?
[00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:10.860]   It's important because notice, David was not picked because of his looks.
[00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:14.180]   It just so happened that he was good looking.
[00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:16.580]   It's the same point that scripture is trying to highlight.
[00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:19.340]   It doesn't matter how you look.
[00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:23.100]   If you're handsome, congratulations, God can use you.
[00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:27.420]   If you look a bit different, God can choose you too.
[00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:29.020]   The same point remains.
[00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:33.060]   The looks is not what God looks on as important.
[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:35.460]   What matters is your heart.
[00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:39.300]   And we're going to find out the qualities that David had were beyond his handsome and
[00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:40.300]   rugged looks.
[00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:43.900]   It's because he had a heart that was after God.
[00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:48.820]   He was a man after God's own heart.
[00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:52.100]   And the fact that he was a shepherd boy is also a significant detail.
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:56.180]   Again, on the outward appearance, something others would have overlooked.
[00:36:56.180 --> 00:37:02.180]   Being a shepherd would not have made sense for him to become king.
[00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:07.980]   You needed someone for a king to be from a military background who knew how to fight.
[00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:11.180]   Who is this kid who's been tending sheep?
[00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:15.500]   What right does he have to become a king?
[00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:18.980]   David is almost like a male Cinderella in this story.
[00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:24.140]   Cast out to the field to do the domestic chores.
[00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:30.220]   But as we consider further on in the story, when Jesus comes to this earth, how else does
[00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:34.500]   he describe himself as the good shepherd?
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:40.780]   As pastors, the word pastor actually means a shepherd of the people.
[00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:45.700]   So it's ironic that as the people would have never chosen a shepherd boy to lead the nation,
[00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:50.380]   this is exactly what God had in mind all along.
[00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:52.780]   It looks like he doesn't know how to fight, but check this out.
[00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:54.060]   You'll find out next week.
[00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:58.100]   It was very much because he was a shepherd out in the fields protecting his sheep that
[00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:02.900]   David acquired the skills that he needed to fight and bring down Goliath when he was in
[00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:06.020]   one-on-one combat with him.
[00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:11.420]   My point is this, God is serious when he says he looks at the heart.
[00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:16.500]   God isn't concerned about outward appearances and social norms.
[00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:22.900]   So church, let me ask you again, how is your heart?
[00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:28.640]   Because it might seem like according to the world, you don't have what it takes.
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:31.620]   People might have said to you, "Oh, you haven't achieved very much.
[00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:34.380]   What do you have to show for yourself?"
[00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:38.340]   It might seem like from outward appearances and earthly standards that you haven't been
[00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:42.180]   successful.
[00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:44.900]   Don't let the world lie to you.
[00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:51.860]   Stop listening to that junk and open your eyes to see things from God's perspective.
[00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:56.900]   Are we as a body of Christ able to rise above these superficial and earthly standards?
[00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:00.760]   The call on us, like I said, has not been to conform to this world, but to allow the
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:06.100]   Holy Spirit of God to transform and renew us.
[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:10.940]   And this starts by the renewing of our hearts.
[00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:17.900]   The Psalms will teach us to pray, "Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast
[00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:21.420]   spirit within me."
[00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:26.020]   Create in me a pure heart, not so I can look good to everyone else, not so I can appear
[00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:32.380]   to be righteous, but create within me a pure heart so that empowered by the Holy Spirit,
[00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:34.180]   I'm able to do your will.
[00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:39.740]   I'm able to choose to live life in the way that God has called me to live.
[00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:41.060]   I don't care what the world thinks.
[00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:43.580]   I don't care about that stuff.
[00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:48.460]   If this is really going to be a year of action for us, if we're serious about seeing the
[00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:52.620]   life of the Holy Spirit move in this church, if we're serious to see people coming into
[00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:57.820]   life-changing, salvation-giving relationship with Jesus, then this needs to be a place
[00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:04.300]   where all of us, I'm calling all of us to reflect the heart of God.
[00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:07.980]   This needs to be a place where someone who doesn't know Jesus at all walks in and says,
[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:08.980]   "You know what?
[00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:10.980]   These people are different.
[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:14.780]   I'm not judged here as I am on the outside world.
[00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:16.020]   They don't live life the same way.
[00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:18.740]   They don't make decisions the same way.
[00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:23.820]   They have hearts that reflect the heart of Jesus."
[00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:30.260]   And if we want to see the Spirit of God move powerfully in our midst, our hearts have to
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:33.900]   be in the right place.
[00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:36.420]   So this is how we're going to end.
[00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:40.980]   I'm going to ask all of us to close our eyes so we can just focus on what God wants to
[00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:44.340]   speak to us in this time.
[00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:49.580]   So I encourage you, church, if you're online and overflow outside right now, just close
[00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:59.060]   your eyes so you can focus.
[00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:04.420]   And our prayer is going to come from the line in the psalm that I read just now.
[00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:08.940]   I'm going to invite you in a minute to pray and repeat after me.
[00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:13.020]   I'm repeating Scripture, but you repeat after God's Word.
[00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:16.020]   But only do so if you're ready, church.
[00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:33.940]   Only do so if this is something that, a choice that you're making for yourself.
[00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:51.700]   So I'm going to read, and like I said, if you feel ready, you can repeat this as well.
[00:41:51.700 --> 00:42:00.180]   Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.
[00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:07.940]   Now let that sit with you for a minute, and invite the Holy Spirit now to come and move
[00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:14.820]   in your heart, to do that searching, to search the depth, to bring up anything that you need
[00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:24.660]   to confess to the Lord, to deal with, to hand over to Him, and just invite the Holy Spirit
[00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:43.660]   now to come and move within you.
[00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:48.420]   And as the Holy Spirit is moving, I again invite you to repeat these words after me
[00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:51.060]   from Psalm 139.
[00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:55.340]   Touch me, God, and know my heart.
[00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:59.900]   Test me and know my anxious thoughts.
[00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:07.540]   See if there's any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.
[00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:22.620]   And so Jesus, as we come before you now as a church, we pray for our hearts.
[00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:26.940]   But I pray that you would come and do the work that only your love and your presence
[00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:32.880]   can do.
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:38.260]   And yes, the world might have a certain, we have to be in this world, and we have to
[00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:45.500]   live lives, and we have to go about our daily work and things like that.
[00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:50.460]   But it's precisely in those spaces, Lord, that you want us to represent you.
[00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:56.140]   It's precisely in the way we live our lives that you want us to reflect who you are, the
[00:43:56.140 --> 00:44:00.860]   heart that you have for us and the people around us.
[00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:05.780]   And so Jesus, we give our hearts to you.
[00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:11.820]   Give us hearts that are clean and pure and new so that we can make the choices and live
[00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:15.540]   the life that you have called us to live.
[00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:25.740]   And as your body, Lord, as your children, as this church, as followers of you, we carry
[00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:32.620]   that with us every single day of our life, Lord.
[00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:33.620]   Come change our hearts, Jesus.
[00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:34.620]   We pray this in your name.
[00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:34.620]   Amen.
[00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:35.460]   Amen.
[00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:36.300]   Amen.
[00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:38.880]   (gentle music)
