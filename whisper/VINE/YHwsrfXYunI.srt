1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
 So today we will continue our sermon series on the book of James.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,880
 And Pastor Carla will be giving the message today.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,200
 So let's welcome Carla to the stage.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,080
 Hi, Carla.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:13,880
 Hi, Jennifer.

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:14,640
 How are you doing?

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,560
 I'm good.

8
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,480
 Are you ready?

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,080
 I am. Are you ready?

10
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,280
 Do you know, Jennifer, this is only Jennifer's second time service leaning in the morning.

11
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,400
 And she's done a great job.

12
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,000
 Yeah.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,760
 Thank you.

14
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,080
 I usually belong to the afternoon.

15
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,840
 Yeah.

16
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,560
 Hey, enough, enough.

17
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:37,840
 Why don't we stretch our hands and pray for Carla now.

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,960
 Jesus, we thank you for Carla.

19
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,080
 We thank you for her family as well.

20
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:47,520
 We thank you that, yes, she is an amazing leader in our community.

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,800
 And we thank you that you have chosen her to really speak to us today through the book of James.

22
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,160
 So, Lord, may your word speak to us, speak to each one of us.

23
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,000
 May you bless Carla as she is preaching your message today.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,200
 And we pray in Jesus name.

25
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,320
 Amen.

26
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,600
 Thank you.

27
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,360
 Hello, church.

28
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,640
 Hello, if you're watching online as well, so pleased that you're joining us.

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,080
 It's great that every week we have this contingent that join us online.

30
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,840
 And so I just want to also give a shout out to Michael.

31
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,480
 Michael is part of our community and he is in hospital at the moment.

32
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:32,000
 And he has been in hospital for a long, long time battling a horrendous disease.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,280
 But he is battling it and he's not doing it alone.

34
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:40,000
 We as a community continue to pray for you and Heather and Ben and Nathan.

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,720
 Isn't it beautiful that as a community, we are able to come together in those special moments and pray.

36
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,360
 That's what being the body of Christ is all about.

37
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,400
 And I love the fact that, you know, Ellison takes a massive chance.

38
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,880
 I mean, really, why if nobody had come forward?

39
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,440
 That would have been okay as well, right?

40
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,320
 Because sometimes, you know, we're battling things and there's no way we're coming out front.

41
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:11,680
 But really honor the fact that we are a community that are willing to lean in and pray for each other.

42
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,560
 And, you know, we have been looking at the book of James these number of weeks.

43
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:23,480
 And really that reminds us once again that our faith cannot just be something that is in our mind,

44
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,280
 but it has to be within our action.

45
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,440
 That is all about the book of James.

46
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,480
 James is very clear about that.

47
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,520
 We have to have a radical faith.

48
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,160
 We have to have an obedience to God.

49
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,040
 And it's a challenge.

50
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:44,520
 And I think, you know, when I read the book of James, sometimes I'm like, "Oh, he's pretty direct.

51
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,680
 He's got some hard words to say to us."

52
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,800
 But, you know, he has an expectation.

53
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:58,200
 He expects us, if we are going to choose to follow Jesus, he expects us to live differently.

54
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:04,600
 And as he was talking to his readers, you know, he was calling them out in this.

55
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,040
 So we're looking through at chapter 4 today.

56
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,040
 We're looking through verses 1 to 10.

57
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,880
 And we are going to be encouraged to really submit to God in all areas of our lives,

58
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:23,240
 but also encouraged to know that, you know, when we fall short of that, which we do,

59
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:29,680
 that we are reassured that we have incredible grace from God.

60
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:37,160
 There's this clear instruction from James that you cannot be friends with the world and God.

61
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:43,120
 But at the same time, there's this beautiful invitation to draw close to God

62
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,520
 and a promise that he draws close to us.

63
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:55,800
 And we'll know what victory means over things in our life that try to draw us away from God.

64
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:02,160
 Now, I think we can sometimes read the letter of James and kind of see it as a telling off.

65
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:11,480
 But rather, I hope through these number of weeks, we actually see just how much God truly loves us

66
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,840
 through the letter of James.

67
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:21,640
 So let's dive in straight, directly, as ever with James chapter 4.

68
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,800
 What causes fights and quarrels among you?

69
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,080
 Don't they come from the desires that battle within you?

70
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,480
 You desire, but you do not have.

71
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,040
 So you kill.

72
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,800
 You covet, but you cannot get what you want, so you quarrel and fight.

73
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,920
 You do not have because you do not ask God.

74
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,680
 When you ask, you do not receive because you ask with wrong motives,

75
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,000
 that you may spend what you get on your pleasures.

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,480
 You adulterous people, don't you know that friendship with the world means enmity against God?

77
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:57,160
 Therefore, anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.

78
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,840
 Or do you think Scripture says without reason that he jealously longs for the spirit

79
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,920
 he has caused to dwell in us?

80
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,760
 Ooh, James.

81
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:13,760
 So let's stop there for a moment to try and understand, okay, what is James saying and why?

82
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:19,920
 Remember, James is talking to the believers, those that have chosen to follow the way,

83
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:27,080
 those that have chosen to follow Jesus, and many have been scattered all over Asia Minor and beyond.

84
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,720
 So they're not only facing persecution for their new faith,

85
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:37,640
 but they were clearly facing some external challenges amongst themselves.

86
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:43,840
 There's infighting and disagreements driven by a selfish ambition.

87
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:52,040
 So James was addressing what he saw as an outward expression of inward struggles.

88
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:59,760
 He refers to the battles within, their motives, and how they were affecting their relationship with God,

89
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,240
 but also with each other.

90
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:11,560
 And I believe that these outward expressions of an inward struggle are relevant for us today.

91
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:19,720
 Now, I imagine that the majority of us in this room are Christians, that you chose to follow Jesus.

92
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,440
 But there will be some that maybe are on a journey of discovery,

93
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:30,120
 maybe in this room or watching online, where you're asking the question, "Who is Jesus?"

94
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:37,760
 And I want to encourage you that this inward and outward struggle is relevant to you too.

95
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,800
 And I hope that this message will stir something within you

96
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:49,440
 as you continue to journey in the discovery of knowing who Jesus is.

97
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,000
 So when we make a decision to follow Jesus,

98
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,680
 we are choosing to say goodbye to the old way of life, embrace a different way of living.

99
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,920
 But if we're honest, sometimes that's really hard.

100
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:08,280
 How often do we find ourselves acting out in ways that align more with the world

101
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,240
 than they do with the values of Jesus?

102
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,960
 And it can sometimes feel like we're being pulled in two different directions.

103
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,320
 That tension James is talking about is related to our relationship with the world

104
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,920
 and our relationship with God.

105
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,400
 Now, when I talk about the world, I'm not talking about the people.

106
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:37,800
 I'm talking about the systems, the values, the desires that drive our decisions and our actions.

107
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:44,760
 And as James mentions later in this chapter, we're also talking about spiritual forces,

108
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:51,080
 those that are working against us and working against God.

109
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:57,400
 So this idea of being pulled this way and that way is captured really well by the Apostle Paul

110
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,680
 in his letter to the Romans.

111
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:05,360
 He says this, "I do not understand what I do, but what I want to do, I do not do,

112
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,080
 but what I hate, I do."

113
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,560
 You know, I love that.

114
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,720
 Am I the only one that loves that?

115
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,520
 I mean, I'm so glad that that verse is in the Bible.

116
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,920
 And it was the Apostle Paul who said it.

117
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:25,840
 Our natural inclination tends to be towards the things of the world that cause and can lead us

118
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,360
 into sin.

119
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,720
 And this idea that we cannot be friends with the world and friends with God is captured

120
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,760
 throughout Scripture.

121
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:45,520
 You see, the world, its systems, the spiritual forces around us are in opposition to God.

122
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,320
 And Jesus himself taught clearly.

123
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,480
 He said, "No one can serve two masters.

124
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,640
 Either you will hate the one and love the other.

125
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,720
 You'll be devoted to one and despise the other.

126
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,960
 You cannot serve both God and mammon, money and materials."

127
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:08,480
 And then he said, "If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first.

128
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,400
 If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own.

129
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:18,800
 As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world,

130
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,920
 and that is why the world hates you."

131
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,720
 And he prayed, Jesus prayed to his father, and he said, "I have given them," followers

132
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,840
 of Jesus at that time, "and for us now, your word.

133
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:37,600
 And the world has hated them, for they are not of the world any more than I am of the

134
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,600
 world.

135
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,280
 My prayer is not that you take them out of the world, but that you protect them from

136
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,160
 the evil one.

137
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:50,880
 They are not of the world, even as I am not of it."

138
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,360
 And John says, "Do not love the world or anything in the world.

139
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,480
 If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in them."

140
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,760
 So I think it's pretty clear, right?

141
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:10,280
 The theologian and scholar N.T. Wright puts it this way, "Christianity is a way of seeing

142
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,280
 the world.

143
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:18,960
 It is a way of being in the world and a way of acting in the world grounded in the story

144
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,400
 of Jesus."

145
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:27,440
 So as Christians, our way in the world must be different.

146
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,200
 Talking about our colleagues over yum cha with friends, as believers, we choose not

147
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
 to.

148
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:40,960
 The last elderly person on the bus with no seat, as believers, we give up our seat for

149
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,320
 them.

150
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,840
 Invited to a boys' or girls' weekend away where we know there will be strip bars as part

151
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:55,280
 of the entertainment, as believers, we choose not to go, or we choose to go but we hold

152
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:01,400
 strong boundaries while we are away so we do not join activities that do not honor God

153
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,720
 and do not honor others.

154
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:11,960
 A colleague has a large hospital bill and they're struggling to pay, and you know that.

155
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:18,600
 As believers, we anonymously give generously because we can.

156
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,840
 Our tax bill is due.

157
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,840
 Yikes!

158
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:28,640
 As believers, we pay without trying to distort the numbers.

159
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:36,640
 A colleague is promoted over you, even though you're better qualified, more experienced.

160
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:45,320
 As believers, we refuse to allow disappointment to take root, cause bitterness, and instead

161
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,400
 we congratulate them.

162
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:55,000
 And I'm sure you can think of multiple other experiences, examples within your own context.

163
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,360
 When our faith is deep, grounded in Scripture and our relationship with God, we'll find

164
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:09,400
 ourselves naturally wanting to act differently, different to how the world would act.

165
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,320
 We don't do this simply because we want to be different, because it's our faith that

166
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:19,240
 grounds us, it's our morals, it's our choices, our actions are different.

167
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:25,440
 They flow because we've surrendered to Jesus and it is the convicting transformative work

168
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,560
 of the power of the Holy Spirit in our lives.

169
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:36,600
 When we choose to follow Jesus, we must live differently.

170
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:42,680
 Let me give you an example of when I first got married.

171
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:48,280
 For the first few months of being a newlywed, I was really awful.

172
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,440
 Now you don't believe that, do you?

173
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,000
 How could I be awful?

174
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,760
 Like I'm like the nicest person.

175
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,360
 Well, I wasn't.

176
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,240
 I was awful.

177
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,160
 I wasn't treating Richard very well at all.

178
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:11,240
 And to be honest, I was really struggling because I was used to being very independent

179
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:16,720
 and suddenly, you know, I had somebody else to think of.

180
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,080
 I was working, Richard was about to go back to study, so he had a little bit more time,

181
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:28,440
 but I spent most of my time actually hanging out with my work colleagues.

182
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,040
 And to be honest, you wouldn't even really know that I was married.

183
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:40,160
 When I went home, I was moody, bad-tempered, just not nice to be around.

184
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,480
 It got to the stage where close friends of ours confronted me on this.

185
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:53,120
 Now, we've been married for 33 years.

186
00:13:53,120 --> 00:14:00,440
 But I still remember when I was confronted, when they said to me about my behavior and

187
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,240
 how I was treating Richard.

188
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,560
 And so I made that decision.

189
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,560
 You know what?

190
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,680
 That's right.

191
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:15,080
 I chose to then invest more into my relationship with Richard, focusing on my marriage.

192
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:19,000
 Stop acting as though I was single.

193
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,920
 In a similar way, when we choose to make a decision to follow Jesus, we are making a

194
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,760
 decision not to follow the old ways of our life.

195
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,160
 We want to live differently.

196
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:37,720
 It's intentional, but it's about surrendering to God and working on our relationship with

197
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,720
 God.

198
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,560
 And I'm sure if you were to ask Richard, he would agree, I'm much nicer to live with now.

199
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,560
 Is that right?

200
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,560
 Yes.

201
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,800
 Give me the thumbs up.

202
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,200
 So why is this so important?

203
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,680
 And why is it so hard sometimes?

204
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,840
 I think first of all, we've really got to grasp how much God loves us.

205
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:03,480
 Now, we hear this a lot in church, but we really need our revelation of what that actually

206
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,560
 means.

207
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:11,440
 Because when we actually grasp how much God's love is unconditional, not dependent on what

208
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,920
 you do, but simply because of who God is.

209
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:25,160
 When you appreciate how James uses language associated with marriage to help us see that,

210
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:33,680
 when he calls the people adulterous, he does this to emphasize how God sees his relationship

211
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,200
 to his people.

212
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,820
 It's a metaphor we see reflected through scripture.

213
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:42,040
 It's this marital relationship between God and us.

214
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:49,000
 And I think we would agree that for a marriage to work, it must be built on mutual trust,

215
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,160
 commitment, loyalty, and love for each other.

216
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,480
 If one partner is not able to do that, when there is a lack of trust, one-sided commitment,

217
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,080
 disloyalty, the marriage breaks down.

218
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:10,920
 I recently read that the exclusivity of marriage is the essence of marriage.

219
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,240
 And I think that is so true.

220
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:20,040
 And so God reminds us again and again that he is faithful to us, even when we are not

221
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:28,360
 faithful to him, but there is a righteous jealousy over us, and he will not accept our

222
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:34,120
 allegiance, our fidelity, our attachment to other things.

223
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:43,040
 Exodus tells us, "You shall worship no other God, for the Lord whose name is Jealous is

224
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,640
 a jealous God."

225
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,260
 And the Hebrew for jealous is kanah.

226
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:55,920
 And throughout scripture, we see God as kanah for his glory, jealous for his glory, kanah

227
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,200
 for his people.

228
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,120
 Why?

229
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:07,680
 Because of his absolute holiness and love, absolute, and the expectation of exclusive

230
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,480
 worship from his creation.

231
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,240
 He loves you too much.

232
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,040
 He knows what is best for you.

233
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:21,440
 He knows that if we follow the way of the world, as broken as it is, we will never be

234
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,340
 truly satisfied.

235
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:26,480
 We will continue to strive endlessly.

236
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,560
 We will continue to try to achieve, driven by ambition, to be successful, to be wealthy,

237
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:39,540
 to be rich, to be happy, maybe even to do some good, but all on our own strengths.

238
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:45,000
 Just ask anyone who's achieved great wealth or highly successful or achieved most of their

239
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,760
 goals, have they stopped striving?

240
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,360
 Stopped gaining more?

241
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,160
 Are they satisfied?

242
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,880
 Usually not.

243
00:17:53,880 --> 00:18:01,440
 The world will never give us what we think we need because from the very beginning, Genesis

244
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:09,280
 1 and 2, we were created to be in perfect relationship with God, with each other, and

245
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,940
 creation.

246
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:14,880
 And then we all know what happened in Genesis 3, right?

247
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:21,120
 When sin entered and our world is fractured.

248
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,160
 Because of God's love for us, he'll not accept our friendship.

249
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:29,760
 He'll not accept our friendship with the value systems of the world because they're in opposition

250
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:35,160
 to him and they are destructive to us.

251
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,600
 So we're also facing that spiritual oppression.

252
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:43,760
 We know, again, Scripture talks about powers and principalities that are working against

253
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,840
 God, but they're working against us as well.

254
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:53,360
 So don't be surprised when you find yourself being pulled in two different directions.

255
00:18:53,360 --> 00:19:01,640
 But we have a way to overcome this internal struggle which changes our external behaviors

256
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:07,440
 as you choose friendship over God, over friendship with the world.

257
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,360
 The good news and the encouragement to us is that James is very clear on how to do that.

258
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:18,960
 How we can choose God over the world when in surrender, in humility, and in trust, when

259
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:25,840
 we come to God, when we recognize and acknowledge who he is and how much we need him, when we

260
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,240
 draw close to him, we'll know his presence.

261
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:33,320
 We'll know victory in our life over the enemy.

262
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:37,360
 From verse 6, let's see what James says.

263
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,400
 But he gives us more grace.

264
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,600
 That is why Scripture says, "God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble."

265
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,400
 Submit yourselves then to God, resist the devil and he will flee from you.

266
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,640
 Come near to God and he will come near to you.

267
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,880
 Wash your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.

268
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,920
 Grieve, mourn, and wail, change your laughter to mourning and your joy to gloom.

269
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:06,520
 Humble yourself before the Lord, he will lift you up.

270
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:12,080
 It will be impossible to choose God without God's grace in our life and the power of the

271
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,400
 Holy Spirit in us.

272
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:21,920
 But God promises he gives us grace and we'll have his favor when we simply admit we need

273
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,600
 him and turn towards him.

274
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:31,280
 James makes it very clear, we draw near to God and he draws near to us.

275
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,880
 But don't think that this means God is like over there in the distance and we've got to

276
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,360
 do the work to get to him.

277
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,680
 God actually has never left us.

278
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,480
 He's here right by our side.

279
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,960
 He's been there the whole time.

280
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,600
 The Lord is near to all who call on him, to all who call on him in truth.

281
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,800
 Never will I leave you, never will I forsake you.

282
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:05,560
 And behold, I am with you always to the end of the age.

283
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:13,480
 So James is emphasizing this posture of humility that we need to have when we realize we have

284
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,480
 to draw close to God.

285
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,480
 He's there.

286
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:23,560
 And it's interesting because if you contrast this with the Old Testament, think about Moses.

287
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:29,360
 When Moses was drawing near to God and God said, "Stop, don't come any closer.

288
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,400
 Take off your sandals, the ground is holy."

289
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:39,520
 Not the holy priest, the high priest who was the only one that could go into the holy of

290
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:47,600
 holies to speak on behalf of the people when he went to God.

291
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,820
 The only one.

292
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:53,320
 And yet we have an intimacy with God now.

293
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,400
 Why?

294
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,760
 Why is it different?

295
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,640
 It's Jesus.

296
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,000
 It's the death and resurrection of Jesus.

297
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 It's his blood that allows us to be in an intimate relationship with our God.

298
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,640
 The God who created heaven and earth.

299
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:18,160
 Like we heard last week with Andrew, the God who spoke and the world was.

300
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:23,920
 That's the God that calls us into friendship.

301
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:30,520
 So in that intimacy, James tells us and his readers that when we have God's presence,

302
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:40,280
 we also have the power to face every situation and to face those situations where the enemy

303
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:44,800
 is trying to attack us.

304
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,200
 Resist the devil and he will flee from you.

305
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,720
 Now I know maybe some of us in the room are thinking, "Hmm, how do you resist the devil

306
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,720
 and he will flee?

307
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,040
 What does that actually look like?

308
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,000
 We can't see anything here.

309
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,520
 There's no little minions running around that we can slap.

310
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,520
 So what does it actually mean?

311
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:12,040
 Let me give you an example of one occasion recently where I resisted the devil and he

312
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,040
 fled.

313
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:18,600
 I had to think what the grammar for "flew" was then.

314
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,800
 Flew, flew, fled.

315
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:28,400
 So I was traveling to work on the bus and I overheard a conversation between two people.

316
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:34,120
 And just so that you're aware, I wasn't eavesdropping.

317
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,720
 You know, they were talking in English.

318
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,960
 They were talking quite loud and I just happened to be sat there minding my own business as

319
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,040
 I'm traveling to work.

320
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:48,400
 Anyway, they're talking about money and they're discussing it quite openly.

321
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:55,840
 They're talking about how they were set up for retirement, how much money they were making,

322
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:01,960
 how they were able to be really smart because they were using -- the money was making them

323
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,440
 money.

324
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,520
 And so I'm sat there listening to them talk about this and I'm not kidding you.

325
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:13,240
 I mean, I was just happily sat there going to work, not thinking about anything.

326
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:23,280
 A thought came into my mind out of nowhere, said to me, "You do not have enough.

327
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,400
 You will never have enough.

328
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,120
 You're too late.

329
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:32,500
 You've wasted your life and you've certainly not been smart.

330
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,560
 You should have done better."

331
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,040
 Now I'm not kidding you.

332
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,520
 Generally I'm not an anxious person.

333
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:47,880
 Really physically I felt such stress.

334
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,160
 My heart was beating faster.

335
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,040
 I felt a weight on me.

336
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,280
 I felt sad.

337
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:58,640
 I felt so sad as I began to think, "Oh my goodness.

338
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,240
 I don't have enough.

339
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,520
 Hong Kong's an expensive city.

340
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,440
 What about my future?"

341
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:14,360
 And then, because I like to take action, I put in my head a plan of action of how I was

342
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,800
 going to deal with this.

343
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:22,520
 So my action involved, okay, I've got to work out how do I make extra money on the side?

344
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:28,720
 How does Richard make extra money on the side?

345
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:35,040
 And what do we need to cut and sort of start saving on in order that we can save a little

346
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,480
 bit more for the future?

347
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:41,120
 So all of this is going on within my head.

348
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:47,440
 I'm just sat on the bus, but it's like this, "Foom."

349
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,720
 And as I was just trying to work all this out in my head, I had another very strong

350
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,800
 voice.

351
00:25:53,800 --> 00:26:02,240
 It said to me, "The world's economy is not your economy."

352
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:10,000
 And then a little bit more gentler voice, "God's economy is different."

353
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,440
 And I knew immediately then that was the Holy Spirit.

354
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,280
 But listen, I had a choice.

355
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:23,240
 I could have stayed with my train of thought that was spiraling into fear, anxiety, and

356
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:28,520
 planning action, which I don't think Richard would have been very happy about.

357
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,120
 Or I could have decided, "You know what?

358
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,120
 I am not going to accept this.

359
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,040
 Where did this even come from?

360
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:39,280
 I was just happy on the bus going to work."

361
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,200
 So I decided that I refused to accept those words.

362
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:47,200
 I told myself there and then, "I do have enough.

363
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,040
 God has always been faithful and he always will be faithful."

364
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:57,200
 And immediately, I'm not kidding you, I didn't feel sad.

365
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:04,800
 I felt physically so much better and just the heaviness just lifted and I just felt,

366
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,720
 "Oh, okay, let's carry on the bus ride then."

367
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,760
 But this is an example of what it means.

368
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:15,000
 You know, the enemy, he thinks he's so smart.

369
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,920
 He just throws all these little lies at you.

370
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:24,240
 The problem is sometimes we don't resist them and so they stay.

371
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:33,440
 We begin to see or act when those are just lies of the enemy.

372
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:40,520
 We have to be able to resist the devil because it says he will flee, not he may be, could,

373
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,520
 depends on his day.

374
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,720
 No, he will flee.

375
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:53,280
 To live genuinely as believers of Jesus, we recognize there is a choice to make in who

376
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,840
 and what we are aligned to, the world or God.

377
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,840
 Cannot be both.

378
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:04,040
 The inward struggles and the external behaviors we have to overcome, we can if we choose friendship

379
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,280
 with God.

380
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:11,880
 We draw close to him and that is key to the victory in living in a world where there's

381
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:18,240
 a lot of tension, in a world where we're being pulled away.

382
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,360
 But it's proactive to draw close.

383
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,360
 It's not a one-off thing.

384
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:29,000
 It's an intentional, habitual, drawing close day after day after day for the rest of our

385
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,960
 lives while we're here on earth.

386
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:39,560
 So in the context of Hong Kong and our very busy lives here, what are some of the ways

387
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,200
 that we can draw close to God?

388
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,960
 Well I can tell you what it's not.

389
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,520
 It's not spiritual activity.

390
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,840
 Can I hear an amen?

391
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:54,120
 Does anybody want spiritual activity for the sake of spiritual activity?

392
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,520
 No.

393
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,600
 It is not your daily Bible reading.

394
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,540
 It is not in the activity of going to church.

395
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:10,080
 It is not bringing God a list of prayer requests or even listening to beautiful worship music.

396
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,720
 Now don't get me wrong.

397
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:19,720
 These are all good disciplines and we should do them, but they are a means to enter into

398
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,720
 his presence.

399
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:29,000
 They are a means in order to commune with God, to have a friendship with them.

400
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,720
 So of course we do all of these things.

401
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:39,560
 Absolutely read your Bible, come to church, worship, but ask yourself this, did I meet

402
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,440
 with God?

403
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,160
 When you leave the service, did you really meet with God when you were here?

404
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,560
 Did you commune with God?

405
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,360
 Is God a friendship?

406
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,840
 Is there a friendship there?

407
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,620
 Because that's what God wants.

408
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:57,200
 It's not tasks ticked off a list.

409
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,160
 True friendship is about a true relationship with each other.

410
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,280
 It's the same with God.

411
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:07,640
 I think in this service especially, some of you really struggle with this idea of friendship

412
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,640
 with God.

413
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,640
 That is so alien to you.

414
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:16,040
 You can't understand how do you have a friendship with God?

415
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:21,760
 Well I really encourage you to pursue this because it will change how you view God when

416
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:28,760
 you realize his pursuit of you is to be in friendship.

417
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:34,880
 It can seem challenging at times to have a conversation with God rather than just bring

418
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,800
 him your prayer list.

419
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:41,360
 But it's being intentional about creating that intimacy with him.

420
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,760
 So as I close, I want to bring a take home application.

421
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:53,240
 One practical way that I personally have found helps me draw closer to God.

422
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,560
 And it's through the idea of contemplative prayer.

423
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:02,280
 Now this sounds really simple, but it's very difficult.

424
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:07,560
 But if you can commit to some regular rhythm in your life, in your relationship with God,

425
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:12,560
 it will deepen your friendship and intimacy.

426
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:18,920
 And contemplative prayer is about being silently focused on God.

427
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:23,760
 It's letting go of every thought and other distraction that is around you.

428
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,840
 And let me tell you, that is so difficult.

429
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,720
 And I challenge you to try this because it is not easy.

430
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,080
 And the fact that it's not easy should surprise us.

431
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:41,800
 Because in this, my version of a practice of the 14th century from the book of Privy

432
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:46,720
 Counseling, they say you should set aside a certain amount of time.

433
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,280
 Now I would say first of all, you've got to get a timer.

434
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:53,600
 Because if you don't use a timer, after three minutes, you're going to be like, "Okay, what's

435
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,600
 time then?

436
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,600
 Did we--?"

437
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,880
 So set a timer, first of all, for 20 to 30 minutes.

438
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:06,360
 Find a quiet space without distraction or disturbance.

439
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:12,880
 Then believe and accept God's gracious love towards you.

440
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:19,680
 Imagine for a moment you're resting on him, as a sick child would rest on a comforting

441
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,360
 parent or guardian.

442
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:28,040
 Next, don't allow yourself to analyze yourself or God.

443
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,600
 This is hugely important.

444
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:36,720
 Because we know our minds play tricks on us or try to distract us or tell us what we haven't

445
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:42,360
 done, how unworthy we are, and questions whether or not God really, really does love.

446
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,760
 All of this goes in our mind.

447
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,400
 You've got to push it away.

448
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,480
 Push it away so there are no distractions whatsoever.

449
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,320
 You push it away and you'll be encouraged by the simple truth.

450
00:32:52,320 --> 00:33:00,960
 You are known, you are loved, and you are accepted just as you are in that present moment.

451
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,000
 And if it helps, you repeat, "I am loved.

452
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,480
 I am loved.

453
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,480
 I am loved."

454
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,720
 You see, many of us don't really believe that.

455
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,680
 We say it, but we can't sit in it.

456
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:22,000
 If you could sit 20 to 30 minutes and you are telling yourself how much you are loved

457
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:29,360
 in the presence of God, that will do huge wonders for your confidence, that's for sure.

458
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:35,440
 But to be able to do that isn't easy because we're so busy-minded.

459
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:41,520
 But the most important thing is once that timer goes off, you've had that meditative

460
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:50,200
 time with God, intimacy with Him, and it's only 20 minutes of your time.

461
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,280
 It is life-giving.

462
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:56,680
 I found it hugely freeing for me because it gave me permission not to think about, "Oh,

463
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,840
 well, I must do this, I must do that.

464
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,120
 Well, I better ask for this and I better talk about this with God."

465
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,120
 Instead, there was nothing.

466
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,920
 It was just me and God.

467
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:13,120
 If you're a parent, you know what it's like when a child climbs up onto your lap and they

468
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,080
 just sit there.

469
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:20,360
 They're not talking, wriggling, whining, anything.

470
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:25,160
 They're just there in your presence and it's a beautiful thing.

471
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:32,040
 And that's how God is and wants us to be with Him.

472
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:40,600
 So as you leave today, I challenge you all to ask this question daily, "Am I choosing

473
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:44,640
 friendship with God or the world?"

474
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:51,400
 And then create within your routine those regular rhythms where you're choosing to seek

475
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:56,920
 God because you are close to Him, because you have a friendship with Him.

476
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:05,120
 And victory comes over those internal struggles and then those behaviors when we submit and

477
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:09,400
 draw close and He's with us.

478
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,320
 I would love to be able to pray for us now.

479
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,940
 So if you would be able to stand.

480
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:24,200
 When I was preparing this message, one of the pictures that I got was that we were here

481
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,040
 and many of us had scales on our eyes.

482
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,400
 The scales were on our eyes because for a number of different reasons.

483
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:37,640
 One is for some of us, we don't really know what it is that we are doing that is in the

484
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,640
 world.

485
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,080
 We've been doing things that are choosing friendship with the world more than friendship

486
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:47,980
 with God for so long, we don't even know what that is.

487
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:54,000
 And the picture that I got was of scales falling off.

488
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,680
 We need to be a community of believers.

489
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:03,080
 We need to be a body of Christ that chooses friendship with God, not friendship with the

490
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,440
 world.

491
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:10,400
 We need help to see where we've chosen the world.

492
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:17,520
 And so maybe that's you and while we sing in a response song, I believe the scales will

493
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,200
 come off and God will show you.

494
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:24,400
 He will draw you into place of seeing where you need to let go the things of the world

495
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:31,560
 that are holding you, that are causing behaviors that you know are not good for you, not good

496
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,920
 for your family.

497
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:39,720
 And then the other side was this sense that the enemy, he does not want you to even think

498
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:47,960
 that he does send words and ideas in your head that would cause you to feel anything

499
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:51,200
 but not good about yourself.

500
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,720
 He doesn't want you to believe that he does that.

501
00:36:53,720 --> 00:37:00,480
 And I believe that the scales need to come off here that we would spiritually, supernaturally

502
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:07,240
 be able to discern when the enemy is attacking because it's very clear in scripture, we have

503
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:14,440
 the power as believers of Jesus, the spirit is within us to resist the enemy and he will

504
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,720
 flee.

505
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:19,840
 And too many of us, we're not resisting.

506
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:29,640
 So as we pray and as we worship, may our eyes be open to truly see so that we can enter

507
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:38,560
 into this world, not in the world, not of the world, but because we know that God is

508
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,560
 with us.

509
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:46,120
 So let me pray.

510
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:51,560
 Father, I thank you.

511
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:56,040
 I thank you for everyone here today and everyone watching online.

512
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,320
 Lord, we need help.

513
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:04,160
 We thank you that you've given us help by your spirit.

514
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,240
 Help us to choose friends with you over friends of the world.

515
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:13,200
 And I pray for those that are struggling in this area, would their eyes be open to see

516
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,600
 right now.

517
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:24,160
 I pray, Father God, may our posture as believers be one of humility and repentance as we recognize

518
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,360
 we need you in our lives.

519
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,320
 We can't do it on our own.

520
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,920
 We are not self-sufficient.

521
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,200
 We can't be.

522
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:40,440
 And I pray, Father, that we would be reminded that the enemy has no power over us.

523
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,520
 We resist and he will flee because we belong to you.

524
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:49,560
 And I pray for those in this room that have scales over their eyes and have believed the

525
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:55,920
 lies of the enemy for so long, the narrative over them is distorted.

526
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:02,920
 I pray, Father God, you remove those scales so they can truly see how much they are known,

527
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:08,840
 they are seen, they are loved, and they are accepted.

528
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:15,240
 And Father, we pray this, that may we be truly lifted up in your love.

529
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,640
 In Jesus' name, amen.

530
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,360
 Amen.
