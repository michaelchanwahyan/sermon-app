[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720]   - Thank you Carla for just being amazing as always.
[00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:03.720]   So good.
[00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.720]   Well, welcome to The Vine.
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.280]   My name's Andrew, one of the pastors here,
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.920]   and there's probably a lot of you
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.560]   that are visiting with us this weekend,
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.480]   and we are so, so glad that you are with us and amongst us.
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.320]   And I know there's loads of people
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.480]   in the overflow right now,
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.880]   so I wanted to say hi to everybody in the overflow.
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.720]   Thank you guys for being willing to sit in the overflow,
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.280]   and then everybody that's sitting on the floor
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.120]   and everything crazy.
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.360]   Anyway, we're so glad you guys are here.
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.560]   A number of years ago,
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.040]   I was invited to speak at a church overseas,
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.960]   and this happens a number of times for me,
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.280]   and it's always a great privilege to travel overseas,
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.120]   to speak in other churches and other contexts.
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.480]   But every time I get invited to speak overseas,
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.840]   I know that I, as well as being excited,
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.160]   I know that I'm also gonna be exhausted,
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.880]   because these trips are like full on.
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.920]   From the moment that the pastor from that church
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.360]   picks you up at the airport,
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.440]   to the moment that they drop you back at the airport,
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.480]   like three days later, you are on 24/7.
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.120]   It is crazy.
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.400]   They expect you not just to speak in their church,
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.040]   but they expect you to sort of pastor all their people,
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.480]   pray for everybody, solve all the problems of the church,
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.320]   work out why their finances are not right,
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.520]   visit with their eldership,
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.800]   and solve all the problems there,
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.400]   and strategically believe for everything.
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.680]   You're supposed to have a prophetic word
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.280]   for every single person in the church.
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.600]   The whole thing is crazy, and it is a great privilege.
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.200]   Honestly, one of the great privileges to go there.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.480]   I love what I do, and when I get invited to go do that,
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.920]   I'm very excited about it,
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.000]   but I recognize that I have to manage my energy.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.600]   If I don't manage my energy,
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.600]   I know that about a day and a half into the trip,
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.440]   I will hate everybody in that church.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.200]   I will be exhausted.
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.840]   Anyone here not like people when you're tired?
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.920]   You know when you get tired, right?
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.280]   You get a little prickly with people.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.040]   And I realize that I'm going overseas to this church,
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.640]   I'm representing the vine, right?
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.400]   I don't wanna be that guy like two days in
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.440]   who really doesn't like the people around them,
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.840]   and is getting a little prickly with people.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.680]   So I have to like make sure that my energy
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.440]   is well managed on these trips.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.760]   Well, on this particular trip I went to,
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.520]   the church was larger than the vine.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.360]   They had five services on a Sunday.
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.240]   I was speaking at all five services,
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.040]   pretty much back to back.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.040]   After the third service, I was tired.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.040]   After the fourth service, I was a little bit wobbly.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.480]   After the fifth service, I couldn't even remember my name.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.400]   Okay, I was really exhausted.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.760]   And of course it was after every service,
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.320]   they expected me to be on the prayer line.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.200]   So I'd go down the front, I'd be on the prayer line.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.960]   And it was after the fifth service,
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.560]   I'm on the prayer line after I've just preached,
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.520]   there's a crowd of people that are waiting
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.480]   to get prayed for me, that the most awkward thing
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.280]   that perhaps has ever happened to me, happens.
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.600]   There was this guy on the prayer line,
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.560]   waiting for me to pray with him.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.920]   He comes forward and as usual with these sort of things,
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.720]   you know, we introduce ourselves and stuff.
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.280]   And I say to him, the thing that I say to pretty much
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.280]   everybody when I'm ever on a prayer line,
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.520]   I say to him, what is it that you would like me
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.520]   to pray for you for today?
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.160]   You know, what is it that I can pray for you about?
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.720]   This was his response.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.640]   He said this, "You're a man of God.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.240]   "I don't need to tell you what my needs are.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.680]   "God knows, just ask God and he will tell you.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.840]   "I wanna see what you will say."
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.840]   (congregation laughing)
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.000]   Five services, okay, I'm exhausted.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.040]   And I don't like people at this point, all right?
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.600]   And here's this guy, and I tell you what,
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.080]   this happens more than you might think,
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.360]   more than you expect.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.040]   This guy comes up to me, he's basically like,
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.800]   "I wanna see whether you're really a pastor.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.400]   "I wanna see if you really hear from God, okay?
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.200]   "I know what my needs are, God knows, but do you know?
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.080]   "Ha ha ha ha, you're gonna have to pray about it.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.880]   "And when you pray about it, we'll find out
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.720]   "if you hear from the Spirit of God."
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.960]   (congregation laughing)
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.840]   By the way, if you're taking notes, write this down.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.640]   Us pastors do not like people like this, okay?
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.400]   This feels like you're put under a spiritual test.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.320]   It feels like they're testing you
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.640]   to see whether you're truly a person of the Spirit.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.480]   And so this guy is speaking like this.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.360]   By the way, this is on the same part
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.040]   as the other pet peeve that us pastors have,
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.880]   and that's this, "Pastor, you prayed for me seven years ago
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.600]   "and I've never seen you ever since.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.400]   "Do you remember what you prayed for?"
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.360]   (congregation laughing)
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.080]   Here's the answer, "No, we don't remember.
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.000]   "We're like vessels, the Spirit comes in
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.680]   "and out of us, we are not spiritual data cards
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.240]   "that are storing everybody's spiritual issues.
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.200]   "For decades, that doesn't happen."
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.640]   Okay, anyway.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.560]   So this guy is like testing me.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.880]   I'm, my attitude, like I am using all the remaining reserves
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.880]   of energy that I have to try to be calm
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.240]   and nice and polite to this guy.
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.240]   So I said, "Okay, yeah, sure, let's pray."
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.600]   So I put my hand on his shoulder, we start to pray.
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.120]   And I say to God, "God, you know I'm tired.
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.600]   "And you know my attitude really is not good right now.
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.280]   "But I come to you and if you have something
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.280]   "you wanna say to this guy, speak to me
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.680]   "and I'll pray over him."
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.520]   Well, as God often does with me,
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.760]   he gave me a visual, a visual something.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.880]   I often see things when I'm praying for people
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.160]   and I saw something.
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.480]   And I begin to pray this over this guy.
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.840]   About a minute into praying it,
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   I realized that what I'm praying is not very positive.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.320]   It's not very sort of happy.
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.880]   It's actually kind of a hard thing
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.840]   that I was praying for him about.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.040]   And I kept praying and I kind of lent in
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.800]   to what I sensed God was saying.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.640]   And as I prayed on, I could tell that the prayer
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:58.720]   was just a little bit heavy.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.520]   It was a little bit, it wasn't mean,
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.640]   but it was just like the things that I felt
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.480]   like God was saying to him
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.200]   were not necessarily easy things to hear.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.520]   And at the end of the prayer, I said, "Amen."
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.480]   And I opened my eyes and I was met with this face.
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.320]   (congregation laughing)
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.200]   And the guy says these words to me, he goes,
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.160]   "Uh, okay, thank you."
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.080]   And then he just walks off.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.920]   And I'm left there like,
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.800]   "That is the most awkward experience I have ever had."
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.520]   Well, six months later, I get an email.
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.520]   And the email is from this guy.
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.000]   And he's managed to track down my email.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   And in the opening line of the email,
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.120]   I wonder if you can imagine what it said.
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.600]   It said this, "Pastor, you prayed for me six months ago.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.120]   "I wonder if you remember what you prayed for me about."
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.720]   (congregation laughing)
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.640]   The irony is in this case,
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.000]   I did actually remember what I prayed for this guy about,
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.480]   'cause it wasn't very nice, right?
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.400]   And he starts to tell me in this email, he's like,
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.640]   "You know, you prayed for me and you said these things.
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.320]   "And I was actually really offended in the moment.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.040]   "And I didn't like what you said.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.480]   "And I walked away and out of the church that day.
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.640]   "And I was angry.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:06.720]   "I was angry at you.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.040]   "I was angry at God."
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.160]   And anyway, this was not a pleasant email
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.000]   up to this point, right?
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.120]   And I was like, "Okay, great."
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.280]   And then he said, "But God kept speaking to me
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.720]   "about those words that you said over the coming weeks.
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.440]   "And I kept having to bring myself back to prayer
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.640]   "with those words.
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.000]   "And I realized that those words
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.640]   "that God was saying to me on that day
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.760]   "were designed to uproot
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.520]   "some of the deepest stuff that was in my life."
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.160]   And he went on to tell me some of the deep sins
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.720]   and the brokenness, addictions,
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.160]   and some things that he had in his life.
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.400]   And as the email went on, he said,
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.760]   "You know, I was able, it took me about six months,
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.240]   "but I've been able to reach out to my wife."
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.360]   It turned out that him and his wife
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.280]   had been separated for some time.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.840]   And he reached out to his wife and he repented with her
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.680]   and apologized for some things.
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.240]   And he said, "We've gotten back together
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.080]   "and we're trying to make marriage work again.
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.920]   "And I just wanted to let you know
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.200]   "that although I treated you rudely in the moment,
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.200]   "that those things that you said disrupted stuff."
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.560]   He goes, he actually said this, he said,
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.560]   "I didn't wanna hear what you said,
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.320]   "but it disrupted some things in me
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.360]   "that needed to get disrupted."
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.400]   And he said, "I just want you to know
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.120]   "that I'm in a better place now."
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:23.040]   I wonder if you've ever experienced God
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.800]   saying something to you that is not easy for you to hear,
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:31.400]   that is not comfortable to hear.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.200]   I wonder if any of us have ever experienced
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.200]   when God speaks to us in a way that kind of,
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.320]   just comes in and disrupts some things in us.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.200]   It's not easy, is it?
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.160]   I think as Christians, we often think
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.960]   that when God speaks to his people,
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.760]   he's always gonna speak super positive things.
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.200]   That when God speaks to his people,
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.680]   it's always gonna be kind of a feel good thing.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.080]   It's always gonna make me feel good.
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.040]   It's always gonna be great.
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.880]   It's always gonna be wonderful.
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.880]   And I think us Christians get so conditioned
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.920]   into thinking that that's always how God speaks,
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.520]   that when God shows up and says something
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.640]   that's slightly different to what we expected,
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.080]   or says something that we weren't quite
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.560]   kind of wanting to hear or whatever it might be,
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.920]   we often, as Christians, I think, reject that.
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.720]   We think, "Oh, that's probably not God.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.640]   "That can't be God.
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.000]   "God wouldn't say something like that."
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.280]   And we kind of push away from it.
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.120]   And I think we have this problem as Christians sometimes,
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.840]   'cause we're always expecting God to show up a certain way,
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.320]   but when he shows up in a different way,
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.360]   we really struggle with that.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.960]   Am I the only person here who struggles with that?
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:38.560]   I am, I guess, the only person here who struggles with that.
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.640]   I'm assuming that more of you also do.
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.720]   Here's the reality that I think
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.440]   I've come to learn about God,
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:48.120]   that I think is actually a very important thing
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.520]   for us to grasp, and it's this,
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.120]   that sometimes when God speaks,
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.440]   the very thing you need to hear the most
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.760]   is often the very thing you want to hear the least.
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.560]   Come on, church.
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.000]   So often when God speaks to us,
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.120]   the very thing we need to hear the most
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.840]   is often the very thing we want to hear the least.
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:17.400]   That actually is a really good summary
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.240]   of the first Christmas that happened some 2,000 years ago.
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:25.520]   See, when Matthew and Luke present the birth story of Jesus,
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.440]   they present it in a raw and very real way.
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.840]   And yes, it's a story of incredible moments,
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:35.200]   a story of choirs of angels and God's birth,
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.720]   the incarnation and the glory and the peace
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.720]   that is exclaimed during that time.
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:43.120]   But if the story of Jesus' birth is anything,
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.520]   it's a story of a God who speaks
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.000]   and a God who longs to speak to his people.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.240]   But if you trace through the story,
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:56.160]   you'll see very quickly that so often the things
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.960]   that God speaks to the characters in the Christmas story
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.920]   is not the things that they were expecting to hear.
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.560]   It's not the things that they even perhaps wanted to hear.
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.600]   Take Zachariah, for example.
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:11.640]   God shows up in an angel through Gabriel and says to him,
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.320]   "Hey, because of your unfaithfulness,
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.760]   "you're now not gonna be able to talk
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.320]   "until your wife Elizabeth gives birth."
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:20.360]   Take Joseph, for example.
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.560]   Joseph, having discovered that his unmarried,
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:26.320]   pregnant fiancee is now pregnant with a child
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.120]   that came from the Holy Spirit,
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.680]   and he understands the shame that will come upon him
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.920]   and upon Mary, and so he's making plans in his mind
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.880]   to do the right thing for her and for him,
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.400]   and which is to separate their relationship.
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:39.440]   And God steps in and says,
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.280]   "No, you can't separate that relationship.
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.640]   "You're actually gonna have to walk into that shame,
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:46.120]   "walk into that pain, 'cause I've got a bigger thing
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.320]   "that's happening here."
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.000]   Or think about the shepherds.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.280]   The shepherds who were faithfully looking after their sheep,
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.920]   which was their livelihood.
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.320]   God shows up in the form of angels and says,
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:01.240]   "Leave your livelihood behind and go into Bethlehem.
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.120]   "Just drop everything that you've worked hard for,
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.760]   "because we've got a new thing
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.080]   "that we want to happen in your life."
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:13.120]   Isn't it so interesting for us that we have a plan A
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.480]   that we think is our plan A,
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:16.760]   but so often God comes and says,
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.000]   "There's actually a B, C, and a D
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.920]   "that is really the thing that's gonna set you alight,
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.560]   "really the thing that's gonna make you as a person,
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.640]   "really the thing that's gonna flourish you
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.760]   "and bring you into the fullness of who you are."
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.560]   I mean, just think about Mary.
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:36.920]   God shows up to Mary and says some pretty crazy things,
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:40.840]   things that she must've been so confused by,
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.280]   so overwhelmed by,
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.560]   not things that she was expecting God to say to her.
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.360]   In fact, I think if Mary had the choice,
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.240]   she would have chosen not to be in a part
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.800]   of the whole Christmas story in the first place.
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.440]   Imagine the shame that she had to hold.
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.880]   Imagine the months that she had to go through,
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.360]   where people thought all this stuff about her.
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.040]   If she had the choice, she probably would have said,
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.520]   "I didn't even wanna go anywhere near that story
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.280]   "or that thing whatsoever."
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:06.000]   And I think this is fascinating,
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.400]   that in the heart of the Christmas story,
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.440]   you see something that is so important
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:13.200]   for all of us to understand about how God works in our lives.
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.640]   And it's this, that your personal preferences
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:19.840]   and your personal choice is not always
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.000]   the most important things in God's mind
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.240]   when it comes to his leadership of your life.
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.680]   I know this is not the Christmas message
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:28.920]   you were hoping to hear.
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.600]   (congregation laughing)
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.600]   But I wanna encourage you to stay in with me
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.200]   because I think there's something important
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.320]   that you need to hear.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:40.440]   Our personal choices and our personal preferences
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:45.440]   are not always God's most forefront things in his mind.
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.080]   When he thinks about you and his leadership of his life,
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.520]   and he sees you, he sees your future,
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.840]   he sees where he's leading you in his life.
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.480]   And he says, "I know what's ahead.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.640]   "And I know all the good things.
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:56.640]   "I know the bad things.
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.680]   "I know the ugly things.
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.560]   "And you want plan A,
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.720]   "but I've got this other plan over here."
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.320]   Your personal preference is to go down this path.
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.480]   But if you go down that path,
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.040]   I tell you in five years time,
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.200]   you're gonna hit rock bottom.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.920]   But if you were to listen to me,
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.240]   if you were just to come with me,
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.320]   I've got a new path that I'm gonna take you down.
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.600]   And this is the way that will bring flourishing
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.160]   and growth and life to you.
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.160]   Your personal choices and preferences,
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.200]   they're important to God,
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.280]   but they're not the most important thing to him.
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:25.240]   He sees stuff that you will never see.
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.160]   And in faithfulness and trust,
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.720]   we are to turn to his word.
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.360]   Are you following this?
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:38.280]   But sometimes the word that God brings is challenging.
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.840]   It's hard to hear.
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:46.520]   And it comes and disrupts some things in us.
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:50.520]   Case in point is exactly what happens
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.560]   at the end of the Christmas story.
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.400]   The story that Luke is presenting to us
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.280]   of the birth of Jesus,
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:59.560]   he adds a very important story right at the end.
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.840]   It's almost like an epilogue to the story, if you will.
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.840]   It's the moment where Mary and Joseph,
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.280]   having had the child Jesus,
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.080]   Jesus is now eight days old.
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.520]   And from Bethlehem to Jerusalem,
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.960]   they make the journey from Bethlehem to Jerusalem,
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.560]   and they go into the temple when Jesus is eight days old.
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:16.520]   And they're carrying him in
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.080]   because the ritual at the time,
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.560]   the tradition at the time,
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.240]   was that faithful Jewish families
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.640]   would take their firstborn son
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:27.480]   and bring him into the temple to be dedicated to the Lord.
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.000]   And that dedication ceremony
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.560]   involved the act of circumcision.
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.880]   And so this was what Mary and Joseph were doing.
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.800]   They're faithful Jewish people going to the temple
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.240]   on the eighth day with Jesus,
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.600]   taking him into the temple
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.880]   in order for him to be dedicated
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.800]   and for the circumcision ceremony to take place.
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.480]   And when they're in the house of God,
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.840]   something awkward happens.
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.920]   A little bit like me standing in that prayer line
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.720]   and that man coming forward.
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.520]   For Mary and Joseph,
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:00.880]   something significantly awkward takes place.
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.160]   Let me actually break this down for you
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.200]   from Luke chapter two, starting in verse 25.
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.680]   Everybody still okay?
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:08.680]   Do you still like me?
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:10.600]   I'm really, if you're visiting,
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.600]   I'm really a nice person.
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:12.920]   Trust me, I am, I am.
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:15.280]   But hang with us.
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:18.520]   Verse 25 of chapter two of the Christmas story.
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:21.640]   Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.320]   who was righteous and devout.
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.480]   He was waiting for the consolation of Israel
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:28.360]   and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.040]   It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.760]   that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Christ.
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.320]   That's the Messiah.
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.480]   Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.440]   when the parents, that's Mary and Joseph,
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.600]   brought in the child Jesus to do for him
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.080]   what was custom of the Lord, that the law required,
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.240]   that's the circumcision.
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.600]   Simeon took the baby into his arms
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:51.080]   and praised God saying this,
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:53.160]   "Sovereign Lord, as you have promised,
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.360]   "now dismiss your servant in peace.
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.600]   "For my eyes have seen your salvation,
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.960]   "which you have prepared in the sight of all people,
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:03.040]   "a light for revelation to the Gentiles
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.680]   "and for glory to your people Israel."
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.120]   Up until this point in the story,
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:11.200]   everything is going perfectly right.
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.080]   This is wonderful.
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:15.360]   And Luke is creating and writing this story
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:17.680]   to help you to see how amazing this is.
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:20.720]   There's the temple in all of its glory and beauty
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.760]   in the presence of God.
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.480]   For the very first time, the Son of God
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.720]   is being brought into the temple itself.
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.280]   There's Mary and Joseph, the faithful family
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.760]   bringing their child for that dedication service
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:35.160]   and then we're introduced to the sort of creme de la creme,
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.480]   Simeon.
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:39.720]   And Simeon is described by Luke in the best ways
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:42.400]   that you could ever hope to be described in the Bible.
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.520]   Listen to this, righteous and devout,
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.800]   waiting for the consolation of Israel,
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.360]   the Holy Spirit upon him.
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.960]   Luke is saying, this man is righteous.
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.400]   He hasn't put a foot wrong.
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.960]   This man loves the Lord.
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.520]   He's devout in his devotion to God.
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:00.560]   He is waiting for the Messiah to come.
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:03.680]   He's so excited that one day God would step into the world
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:04.520]   with the Messiah.
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:07.800]   Not only that, but he's filled with the Holy Spirit.
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:11.280]   I mean, you can't paint somebody in a better light than that.
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.680]   Righteous, devout, waiting for God,
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:15.400]   filled with the Holy Spirit.
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.040]   And the Holy Spirit takes Simeon
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.600]   and he walks into the temple courts
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.280]   and he sees the baby Jesus
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:23.240]   and he sweeps up Jesus in his arms.
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.760]   And notice what he says.
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:28.240]   He says, "This is a light for revelation to the Gentiles
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.880]   "and glory to your people, Israel."
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:34.000]   You could not say a better thing about baby Jesus,
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.440]   that he's gonna be the light of revelation to the Gentiles.
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.560]   I love that the Christmas story brings us the picture
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:43.120]   of Jesus's mission to the world.
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.920]   That anyone who was not Jewish,
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:47.000]   that's the majority of us in this room,
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.840]   we can come to the saving knowledge of God
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.080]   through Jesus Christ.
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:54.640]   He's a light of revelation to all of us here in Hong Kong.
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:57.080]   But he's also the glory to Israel.
[00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:58.520]   He's also gonna do all the things
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:18:59.880]   that the scriptures had prophesied
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.640]   about what was gonna happen to Israel.
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:04.440]   He was gonna be their Messiah and their Christ.
[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:07.680]   And Simeon sweeps up baby Jesus in his arms
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.480]   and says all these incredible stuff.
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.160]   And you can imagine Joseph and Mary standing there
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.440]   and thinking, "This is the most amazing thing
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.520]   "I have ever heard.
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:19.640]   "This is the best thing I could ever hear about my child."
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.840]   I mean, think about this from your perspective.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.920]   Imagine if you had a baby
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.000]   and you come into the vine on a Sunday,
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.080]   it would be like one of the pastors from the vine
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:30.360]   sweeping up your child in their arms
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:34.120]   and going, "This one, this one is destined to go to Harvard
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.240]   "and graduate from the top of his class.
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:39.760]   "This one will be a millionaire by the age of 30,
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:43.680]   "for he will become a doctor or a lawyer or a banker.
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:46.520]   "This one will master the piano and the violin
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.160]   "and will speak 13 languages.
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:51.320]   "And even in your old age, you will be blessed
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.040]   "'cause this one will look after you."
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:57.880]   Every Hong Kong family would say, "Praise the Lord.
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.760]   "Are you with me?"
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:03.440]   That's what it was like for Mary and Joseph, okay?
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:06.640]   This was their Harvard monument, all right?
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.240]   The child will be a light of revelation to Gentiles.
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:12.120]   He's going to be the glory to Israel.
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.600]   It could not get better than this,
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.720]   which is why it says in the next verse,
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:19.280]   it says, "The child's father and mother marveled
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.400]   "at what was said about him."
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.400]   The word marveled there means they rejoiced.
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.120]   They were in wonder, they were in awe.
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.680]   This was the most amazing thing they have ever heard.
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.280]   And right now, Luke is basically saying,
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.960]   "It can't get better.
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:33.400]   "Isn't God great?
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:36.400]   "Isn't he saying nice things?"
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:41.880]   And then Simeon opens his mouth again.
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:48.440]   And then he puts Jesus to one side and he turns to Mary.
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:51.640]   And I want you to hear what he says to Mary.
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:55.400]   "Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother,
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.800]   "'This child is destined to cause the falling
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.200]   "'and the rising of many in Israel
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:02.960]   "'and to be a sign that will be spoken against,
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:06.000]   "'so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.880]   "'and a sword will pierce your own soul too.'"
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:14.320]   This was not in the Christmas script
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.560]   that was supposed to be the Christmas script.
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.520]   This wasn't quite as nice
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:22.080]   as what had just been spoken about Jesus.
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:26.360]   Simeon turns to Mary and he says some prophetic words
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:31.200]   over her that she did not want to hear,
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.520]   but she needed to hear.
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.880]   He says to her, first of all,
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:38.280]   that Jesus is gonna be an absolute nightmare for you.
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:42.400]   He said, "He's gonna cause the rising and the falling
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.800]   "of many in Israel and will be a sign
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.400]   "that will be spoken against."
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:49.360]   In other words, Jesus is gonna grow up
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:52.520]   and he's gonna be a controversial figure,
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.040]   he's saying to Mary.
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.080]   He's gonna cause the falling and the rising
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.000]   that the contents of people's hearts
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:58.840]   are gonna be revealed
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:02.440]   and no one likes the contents of their heart to be revealed.
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:06.480]   And some people will rise with Jesus.
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.880]   So some people will find their greatest life
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:09.880]   in relationship with him,
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:13.720]   but there are others who will reject him,
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:16.160]   who will not believe him,
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.560]   who will turn their backs on him,
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:20.760]   others who will actually speak against him.
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:26.480]   And this Jesus, he's gonna say some things.
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.720]   I mean, he's gonna come and he's gonna say some things
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.800]   that you, Mary, as his mother,
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:32.640]   you're gonna be like, "Oh my goodness, I can't believe
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.720]   "he just said that."
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:38.760]   This is not gonna be an easy future for you, Mary.
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.560]   And God so loves Mary in this moment.
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:42.800]   So, I want you to see this,
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:46.880]   so loves Mary, but sees her future
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.520]   and knows it's gonna be hard,
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:51.400]   knows that raising the son of God is not gonna be easy.
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.200]   And so out of his love for her,
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:56.720]   he wants to prepare her and mold her and shape her
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:58.960]   into the woman that she needs to become
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.600]   so that she can be the mother to the son of God.
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:05.360]   And so he brings a word that she may not want to have heard,
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:08.800]   but she needed to hear in order to become the woman
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.040]   God wanted her to become.
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:15.560]   I mean, Jesus, can you imagine what Jesus is about to do?
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:19.080]   He's about to say things like,
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:21.640]   "Unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood,
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:24.040]   "you have no part of my kingdom."
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:27.200]   That one got most of his followers to leave him.
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.960]   He would say to the religious authorities of the day,
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:33.480]   "You brood of vipers, you whitewashed tombs."
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.320]   He would say to his disciples, the followers,
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:37.880]   he would say, "Unless you pick up your cross,
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:40.840]   "unless you die, basically, you can't follow me."
[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:43.240]   He would actually say to his best friend,
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:46.560]   he would call his best friend Satan.
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:49.920]   This is not how to win friends and influence people.
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:54.760]   And then Simeon says this.
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:59.240]   He says, "A sword will pierce your own soul too."
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:02.720]   He's not speaking, of course, of a literal sword.
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:05.040]   He's not speaking of her death in the future.
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:08.000]   He's speaking about her emotions.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.320]   He's speaking about how hard it's going to be for her.
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:13.800]   And that if she's not prepared for the reality
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.800]   of the chance and the choices and the things,
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:19.080]   there's one point Jesus is going to,
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.240]   in front of his mother, say,
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.720]   "My mother and father is not biological.
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.040]   "My mother and father is anyone
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:26.560]   "who follows after my father."
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:31.280]   Mary is gonna have a hard path,
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:36.280]   and God doesn't hold back from helping her to see
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:39.120]   that there's some tough times ahead.
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:42.480]   There's a sword that's gonna feel like it pierces your soul.
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.560]   It's gonna be difficult.
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:45.080]   And God is saying this because he's like,
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:48.840]   "I love you so much that I'm gonna say the very things
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:49.880]   "to you that you need to hear,
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:52.840]   "even as you're holding an eight-day-old child
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:55.040]   "in your hands, the future ahead for him.
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:56.520]   "He is gonna be the savior of the world.
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:58.800]   "He is the light of revelation to the Gentiles.
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.360]   "He is the glory to Israel.
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:02.680]   "You are gonna have the joy of holding him,
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.640]   "but you're also gonna feel the pain
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.720]   "that no parent wants to feel,
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.880]   "and that is you're gonna watch your child die."
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:17.480]   And God has so much love for Mary
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:22.600]   that he's willing to speak a hard word.
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:27.600]   God has so much love for you,
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:32.000]   and God sees everything that is ahead of you.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:38.080]   God loves you so much that he's also willing, at times,
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.400]   to come and speak over you
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:44.960]   and to help, perhaps, you to see that there are some things
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.560]   that might need to change in your life,
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.840]   or perhaps tell you that there are some things coming up
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:52.320]   that you need to get ready for and prepare for,
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.360]   'cause if you're not, it's gonna be overwhelming,
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:58.280]   and it will feel like a sword has pierced your soul, too.
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:01.440]   I think sometimes, as Christians,
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.160]   we think that when we come to Christ Jesus,
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:06.560]   then everything's gonna be absolutely perfect.
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:10.440]   The Christmas story shows us a different thing.
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:13.280]   And of course, Jesus is our life.
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:15.320]   And the wonderful thing that we celebrate at Christmastime
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:17.600]   is the arrival of our Savior and our Messiah,
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:19.000]   that when we're in relationship with him,
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.560]   our sin is taken care of, forgiven.
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:23.960]   We're released and filled with the fullness of God,
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:26.440]   that the same Spirit that raised Jesus is found in us,
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:29.400]   and that we are found into flourishing, fullness of life,
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:31.680]   that we can know the fullness of peace, shalom,
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:33.440]   and that we'll have eternal life with him.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:36.960]   There is so much good news in the gospel, so much there,
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.960]   and God so wants all of that for you
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:44.880]   that he's sometimes willing to speak something
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:48.000]   that is not gonna be easy for you to hear
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.960]   to ensure that you remain on the path
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:51.400]   that he has for you to be on.
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:57.800]   See, Jesus is not afraid to speak a disruptive word
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:00.640]   to your perfect world if your perfect world
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.800]   is perfectly misaligned to his perfect will.
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:06.480]   He's not afraid to do that.
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.720]   And it seems weird, doesn't it, on Christmas Eve
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:13.960]   that this would be a part of the Christmas story,
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.880]   but I think it's a part of the Christmas story
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:20.560]   because God is revealing his heart to his people.
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:23.360]   I'm so passionately in love with you,
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:26.400]   and I so passionately want the best for you,
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:30.760]   that if there is anything in your life that is misaligned,
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:35.400]   I have the grace and the courage
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.200]   to lead you on a different path.
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:42.440]   I don't know about you, but I've had the disruptive word
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:45.720]   of God into my life many times over my life.
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:48.760]   I remember when I first quit my job,
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:49.800]   I was in banking here.
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.560]   I was one of those kids that was the banker.
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.960]   I wasn't a millionaire by 30, but I was a banker.
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:28:00.440]   And I felt God calling me out of that marketplace world
[00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:03.800]   into being a pastor, and so I remember quitting my job
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:05.880]   and moving with my family to New Zealand
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.680]   to go to Bible school, and I remember the first month
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:10.560]   in Bible school, I felt so excited.
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:12.600]   I felt so excited about what my future was.
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:14.640]   I could not wait to become a pastor.
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.480]   Could not wait to become a preacher.
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:18.040]   I knew that God had called me to preach,
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:20.160]   and I was really excited to have a life
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.560]   where I could communicate God's word to people
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:24.400]   and speak life over people.
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:26.440]   I mean, it was everything I wanted to do,
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.440]   and I remember in the first month of Bible school,
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:31.080]   I was setting myself ready for all the studies.
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.120]   I wanted to learn Greek.
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.040]   I wanted to learn Hebrew.
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:35.040]   I wanted to understand the Bible as best I could
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.480]   because I wanted to be the best preacher
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:37.840]   of God's word that I could,
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.920]   and in the first month, I said to God,
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:41.960]   I said, "God, would you speak to me a word
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.520]   "about my preaching gift?"
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:48.400]   And I was expecting that God would say,
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.680]   "You're awesome, Andrew.
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.280]   "You're the best ever.
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:53.120]   "You're the best.
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.640]   "I can't wait to see your future.
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:55.560]   "You're gonna be the city pastor
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:56.880]   "of a church called The Vine in Hong Kong,
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:57.840]   "and it's gonna be amazing,
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:59.480]   "and there's gonna be so many people on Christmas Eve
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:00.320]   "that not only are you gonna be able to fit
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.440]   "into the building, and it's gonna be great."
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.560]   (congregation laughing)
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:09.560]   I was expecting a word along those kind of lines.
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:12.000]   But God said to me,
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.040]   "You really want me to speak to you
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:14.640]   "about your preaching gift?"
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.320]   I was like, "Yeah."
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:19.360]   He's like, "Go to Amos chapter eight."
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:22.680]   So I went to Amos chapter eight, and here's what I read.
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:24.880]   "The days are coming, declares the sovereign Lord,
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.000]   "when I will send a famine through the land,
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.520]   "not a famine of food or of thirst for water,
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:33.080]   "but a famine of hearing the words of the Lord.
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.000]   "People will stagger from sea to sea
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.520]   "and wander from north to east,
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:38.560]   "searching for the word of the Lord,
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.680]   "but they will not find it."
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:44.880]   I had asked God to speak to me about my preaching gift,
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:47.440]   and he brings me to this passage where he's like,
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:50.480]   "Andrew, you need to understand that in your life,
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:55.160]   "if you don't make some changes, a famine is coming on you,
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.480]   "and that famine will be on hearing the word of God.
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:00.200]   "And you need to understand that what makes a preacher
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.080]   "is not how they speak the words of God,
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.880]   "but how they hear the words of God.
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:08.480]   "I am nothing if I can't hear the words of God.
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.400]   "I am the worst pastor ever.
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:12.880]   "I have nothing to say on this stage,
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:17.320]   "week in and week out, if I can't hear the words of God.
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:19.120]   "If I can't receive and hear something
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:21.520]   "and do my best to package it and bring it to you,
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:26.360]   "if I can't do that, then this is absolutely useless."
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:29.120]   And I sat there under this idea that God's saying,
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:31.560]   "You really want me to speak about your preaching gift?
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:33.200]   "Here's what you need to hear.
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.240]   "It's not what you want to hear, Andrew,
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:36.360]   "but here's what you need to hear.
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.640]   "A famine is coming on your life
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:41.080]   "where you will be completely useless,
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:42.880]   "no matter how much Bible knowledge you have,
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.640]   "no matter how much Greek and Hebrew you might know,
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:47.240]   "completely useless unless you change
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.520]   "some things in your life.
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.840]   "There's some stuff in your heart, Andrew,
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:52.440]   "that you need to deal with.
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:54.600]   "And if those things don't get dealt with,
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:57.880]   "I will block your ears and you won't hear my word."
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:02.960]   And this led me on a difficult six-month journey
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:06.360]   of dealing with some really important things
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:09.320]   in my soul and my heart that needed to be dealt with,
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:10.400]   things like pride,
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:15.320]   things like arrogance in my cool in life,
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:16.360]   things like thinking I'm better
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:19.160]   because I'm in Bible school than in the marketplace,
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:21.960]   things that were ugly in me,
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:24.360]   other things that I don't want to tell you about.
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.680]   And I went through a six-month journey
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:29.080]   of having to bring those things to the Lord
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:30.960]   and have Him deal with me in
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:34.320]   so that I could even think about being
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:35.680]   in the place that I'm in right now
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:38.920]   and doing what I'm doing with you right now.
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:42.040]   And every single time that I prepare a sermon
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:46.400]   here at The Vine, God breathes over me and says,
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:48.880]   "Don't forget Amos 8."
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:55.320]   This has been a disruptive word for me
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:59.600]   that has messed me up inside for years and years and years.
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:02.960]   And by God's grace has enabled me
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:05.120]   to hopefully stand in front of you
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:08.120]   and say some things at times that are helpful to you.
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:15.440]   Mary, Mary had this future ahead of her that God could see.
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:20.280]   And so he came in the gentleness of this amazing man, Simeon,
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:23.120]   and said some things to her that were not easy to hear,
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:26.280]   some things that messed some things up inside of her.
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:29.560]   God could see what my future was
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:32.800]   as a young 30-year-old wondering what was going on in life.
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:36.120]   He could see what was gonna happen for me.
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:38.200]   And he said, "You will be a disaster
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.400]   "for those people in Hong Kong
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:42.200]   "unless you first deal with this."
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:47.200]   He so loved me and you that he was willing to disrupt
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:50.680]   and make a mess of some things in my life.
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:51.960]   And what you need to understand
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:54.600]   is that God doesn't just come into mess,
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:56.560]   sometimes he creates mess.
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:33:00.840]   And he creates a mess sometimes by bringing a word
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:04.680]   that is designed to disrupt some faulty old ways
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:07.280]   of thinking in you so that you would be brought
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:11.080]   into new and transformative ways of being.
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:15.400]   That's actually the Christmas story,
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:21.000]   that Jesus was willing to disrupt this world,
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.280]   willing in the incarnation to come and stir some things up
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:28.000]   so that the world would get a vision of a life
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.920]   that is so much greater and so much better
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:33.440]   than the one that was currently being experienced.
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:37.160]   The point of Christmas, the point that Jesus has come
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:38.320]   is so that the world would know
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:40.800]   that there is an alternative way and is the Savior,
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:43.440]   one that can set us free, one that forgives sins,
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:44.760]   one that changes us.
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:49.480]   And we need Jesus to come in to our perfect little worlds
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:51.520]   and mess some things up sometimes
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:55.080]   so that we would come to a place
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:59.760]   where we would truly worship him.
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:05.880]   My heart for you is that you would think about it this way,
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:08.880]   and this is perhaps the more positive way to think about it.
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:12.520]   If you really want to grow as a person in 2024,
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:15.680]   the greatest Christmas gift you can give yourself
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:18.200]   is an open and receptive heart
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:20.800]   to the correction and discipline of God in your life.
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:25.880]   And I know that's not the Christmas Eve message
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:27.080]   you were hoping to hear,
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:30.720]   but I do believe it's the Christmas Eve message
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:32.080]   that God wants you to hear.
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:37.320]   If you took that seriously in 2024,
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:40.680]   you will have your greatest maturing growth
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:43.280]   that you have ever experienced.
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.680]   And it's not that God is gonna say those kinds of things
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:46.680]   all the time to us.
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:50.440]   Of course, God so often and normally and usually speaks
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:51.640]   words of life and hope.
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:55.560]   But let's not close our hearts off
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.360]   to the truly transformative moments
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:00.760]   where he puts his little finger on something
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:04.840]   and says, "Let's go on a journey here for a little while.
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:08.280]   "And let's actually allow this thing to get healed
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:11.040]   "and renewed and redeemed for you."
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:14.320]   My prayer for us as a church as we head into the new year
[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.560]   is that we would have a heart like Samuel
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:19.760]   in the Old Testament who walked into the presence of God
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:24.760]   and said this, "Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening."
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:29.160]   Tomorrow, we're going to give you a really positive,
[00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:30.760]   happy message on Christmas Day.
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:36.480]   Today, my prayer is that you listened.
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:38.960]   Should we pray?
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:40.320]   Let's pray.
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:44.040]   Father, I am so grateful for all these amazing people
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:46.960]   in this room and the overflow around the building right now.
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:49.560]   Father, I'm thankful that they are so hungry
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:51.720]   to come to worship you on Christmas Eve,
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:55.880]   that they're willing to stand and sit in the aisles,
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:57.760]   sit on the stairs.
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.640]   Lord, we honor everybody in this room.
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:01.000]   We're so grateful for the community
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.760]   that you've built here at the Vine.
[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:06.080]   And Father, we thank you for Christmas
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:07.920]   and the real Christmas story,
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.400]   the original one 2,000 years ago.
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:13.480]   We thank you that Luke included a story like this,
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:14.920]   a story that perhaps is different
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:18.200]   from some of the other things we see in the Christmas story,
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:22.240]   a story where Mary sits under
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:24.360]   a challenging prophetic word from God.
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:29.440]   And Father, you speak so often words of life,
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:31.200]   the hope and truth.
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.360]   And sometimes you speak those words in ways
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:38.120]   that is designed to mess up our perfect worlds,
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:42.520]   particularly when we're misaligned to your will.
[00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:45.200]   (coughing)
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.360]   Father, I pray.
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:50.200]   I pray by your Holy Spirit
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:55.800]   that people here would know the love of God
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:59.200]   seen in the beauty and the wonder of a child
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:00.600]   born in Bethlehem,
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:06.000]   that people in this room would know the call that's upon them
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.720]   that through relationship with Jesus,
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.400]   they can experience the greatest flourishing
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:11.960]   that they will ever experience.
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:15.080]   And that everybody in this room would also know
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:20.640]   the openness of their hearts to whatever it is
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.120]   that God wants to say to them.
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:27.320]   Father, you know our best far better than we do.
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:33.360]   Father, we lay down our perceived perceptions and hopes
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:37.840]   and positive things that we want.
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:40.680]   Father, we ultimately want you.
[00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:43.160]   We want your leadership.
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:44.520]   We want your love.
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:47.880]   We wanna become the people that you need us to be
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:50.240]   so that the gospel could be heard in Hong Kong
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:51.800]   like it's never been heard before.
[00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:53.240]   I pray this Christmas Eve, Lord,
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:55.440]   would be a turning point for some of us here.
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:58.160]   And as we go into the new year,
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:00.720]   we would go in with open and receptive hearts.
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:02.880]   And that maybe there's some words
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.280]   that you've been saying to us this year
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:07.440]   that we've gently put to one side.
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:10.120]   Perhaps we've been like, I don't wanna deal with that.
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:13.200]   And maybe as we've unpacked this story today,
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:15.400]   the Holy Spirit has reminded you right now
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.920]   of some of those words that God has said to you in the past
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.920]   that you've either ignored or put to one side.
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:24.240]   And perhaps your Christmas gift this year
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:26.200]   is God just gently saying,
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:28.160]   I wanna bring you back to that word.
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:29.880]   I wanna bring you back to that thing.
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:31.240]   Let's talk about it.
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:34.920]   I wanna heal you and restore you and redeem you.
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:37.600]   The years of the locust have eaten from you,
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:39.640]   as Joel chapter two would say.
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:42.360]   I wanna restore to you, the Lord says.
[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:45.280]   Let me speak.
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:48.160]   Father, I pray that you would speak,
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:50.880]   that Lord, your church would hear,
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:53.720]   and that Lord, together we would glorify you,
[00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:56.560]   just like those shepherds who left behind the sheep
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:59.760]   and saw the child Jesus in the manger
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:04.040]   and went back glorifying and sharing the news of you.
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:06.800]   Lord, I pray that that would be your church
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:07.840]   at Christmas time.
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:12.080]   And Father, we thank you for this, in Jesus' name.
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:13.960]   Everyone says.
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:16.080]   - Amen. - Amen, amen.
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:16.920]   God bless.
