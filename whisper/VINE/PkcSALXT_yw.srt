1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
 Everyone says amen. Amen. Amen. Can we thank our worship team? So, so beautiful.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,640
 Thanks guys so much. Have a seat. Have a seat. It's so good to have you here. My

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,880
 name is Andrew. I'm one of the pastors here at the Vine. If you're relatively

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:20,720
 new to us, new to the church, we're really glad that you're with us and you

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,520
 know everything we've just been sharing about and singing about is for you. This

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,720
 is a place of acceptance, a place of love, a place where you can come and just be

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,240
 who you are. Be who you are in this season of life that you're in and my

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,800
 prayer today is that you would know and encounter God who accepts and loves you

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,520
 and fills you. You know, I'm really grateful that I have an amazing woman in

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,800
 my life, my wife, who loves me dearly. My wife and I started dating, by the way,

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,600
 back in 1996. I know, for like most of the people in this part of the room right

12
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:59,080
 now, that was before you were born, okay? 1996. I know, that ages me tremendously.

13
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,320
 But my wife and I, we met at Mother's Choice, an organization here in Hong Kong,

14
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,400
 and we started to date and as we started to date, my wife began to complain about

15
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,680
 a pain that she had in her side and she said the pain would come and go, but there

16
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,320
 was this kind of like niggly sort of pain in her almost all the time. I tried

17
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:22,520
 my best not to assume that that pain was because I was now in her life and we

18
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,760
 were dating together, but she complained about this pain and so one night we

19
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:33,400
 were praying together and as we were praying, I saw a picture, a vision.

20
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:39,320
 It was almost like this prophetic kind of vision and I saw a dagger stuck in my

21
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:45,320
 girlfriend's, at the time, my girlfriend's side and the blade was deeply inside of

22
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:50,240
 her, but the handle of the dagger was on the outside and I could see that every

23
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,680
 once in a while, because it was always there, the enemy would like to come along

24
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,040
 and just grab a hold of it and twist it a little bit and cause that pain into

25
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,200
 her. So as I'm seeing this in prayer, I share it with her, "Hey honey, I see that

26
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,640
 there's this dagger inside of you, the handle's on the outside, I can see it's

27
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,560
 there, that the enemy's manipulating it, it's causing you great pain." And she kind

28
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,480
 of looks up at me and she goes, "Well pull it out then." I'm like, "What do you mean?"

29
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,320
 She's like, "Well pull it out! If you see it, you should just pull it out, I don't

30
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,520
 want it in me." And I'm like, "This is weird, okay." But I'm trying to like date her,

31
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,880
 right? So I'm like, "Okay, sure honey, I can be the man, I will pull out the dagger

32
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:35,760
 from your side, this is very weird." So I leant forward and I put my hand on the

33
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,600
 kind of, the dagger as I could kind of see where it was, I put my hand on there

34
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:48,160
 and I pulled it out and she never felt a pain in her side ever again. A couple of

35
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,040
 years later, a couple of years later, I'm on a missions trip in the Philippines.

36
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,160
 I'm a youth leader here at the Vine and we're leading a group of youth to the

37
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,480
 Philippines and we're working in the slums in Manila. And there's a man and

38
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,520
 his wife that we're ministering to, the man had cataracts on his eyes. We'd been

39
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,700
 told by the people that we were serving with that he'd been blind for over 20

40
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,960
 years, full cataracts, couldn't see out of his eyes at all. And as we're talking

41
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,920
 with him and just sharing the gospel with him, one of the 14-year-old youth on

42
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,440
 this trip kind of tugs my shirt and I look down and she's like, "I believe Jesus

43
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,000
 wants to heal him right now." Now I don't know about you, but when you're the youth

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 pastor and you're leading all these youth to a moment like this and somebody

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,200
 goes, "I think Jesus is gonna heal him and do this miracle." You're kind of like, "Hmm,

46
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,960
 really? I hope he does, but I got to prepare myself for when that doesn't

47
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,040
 happen and then I have all these disappointed youth and Jesus, right?" So I

48
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,520
 unfortunately was not feeling much faith in that moment, so my response there was

49
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:54,400
 like, "Oh, cool. Okay, well then you pray for him." I'm a terrible Christian, by the

50
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,920
 way. So I'm like, "Why don't you pray for him?" So she comes forward and she

51
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,920
 stretches out her hands and she puts her hands on his eyes and she prays like the

52
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,680
 simplest prayer you could ever imagine. Now I'm watching this with my eyes open

53
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,040
 and I see something that I had never seen before. The best way to describe it

54
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,200
 to you is like windshield wipers, just you know like if you have a really dirty

55
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,880
 windscreen in your car and the windshield wipers kind of wipe it away.

56
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,680
 Immediately as she starts to pray, his cataracts are wiped away from his eyes.

57
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,920
 He starts screaming his head off because for 20 years he's not had light coming

58
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:31,800
 into his eyes. He starts screaming, his wife starts crying, all the youth start

59
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,640
 screaming, I start screaming because everybody's screaming. We're all just

60
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:41,000
 there in this amazing moment because God in the power of prayer has set this man

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,200
 free. And suddenly he could see. A few years later I'm here at the Vine on a

62
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:51,000
 Sunday. It's at our four o'clock service and we're all worshiping away and the

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,080
 power of the Spirit is in the room and suddenly this guy starts shouting and

64
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,920
 screaming and thrashing around. He falls on the floor, he's thrashing around. It's

65
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:04,840
 super awkward. Everybody's like what is going on? Myself and a few of the elders,

66
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,040
 we went over to see him and we sort of knelt down and we realized that he's

67
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,600
 having this demonic kind of manifestation. This demon is screaming

68
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,840
 and he's swearing and it's all pretty gross and ugly and horrible. And one of

69
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,240
 the elders just reaches out his hand and just gently in prayer says, "In the name

70
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,880
 of Jesus be still." And this man immediately went still. In fact it was

71
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:33,680
 like what the Bible describes. He was suddenly dressed in his right mind. A few

72
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,920
 years later I'm traveling on a bus here in Hong Kong. Just traveling on a bus,

73
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,040
 minding my own business. Got some music going on in my ears, trying to be

74
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,640
 anonymous. Some guy starts freaking out on the bus, starts screaming

75
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,440
 and shouting and immediately I know it's the same kind of thing. He's probably

76
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,360
 going through some demonic manifestation right now and I'm thinking I don't want

77
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,240
 to be a Christian in this moment. So I'm like staring out of the window of

78
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,320
 the bus, kind of trying to pretend like I'm not a pastor, I'm not a Christian.

79
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,440
 This is my day off, okay? I'm on a day off from being a Christian right now, okay?

80
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,440
 And as I'm staring out the window this guy's freaking out. Everybody's kind of

81
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,280
 freaking out on the bus and the Holy Spirit says to me, "Pray for him right now."

82
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:19,280
 And so out loud in front of everybody I just say, "In the name of Jesus be still."

83
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,320
 And immediately he falls asleep. Immediately he falls asleep right there

84
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:29,480
 and then everybody starts staring at me like, "What is this guy?" Immediately he

85
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:37,640
 falls asleep. A few years later I'm sitting with this mother as she holds

86
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:44,480
 her dead son in her arms and you can imagine the pain and the trauma of that

87
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:51,400
 moment. And I'm sitting there like I have nothing to say to this. I have no words

88
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:56,040
 of comfort. I don't even know how to approach this pastoral moment. I'm

89
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:02,520
 sitting with her on the bed as she's holding her dead son in her arms and I'm

90
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:08,600
 like I have nothing to say. And she, in the middle of her morning and trauma, she

91
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:14,920
 makes a prayer. And in her prayer she asks God to come and I have never seen

92
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:19,040
 anything like this. She's like crying and weeping as you could imagine that she

93
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,800
 should in her morning. But as she prays a peace that comes upon her, as Scripture

94
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,600
 says, a peace that surpasses understanding comes over her. And

95
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:32,120
 although she's still in a place of deep pain and deep mourning, I can see in her

96
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:38,040
 eyes that she's filled with the peace of Christ. And why am I sharing all these

97
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:44,520
 incredible stories with you? I think it's because right now in the time that we're

98
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,280
 in, in the season that we're in, in the world right now, I don't know if you saw

99
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,720
 this week but there was newspaper reports that were talking about the

100
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:57,240
 possibility of World War III. I think in the time where there's a rising sense of

101
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,000
 panic and fear across the world for what is happening in our world, now more than

102
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,480
 ever, I think the global church needs to rise up and regain a passion for power

103
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:15,040
 that is only felt and seen through prayer. See, I think there's a work of

104
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,560
 God's Spirit that he wants to do through the power of prayer like he has never

105
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:24,880
 done before. You see, in a time where the world is doubling down on the grasping

106
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:31,360
 of power through violent wars, through the kind of overestimation of the

107
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,440
 false freedom of individualism, through the inequitable distribution of

108
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,720
 resources around the world, all these ways that we see a narrative in the

109
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:43,680
 world to grasp a hold of power, now more than ever, the church needs to remember

110
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:50,520
 the subversive and revolutionary power that there is in the humble posture of

111
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:56,480
 bending a knee. You see, I think the narrative in the world right now about

112
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,240
 power is those who are powerful are the ones who have the greatest army, the most

113
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:06,000
 amount of resources, and the ones who have the loudest voice. And we need to

114
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,720
 remember that that is not how Scripture defines power. We need to understand that

115
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,280
 that is not the way in which the kingdom of God operates in power. And that

116
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,800
 actually, I'm a hundred percent convinced that the only true power in this world

117
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:26,320
 is found in God by the Spirit through Jesus Christ. And if that is true, if that

118
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,800
 is true, then a church's ability to impact and change the city that it's

119
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:37,400
 planted in is not found in how large we are, how influential we are, it's not

120
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,400
 found in how relevant we might be, it's not found even in how great the worship

121
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,840
 might be or how clear the teaching might be. The only thing that can move the

122
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:51,160
 needle in this city is the unbridled power of the Spirit of God that is

123
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:58,040
 released in prayer. Show me a church that is passionate for prayer and I will show

124
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,640
 you a church that is humble enough to understand that only God can change the

125
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:09,840
 world, not us. See, here's the thing that I think we really need to understand. When

126
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:16,040
 a church lacks a culture of dependency on prayer, it is usually because that

127
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:21,320
 church has become satisfied being dependent on itself. I'm gonna say that

128
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,520
 again, that's super important. I think when a church lacks a culture of

129
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:30,200
 dependency on prayer, it is because, quite likely, that that church has become

130
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,120
 satisfied being dependent on itself, being dependent on its own resources. And

131
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,800
 if I was to say this, I want to put it this way, I think the number one danger

132
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,160
 that faces the vine in the season that we're in, in the world that we're in

133
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,000
 right now, is that we would, because of this incredible building we have, because

134
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 of the money that's in our bank account, because of the crazy talents that we see

135
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,840
 on our staff team and our volunteers, because the services we have and the

136
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,720
 ministries that we have, that all of those things which are a gift of the

137
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:02,760
 working of the Spirit of God, that all of those things would so amplify in us a

138
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:09,600
 sense of self-reliance that it would dampen our desperation for prayer. Is

139
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,480
 anybody here? Are you okay? That we would so see all this great stuff that God has

140
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,960
 given us, but that would seduce us into a place of self-reliance that we would

141
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:25,040
 actually dampen the enthusiasm and the desperation that we have for prayer,

142
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,040
 because the kind of power that the world needs to see today is not more warring

143
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,400
 armies, it's not more resources in the bank account, surely it is this unbridled

144
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,080
 passion and power of the Spirit of God, and that my friends is released always

145
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:47,280
 in prayer. What might it look like that the church would truly believe that

146
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:53,400
 power is not found in the hands of the outwardly powerful, but in the scarred

147
00:11:53,400 --> 00:12:02,320
 hands of the inwardly crucified? Now when Paul writes to the church in Ephesus, all

148
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,000
 of that is on his heart for those people in that church. He sees what they've been

149
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,400
 saved out of. He understands that Ephesus was a place of great power. In fact,

150
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,480
 Ephesus in those days was one of the most powerful cities that there was in

151
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,000
 the Greek or Roman Empire. It was a port city, very much like Hong Kong, and because

152
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,200
 it was a port city, it was a center of trade and commerce. People, particularly

153
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,800
 entrepreneurial people, were moving in the Greek or Roman Empire to Ephesus to

154
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,560
 make a life for themselves, to make a name for themselves, to gain that wealth

155
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,680
 and that status, and to have generational wealth for the generations of their

156
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,760
 family to come. This was what Ephesus was known for. And Paul has shared the

157
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,040
 gospel in that city, and he's helped people to understand that power in the

158
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,920
 kingdom is actually seen in a different way, that it's not about what resources

159
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,120
 you have, what's in your bank account, all these other ways that power is seen in

160
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,520
 the world, that it's seen through the life, death, and the resurrection of Jesus.

161
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:01,360
 But Paul knows that his church is susceptible to falling back under the

162
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,720
 seduction of the power of its city. He knows that the church is caught at times

163
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,080
 with its feet in two camps, in the camp of being seduced by that power seen in

164
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:16,120
 the world, and the camp of this newfound relationship that they have in Jesus, and

165
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,600
 they're struggling between the two. And so he writes this letter to help the

166
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,640
 church understand where true power really sits. And Paul understands that

167
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:29,440
 that's in prayer. And so interestingly, in the book of Ephesians, more than any of

168
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,840
 his letters in the New Testament, he has a number of prayers in the book. One in

169
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,120
 the first chapter, one in the third chapter, we're looking at the one in the

170
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:43,640
 first chapter here today. Now, why is prayer and power so important for Paul

171
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:49,440
 in Ephesus? It's because not only was there this great commerce and this great

172
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,480
 economic power that was seen in the city of Ephesus, there was also a powerful

173
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:00,320
 spiritual entity that was at work. See, Ephesus was famous for the worship of

174
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:06,680
 Artemis, the goddess Artemis, in Greek, the goddess Diana. And Diana and Artemis, the

175
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,680
 same person, same God, this goddess was worshipped in Ephesus. It had one of the

176
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,760
 largest, most glorious temples to Artemis that you can see. In fact, you can go to

177
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:19,720
 Ephesus today and still see the ruins of this temple. It truly is an incredible

178
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,400
 thing to see. But in those days, that temple was massive. And that temple was

179
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:29,720
 filled with people worshipping this Artemis for a number of very significant

180
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,060
 reasons. Artemis was believed to be the goddess of the underworld. So she was the

181
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:39,560
 goddess, actually, of evil forces and dark forces and curses. She was also seen as

182
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,320
 the goddess of fertility, which is why when you see statues of her, if you jump

183
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,840
 back to that statue just a moment ago, you'll see that she's covered in all of

184
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,000
 these things. These are actually breasts that she's covered in. She was the goddess

185
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,640
 of fertility, so she's covered in these breasts. That was how she was actually

186
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:59,400
 depicted to the people. And if you wanted fertility in that day, here's how you

187
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,120
 would do it. You would go to the temple and you would hire a temple prostitute.

188
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,000
 And you would have sex with the temple prostitute, and that was your way of

189
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,400
 worshipping Artemis in order for her to have favor to bless you with fertility.

190
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:18,800
 The other thing that Artemis was known for was the giver, the cosmic savior and

191
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:24,520
 giver of wisdom. If you wanted wisdom to solve a problem in your life, if you

192
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,920
 wanted to get some revelation to help sort out something in your life, you

193
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,120
 would go to the temple and you would pray to Artemis. The other thing that

194
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,120
 you would do, or the other thing that took place in Artemis worship, was

195
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,560
 also this idea of the opening of the mind. And actually, ancient sources have

196
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,240
 shown that there was the use of drugs in the temple to help people to have

197
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,760
 ecstatic experiences, so their minds were open to see things in different ways.

198
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:57,920
 This was all happening in the temple in Ephesus. And then, if you wanted Artemis

199
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,800
 or one of the gods that were under her control to do something for you, here's

200
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,920
 what you would also do. You would go to the priest of the priestess in the

201
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,640
 temple and you would say, "Hey, I want this person..." So, give me an example out of my

202
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:15,040
 own life. I have this amazing girl that I meet. She's blonde, from New Zealand. She

203
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,800
 became my wife, okay? So, hang with me. But she's blonde, she's from New Zealand. I

204
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,800
 fall in love with her, but she hasn't fallen in love with me yet. This is a true

205
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,520
 story, by the way. She hadn't fallen in love with me. So, if I was in the first

206
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:29,240
 century Ephesus, here's what I would do. I would go to the temple of Artemis and

207
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,960
 I would say to the priest and the priestess, "Can you give me a prayer to

208
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,600
 pray to a specific God that would enable this woman to fall in love with me?" And

209
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,680
 the priest and priestess would say, "Well, tell us a little bit more about this

210
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,240
 person." And I would describe, "Well, she's from New Zealand. She's blonde. She's

211
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,480
 beautiful. Her last name's Ho. I think she's awesome." And I would go through all

212
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,480
 the things about her that I liked about her. And then, the priestess would go, "I've

213
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,800
 got just the prayer for you." And they would go to a chest and they would pull

214
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,240
 out a scroll, a magic scroll. And they would basically say, "This magic scroll

215
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,960
 contains the name of the exact God that you need to pray to in order for that

216
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,480
 woman to fall in love with you." And they kind of give you the scroll and you're

217
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,360
 like, "Give me the scroll." And then they take the scroll away and they say, "You

218
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:16,480
 have to buy the scroll. The scroll is gonna cost X, Y, Z amount of money." And

219
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,920
 you're like, "Of course I will pay that because I need to know the name of the

220
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:24,000
 specific God that can help me to have this woman fall in love with me. You following

221
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,200
 this?" So, you buy it and you take the scroll. You open it up at home. It has the

222
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:32,480
 name of that God. You pray to that God, believing that this woman is then gonna

223
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,480
 fall in love. This was the way that worship was done in the temple at this

224
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,440
 time. And so, here's Paul writing to the church, to a bunch of people who've been

225
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:45,120
 saved out of that context, whose feet are still kind of in both camps. They're

226
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,000
 attracted still to the power that is seen in the world with finance and

227
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,240
 commerce and making a life for themselves. Equally, they're attracted to

228
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,360
 the temple and to Artemis and to knowing the names of all these different gods.

229
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,680
 And at the same time, they're trying to also now live on behalf of Christ and

230
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,320
 try to navigate all of that. And Paul writes them and says, "You need to

231
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,120
 understand what true power comes from. You need to understand that it doesn't

232
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,600
 come from this temple. It doesn't come from this goddess Artemis. You need to

233
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,920
 understand that the only power you need, the only answer that you'll ever need to

234
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:22,800
 every prayer that you will ever pray is Jesus Christ." And he helps the church to

235
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,520
 re-center themselves in the power that comes through prayer. And if there's one

236
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,440
 thing I want to do with you tonight, no matter how you felt coming in here today,

237
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,240
 no matter what is going on in your life, I want to pray that what we do together

238
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,400
 today will help to revolutionize your prayer life. Because I think when we

239
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,200
 truly understand what it is that Christ has done for us, we truly will then

240
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:49,440
 begin to lean into the praying that I think Paul longs for his church to pray.

241
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,640
 Let me read this to you, this incredible prayer that he has in Ephesians chapter

242
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,280
 1. Everybody okay still? All right, here we go. Starting in verse 15. Listen to this

243
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,360
 incredible prayer. This is Paul. He says, "For this reason, ever since I heard about

244
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,320
 your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints, I have not

245
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,000
 stopped giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers." And here's

246
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,200
 what I pray. "I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious

247
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:21,680
 Father, may give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation so that you may know Him

248
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:27,720
 better." Notice that not Artemis, that the Father, the glorious Father, would give

249
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,240
 you a spirit of wisdom and revelation so you would know Him better. "I pray also

250
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,800
 that the eyes of your heart would be opened." Not your mind through some drugs,

251
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:41,640
 but the eyes of your heart would be opened so that you would be enlightened

252
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:46,520
 to know the hope that there is to which He has called you, the riches of His

253
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:51,480
 glorious inheritance in the saints, and you would know this, His incomparably

254
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,640
 great power for us who believe. Oh, that power is like the working of His mighty

255
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,840
 strength which He exerted in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated

256
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:06,000
 Him at the right hand in the heavenly realms. Oh, far above all other powers, all

257
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,880
 other authorities, all other dominion, over every name that could ever be named,

258
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,520
 not only in the present age, but in the one to come. And God placed everything,

259
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,480
 all things, under His feet and appointed Him to be the head over everything for

260
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,120
 the church, which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills everything in

261
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,880
 every way. Paul is saying, "Church, don't you understand the power that is before

262
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,840
 you? Don't you understand who Christ is and what He's done for you? My prayer is

263
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,800
 that you would have wisdom and revelation so that you would know more

264
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,240
 of what it is that He's done with you. I pray that the eyes of your heart would

265
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,080
 be opened up, not just your mind so you can think better, your heart so that you

266
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,760
 would have more compassion, more grace, more forgiveness, so you would know the

267
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,800
 hope by which it is that you've been called." He says, "Not only that, but I want

268
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:59,000
 you to see the incomparably great power that there is for those who believe. That

269
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,400
 power is greater than anything Artemis could ever offer you. That power is

270
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:08,000
 greater than anything economics or commerce could ever offer you. That power,

271
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,480
 everything else sits under that. Every name has to submit to that name. Guess

272
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,720
 what? You don't need to buy magic scrolls anymore. You can get rid of all of that.

273
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,360
 If you've got the name of Jesus, everything else submits under that power."

274
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:28,880
 And He's basically saying, "That is all you need to know. Jesus." And when you come

275
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:36,960
 to a relationship with Him, all power is available to you. I love how He starts

276
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,240
 the prayer. He says, "For this reason." In other words, Paul is saying, "Okay, for

277
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,320
 everything I've already said so far in the letter, the first 14 verses, for the

278
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,520
 reason of all of that, here's now how I pray for you." I love this. I'm very

279
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,800
 grateful for Sydney last week for taking us so beautifully through those 14

280
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:59,160
 verses and showing us what it means for us to live in Christ and to have Christ

281
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:03,720
 living in us. And we saw last week some of the things that Paul is

282
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:08,240
 presenting to the church in Ephesus about who they are in Christ because he

283
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,640
 wants them to understand their identity in Him. Let me just show you a bit of a

284
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:16,600
 summary of these things. This is what he has said in the first 14 verses of the

285
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,480
 letter. "You are blessed with every spiritual blessing. You've been chosen by

286
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:25,720
 Him, adopted to His family, freely given grace. You're redeemed by His blood. You've

287
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:30,360
 got wisdom and understanding. You've been made known God's will. You have hope in

288
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:34,600
 Christ. You are the praise of His glory. You've received the word of truth. You've

289
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,960
 been given salvation. You are marked by the Holy Spirit. You have an inheritance.

290
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:45,280
 And because of all of this, for this reason, here's how you pray." Which is so

291
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,760
 powerful. See, for Paul, his prayers are not coming out of thin air. For Paul, he's

292
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,640
 not praying some rote prayers that he's memorized to learn. He's like, "Because of

293
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:59,000
 all that Christ has done for me, because of all that Christ has done for you, you

294
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,120
 haven't earned it, you don't deserve it, He's just done it out of His grace.

295
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:07,360
 Because of all of that, this is how we pray. We pray from a posture and from a

296
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,960
 place of the power for which God has done stuff for us. The power for which

297
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:18,560
 Christ has changed our lives. That's the fuel for our prayers," he's saying. Which is

298
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:25,000
 deeply challenging, because I realize that's not how I pray. And I wonder

299
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,760
 whether that's really how you pray. Because if I'm honest with you tonight,

300
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:36,400
 here's how I pray. I don't pray from a Christ-centered perspective. I pray from

301
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:42,360
 an Andrew-centered perspective. "Oh, my ankle hurts a little bit. I'm gonna pray.

302
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:48,160
 I've had an argument with my wife. I better pray. I've had a really stressful

303
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:52,520
 week at work. I'm gonna pray." In other words, my approach to prayer is so often

304
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:58,120
 based on what is happening for me, and is based on my perception of reality. Now,

305
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,200
 don't hear me wrong. If you're in a season right now in your life where

306
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,000
 things are really challenging, really difficult, things are really hard, and

307
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,080
 you're going to Christ out of that for prayer, that's absolutely awesome. That's

308
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,280
 totally fine. Totally great. Please don't hear me wrong. What Paul is saying, though,

309
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:18,000
 is that the true power that fuels our prayers shouldn't be what is going on

310
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,280
 for us. It should be what Christ has done for us. And when we center our prayer

311
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:29,720
 life in the perspective of what Christ has done for us, for this reason, our

312
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:34,920
 prayers take on a different focus. Our prayers take on a different power to

313
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:40,120
 them. I mean, could you imagine what that would be like? You see, when the self is

314
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:44,960
 the starting point of prayer, we very quickly become people who are

315
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:50,120
 overwhelmed by our need and our circumstance. But when Christ is the

316
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:55,440
 starting point of prayer, we are very quickly comforted by His authority and

317
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:01,080
 His power. And from that place, we are then able to pray prayers that

318
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:05,680
 truly mean something. My challenge for you in the week ahead is to do this, to

319
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:10,240
 find some time in your diary, to take out the book of Ephesians from Scripture,

320
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,760
 read the first 14 verses, and then afterwards begin to pray. I think you'll

321
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,640
 be amazed at how different your prayers are off the back of all of the things

322
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,880
 that Christ has done for you. It will shape and transform your prayers in a

323
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:31,900
 very different way. Paul's like, "For this reason, then I pray." And my hope for you

324
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:36,000
 this week ahead is that you will find your prayers coming out of the overflow

325
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,320
 of what Christ has done for you, so that you're finding yourself more bold, more

326
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,680
 courageous, more direct, and more hopeful in the things that you're bringing to Him.

327
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,920
 And you may still have challenging circumstances and situations going on in

328
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,000
 your life, and it's absolutely no problem to pray for those things. You should pray

329
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,700
 for those things. But they're flowing not out of a power that you're trying to

330
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:58,780
 find in yourself, they're flowing out of the power of the cross, the death, and the

331
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:05,800
 resurrection of Jesus. Are you with me? Then he starts to pray, and he does this

332
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,520
 incredible prayer. He first starts off by thanking them. He's like, "I thank you, and I

333
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,900
 thank God for who you are. You're awesome." Then he says, "I hope that you will have

334
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:18,560
 wisdom and revelation, that God will give you what you've been trying to seek from

335
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:22,300
 Artemis." The ultimate wisdom and revelation, he's saying, comes from Him,

336
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:26,460
 that you might be able to know Him better. Not that you would

337
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,700
 get answers to all the problems in your life, but that you would know Him better.

338
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:34,020
 He then says, "I pray that the eyes of your heart would be opened, so that

339
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:38,060
 you know more compassion, and forgiveness, and love, and ultimately know the hope by

340
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:42,540
 which you have been called, the great inheritance of all the saints." And then

341
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:46,460
 he gets to the heart of his prayer. In fact, from this part forward, from verse

342
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:50,060
 19 onwards, the rest of the prayer is focused on one theme and one theme only,

343
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:54,220
 and that's power. He says, "Here's what I pray for you, too. I pray that you would

344
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:59,900
 come to know the incomparably great power that there is for those who

345
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:06,260
 believe." And he wants his church to be so rooted in a right understanding of

346
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:10,920
 power, that they're able to let go of all of that seduction that they see in the

347
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:15,380
 world, and put their full trust and faith in Christ and Christ alone. Let me read

348
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:21,940
 you, actually, verse 19 in its full. It says this, it says, "And His incomparably

349
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:26,500
 great power for us who believe." That power is like the working of His mighty

350
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:30,220
 strength. Now, in the English, when we read that, it seems like pretty

351
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:33,660
 straightforward, but actually in the Greek, this is very

352
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:37,140
 interesting. In fact, what Paul does in the Greek here, which is what he's

353
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,820
 writing in, is something that he hasn't done and doesn't do in any of the other

354
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:45,780
 places of his letters. He actually uses six different words for the word "power."

355
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:50,260
 Look at this. You don't need to know what the words are, but these six words are

356
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:55,820
 all words which we translate into our English as "power." Which is really funny,

357
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:59,900
 because if you were to read this from the Greek into a transliterated English,

358
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:03,500
 here's how it would read. It would read this, "God wants you to know the power of

359
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,420
 the power of the power, for those who believe according to the power of the

360
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:11,860
 power's power." In other words, no power! Are you with me? Can you feel like

361
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:15,700
 Paul's passion? He's like, "I really want you to understand that the power of the

362
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:20,100
 power of the power, even the power's power has got power, right?" Like, he's really

363
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:24,780
 trying to help his church to understand the fullness of what Christ has done for

364
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:29,460
 them. So he uses six Greek words that we translate to "power," but mean slightly

365
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:33,540
 different things. He starts with the word "hupoballon." "Hupoballon" means this

366
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:39,380
 idea of a power that is beyond anything else, a power that cannot be undone or

367
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:44,220
 outdone by anything else. In other words, this power is incomparable, which is the

368
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:48,780
 English word we use, than any other power. "Hupoballon." He then uses this other

369
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:54,500
 word "maitheus." "Maitheus" is this idea that the power is of the greatest size

370
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:59,060
 that you could ever imagine, that the scope of that power is bigger than any

371
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:05,460
 other scope. He then uses the word "dunamis." "Dunamis" means a power that is

372
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:09,740
 in the possessive form, the idea of a power that is kind of the capability for

373
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:13,740
 action, the capability of this thing for its power. The picture is like a

374
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:17,940
 crossbow that an archer might pull back, and when they've got the crossbow pulled

375
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:22,100
 back, just before they're about to let go, their fingers and the arrow shoots

376
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:27,780
 forward, the tension in the bow, that's "dunamis." It's the potential power that is

377
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:33,500
 there. He then uses this other word "henephia." "Henephia" means actual power,

378
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:38,020
 not just a potential of the power, but the actual power that's at work in the

379
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:43,180
 world. He then uses another word, it's this kind of interesting word "kratos."

380
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:48,260
 "Kratos" essentially means that there is a mastery over every dominion and

381
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:53,340
 overplace. So this power is not just potential, it's not just actual, it's

382
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:57,900
 also a power that has dominion over every other kind of power that you could

383
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:02,660
 ever imagine. Every underpower is gonna sit under this. This is what "kratos" means.

384
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:06,540
 And then he finishes using this word that I think sounds like a Korean boy

385
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:12,180
 band name, "hysun." "Hysun" sounds Korean, doesn't it? "Hysun" is a Greek word

386
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:16,460
 which traditionally means like a possessive power or a power that's unique to the

387
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:21,580
 individual. So I want you to see this, these six words, and they capture a

388
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:26,300
 slightly different emphasis of what power is about. And when Paul writes

389
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:30,820
 Ephesians 119, he's wanting his church to understand, they would have known the

390
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:35,420
 Greek, they would understand what it is. So let me now translate this from what I

391
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:40,180
 think Paul is trying to say back into English for us. Let me read this to you.

392
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:45,020
 "I pray also that you would know the hope there is in the knowledge that there is

393
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:49,700
 no power in all the world that can go beyond the power found in God. No power

394
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:54,780
 that has the scope to outdo the power of God, and that this power sits in its full

395
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:58,900
 potential in the heart of God in every moment and is ready to be released in

396
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:04,100
 this world with a moment's notice. This is an actual power already at work all

397
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:08,820
 around us, not a power in theory but one in reality. And this power has dominion

398
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:13,420
 and mastery over all of the pretensions to power, for it is the personal power of

399
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:18,060
 the one true God, and he has uniquely revealed this power to us in the life,

400
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:23,020
 death, and resurrection of Jesus." That's what he's saying. That should blow your

401
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:27,700
 mind, that he would say in this prayer, "This is what I want you to believe about

402
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:32,580
 what Christ has done. This is the power that we have access to as Christians, a

403
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:40,100
 God who is able to do all of this." And so maybe you came in earlier and you were

404
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:48,020
 feeling defeated and overwhelmed. You have a God who is all of this for you,

405
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:53,420
 right here, right now. The fullness of that power right here and right now. This

406
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:57,460
 is why he actually says in verse 21, I love how he puts it here, he's getting

407
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:01,380
 like really sort of fired up at this point, he says, "Far above all the rulers

408
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:05,260
 and authorities, powers and dominions, over every name that can be named, not

409
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:08,860
 only in the present age but in the one to come." He's saying, "You don't need magic

410
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:13,420
 scrolls anymore, Ephesus. Stop spending your money on these stupid scrolls that

411
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:16,340
 are supposed to be giving you the name of some God that you think you need to

412
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:19,140
 pray to make that girl fall in love with you. If you want the girl to fall in love

413
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:23,020
 with you, you only need one name." Well, maybe that's not true. I don't know. But

414
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:26,620
 he said, "There's only one name for you. It's the name of Jesus, and if you get

415
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:29,580
 the name of Jesus, every other name is under that name. You don't need to do

416
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:34,500
 anything else. That becomes the one thing that you have. You can let go of all of

417
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:39,300
 the other pretensions to power, and you can declaim that Jesus and Jesus alone

418
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:45,420
 is Lord." This is a message for us in Hong Kong. I can't tell you the number of

419
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:50,340
 times where I've led somebody to the Lord here in our city, and I know that

420
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:53,740
 what's happened is they've taken Jesus, and it's the new deity that's on their

421
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:58,380
 shelf, next to a bunch of other deities that they've still got on their shelf.

422
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:05,100
 Jesus has become the latest guru to help with their problems in life, but they're

423
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:10,020
 still holding on to a lot of other superstitions, a lot of other cultural

424
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:13,500
 deities, maybe a lot of deities that their family has worshipped in the past,

425
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:17,740
 and they're still there too. And it's like Jesus has become added to a whole

426
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:22,460
 pantheon of deities for that person or for their family. And Paul leans into

427
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:27,420
 that context, and he says, "You just need one. In fact, there is only one, and it's

428
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:31,140
 Jesus Christ. And when you have Him, everything else has to be removed from

429
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:35,220
 the shelf. And if you're trying to hedge your bets across a whole bunch of

430
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:39,140
 different gods, that's not going to work for you. There's only one true power in

431
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:43,140
 this world, the life, death, resurrection of Jesus. And in relationship to Him,

432
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:52,020
 every other pretension to power submits itself unto Jesus Christ." This is why he

433
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:56,420
 says, and I think this is really, really important, in verse 19 he says this,

434
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:03,900
 "And this incomparably great power for us who believe." In other words, if you

435
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:08,180
 want to know, "Well, how do I get this power? How do I align myself to this power?" I

436
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:11,460
 hear you, Andrew, talking about all this great power. I kind of want to be a part

437
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:14,780
 of that too. I want to know a God who's going to be over me and going to move in

438
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:20,340
 that path. How do I get that power in my life? Paul says it simply. You want to get

439
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:27,140
 that power? Believe in Jesus. It's available for all who believe. Which,

440
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:30,900
 funnily enough for us Christians, sometimes grates against us, because

441
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,620
 we're kind of like, "How do I get that power? What do I need to do in order to

442
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,900
 get that power? Because I want that power. Are there more Bible studies that I can

443
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:40,580
 join to get that power? Or maybe it's power only reserved for the senior

444
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,540
 pastor. So after the service, I'm going to ask him to pray for me because his

445
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:46,860
 prayers are way more powerful than anybody else's, of course. Or maybe that

446
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:50,980
 power comes if I attend church every week for the next six months. If I do

447
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:55,980
 that, do I get that power?" And Paul says, "If you're still thinking that way, you're

448
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:03,540
 still purchasing magic scrolls." He's saying, "Actually, all you need to do is

449
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:09,700
 believe in Jesus. And if you believe in Jesus, you have access." The fullness of

450
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:13,940
 that. The only qualification that Paul puts on the access to the power of God

451
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:19,180
 is belief in Jesus. That's the only thing. Which I think is such a fundamentally

452
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:22,300
 important thing for us to remember. Because Christians, we can be so

453
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:27,340
 judgmental of others at times. "Oh, look at that person over there. Have you seen

454
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:32,020
 the way they dress? They're not really filled with the power of God. Because if

455
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:36,220
 they were, they would certainly not dress like that. Are you with me, too?" We are so

456
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:40,140
 judgmental in the church. Paul writes this to his church to say, "Let's stop

457
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:45,180
 judging one another. The only qualification for the power of God to be

458
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:49,260
 at work in your life, for you to be in Christ and Christ in you, is belief in

459
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:55,820
 Him." That's it. See, Paul wants you to know and accept that the fullness of the

460
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:00,580
 power of God is in those who believe in Him. And that the fullness of that power

461
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:07,140
 is potentially working through them as well. That's a wonderful thing. That we

462
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:12,540
 would all know a God who can fully meet us in all of that power that Paul has

463
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:18,180
 been talking about. So it comes back to our prayer lives. And it comes back to

464
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:24,340
 those moments where we wonder, "Is God really going to come through?" And I tell

465
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:27,580
 you what, in this time and in this hour, where we see all the stuff that's

466
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:31,820
 happening in the world around us, it's very easy for the church to feel

467
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:37,660
 defeated. I don't think Jesus died on the cross for a defeated church. I think He

468
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,940
 died on the cross so that we would know the exact thing that Paul's been talking

469
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:44,420
 about in this passage. He died on the cross so His church would not be

470
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:49,040
 defeated but victorious. He died on the cross so His church would know that when

471
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,380
 they pray, they have access to the fullness of the power of God. That

472
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:57,980
 power means that the name of Jesus, every other name, falls under that. It means

473
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:01,540
 that there is no dominion or mastery that is greater than that. It means that

474
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:05,340
 no matter what the world might tell us about the narratives of power, none of

475
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:09,900
 that makes sense because Jesus is the only one in true power. And when we put

476
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,460
 our allegiance and our obedience and our faith to Him, we know that we are

477
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:19,420
 walking in the only power that can sustain things for eternal life. That's

478
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:27,020
 our gospel. That's our story. That's the church God needs in the world today.

479
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:33,180
 See, a church that lacks a culture of the dependency on prayer has become a church

480
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:37,820
 that's ultimately satisfied in being dependent on itself. And that's not the

481
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:43,940
 church we need right now. My prayer for you is that you, as you see a Christ-

482
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:49,420
 centered approach to prayer, you would transform your prayers to be prayers of

483
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:56,060
 boldness and courage and hope and that you would pray with new unbridled power

484
00:37:56,060 --> 00:38:02,620
 that comes from the Spirit of God through the activity of prayer. Can I

485
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:08,420
 pray for you? Let's pray. Why don't we stand together? I'm gonna pray for us.

486
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:19,100
 Maybe just posture your heart into a place of prayer now. Just maybe close

487
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:26,140
 your eyes. Just come before Him. You've been saved for a reason and a purpose.

488
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:31,020
 He loves you so much. Next week we're gonna talk about what it means to be the

489
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:35,260
 workmanship of God. What it means to be fashioned and shaped for purpose in this

490
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:44,020
 world. And it starts here in this moment because prayer is our access point to

491
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:47,380
 everything we've been talking about here today.

492
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:54,940
 And I believe that you're gonna see the power of God through prayer in your life

493
00:38:54,940 --> 00:39:00,420
 like never before. It doesn't mean He's gonna answer every prayer you pray. The

494
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:03,940
 answer of prayer is always in the hands of God. It's not in the hands of man.

495
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,780
 It doesn't mean He's gonna answer every prayer. It doesn't mean He's gonna come

496
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:10,380
 through for every dream. It doesn't mean that your life's suddenly gonna be

497
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:17,020
 perfect. But I believe that you will have a revolutionized prayer life as you come

498
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:21,020
 to remember and reflect on the power of Christ and as you pray from a Christ

499
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:24,980
 centered perspective. From all of the things that He has done for you out of

500
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:31,540
 the gratitude of that we pray. So Lord I want to pray this week that each person

501
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:35,660
 in this room would come to know your power in a new way. Father I thank you

502
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:39,940
 that you went to the cross and you died and took on the fullness of our sin so

503
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:43,660
 that we would know the fullness of life. I thank you that every single person in

504
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:47,100
 this room who confesses you as their Lord and Savior has access to the

505
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:52,140
 fullness of the Spirit. That the same Spirit that raised you from the dead now

506
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:57,460
 lives in them. I pray Lord that the power of God would move in our hearts and our

507
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:01,660
 lives and our mouths as we pray. Lord I pray that you would birth a fresh

508
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:05,780
 desperation for prayer at the vine like never before. Lord we know in the season

509
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:09,140
 where people are talking about wars and more wars and world wars and all this

510
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:13,420
 crazy stuff that we don't need to retreat. We don't need to be fearful. We

511
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:16,860
 don't need to run in the opposite direction. We can take our stand because

512
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:21,140
 we are filled with the power of Christ. We are filled with the hope that comes

513
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:26,580
 from the gospel. We are secure in our feet that are rooted in peace and we can

514
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:35,180
 be His hands and feet in this time. So Lord I pray, I pray that that all-

515
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:41,540
 encompassing power would fall on each person right now. I wonder whether you

516
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:47,980
 just be willing to open your hands as I pray. Father that power is in your spirit

517
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:53,020
 and it is released through prayer. And so I want to pray right now in the name of

518
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:58,460
 Jesus for the releasing of the power of the Spirit of God over each person here.

519
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:07,460
 Fear be gone in the name of Jesus. Worry be gone in the name of Jesus. Pain be gone

520
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:12,940
 in the name of Jesus. Shame, regrets gone in the name of Jesus. Father I pray that

521
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:18,420
 you would release over your people love and goodness and mercy. Lord I pray that

522
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:23,060
 every person would walk out of here today knowing the hope to which you have

523
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:26,820
 called them. The great inheritance that is there in the saints and the

524
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:31,580
 incomparably great power for those who believe. For that power is like the

525
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:36,260
 working of your mighty strength that has come and raised Jesus from the dead and

526
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:41,140
 now sits him at the right hand of the Father. That every power and dominion and

527
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:45,660
 authority and every name that can be named now sits under the authority in

528
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:52,060
 the name of Jesus Christ. And that he has done that for the church, for you. So that

529
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:55,540
 you would not live a defeated life. You would not live a life where you're

530
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:59,420
 overwhelmed and struck down. But you would live a life that is full of

531
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:05,340
 purpose, full of hope, full of light and full of love. And I pray that you would

532
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:12,500
 live that life to the fullness of the Spirit of God that is inside of you. That

533
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:16,700
 you would live a life that is worthy of the calling that you have received,

534
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:22,580
 filled with the power that is only found in Jesus. And Father we thank you for

535
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:28,580
 this in Jesus name. Everyone says amen. Hey we're gonna we're gonna worship

536
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:32,380
 together so let's just spend some time together as a community responding in

537
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:35,140
 worship now.

538
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:38,200
 you

539
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,600
