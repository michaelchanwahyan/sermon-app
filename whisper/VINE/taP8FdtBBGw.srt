1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,300
 Why don't you have a seat?

2
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,140
 Why should you do so?

3
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,120
 Turn around and say hi to someone

4
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,440
 that you did not meet beforehand.

5
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,600
 Say hi, who are you?

6
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,000
 It's very nice to meet you.

7
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,920
 Give me your name.

8
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,440
 Please say hi, be friendly.

9
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,280
 All right.

10
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,400
 Well, I'm super excited that we get to continue

11
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,480
 our Philippian series today.

12
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,000
 Okay, that's enough friendliness for one day, thank you.

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,300
 Just kidding.

14
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,120
 We're getting to continue our Philippian series

15
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,120
 in Alternative Society.

16
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,760
 If you've been here at the Vine for the last number of weeks

17
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,400
 you'll know that we're in a series

18
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,000
 where we're looking at Paul's vision

19
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,280
 for the local community of church.

20
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,800
 His vision for how the church could shine

21
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,720
 in the community around them.

22
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,960
 And this is exactly the topic that we're looking at today.

23
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,880
 I'm really grateful that we got Sidney Yip,

24
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,400
 chairman of our eldership with us today,

25
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,120
 friend of many in this church,

26
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,800
 someone who served this church for many years

27
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,280
 with Vivian and their family.

28
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,600
 Why don't you stretch out your hands with me

29
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,100
 and I'm gonna pray for Sidney.

30
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,760
 Father, we thank you for Sidney and Vivian.

31
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,000
 We thank you for their leadership,

32
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,800
 their partnership together in marriage.

33
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,000
 Lord, we thank you for Sidney's passion

34
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,760
 for your word, his heart.

35
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,560
 Lord, we thank you for the skills that you've given him

36
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,960
 in the marketplace as a surgeon, a doctor.

37
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,880
 And Lord, as he pours out his heart towards us today

38
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,200
 in this area of holiness,

39
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,920
 Lord, we come to you afresh with that vision of the hill

40
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,660
 that we are ascending by you.

41
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:26,160
 And Lord, we pray for this pure and blameless spirit

42
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,140
 to be in us and through us.

43
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,900
 We pray that we would be able to live, Lord,

44
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,960
 as the people of God in the way that you called us to live.

45
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,400
 So would you open this word to us, Lord, through Sidney.

46
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,760
 Would our hearts be fertile soil

47
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,000
 for the things that you want to say to us today?

48
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,080
 And God, we thank you for this

49
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,320
 and we give you praise in Jesus' name.

50
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,960
 Everyone says amen.

51
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,120
 - Amen.

52
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,400
 Well, thank you, Andrew.

53
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:53,200
 Many years back while I was still working in Singapore,

54
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,240
 I got an invitation to speak

55
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,000
 in a medical conference here in Hong Kong.

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,360
 So the organizers were very generous.

57
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,880
 They put me up in a six-star hotel.

58
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,200
 Well, whatever it means.

59
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,300
 That was well before this vacation becomes a phenomenon.

60
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,200
 But interestingly, right after that visit to Hong Kong,

61
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,400
 I was to fly out to Indonesia

62
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,200
 to join a medical mission team.

63
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,120
 So that was right after the double jeopardy

64
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,600
 of tsunami and earthquake

65
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,020
 in the outskirt Indonesian island.

66
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,440
 So for all those 10 days,

67
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,860
 we were staying out in all-stars hotels.

68
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,140
 Well, by all-stars, we are really tenting out

69
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,760
 because after the earthquake,

70
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,280
 we don't dare to stay in-house.

71
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,280
 But that sleeping out in the open

72
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,160
 allowed us the perfect occasion

73
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,160
 to glaze upon the stars

74
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,380
 in mere darkness in the countryside.

75
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,840
 So that would help us recall

76
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:00,260
 the painting by Vincent van Gogh, Starry Night,

77
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:04,420
 well, that was told to be the easiest,

78
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,620
 the comprehensible pictures of his making.

79
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:14,340
 Anyway, actually, it's more than 2,000 years ago,

80
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,340
 Paul had already in mind about morning stars that shine.

81
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:22,580
 In Philippians chapter two, it's said,

82
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,960
 so that you may become blameless and pure,

83
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,860
 children of God, without fault,

84
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,960
 in a crooked and twisted generation,

85
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:36,840
 that you will shine among them like stars in the sky.

86
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,600
 So it remains for us to ponder

87
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,160
 what shining morning stars really means

88
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,540
 as we continue our Alternative Society series,

89
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,120
 a new way of living,

90
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,340
 paying particular attention to holiness.

91
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,960
 Well, this study will demand

92
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,260
 more than your usual attention, is that okay?

93
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,120
 Okay, therefore, my dear friends,

94
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,620
 as you have always obeyed,

95
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,640
 not only in my presence, but also in my absence,

96
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,460
 continue to work out your salvation

97
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,880
 with fear and trembling.

98
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,380
 For it is God who works in you

99
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:21,380
 to will and to act in order to fulfill his good purpose.

100
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:26,760
 Therefore, do everything without grumbling or arguing,

101
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,720
 so that you may become blameless and pure,

102
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,220
 children of God, without fault,

103
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,260
 in a crooked and twisted generation.

104
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:41,260
 Then you will shine among them like stars in the sky,

105
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,420
 as you hold firmly to the word of life.

106
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,320
 So in a nutshell, the Philippians were to devote themselves

107
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,320
 to practical Christianity, working out their salvation.

108
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,200
 Then they were to be characterized

109
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,720
 by positive steadfastness,

110
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,080
 never scramble to complaining or grumbling.

111
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,060
 So in short, God is a holy God.

112
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:12,000
 He chooses for himself a people

113
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,380
 and confer holiness to his people.

114
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,880
 And we, the holy people, are to live our holy lives.

115
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:27,540
 So for practical Christianity,

116
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,800
 it is for us to work out our salvation

117
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,340
 with fear and trembling,

118
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,460
 because it is God who works in us.

119
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,360
 Now last, we are caught up with the theological debate

120
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,560
 between work and salvation.

121
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,260
 So for today, it's suffix to understand

122
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:49,260
 that the dynamics of salvation is already, not yet.

123
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:52,060
 Using a word of play,

124
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:59,280
 Paul said that they were to work out because God works in.

125
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,800
 God works in them and provide them the motivation

126
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,520
 and the ability to do his good pleasure.

127
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,860
 Now this passage actually recalls

128
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,780
 the Philippians 1 passage,

129
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:17,460
 where Paul expressed his confidence in them

130
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,220
 because what God has begun, a good work,

131
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,380
 he would bring it to completion.

132
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:29,380
 How then is it best for us to understand fear and trembling?

133
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,560
 That brings us to the original notion

134
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,080
 of who our holy God is,

135
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,420
 and that would necessitate a quick look

136
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,160
 at the Old Testament.

137
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,660
 Now holiness in the Hebrew Bible

138
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:46,160
 is intrinsically connected to God, his very being.

139
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,740
 God is the holy one par excellence,

140
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,500
 with the exclusive power to confer holiness unto others.

141
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,500
 Not only is God the source of holiness,

142
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,080
 but human bodies like us will require holiness

143
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,320
 in order to be in proximity to the deity.

144
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,400
 Now we often think of getting prepared

145
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,980
 as the Israelites through the sacrificial system,

146
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,680
 gaining access to the most high.

147
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,560
 So for illustration,

148
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,660
 many of you are aware that I practice surgery.

149
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:25,100
 So how we prepare to gain access to the operating room,

150
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,800
 the holy place, bears some resemblance.

151
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,220
 To go into the operating theater,

152
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,960
 we need to get changed into necessary gears,

153
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:38,520
 masks, hair cover, scrubs, and boots.

154
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,480
 But this is only the beginning.

155
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,280
 To get into the operating room and be involved in surgery,

156
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,320
 we actually need to go through another round of cleansing.

157
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,400
 We have to scrub for at least three minutes

158
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,280
 using antiseptic lotions.

159
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,800
 That's why Vivian always says,

160
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,760
 "Well, my hands are very smooth."

161
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,680
 (audience laughs)

162
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,440
 Well, then we have to put on sterile gongs and gloves.

163
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,160
 In fact, it is advisable to use double gloves.

164
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,480
 Now this is a mutual protection

165
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,620
 for patients and for ourselves.

166
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:11,680
 Back in the days of SARS, or even in this COVID season,

167
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,000
 gaining access to patients' airways

168
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,840
 as in giving anesthesia before surgery

169
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,800
 is actually considered high-risk procedures

170
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,980
 for the medical personnel.

171
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,400
 In fact, years back, we lost quite a few colleagues

172
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,240
 while they are doing intubation.

173
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:34,240
 We have to gong up using higher standard N95 mask,

174
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,800
 and also what we call astronauts' OT costumes.

175
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,160
 Now even with all those,

176
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,600
 we really come forth in fear and trembling,

177
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,520
 as we are never 100% sure that we are prepared

178
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,040
 and fortness to face the dire consequence

179
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,260
 of not being good enough.

180
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,720
 With that in mind, it may be easier for us to understand

181
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,720
 why the Israelites, as they come before God, Yahweh,

182
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,040
 in the Mount Sinai,

183
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:12,800
 they would rather that Moses approach God on their behalf.

184
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,320
 Now however, while much emphasis was laid

185
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,520
 on maintaining cleanliness by the holiness code

186
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,240
 to come before God,

187
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,220
 the status of holiness was actually conferred

188
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,800
 in the first place.

189
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,920
 In Exodus, the Israelites were summoned

190
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,560
 into a special relationship with God,

191
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,120
 described by three phrases,

192
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,960
 a special possession amongst all peoples,

193
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:44,120
 a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation.

194
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,520
 Israel is to be God's own people,

195
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,400
 set apart from other nations for its own service,

196
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,640
 just as priests were set apart

197
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,620
 and marked by a quality of life in alignment

198
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,360
 with the holiness of the covenant with God.

199
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,980
 Israel is holy because she is called by God

200
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,100
 as its own people.

201
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,580
 However, holiness should not be narrowly understood

202
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,640
 as separation or just setting apart.

203
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,260
 Israelites' holiness has a communal implication.

204
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:24,140
 It is to be manifested in social relationships

205
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,800
 with strangers, with the poor,

206
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,860
 and with the surrounding nations.

207
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,180
 In their shared living,

208
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:34,420
 Israel is called to model the life of the Godhead,

209
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:38,580
 to live out the love, the goodness, and justice of God

210
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,800
 for the nations to see and be drawn to.

211
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,020
 Now fast forward to the New Testament era.

212
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,740
 It is helpful to recall the words of Hebrews.

213
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,860
 Let us then approach God's throne of grace with confidence

214
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,780
 so that we may receive mercy and grace

215
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:01,240
 to help us in times of need,

216
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,140
 that we may come before a holy God

217
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,360
 at any time of our needs.

218
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,500
 It's really made possible by the death and resurrection

219
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,420
 of our Lord Jesus Christ.

220
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,280
 We'll have a bit more of elaboration next week on this.

221
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,440
 Now a New Testament approach to understanding,

222
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,800
 approaching the holy God,

223
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,420
 is in fact best illustrated in the last prayer.

224
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:29,740
 This then is how you should pray,

225
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:34,580
 our Father in heaven, may your holy name be honored.

226
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:42,020
 As a father of two grown up adults in their late 20s,

227
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:46,440
 I would not like them to come to me in fear and trembling.

228
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,120
 Nor I expect them to come in perfection.

229
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,760
 I just treasure that they come to me

230
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,780
 as often as they desire.

231
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,960
 The interesting paradox we have

232
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,440
 for modern day believers is rather,

233
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,520
 now that we can come forth to a heavenly father

234
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,360
 at any time without fear,

235
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:12,240
 do we really come to him as often as he desires?

236
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,120
 So what is Paul's thought on holiness

237
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,640
 as reflected in the Philippians?

238
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,800
 It might be helpful to reconnect today's passage

239
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,420
 to the prayer in chapter one,

240
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:29,640
 as well as the drive to perfection,

241
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,740
 as would be mentioned in chapter three.

242
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,980
 Philippians one, and this is my prayer,

243
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,840
 that your love may abound more and more

244
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,520
 in knowledge and depth of insight,

245
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,760
 so that you may be able to discern what is best

246
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,680
 in order that you may be pure and blameless

247
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,920
 until the day of Christ,

248
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,140
 filled with the fruits of righteousness.

249
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:00,360
 As one examines the prayer, it become evident

250
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:05,160
 that Paul is concerned with the holiness of the Philippians.

251
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,160
 Paul expect them to live a holy life in the presence,

252
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,160
 even as they anticipate the day of Christ.

253
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,880
 Thus holiness is the moral character of our life,

254
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,800
 here and now, that will prepare us to stand the test

255
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,640
 of that great day, whenever it come.

256
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:30,120
 Towards chapter three, the emphasis of holiness,

257
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,800
 of it being a process,

258
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,340
 is best illustrated by Paul's own commitment.

259
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,360
 Not that I've already obtained this, or am already perfect,

260
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,500
 but I press on to make it my own,

261
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,500
 because Christ Jesus has made me his own.

262
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,800
 So a quick summary of what we have

263
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,000
 on Paul's thinking of holiness.

264
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,420
 Number one, Paul's call for holiness

265
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:01,640
 is greatly influenced by his outlook for the future,

266
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,720
 namely the second coming of Jesus Christ.

267
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,720
 Second, the holiness that Paul calls his church

268
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,360
 is both corporate and personal.

269
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,600
 We are to shine together as a community.

270
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,840
 And third, the word perfection reminds us

271
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:26,840
 that we maintain the tension which exists in the words,

272
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:32,200
 to make perfect, as a verb, and perfect as an adjective.

273
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,200
 Well, actually, to put it in very simple terms,

274
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,260
 it is work in progress.

275
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:44,040
 Now, let's come back to our anchor verses in chapter two,

276
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,480
 where Paul's understanding of holiness

277
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,660
 is primarily communal.

278
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,680
 We become related to Christ singly,

279
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,680
 but we cannot live in Christ as isolated individuals.

280
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,400
 God is not just making individuals holy,

281
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,160
 which he certainly does,

282
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,080
 but he's making a people holy.

283
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:12,000
 How about positive steadfastness?

284
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,600
 Philippians 2 remind us,

285
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,800
 "To do all things without grumbling or questioning,

286
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,320
 that you may be blameless and innocent,

287
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,520
 children of God without blemish,

288
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,440
 in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation."

289
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,440
 Paul uses the language in the Psalms of Moses

290
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,740
 that stands near the end of Deuteronomy,

291
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,240
 that describes the unfaithfulness

292
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,680
 of a wicked generation of Israelites

293
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,560
 who were brought out of Egypt.

294
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,480
 They grumble as a sign of their mistrust

295
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,100
 in the goodness of God.

296
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,520
 Now, Paul believes that the Philippians

297
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:58,040
 were to stand in continuity of the ancient call of God.

298
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,520
 Paul's exhortation on holiness to the Philippians

299
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,820
 is that they are to live as God's holy people

300
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:11,580
 in a dark world that Paul describes in its darkest terms

301
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,400
 as crooked and perverse.

302
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:19,400
 If the Philippians can succeed in fulfilling this vocation,

303
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,720
 they will shine as stars in the universe

304
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,760
 as they hold on to the word of life.

305
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,680
 This is the vocation that according to Isaiah,

306
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,960
 Israel was supposed to carry,

307
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,720
 to be the light amongst the Gentiles,

308
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,880
 so that the salvation of God

309
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,160
 might be brought to the ends of the earth.

310
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,400
 Paul's exhortation presents holiness

311
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,520
 both in negative and positive terms.

312
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,880
 In a negative sense, Paul called upon the Philippians

313
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,420
 to shy from grumbling and questioning.

314
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,920
 So, do not grumble.

315
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,280
 Now, in my own workplace context,

316
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,260
 different development strategies

317
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,900
 eventually precipitates the breakdown

318
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,000
 of a very longstanding partnership in the company.

319
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,180
 That we have different financial goals

320
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:18,440
 as a business entity is entirely understandable.

321
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:22,500
 What was very painful and hurtful

322
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:27,160
 was the grumbles and complaints even before we parted ways,

323
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,320
 and it had a tremendous impact, even on myself.

324
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,880
 I'm hoping that as a church body,

325
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,660
 we can do better than in a secular setting.

326
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,580
 In fact, Paul employs three terms

327
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,780
 to describe the stage of readiness

328
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,900
 in which the believers in Philippi are to keep themselves.

329
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,540
 The first, blame them.

330
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:52,260
 It actually appeared also in Genesis,

331
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,380
 whereby God commanded Abraham

332
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,820
 to walk before him and be blameless.

333
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,300
 And that was exactly the idea that was echoed in Psalm.

334
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,460
 Who may ascend to the holy mountains?

335
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,400
 Those who are pure in heart and clean in hands.

336
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,620
 The second term, ignorance, is found in Matthew.

337
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:18,180
 Jesus say, I'm sending you out like sheep amongst wolves.

338
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:23,180
 Therefore, be as shrewd as snakes, and be ignocent as doves.

339
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:28,840
 It is translated as ignorance with ethical overtones.

340
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,340
 Christ's followers are to be characterized

341
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,800
 by a delicate balance of prudence and purity.

342
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:40,300
 The third term, to be without blamish,

343
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:45,300
 is actually a very often Old Testament context of worship,

344
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:51,900
 whereby without blamish is applied to animals

345
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,540
 that were meant for sacrifice.

346
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,240
 However, it was also used

347
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,700
 to describe the person's moral state.

348
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:03,540
 So his call to the Philippians is really to be blameless,

349
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,900
 innocent, and without blamish.

350
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,920
 He's calling for moral transformation

351
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,740
 in every aspect of the believer's life.

352
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,980
 It is a life that should be beyond reproach

353
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,740
 in every area.

354
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:22,580
 The Philippian Christians are to present themselves

355
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:27,260
 as holy and acceptable sacrifice to God.

356
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:31,340
 The result of their living is that they will shine as light.

357
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:35,440
 And yet, even with their imperfections,

358
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,900
 they could progress to become the light of the world

359
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,020
 to those in darkness.

360
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:45,100
 So what does it mean to shine as morning star

361
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,240
 in our times?

362
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,660
 I will name three areas that I learned

363
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:53,700
 from my seminary professor, teaching faith and work.

364
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,820
 So he brought up a version of three Cs in the workplace,

365
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:02,820
 namely, competence, care, and character.

366
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,600
 It is not difficult to understand competence.

367
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,500
 Do with excellence.

368
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,700
 Do it and do it well, period.

369
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,260
 Now, however, just doing well

370
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,820
 without grumbling and complaining.

371
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,980
 Grumbling may not have much bearing

372
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,540
 on your competence in a strict sense,

373
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:28,760
 but your reputation and that of Christ would be at stake.

374
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,620
 On the other hand, while we work diligently,

375
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,020
 Jesus will always open a door

376
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:38,140
 for us to care for others in the workplace.

377
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:42,900
 Our practice recently moved to a newer,

378
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,580
 yet more compact venue, where after all,

379
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,780
 rental in central is prohibitively high,

380
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,700
 in a sense that it's also a reflection

381
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,980
 of the very distorted economic system

382
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,220
 in the deprived generation.

383
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:01,580
 But my honest confession is that as the company

384
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:06,220
 pushes to cut cost for enhanced efficiency,

385
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:09,520
 we are driving our employees to the brink of breakdown.

386
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,180
 Some of my staff lamented that they are losing

387
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,700
 the joy of serving.

388
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,300
 So while my initial thought was to invite

389
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,660
 my fellow elders to come around me

390
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,560
 to bless me and my business,

391
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:30,580
 in preparation that morning, I had a restaurant prompting

392
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:34,080
 that the office blessing should be about

393
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,740
 my colleagues and my staff.

394
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,260
 So the few of us who gathered that morning,

395
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:43,220
 we took time to invite my staff

396
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,180
 to pray for them individually.

397
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:50,220
 Really, in those weeks of tremendous stress

398
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:53,980
 from the fiscal move, the adjustments to new workflow,

399
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,960
 and new management changes,

400
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,300
 they yearned for comfort and strength,

401
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:03,640
 and are there to believe that God's light shone on them

402
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,000
 and illuminated their paths.

403
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,380
 In fact, at the opportune time,

404
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,700
 we shall need to be bold enough

405
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,240
 to speak on behalf of others.

406
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,400
 I'm a minority shareholder in my company,

407
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,900
 but I felt compelled to speak to the management

408
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:26,220
 regarding improvement of the staff's welfare.

409
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,500
 And I'm glad to be reassured by them

410
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,560
 that they are making every effort

411
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,900
 to rectify the situation, and that they care.

412
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,940
 So be proactive.

413
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:40,180
 I challenge you to come forth,

414
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:43,340
 to offer prayers for your staff,

415
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:46,340
 for your peers, and for your boss.

416
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,180
 Why not?

417
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:52,420
 The other day, I was somewhat stressed out

418
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,280
 in preparation for a fairly difficult surgery.

419
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:01,160
 Lo and behold, I received a text from my patient's daughter.

420
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,800
 She encouraged me that she prayed for me,

421
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,100
 believing that I shall be a blessing to her father.

422
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:12,740
 She became my morning star, as she cared.

423
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:20,300
 But most of all, Paul is demanding our character.

424
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:25,300
 The key for character remains fearing in reference to God.

425
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:32,320
 By this, I mean we honor him in all our areas of living,

426
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,140
 working, and being.

427
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:39,700
 As a surgeon who had practiced for more than 30 years,

428
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:46,020
 I confess that actually I'm fearful many a times.

429
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:51,820
 While the irony is some measured fear turned out

430
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:56,820
 to be helpful for us to stay prudent for complicated,

431
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,200
 as much as for mundane surgeries.

432
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,820
 The fear is not so much that there may be shortcomings

433
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,680
 of our own making or complications,

434
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:11,260
 even sometimes undesirable outcomes, including mortality,

435
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:14,100
 beyond our control or understanding.

436
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:18,400
 The reference is that we acknowledge,

437
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,300
 ultimately, God is sovereign.

438
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,860
 He is the healer.

439
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,440
 We are just the instruments to care.

440
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,440
 We are the morning stars that reflect his glory.

441
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:34,260
 But as stars, we can also shine together as a body.

442
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,220
 I mentioned about the medical mission team

443
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,100
 for the earthquake relief,

444
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,420
 whereby we serve different communities

445
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:43,800
 in the outskirts Indonesian island.

446
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,240
 We were in this shining for Christ

447
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,800
 for an otherwise limited assassination,

448
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:54,060
 even when the earth was literally shaken.

449
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,980
 Here in Hong Kong,

450
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,740
 we are coming across a major shaking ourselves.

451
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:04,740
 Richard Napole wrote a very important theological piece

452
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:09,540
 reflecting on Christ and culture.

453
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,660
 He put two extreme ends.

454
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:16,660
 On the one end is Christ entirely against culture.

455
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:22,920
 On the other end is Christ entirely for culture.

456
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,340
 But he put forth a different way,

457
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:28,140
 Christ, or rather Christians,

458
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,500
 in our interaction with the culture,

459
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,200
 we can actually transform culture,

460
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,280
 and that may be the way out.

461
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:39,840
 That is, we can take culture's fallenness seriously,

462
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,840
 but continue to will and to act

463
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,540
 hopes for conversion within it.

464
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:48,220
 While some of us may regard this

465
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:51,660
 as a gloriously impossible mission,

466
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:55,620
 but we may also argue that at the time of Paul's writing,

467
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,420
 the early Christian churches,

468
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,460
 including the Philippian church,

469
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,900
 they learned and practiced humility,

470
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,860
 self-sacrifice, joy, care for others,

471
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:11,640
 and most of all, fear of Jesus Christ as the Lord,

472
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,700
 instead of Caesar as the Lord.

473
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:18,500
 Indeed, they shine and subverted the culture

474
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,700
 where they lived as an alternative society.

475
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:26,060
 In this season, our generation may also choose

476
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,620
 to live out differently,

477
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:31,920
 to act out the fear and reference to our true God,

478
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,660
 regardless of the external society pressures.

479
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:40,860
 For instance, the society may not fully appreciate

480
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:44,260
 the work of manual labors, including street cleaners,

481
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,220
 who actually serve us so well,

482
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,860
 especially in this COVID season.

483
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:51,780
 Yet, the volunteers from STOB,

484
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:55,260
 under the branches of hope, they shine.

485
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,160
 They reach out to the street cleaners in our neighborhood.

486
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,280
 They prepare simple lunch boxes,

487
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:06,100
 but with a lot of love, care, and respect.

488
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:09,620
 And for all you know, it is because our fellow brothers

489
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,580
 and sisters from the Arise community

490
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:16,060
 who are able to speak their languages, they join us,

491
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,700
 so that this church can reach out

492
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,500
 to very different nationalities.

493
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:28,980
 So in conclusion, may God find our response

494
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:33,180
 of fear and reference entirely appropriate.

495
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:36,280
 We are to fear Him in the sense

496
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,300
 that we recognize His holiness,

497
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,860
 and the respect and honor due Him,

498
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:48,900
 as His heart yearns for us.

499
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,060
 We can always approach Him,

500
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:55,060
 His throne of grace, with confidence,

501
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:58,180
 so that we may receive mercy and grace

502
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,540
 to help us in our times of need.

503
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:06,100
 We shall then shine as we meet the need of others.

504
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,020
 In fact, most importantly,

505
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:13,020
 we shall bring others to our holy God, even as we shine.

506
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,140
 (silence)

507
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:19,700
 Can I invite the worship team to come and join us?

508
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,680
 I'll share the story of one of my patients.

509
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:26,320
 She actually, well, she literally come

510
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,340
 with fear and trembling.

511
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:31,400
 Honestly, more before, because she was overwhelmed

512
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,920
 by her medical condition.

513
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:39,100
 Yet along the way, as many come around to support her,

514
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:43,620
 to pray with her, she became much better prepared

515
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,260
 to proceed.

516
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:49,900
 She was learning to fear God as the sovereign,

517
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,040
 as well as the good God, the Holy One.

518
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:58,820
 She made an impressive and speedy recovery,

519
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:02,440
 to the extent that she quickly volunteered to serve.

520
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,580
 In fact, she served in our children ministry

521
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:09,020
 for the underprivileged just this summer vacation.

522
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:13,140
 She served with much joy and became one

523
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:16,420
 of the most beloved volunteers.

524
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,940
 She is shining in her own right,

525
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:22,020
 as one of the morning stars,

526
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:25,120
 alongside with many other stars in our midst.

527
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:30,220
 So each one of us here, we can look up the sky

528
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:36,220
 and envisage that we can also shine alongside many others

529
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,900
 from this congregation as morning stars.

530
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:46,940
 Can I invite all of us to stand together as we worship,

531
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:52,620
 as a symbolic act, I would suggest that you bring out

532
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:57,100
 your handphone, you switch on your torch mode,

533
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:01,080
 and continue to shine as morning stars,

534
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,980
 even as we worship together.

535
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:06,400
 (soft music)
