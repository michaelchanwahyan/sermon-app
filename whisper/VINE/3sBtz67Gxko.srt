1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
 I'm so grateful that I can be with you here on my final Sunday with you before sabbatical.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,220
 I was supposed to be preaching out of Ephesians today and continuing our series in Ephesians,

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,760
 and that was the schedule for this Sunday.

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:19,480
 But over the last few weeks as I've just been processing my heart to get ready to go on

5
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:25,320
 the four-month break that I have, I've just felt like a rising sense in me that I have

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,720
 a message that I want to impart into you as a community before I go.

7
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,840
 And it's one that I know that the Holy Spirit is currently imparting into me.

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,800
 It's something that I feel like the Spirit of God is shaping in me.

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,460
 And while this is not always the case, I've recognized over the last 11 years of leading

10
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:46,880
 here that when the Holy Spirit does something for me, He'll often also do it for us as a

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,400
 community.

12
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:54,520
 And so I want to speak a little bit out of what I'm sensing God is calling me into sabbatical

13
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,520
 for.

14
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,680
 I actually am entering into my sabbatical with a lot of energy.

15
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,800
 I'm not collapsing over the finish line as if I've done this massive marathon and I need

16
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,240
 someone to kind of pump some sort of energy into me.

17
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,320
 I'm actually going on the sabbatical with a lot of spiritual energy, a lot of leadership

18
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,920
 energy, a lot of excitement, which is a great thing.

19
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,760
 But I also recognize I'm heading on the sabbatical because there is some healing I need.

20
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:23,860
 There is some inner healing and restoration that I need for me.

21
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:29,080
 And I know that in order for me to lead how I sense the Holy Spirit is calling me and

22
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:33,800
 wanting me to lead here, I need to make sure I've got regular rhythms in my life, not just

23
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,760
 sabbatical times, but regular rhythms to get healing from the Holy Spirit.

24
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,640
 But now in this season of my life, I know I need that healing perhaps now more than

25
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,640
 ever.

26
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,240
 And I feel that cool as I go into sabbatical.

27
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,640
 And I want to share a little bit with you today out of that place because I sense that

28
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,560
 there is many of us here in this room, in the overflow online right now, who are also

29
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,600
 in need of what we've really seen Paul teach in the book of Ephesians.

30
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,000
 And that is a journey of inner healing and restoration.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,400
 And it's been amazing over the weeks as we've seen Paul's pastoral heart for his church

32
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,400
 in Ephesus.

33
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,440
 And a few weeks back, we saw that prayer at the end of chapter three, where he says, "My

34
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:20,600
 prayer for you is that you would be strengthened with power by the Spirit in your inner being."

35
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:25,120
 And it's this pastoral moment where Paul is standing for his church and he's saying, "Man,

36
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,520
 this is my heart.

37
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,280
 My heart is that the Spirit of God would come and do a healing, regenerative, restorative

38
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,880
 work within you, create power where there is currently weakness."

39
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,840
 And as I head into my sabbatical, I almost feel like God's got like a little rope around

40
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,200
 me and he's kind of gently doing this.

41
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,640
 And he's saying, "I need you once again to get strengthened with power by my Spirit in

42
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,480
 your inner being, because I need to release some things out of you.

43
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,160
 I need to heal and restore some things in you.

44
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,600
 And I feel that call for you here this morning."

45
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,680
 And so I put aside what I was supposed to be doing and I want to bring a message that

46
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,760
 hopefully will not only help you to understand what's happening for me, but perhaps more

47
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,040
 importantly, help you to understand what the Holy Spirit wants to do for you.

48
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,840
 This is a year of intimacy.

49
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,880
 We've said here at the Vine in 2024.

50
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:21,560
 Intimacy is always not just about coming into closer relationship with Christ or sensing

51
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,700
 his presence in our lives more.

52
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,280
 Intimacy is always about inner healing and restoration.

53
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,480
 It's always about coming in so that we can be restored to then go out again.

54
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,480
 And I pray that what I share with you today will be a part of that journey in your life.

55
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,200
 A number of months ago, I got a phone call from an old high school friend of mine here

56
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,800
 in Hong Kong.

57
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,880
 We had been in the same high school year group back in Hong Kong for seven years at South

58
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,440
 Island School.

59
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,360
 And so we'd kind of grown up together.

60
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,520
 We weren't like the closest of friends in high school, but we were in the same year

61
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:02,440
 group and we had both lived in Hong Kong post-graduation.

62
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,720
 And so I had stayed in touch with her here and there and I'd seen her here and there,

63
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,000
 but her calling me out of the blue was a surprise.

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,160
 And so of course I answered the phone.

65
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,120
 And as I was talking to her, she explained to me that the reason why she was calling

66
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,800
 was because her father had just passed away.

67
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,040
 And she wanted to know whether I would be willing to do the funeral, to help with the

68
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,720
 funeral, which was of course an incredible privilege to be invited into one of my very

69
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,520
 old school friends' lives in a time of great grief and mourning to help them to walk into

70
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,080
 this kind of memorial funeral time.

71
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,720
 And I remember though, as we were talking about this, I remember thinking to myself,

72
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,840
 I don't think this family is from a place of faith.

73
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,680
 Not that that would necessarily stop me from wanting to do this, but I was curious as to

74
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,660
 why she had asked me to do it.

75
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:58,000
 And so I raised this, that I thought that they were perhaps a family that were not churched

76
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,800
 or from the faith tradition.

77
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,800
 And she said, "Yeah, absolutely."

78
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,680
 And she said, "In fact, my father was a staunch atheist, a strong atheist for the majority

79
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,680
 of his life.

80
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,920
 And one of the things that he loved to do most at the end of his life, in the last few

81
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:18,000
 years of his life, is to debate with Christians to prove them that they're stupid in their

82
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,720
 beliefs.

83
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,240
 And you want me to do the memorial, right?"

84
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,880
 So this is kind of an interesting context, right?

85
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,000
 But I sensed her heart.

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,300
 She didn't know anybody in church.

87
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,400
 She didn't know really many Christians in her life, but she remembered me, that I was

88
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,400
 a pastor.

89
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,600
 And she gave me a call and said, "Hey, I would love you to do this."

90
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,520
 And of course, I was like, "Absolutely.

91
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,080
 I would love to serve you and your family at this time of grief."

92
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,080
 She said, "Great.

93
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,520
 Well, maybe in a couple of weeks' time, we can meet face to face just a few days before

94
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,520
 the funeral, and we can firm up the rundown and everything like that."

95
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,640
 And I'm like, "Yep, great."

96
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:59,240
 So two weeks later, we met here at the Vine, and something absolutely fascinating had occurred

97
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,780
 between that first phone call and meeting her here in the building.

98
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,640
 Her father had been raised from the dead.

99
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,720
 No, that's a lie.

100
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,720
 I just made that up.

101
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,720
 That didn't happen.

102
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:17,560
 I just wanted to see how you would react.

103
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,560
 I'm going on sabbatical.

104
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,360
 I can play with you a little bit.

105
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,240
 That's fine.

106
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,240
 But no, but something fascinating had happened.

107
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,120
 So in that two weeks between when I had first spoken to her and we met, she'd been going

108
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,680
 through her father's possessions, and she had discovered in the possessions a handwritten

109
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,680
 note.

110
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,360
 And because of the way it was written and the date on the back, she knew that he had

111
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,280
 written it just a month before he had passed away.

112
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,720
 Now it was rare for him to write anything down, particularly to write a handwritten

113
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,800
 kind of note like this.

114
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,440
 And when she looked at it, even though she's not from a faith background, she thought that

115
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,720
 what she was reading was potentially a quote from the Bible.

116
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,080
 And so she showed it to me as we met, and I want to show you a photo of it.

117
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,560
 I took a photo of it here, and it's from 1 Chronicles 4.

118
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,960
 Let me read this to you.

119
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:13,080
 "Oh, that you would bless me indeed and enlarge my territory, that your hand would be with

120
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:18,800
 me and that you would keep me from evil, that I may not cause pain."

121
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,940
 So I read this note, and although I've been a pastor for many years, and although I would

122
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:28,360
 say I probably have an above-average understanding of the Bible and its narrative, I really didn't

123
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,200
 recognize this prayer.

124
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,000
 I wonder if any of you in the room recognize it.

125
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,960
 If you did, well done.

126
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,120
 I did not.

127
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,000
 So I had actually opened my Bible and go into the Bible, and then I realized, "Ah, this

128
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,480
 is the famous Prayer of Jabez."

129
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,440
 Has anyone ever heard of the Prayer of Jabez before?

130
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:52,680
 If you're older here, chances are you have, because this little prayer was actually made

131
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:58,880
 famous about 24 years ago when Bruce Wilkinson, a pastor, wrote a short little book called

132
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,200
 The Prayer of Jabez.

133
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,800
 And in the intro of the book, he actually said this.

134
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:09,620
 He said, "If you pray this prayer once a day for 30 days, then you can expect that God

135
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:14,040
 is going to bless you, He's going to enlarge your territory, He's going to enable you to

136
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,400
 have more influence."

137
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,560
 And this book sold like wildfire.

138
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,640
 Because let's face it, all of us want that magical prayer, don't we?

139
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:29,240
 That one thing that we could pray, if we could pray that 30 days, my whole life would be

140
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,880
 changed and I would have more influence and more power and more material goods, and God

141
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,880
 has blessed me.

142
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,960
 And this was the classic kind of name it and claim it book, and it flew off the shelves.

143
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:46,260
 In fact, to this day, it remains one of the only five Christian books that have sold more

144
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,720
 than 10 million copies in the US alone.

145
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,160
 Go into any church, go into pretty much any Christian bookstore anywhere in the world,

146
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,920
 you will see a copy of this book, The Prayer of Jabez.

147
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:04,420
 Now, it is possible that my friend's father stumbled across that book in the last month

148
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:11,200
 of his life, read it, and decided to hand write out that prayer, but I don't think that's

149
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200
 what happened.

150
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,160
 In fact, the reason why I don't think that happened is because of the translation in

151
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,040
 which he writes out this prayer in his own hand.

152
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,080
 It's not the translation that Bruce uses in the book.

153
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:27,120
 In fact, I think it's much more likely that my friend's father recalled this prayer from

154
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,960
 an early time in his life.

155
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:34,280
 He was Dutch and had been raised within the Dutch community before moving to Hong Kong

156
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:38,740
 later in his life, so it's possible that he might have heard this in the school or something

157
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:46,480
 like that, and in his last dying few weeks, recalls the prayer and decides to write it

158
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,400
 out in hand.

159
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,560
 And as my friend gave me the note, she said, "I would love it if you could speak on this

160
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:59,240
 passage at the memorial," and that led me into a time of researching a bit about it,

161
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:05,000
 looking at the scriptures, understanding the passage, and as I did so, not only did I become

162
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:12,640
 more profoundly fascinated and honoring of her father, I also realized that God had something

163
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,040
 deep to say to me.

164
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,240
 And as I open this up for you here today, I wonder, and I hope and pray, that I'll have

165
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,160
 something deep to say to you too.

166
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,680
 Prayer of Jabez is just two verses in the Bible.

167
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,840
 He's only mentioned in those two verses.

168
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:34,120
 It's found in the middle of eight chapters of genealogy at the beginning of 1 Chronicles.

169
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,840
 I don't know if you've read 1 Chronicles much lately.

170
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:42,800
 It's the story, basically, of Israel and their journey up into the Davidic kingdom, and it

171
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:48,280
 traces in the first eight chapters this genealogy of all the kings and all the tribes, starting

172
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:53,400
 with Adam going to Abraham, and then the 12 tribes, and it unpacks all the descendants,

173
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,680
 the generations, flowing out of the kings of those 12.

174
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:03,320
 Now here in chapter 4, where these two verses are found, it's actually found in the tribe

175
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,320
 of Judah.

176
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:10,880
 So Jabez is part of the family of the kings from the tribe of Judah, which tells us something

177
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,020
 straight away, that Jabez was from a privileged background.

178
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:19,200
 He was a son of one of the kings in the generation in the line of Judah.

179
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,800
 He was probably raised in a place of relative prosperity and wealth.

180
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:29,240
 And I want to read you the two verses that we have that captures his story.

181
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,800
 This is 1 Chronicles 4, starting in verse 9.

182
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,880
 "Jabez was more honorable than his brothers.

183
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,360
 His mother had named him Jabez, saying, 'I gave birth to him in pain.'

184
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:45,040
 Jabez cried out to the God of Israel, 'Oh, that you would bless me and enlarge my territory.

185
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,320
 Let your hand be with me and keep me from harm, so that I will be free from pain.'

186
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,680
 And God granted his request."

187
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,160
 Just two verses in the middle of a genealogy.

188
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,920
 If you're anything like me, when you come across the genealogies in the Bible, you're

189
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,920
 like...

190
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:04,080
 But right in the middle of that, we see this fascinating story.

191
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:09,640
 And the first thing we learn is what his mother has gone through and what she does in response.

192
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,920
 Here's the fascinating thing.

193
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:16,680
 We all respond in challenging ways when we've experienced trauma.

194
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,400
 She names her son Jabez, it says here.

195
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,560
 "For I gave birth to him in pain."

196
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:29,360
 The name Jabez, literally in the Hebrew, sounds like the Hebrew word for pain.

197
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,440
 His mother, and we don't know the details because we're not given any more details than

198
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:37,380
 this, but we can assume that her mother had a really bad labor with Jabez.

199
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:42,840
 So bad that the pain and the time and everything that happened, maybe she even almost died,

200
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,840
 we don't know.

201
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:48,960
 But there was so much pain that when Jabez was born, and it was her responsibility to

202
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:56,280
 speak a name, to place a name on him, all she could think of out of her trauma was,

203
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,720
 "This one caused pain."

204
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,720
 That's what his name means.

205
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,560
 "This one caused pain."

206
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:12,520
 And so for the rest of Jabez's life, he's named, he's called the one that causes pain.

207
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,520
 Which shouldn't have happened because when you're a part of a royal family, when you're

208
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,800
 a part of the lineage of the kings, your name that you're given at birth is very important,

209
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,320
 particularly in Hebrew culture.

210
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,460
 And so probably he should have been named for one of his forefathers.

211
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:32,020
 Or perhaps he could be named for a village or an area where a great battle or victory

212
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,900
 happened in the generations of his family.

213
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:38,600
 Or maybe at the very least, he should have been given a name that would actually help

214
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,980
 to project this idea of a character or something that God wants to do in his life or something

215
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,620
 that his parents are longing for.

216
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:51,780
 Instead, out of this woman's deep pain of childbirth, she places her hand on her son

217
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,340
 and she says, "This one caused pain."

218
00:13:54,340 --> 00:14:00,500
 And Jabez for the rest of his life is causer of pain.

219
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:10,840
 The names and the words and the labels placed over us in life hurt us, don't they?

220
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:16,000
 We don't know the details here, but we can assume that Jabez grew up in a place of embarrassment

221
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,540
 and shame because of this name.

222
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:24,640
 Surrounded by brothers who probably had much more regal and better names, he's constantly,

223
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:30,360
 anytime he's called, anytime somebody says his name, anytime he has to introduce himself,

224
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,440
 "Hi, I'm causer of pain."

225
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:41,100
 It's fascinating to me because in the Hebrew understanding of naming something, in the

226
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:46,740
 Hebrew worldview of the Old Testament, they thought that names had materialism to them.

227
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:51,820
 In other words, when you put a name on someone, it was like you were actually literally physically

228
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,600
 placing a mantle on them.

229
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,560
 The word "dabah," which is the Hebrew word for "word," when you speak a word, the word

230
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,340
 suggests a putting on of, almost like you're putting a cloak on somebody.

231
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:08,280
 A little bit like how Ezekiel would get a cloak put on him as a prophet.

232
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:13,320
 When we speak a name in the Old Testament Hebrew understanding, it's a physicality to

233
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,560
 it, a weight to it.

234
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,200
 This is why in the modern days, you remember if somebody says to you, "Oh man, their words

235
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
 had weight."

236
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,000
 Remember how we say that?

237
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,520
 That's basically the Old Testament Hebrew understanding of this idea of what naming

238
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,520
 something is.

239
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:32,440
 So when his mother does this to him, she knows what she's doing.

240
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:37,720
 And she's placing upon him, in her mind, a material reality.

241
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,900
 Not just saying something with an arbitrary meaning, she's placing a material reality

242
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,580
 on them out of the depth of her trauma, she causes trauma.

243
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,540
 She's not the first person to have done it in history.

244
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,980
 She will not be the last.

245
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:57,660
 And Jabez now has to walk in the pain of the reality of this name, shaping his identity,

246
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:04,700
 shaping how he introduces himself, and how he now lives out his life.

247
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:12,780
 And you can almost sense that for Jabez, he's rooted now in a story that he does not want,

248
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,420
 but a story he's not sure how he can get out of.

249
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:18,660
 I wonder if anyone else feels that way here.

250
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:23,900
 I wonder if anyone else has ever said something over you, spoken a name over you, labeled

251
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:31,300
 you in some way that has caused you to live a story you're struggling to get out of.

252
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:40,900
 When I was 14 years old, my chemistry teacher at school told me that I would never amount

253
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,900
 to anything.

254
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:46,180
 His actual words were this, "Andrew, you are a failure.

255
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:49,420
 Keep this up and you'll never amount to anything in life."

256
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:55,700
 I remember that moment vividly, as if it happened literally just yesterday.

257
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,540
 I remember where I was, I remember the smell of the room, I remember what he was wearing,

258
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,660
 I remember what I was wearing.

259
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,860
 And although I didn't like this person particularly very much, and he was right, I was failing

260
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:12,860
 in chemistry, there was something as a 14-year-old that a person in authority said over me, "I

261
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,780
 will never amount to anything."

262
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:22,060
 And although, of course, neither of us were Jewish, there was this impact to me.

263
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:29,240
 That phrase, those words went deep into a 14-year-old that was trying to build his identity.

264
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,300
 And I think to begin with, it was at the subconscious level.

265
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:37,260
 This kind of subconscious level that maybe I'm not going to amount to anything, that

266
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,920
 maybe my life's not going to mean much.

267
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:45,180
 And then when I became a young adult and started to work and move into adult life, it wasn't

268
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:49,580
 subconscious anymore, it became a conscious reality to me.

269
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:53,620
 And I have sat under the power of those words for all of my adult life.

270
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:56,380
 The one thing I have struggled the most with, and I've shared this quite a bit with you

271
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:00,180
 as a church over the years, is insecurities.

272
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:05,820
 Insecurities about my self-worth, insecurities about whether I'm achieving anything or doing

273
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,820
 anything.

274
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:11,380
 I've struggled a lot in my adult life with imposter syndrome, and I can trace it all

275
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:15,900
 back to that moment where he has spoken over me.

276
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:19,820
 And I've realized over the years that those words have done two things, and I wonder whether

277
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:24,900
 this might resonate with some of you who know some words that have been spoken over you.

278
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:31,100
 Those words have crippled me at times, and they have driven me at times.

279
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:37,300
 On the crippled side, those words have sucked confidence out of me, sucked self-belief,

280
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,540
 and I've struggled with self-doubt for so much of my life.

281
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:44,260
 In fact, I can't even tell you, Chris was here for the first service, my wife, but I

282
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:49,260
 can't tell you the number of Sundays where no matter how many people showed up, no matter

283
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:54,500
 how buzzing the worship was, no matter how perhaps impactful maybe the word was, I get

284
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:59,820
 home and I crawl up onto the couch and I feel terrible.

285
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,380
 I feel like nothing really happened.

286
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,380
 Nobody really responded.

287
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,580
 It wasn't that great of a Sunday.

288
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,420
 Oh, why do I even bother doing this?

289
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:10,780
 It's like I'm pushing water uphill, I'm not achieving it, and I'll spiral because I'm

290
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:16,660
 tired and I'm worn out, and I'm entering into some of those deeper places that I have where

291
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:20,540
 there's a brokenness within me because somebody said at the age of 14, "You're never going

292
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:25,980
 to amount to anything," and that has so crippled me that even to this day, I still have days,

293
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:31,240
 it's not every day, okay, but some days where I feel stripped and drained of the confidence

294
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,280
 that I should have as a son of Christ.

295
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,240
 On other days, those words have driven me.

296
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,220
 They've gotten inside of me and they've made me want to push even harder to prove that

297
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,900
 those words are wrong.

298
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:50,260
 And out of the exhaustion of performance and perfectionism, I've tried to create something

299
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:53,300
 that perhaps wasn't there, and I've tried to work really hard because I'm trying to

300
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:59,060
 prove first of all to God, then to myself, then to my family, and then to you all that

301
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:02,420
 actually I have achieved something with my life.

302
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:05,800
 I'm turning 50 next year, and if you're over the age of 50 right here, you can close your

303
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:10,360
 ears right now, but that's really old.

304
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,320
 And I feel really old.

305
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,080
 And I kid you not, I'm having like a midlife crisis, part of the reason why I need to get

306
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,080
 on sabbatical.

307
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,600
 And I'm having a midlife crisis, this is my midlife crisis.

308
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,320
 I'm almost dead and I haven't achieved anything.

309
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,980
 And I kind of say it as a joke, but the reality is deep inside, that is partly how I reflect

310
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,840
 about myself.

311
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:37,800
 I know that I have been weighed down by the materialistic impact of somebody's words.

312
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,920
 And how about for you?

313
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,280
 What has been spoken over you in your life?

314
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,800
 Perhaps for some of you, it was by somebody who loves you deeply and meant well for you.

315
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:53,360
 Maybe a parent who said something maybe out of place of love, but those words, man, were

316
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,760
 not what you needed to hear.

317
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:01,720
 And you've carried those words with you and they've shaped and changed you in some way.

318
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,940
 Perhaps like me, it was a teacher, somebody that you looked up to, an authority figure

319
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,940
 in your life.

320
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,840
 Perhaps it was a pastor, someone like that.

321
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,120
 But somebody has said something and it's changed you and it's hurt you.

322
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,840
 And it's actually over time begun to shape how you think about the world and how you

323
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,620
 think about yourself.

324
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:23,240
 And now you feel like you're under the weight of those words and it's really hard for you

325
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,840
 to break out of the weight of those words.

326
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:33,480
 What names or words do you struggle to be free from?

327
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:39,360
 Jabez struggled to be free from the word that had been placed over him.

328
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,600
 But at some point in his life, he decided to draw a line in the sand.

329
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,120
 We don't know when.

330
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:48,580
 All we get is the naming of him and the impact that had for him.

331
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,880
 And then we get his prayer.

332
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,680
 At some point though, whether it was when he was still young, probably more likely as

333
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:58,520
 he got a little bit older, he decided to draw the line in the sand and take action against

334
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,200
 the thing that had been placed upon him.

335
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:05,200
 And for him, that action, not to hate his mom and his action is to go to God and ask

336
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,360
 for healing.

337
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,360
 It's beautiful.

338
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,480
 This is why it says at the beginning of the passage, he was more honorable than his brothers,

339
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,520
 because he has a heart inside of him to not try to fix things himself.

340
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:21,000
 He's got a heart inside him to realize the only way I can be lifted from the power that

341
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,020
 this name is placed upon me is by bringing it to God and getting healing and restoration

342
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,020
 from him.

343
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:32,560
 He's honorable in his humility to bring action to what has been happening.

344
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,600
 And I want you to see what it says right at the start of verse 10.

345
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,760
 It says, "Jabez cried out."

346
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,000
 The Hebrew word here for cried out doesn't mean like just praised.

347
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,920
 It means from a place of anguish.

348
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:50,320
 He kind of speaks loudly before God from a place of pain, basically, which is really

349
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,080
 ironic because the writer here is trying to help you to see a journey.

350
00:22:54,080 --> 00:23:00,220
 Jabez, the one who is named causer of pain, is in pain himself.

351
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:04,600
 And his pain is because his mom has caused him pain, which is ironic.

352
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:09,360
 She said, "You're the causer of pain," but she's the one who ends up causing him pain.

353
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:15,960
 And in that place of great pain, not health, not great, in a place of pain, he then cries

354
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,960
 out.

355
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,960
 I want you to see how he cries out.

356
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:24,760
 He says, first of all, "Bless me, O that you would bless me and enlarge my territory."

357
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,840
 Remember the context.

358
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,480
 The context is he's a son of a king.

359
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,120
 He's grown up in the royal household.

360
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,760
 He's had privilege from the very beginning of his life.

361
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,960
 He's not crying out to ask God to bless him materially.

362
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:43,000
 He's calling out and asking God to meet him in the pain and the brokenness of the label

363
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,520
 that has been placed upon him.

364
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,160
 And in that, he says, "Would you bless me?"

365
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,760
 In other words, "Would you turn your face to me?

366
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,920
 Would your presence be here for me?"

367
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,280
 This is not a prayer for prosperity.

368
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,760
 It's a prayer for presence.

369
00:23:54,760 --> 00:24:02,960
 God, I need you to be with me because I can't do this anymore, and I'm crushed by the weight

370
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,840
 of the word, the name that has been placed upon me.

371
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,720
 This is why he says, "Enlarge my territory."

372
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,560
 He's not asking for his kingdom to grow.

373
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,800
 He's not asking that he would have more influence in the world and fight bigger battles and

374
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,100
 get bigger influence and get that promotion.

375
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,520
 This is not some materialistic desire.

376
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,800
 What he's realizing is because the name has been placed over him that says, "You're a

377
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:28,160
 causer of pain," it has shrunk his worldview.

378
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,000
 It has shrunk how he sees himself.

379
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,880
 And he doesn't see himself how he should be seeing himself, and he's seeing much smaller

380
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,880
 than he should.

381
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,760
 And so he comes to God and says, "Turn your countenance, your presence.

382
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,760
 Bless me."

383
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,920
 Always about God's presence, primarily in the Old Testament.

384
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:50,480
 "Would you bless me with your presence so that I can have a bigger view of life, a bigger

385
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,000
 view of myself?

386
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,720
 Enlarge the territory.

387
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,800
 Enlarge my way of thinking, my spirit, because I have been crushed."

388
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,880
 And that's what trauma will always do.

389
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,160
 Trauma and names spoken over you will always strip away a big vision and always try to

390
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,120
 reduce you.

391
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:15,440
 Like for me, I'm never going to amount to anything, so why even bother to try?

392
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:22,760
 Javis says, "Enlarge my territory because I realize that I have shrunk my identity down

393
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:26,880
 to the power of the word that was put over me."

394
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,960
 Which is why he then says, "May your hand be upon me."

395
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,040
 In Hebrews, in the present continuous tense, which basically means every single day, now

396
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,540
 and forevermore, I need your hand to be with me.

397
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:42,780
 He's asking for the soles of the feet, not just the king, which is to bless me, enlarge

398
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:43,780
 my territory.

399
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:46,880
 He's saying, "I need you to put your hand upon me every day.

400
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,480
 I want you to be alongside of me, walking with me.

401
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,560
 The soles of your feet, if you will," is how Ezekiel would say it.

402
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,280
 "The soles of your feet be with me.

403
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,960
 I need your hand.

404
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,640
 The hand that is powerful, that can fight battles, that can break chains," because

405
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,320
 Javis realizes there's chains on his heart and he's hurting.

406
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:07,480
 He's saying, "God, would you break the chain?

407
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:13,280
 Would your hand every single day help me in my journey?"

408
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,760
 Then he gets to the crux of his prayer and he prays this.

409
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:24,040
 He says, "And keep me from harm so that I may be free from pain."

410
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:28,640
 This little bit right here, "that I may be free from pain," is what's called by scholars

411
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,280
 a textual variance in the Hebrew.

412
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:36,240
 What that means is that there are various different documents where we drive 1 Chronicles

413
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,040
 from that have words here that are slightly different.

414
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:45,080
 There are two ways of interpreting, looking at the textual variances, what he's saying

415
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,080
 here.

416
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,280
 One is the way it's shown in the NIV, that I would be free from pain, which seems a very

417
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,640
 important thing because he's just told us he's cried out in pain.

418
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,960
 It makes sense at the end of his prayer he would say, "I want to be free from pain."

419
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,040
 I think that's a good prayer.

420
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:04,120
 But as I've studied this text and as I've looked at the documents by which this is drawing

421
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:09,360
 from, I think the way this is captured in other translations is actually closer to what

422
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,280
 was originally intended in the Hebrew.

423
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,680
 You can see this, for example, in the New King James Version.

424
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,440
 Let me put both side by side.

425
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,080
 So NIV on the left, "so that I will be free from pain."

426
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:23,920
 And NKJV interprets this way, "that I may not cause pain."

427
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,680
 And I want you to absorb in your spirit here what Jabez is doing.

428
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:33,640
 I think this is much more textually accurate to what I think Jabez actually prayed.

429
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,420
 And as it comes out in the Hebrew, he's not saying that I would be free from pain.

430
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,840
 He was saying, "so that I don't cause pain anymore."

431
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,080
 What he's saying is, "I don't want to be the name anymore.

432
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:48,520
 If my name is causer of pain, here is my prayer, that I would not live up to the label that's

433
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,480
 been placed on me.

434
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,400
 That I need your freedom to bring me out from the label that has been put on me.

435
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,040
 I will not be my name.

436
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:00,440
 And I need you every single day to bless me, bring your presence towards me.

437
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,920
 I need you to enlarge how I see myself, because I'm not seeing myself properly right now.

438
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:09,160
 And I need you so that I would not cause pain.

439
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,560
 So I'm not going to take the name that has been put on me and allow that to shape who

440
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,560
 I am.

441
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,400
 No, Lord, I'm going to speak in the opposite spirit in this prayer.

442
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:20,200
 And I'm going to ask you, Lord, release me, release me, release me, that I would no longer

443
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,600
 my narrative and my story would not be to cause pain.

444
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:31,840
 My name may stay, remained Jabez, but my narrative will not be linked to my name.

445
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:39,560
 That I may be free from pain, yes, but that I may not cause the pain of others.

446
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:47,360
 I will not be the label my mother put on me.

447
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,760
 Let me paraphrase how I think he's expressing the prayer.

448
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,080
 My mother named me as one who causes pain and I have carried this label around with

449
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,960
 me my whole life, but no more.

450
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,960
 God come and bless me.

451
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,160
 Help me to enlarge the territory of my identity so I do not live out the very name that was

452
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,160
 placed upon me.

453
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,000
 I don't want to be what my name suggests.

454
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,840
 No, Lord, bless me, change me so that I would not cause pain.

455
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:15,100
 This is not a prayer for prosperity.

456
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,460
 This is a prayer for inner healing.

457
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:22,020
 This is a prayer for freedom from the name that was placed upon him.

458
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:26,920
 That's the prayer of Jabez, my friends.

459
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:33,600
 What fascinates me is that my friend's father, who wrote out this prayer in hand, wrote out

460
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,800
 what I would consider is the right translation of it.

461
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:42,800
 Let me show you once again what he wrote at the end, that I may not cause pain.

462
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,680
 It's interesting.

463
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:48,440
 I was talking to my friend about him and his journey in life and she told me great stories

464
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,520
 because I was going to have to represent him at the memorial.

465
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,520
 She told me lots of great stories.

466
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,000
 This man had lived an amazing life.

467
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,120
 He was a person who was a large in the life character that really grabbed life by its

468
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:04,120
 neck and lived out that idea of better to burn out than fade away.

469
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,600
 He was just full on in his life.

470
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,600
 He was an entrepreneur.

471
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,400
 He actually lived in Hong Kong the majority of his life and he had changed and done a

472
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:14,280
 lot of great things for Hong Kong as a city.

473
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:19,760
 But she also shared stories of some of his challenges and some of the things that he

474
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:24,700
 hadn't done well, like all of us here who don't always live the perfect life.

475
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,000
 He had had brokenness in his marriage.

476
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,440
 He had found himself in divorce.

477
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,960
 He had brokenness in his finances and what happened in his finances that actually ended

478
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:38,440
 up causing quite a lot of pain, pain to himself and pain to his family.

479
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:43,400
 I think it's so profound that just a few weeks before he passed, he would write out in hand

480
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,000
 this old prayer that he remembered from when he was a kid and right at the end of it, he

481
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,320
 would say, "So that I may not cause pain."

482
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,560
 I don't know whether he gave his life to Jesus at the end of his life or not.

483
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:59,760
 We have no idea of knowing that, but what I do know is that somehow he found comfort

484
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:06,320
 in an old prayer and he could use it to express something to his daughter who found the note,

485
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:11,080
 "I never wanted to cause you pain and I'm sorry for anything that I've done that may

486
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:15,560
 have caused you pain, that I may not cause pain."

487
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:21,400
 As I step on the sabbatical tonight, I do so because I'm in need of my version of the

488
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,720
 prayer of Jabez.

489
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:29,680
 I realize that as a 14-year-old, I was spoken over in a way that has impacted my life and

490
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:33,360
 my insecurities and how I see myself.

491
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,440
 And it's not the first time that I've recognized this.

492
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,480
 I've had years of therapy and prayer and it's helped hugely.

493
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:44,000
 I've had so many victories and I know standing before you today, I'm way stronger than I

494
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,720
 ever used to be, but I realize I desire more.

495
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,320
 I realize that there's more freedom I want.

496
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:55,200
 I realize that I do not want to carry around any more, even just a little bit of what that

497
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,480
 man said to me when I was 14 years old.

498
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:05,880
 So part of my need for sabbatical is to get away and pray a prayer that ends with that

499
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:13,360
 I would do what it is that you called me to do and never second guess it.

500
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,360
 That's going to be a journey.

501
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,920
 It's not going to be an easy thing to do and that's what my sabbatical is about.

502
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,800
 How about for you?

503
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,800
 In this year of intimacy here at the Vine, what an opportunity we have to a journey of

504
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,800
 inner healing.

505
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:31,520
 And there have been some words and some names that either have been spoken over you, that

506
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:36,320
 you know you struggle to be free from, or that, and we felt this at the end of the first

507
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:44,200
 service, or that you've spoken over yourself, ways that you've come to define yourself or

508
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:49,960
 maybe out of your own traumas or your own past experiences, and you've labeled yourself

509
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:54,600
 a certain way that actually Christ looks over you and says, "That's not who I created you

510
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,400
 to be," or, "That's not who you are.

511
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,920
 There's so much more in you.

512
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:02,160
 You're not a failure as you are currently defining yourself.

513
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:06,640
 You're not one who can't be loved as you're currently saying about yourself.

514
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:11,360
 You're not one who has been rejected or lonely as you think right now about yourself.

515
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,840
 The names we place over ourselves have such awesome depth to hold us captive."

516
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,840
 So whether somebody has said something to you or you know you've said something to yourself,

517
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,200
 either way you know that there's change, you know that there's hurt, you know that there's

518
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,480
 a need for freedom and healing.

519
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:32,160
 That's what my sabbatical is going to be about, but I also pray that that's what this is about

520
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,600
 for you too.

521
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:38,760
 I want to encourage you to just open your heart.

522
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:45,080
 I thought for some of you here, words spoken over you, and you're like Jabez, you're like,

523
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,080
 "Enough is enough.

524
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,520
 They've crippled me and they've driven me.

525
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,520
 I'm going to come.

526
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,920
 Lord, would you bless me?

527
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:55,280
 Would you enlarge the places that I have made small?

528
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:59,160
 Would you be with me every day because I need you every day in this?

529
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:03,600
 And would you enable me to walk in the opposite spirit of the name that has been spoken of

530
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,600
 me?

531
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,600
 I will not accept it anymore."

532
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:13,360
 And I pray as you do that, you will see freedom in your life like never before.

533
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,360
 Here's what I want you to do.

534
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:18,280
 Maybe we could just close our eyes and bow our heads.

535
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,280
 Here's what I want to do.

536
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,840
 I want to lead you in a ministry moment here.

537
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:29,480
 If this has been speaking to you and if this resonates with you, in a moment I'm going

538
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:33,960
 to invite you just to respond by opening your hands.

539
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:38,520
 And opening your hands is just a subtle way of coming before the Lord here this morning

540
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,760
 and saying, "I need this too.

541
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:45,000
 I need my version of the prayer of Jabez.

542
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,600
 I need inner healing from some of the things that have been spoken over me and I'm tired.

543
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,560
 I don't want to carry it around with me anymore.

544
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:57,720
 Or I need freedom from the things that I've been saying about myself.

545
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:02,680
 One of the things that I know in my life, I've been saying I'm old a lot lately.

546
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:07,680
 And honestly I felt convicted by the Holy Spirit this morning because in the view of

547
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:12,600
 eternity I'm really, really, really, really, really, really young in the name of Jesus.

548
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:17,240
 I need to stop cursing myself by saying I'm old.

549
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,120
 And I cut that off right now in the name of Jesus.

550
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,680
 Forgive me Lord.

551
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:27,280
 So Lord, any words that people in this room have spoken over themselves that are not of

552
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,280
 you, Lord, we want to bring those to you too.

553
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:37,840
 So this is for you, maybe just you can open your hands as you're sat and I want to pray.

554
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:43,320
 Father, we are very grateful that we have your presence with us.

555
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:49,280
 We're very grateful that, yeah, through the story of a man who would claim to be an atheist,

556
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:55,360
 we have an entry point into understanding a prayer that perhaps has been misunderstood

557
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,080
 for too long.

558
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:02,520
 And Father, I know that there is a lot that the enemy has done over us and over individuals

559
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,320
 here in this room over years.

560
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:09,080
 Lord, I know that there are people in this room who have carried and are carrying the

561
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:13,800
 wrong identity or the wrong thought about themselves simply because somebody has labeled

562
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,800
 them.

563
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,600
 And you need to know here this morning, you are not your label.

564
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,440
 I'm going to say that again in the name of Jesus.

565
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:23,680
 You are not your label.

566
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,080
 You are not that name.

567
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,480
 You are not that word.

568
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,400
 You are not the label that has been placed upon you.

569
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,920
 You are exactly who God says you are.

570
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,120
 And you are alive in Christ.

571
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:41,040
 And Christ looks at you as a child of His.

572
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,200
 And He says, "You are just as I have created you to be.

573
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:52,800
 And that there is nothing, nothing that I cannot liberate you from."

574
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:58,880
 So Lord, we come to you with our hands open and with the recognition of perhaps for some

575
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,600
 of us years of hurt and pain.

576
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,640
 Lord, we want to pray first of all for your presence.

577
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,600
 Come Holy Spirit, come.

578
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:12,720
 I want to pray that that starting of the Jabez prayer would be for each person here.

579
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,720
 Come and bless me.

580
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,760
 Turn your face towards me.

581
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,120
 Maybe that can just be if your hands are open.

582
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,360
 That can be the starting point of this prayer right now.

583
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:23,080
 Just come before the Holy Spirit and say, "Lord, would you turn your face to me?

584
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,080
 Would your presence be here?"

585
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,480
 It's not like you have to convince Him to do that.

586
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,960
 Of course He's present with you.

587
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,440
 But just in asking Him to bless you, it's an opening of your heart.

588
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,680
 That's the starting point of walking in the opposite spirit.

589
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,280
 "Lord, I ask that you would bless me.

590
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,880
 I believe that I'm a person who deserves your blessing."

591
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,760
 For some of you, that's a breakthrough right then.

592
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,360
 I sense that as I'm praying.

593
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,840
 This is a breakthrough right now in the spirit.

594
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,640
 Just you saying, "Lord, bless me," is a massive breakthrough for you because you didn't think

595
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,760
 you were worthy of His blessings.

596
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:56,440
 Holy Spirit, come.

597
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,040
 I want to encourage you for you now.

598
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,240
 As you've asked God to turn His countenance and His presence towards you, here's your

599
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,240
 next prayer.

600
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,040
 "Lord, enlarge my territory."

601
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:11,480
 Maybe just bring what it is that you know you're carrying, the smallness perhaps, the

602
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,840
 shrinking of your identity.

603
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:19,640
 Yeah, whatever it is that has caused you to think less of yourself.

604
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:23,160
 Not to have big dreams, but small dreams because you don't think you deserve it or you don't

605
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,440
 think you're good enough.

606
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:30,120
 And you've reduced the sphere of your influence.

607
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:33,240
 I want to pray that you would have the faith and the courage to say, "Lord, would you enlarge

608
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,240
 my territory?

609
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,800
 Enlarge my spirit?

610
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,360
 Enlarge my emotions?

611
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:45,120
 Enlarge the way that I think about myself?"

612
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,920
 Then I want you to pray, "Lord, would you be with me every day?

613
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,520
 Father, not just in this moment where it feels good and safe and right, but Lord, tomorrow

614
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:56,400
 morning when I wake up and the kids are crying and I've got to rush to work and it's going

615
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,680
 to be crazy and I would have forgotten everything that happened on Sunday.

616
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,000
 And Lord, in that moment, would you be with me even more powerfully than you're with me

617
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 in this moment?

618
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,520
 Lord, I need you every day.

619
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,440
 I need you to be my strong right arm, my strong and mighty tower.

620
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:16,840
 Your name, not mine, your name would be my rear guard, my yesterday, today and forever."

621
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:28,240
 And in that courage that you've already had, here's the final part of the prayer.

622
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:33,080
 For Jabez, it was, "Man, somebody put a name over me that I'm one who causes pain, so here's

623
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,080
 my prayer.

624
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,440
 Lord, help me not to cause pain."

625
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,080
 For you, if somebody has said to you, "You're not good enough," here's your prayer today,

626
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,840
 "Lord, help me to know that I am good enough."

627
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:50,160
 Or perhaps even stronger than that, you say, "Lord, I declare that I am good enough."

628
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:55,280
 If someone's told you, "You're not lovable," here's your reply, "Lord, I am lovable.

629
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,680
 I am the apple of your eye.

630
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,840
 I believe I'm worthy of being loved."

631
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:04,040
 So whatever is the opposite of whatever that name is that's been placed over you, that's

632
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:08,480
 your prayer of Jabez, and that's your opportunity to come now, just in the quietness of your

633
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,600
 heart, go, "Lord, this for me.

634
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:15,600
 I will not accept what it is that's been said, and I move now in the opposite spirit, and

635
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,480
 I release, Lord, and I say the opposite of what has been labeled me.

636
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,840
 I am not my label.

637
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,320
 I am this as a child of God.

638
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:30,160
 I am this as a child of Christ, and Christ has paid the price on the cross for all of

639
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:37,160
 the brokenness that I seem to be carrying with me, and Lord, would you bring liberation.

640
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:41,160
 Liberation.

641
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:47,160
 Holy Spirit."

642
00:40:47,160 --> 00:41:00,120
 I was going to invite in a second the worship team just to just lead us, but I want to,

643
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:03,800
 I want to ask you just to stay in a place of receiving.

644
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,800
 This is for you today.

645
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,800
 We're going to have the prayer team.

646
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:11,040
 In fact, maybe I could just invite the prayer team just to be at the front already, our

647
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,840
 altar call prayer team, and I want to encourage you.

648
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,840
 This is really important for you today.

649
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,640
 Don't leave here today without getting prayer.

650
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,160
 As much as it's been good for us to go through this as a community, but there's some individual

651
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:26,200
 things that we would love to pray for you about, and there's some of you here where,

652
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:30,520
 you know, just having someone come around you, lay their hands on you, speak truth into

653
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,560
 you, both in the upper house and the lower house.

654
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,040
 If you're outside, you can come in in a moment.

655
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,520
 We would love to stand with you and pray for you, so the prayer team can be available,

656
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:41,280
 and in a moment, if you would like prayer, just come forward any time.

657
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,320
 You don't have to wait until the end of the service.

658
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,320
 Just come forward.

659
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:49,000
 Even right now, if you want to receive prayer, just start to come forward.

660
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,440
 Someone's going to put their hands on you.

661
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,440
 They're going to pray for you.

662
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,920
 We're going to worship together, and we're going to believe that Christ is going to continue

663
00:41:54,920 --> 00:42:00,360
 to set chains free, to restore people's identities, to break off the names and the words and the

664
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:05,160
 labels that have been placed on us, and we're going to do this in an atmosphere of joy and

665
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:10,440
 wonder for a God who loves us so much, and we thank you for that in Jesus' name.

666
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,440
 Would you stand with me?

667
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:16,440
 And like I say, if you want prayer, don't be shy.

668
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,440
 Come on, church.

669
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,240
 We did this a few weeks ago, and people came forward for prayer.

670
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,480
 We'd love to invite you to do that.

671
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,960
 Otherwise, you can continue just to receive

672
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,860
 what He has for you as we enter in this time of worship.
