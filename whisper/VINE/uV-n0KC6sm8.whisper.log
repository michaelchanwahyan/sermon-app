[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Thank you church for worshipping with us,
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.400]   singing songs with us.
[00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.600]   Thank you worship team for leading us so well.
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.520]   Hey, if you take a seat,
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.080]   you can say hello to the person next to you,
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.120]   give them a nice warm Christmasy welcome
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.440]   to our service this morning.
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.980]   So good to be with everybody.
[00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.680]   All right, well it's lovely to see wonderful faces.
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.020]   My name's Ellison, I'm one of the pastors here at the Vine.
[00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.000]   If you're here with us for the very first time,
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.680]   we like to do this at some point during our services,
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.980]   towards the beginning, we want to welcome any newcomers.
[00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.760]   So if a friend has brought you today
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.480]   or if you found yourself coming to the Vine
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.580]   for the very first time,
[00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.080]   if you're joining us online for the very first time,
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.540]   you can drop a comment in the box
[00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.460]   to let us know where you're tuning in from.
[00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.840]   But if you're in this building right now,
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.640]   we'd just like you to give us a wave
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.140]   so we know who you are.
[00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.560]   Any first time comers to the Vine today?
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.840]   Can we see, all right, welcome, yes.
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.800]   Can we see a few hands over here and around the place?
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.000]   Welcome, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.280]   You've chosen a great season
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.560]   to step into the life of this community.
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.000]   If you can see, we're very festive right now.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.920]   There's a Christmas market going on,
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.840]   lots more Christmassy things happening
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.080]   in the next few weeks.
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.760]   And so hopefully you'll continue to come and join us,
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.720]   whether it's the first time,
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.240]   or if you've been here for many, many years
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.480]   like Hudson has now, all right.
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.800]   Okay, hey, on your seats you'll find a little present.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.800]   It's a Christmas prayer calendar.
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.400]   Now you look at it, it looks really nice,
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.840]   it looks really put together and all that.
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.060]   But I wonder if anyone can tell me,
[00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.560]   there's something not quite right with this calendar.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.120]   Can anybody tell me what it is?
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.000]   You're gonna need to use your
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.800]   investigation skills a little bit.
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.880]   - Days of the week.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.800]   - The days of the week, that's right, Bernice,
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.080]   that's right, okay.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.000]   Now, the idea of this calendar
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.920]   is that for each and every day,
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.760]   there's something for you to pray about.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.480]   It's an Advent prayer calendar.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.520]   So we thought this would be a really cool way
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.640]   for the whole church, for the whole community
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.920]   to be praying for the same things on the same day,
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.600]   you know, as an act of unity together
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.280]   as we step into Christmas.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.700]   But it works as a prayer calendar,
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.160]   but it doesn't work as a calendar
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.240]   because the 1st of December actually starts on Thursday
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.120]   and not Wednesday, okay.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.640]   This is what happens when you leave Ellison
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.400]   to design things like this, okay.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.600]   My eye for detail, I apologise profusely.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.200]   Please don't fire me, okay.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.080]   But apart from that though, it's a great calendar, right.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.040]   So you can put up on your wall, on your fridge.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.000]   Just don't rely on it to set dates, to set appointments
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.840]   'cause you will be a day late and a dollar short,
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.060]   as they say, okay.
[00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.960]   But as a prayer calendar, I hope it's a blessing
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.840]   for you and your family.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.000]   It gives you something to pray for.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.600]   And it's, yeah, just something that we thought
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.840]   we would be good for us to focus in on together
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.640]   as a community, all right.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.880]   So this is the prayer calendar gift,
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.320]   if you can call it that, from us to you guys.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.000]   As you see outside as well, there's lots of,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.800]   today's the first week of Advent.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.920]   And coming up in the next few weeks of Advent,
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.360]   there'll be lots of different things happening
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.800]   in the life of this community.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.560]   Today is the Christmas market.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.520]   So you've already seen a few vendors outside.
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.720]   Lots of wonderful things to shop for.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.040]   All the proceeds, this is important for you to know,
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.720]   all the proceeds that are gathered here today
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.040]   will go towards ICM, Inner City Ministries,
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.160]   a mission partner that we work very closely with,
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.040]   with some ethnic minorities here in the heart of Hong Kong,
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.640]   in Jordan, in the Temple Street sort of area.
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.040]   And so, obviously, you've seen some amazing things outside,
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.880]   a mulled wine kit, bags for lazy people
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.160]   who don't wanna wrap gifts, you know,
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.640]   all that kind of stuff, it's really cool.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.000]   So if you have some time after the service,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.920]   please do check out the Christmas market,
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.360]   buy a few things if you're able to.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.920]   It'll be a great way to support
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.720]   the really great mission partners of ours this season.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.280]   Also, downstairs on the first floor,
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.320]   if you don't have to rush off after the service,
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.200]   there's a complimentary photo shoot available
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.040]   for you as well.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.640]   So if you come with a friend, if you come with a family,
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.560]   or even if you're by yourself.
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.520]   I went to the Viva dinner a few weeks ago,
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.160]   and I was by myself, so I had to do
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.280]   this photo shoot by myself.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.720]   No one wanted to take a photo with me,
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.080]   but I still had a good time with it.
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.840]   So even if you're by yourself, go and take a photo.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.480]   It would be something good to remember the season by,
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.480]   but that is available for you downstairs
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.240]   on the first floor as well.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.720]   All right, well, we're here to worship,
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.400]   and we're here to be together,
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.640]   but we're also here to hear from Andrew
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.920]   and from the preacher, which is Andrew today.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:28.960]   And so hear God's word.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.600]   So let's put it together for Andrew
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.120]   and give him a round of applause.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.960]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.800]   - Okay, and Andrew's gonna kick off
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.520]   our new sermon series. - That's right.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.680]   - Lead us into Advent together.
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.520]   - Definitely. - Yes, okay.
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.400]   Any details missing or good, right?
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.840]   - My detail's actually very good.
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.680]   - Yeah, I know, yeah.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.520]   You should've checked the candidate, then, bro.
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.920]   - Not very good. - Yeah.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.560]   - If you'd given it to me, I would've seen it.
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.640]   - I know, yeah. - But you didn't,
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:50.480]   'cause you-- - Okay.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.480]   (audience laughing)
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.040]   - You obviously didn't think at all.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.360]   - I know, sorry, oh.
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.200]   (audience laughing)
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.640]   - Actually, we're a very forgiving church.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:58.800]   I forgive you. - Oh, thank you.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.040]   (audience laughing)
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.680]   - You guys heard it, okay, all right.
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.600]   Well, okay, let's pray for Andrew now.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.760]   Jesus, we do thank you.
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.600]   Lord, we thank you for, yeah, just this time.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.680]   We thank you for your spirit.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.720]   We thank you that we can have hope in our hearts
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.400]   as we look forward to this Christmas season.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.560]   So this message that you've given to Andrew,
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.280]   Lord, may he speak it boldly.
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.600]   May he speak it with conviction,
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.040]   just as you've intended for him to speak it.
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.920]   And Lord, open our ears, open our minds
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.720]   to receive and hear what he has to say.
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.360]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.000]   - Amen, can we not thank Alison?
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.240]   Oh, no, sorry, let's thank Alison.
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.560]   Give 'em a round of applause, we love you.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.960]   (audience applauding)
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.720]   Yes, well, welcome to the Vine.
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.120]   If you are relatively new here,
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.720]   whether in the room or online right now,
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.640]   we are so glad you're here.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.000]   My name's Andrew, I'm one of the pastors here, and welcome.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.360]   We're glad you're present with us.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.200]   I don't know about you,
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.200]   but I woke up not feeling particularly Christmassy.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.920]   You know, it's still November, right?
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.440]   So I came into this room and I was like, ah!
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.360]   And now I feel a lot more Christmassy,
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.680]   and perhaps you do too.
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.200]   But I hope after our time together today,
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.360]   after what I wanna share in my heart with you,
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.280]   that it will help you actually to really experience Christmas
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.640]   as I think it was originally intended to be.
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.360]   And I wanna start my time together with you today
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.960]   actually telling you a story about my family.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:19.920]   It's a story about my family
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.200]   that I've not shared here at the Vine before,
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.240]   but it's one that I think is going to blow your mind.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.800]   My great, great, great, great grandfather
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.040]   was called Francis Cravel.
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.040]   He was born in 1770 in Bosum, England.
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.920]   He was the only son actually to Elizabeth and John Cravel.
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.920]   And Francis ended up marrying his childhood sweetheart.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.960]   Her name was Martha Quennell.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.080]   And they got married in the late '70s.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.120]   And after they got married in the early 1800s,
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.760]   they started to have a family.
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.160]   They actually ended up having four children,
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.120]   one who was called Oliver.
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.560]   And Oliver, I can trace my personal lineage,
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.920]   my personal generational history
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.840]   right the way back to Francis's son, Oliver.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.640]   Now, Francis was not a Christian.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.320]   In fact, his whole family were not believers in his day,
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.160]   something that was a little bit strange in those days
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.840]   as they lived in the UK at a time
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.560]   when there was great revival within the churches.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.240]   But Francis and his family,
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.600]   Martha and the kids were not Christians.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.600]   But on the 5th of November, 1809,
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.520]   Francis had a dream.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:38.760]   And in this dream, he saw a room filled with people.
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.000]   And this room was filled with people
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.080]   who were intently listening to one person.
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.840]   And that person was what he could tell in the dream,
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.680]   a young English man.
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.200]   And he was standing on a small platform
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.880]   just raised off the floor,
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.320]   and he was holding up a Bible in the air.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.080]   Now, this is quite a strange dream for Francis to have
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.240]   given the fact that they weren't, like I say,
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.320]   church-going family.
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.640]   But he could see this dream very clearly.
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.280]   And as the dream continued to unfold,
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.600]   he could tell that everybody in the room
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.760]   that was listening to the young Englishman
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.680]   who was holding up the Bible were foreigners.
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.600]   In particular, he could tell that they were Chinese people.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.880]   After he had this dream, he woke up
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.960]   and he told the dream to his wife, Martha.
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.040]   And they wondered what the dream meant,
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.160]   because again, none of them really knew any preachers.
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.440]   They certainly didn't know any young Englishman.
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:40.440]   And they certainly in those days didn't know any Chinese.
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:45.720]   Now, that dream would have been lost to all history,
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:50.320]   unless of course, Francis himself wrote it down.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.080]   And what is amazing in history
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.600]   is that Francis was an avid diary writer.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.400]   And his diary has been passed down
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.880]   from generation to generation.
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.760]   This is Francis's diary.
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:10.080]   This came to me when my father passed away three years ago.
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.220]   And he gave it to me as is rightfully to be done,
[00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:15.760]   passing down through the family history.
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:20.360]   I wanna read to you Francis's entry on November 5th, 1809,
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:26.360]   some 213 years ago.
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:30.760]   He said this, "The dream seems strange to me.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.880]   For I sense despite my lack of faith,
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.920]   a divine suggestion within it.
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.540]   The young Englishman seemed to reflect me,
[00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:44.080]   or at least a future version of me.
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.160]   And the people listening intently
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:50.680]   also seemed to be in the future, many Chinese people.
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:54.440]   As I awoke and spoke of this to Martha,
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.600]   she said a strange thing.
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.760]   She said, "Perhaps you dreamt of a future time
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.760]   of one of your own blood who will do
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.640]   just as you saw them do.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.860]   It seems to me a great mystery,
[00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.960]   but I am quite joyful about it."
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:17.080]   I mean, could you imagine that God 213 years ago
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:22.160]   would appear to somebody in my generation, my family,
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.960]   bring the word of God to them in a dream,
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.400]   see a young preacher standing, holding the Bible
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.880]   in front of a whole bunch of Chinese people in the room.
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.560]   I mean, is that not the most amazing thing?
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:35.860]   I mean, can you believe it?
[00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:38.780]   (congregation applauding)
[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.980]   It's the most amazing thing.
[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:46.680]   Or at least it would be if it were true.
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.360]   I lied to you.
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.640]   I just made up that whole story.
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.400]   Not one word is true,
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.880]   except for I did have a relative
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.360]   who's the name Francis Kerbal.
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.760]   He was in fact married to Martha Quennell.
[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.120]   They did have a son called Oliver who is in my family line.
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.840]   And this is actually from 1802,
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.120]   but it is a Bible, not his diary,
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.680]   and it is still passed down through my generations.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.840]   Now I know what you're thinking right now.
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.840]   You're thinking, "That guy ripped me off.
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.280]   That was a great story.
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.240]   My emotions were there, right?
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.400]   And I ripped you off.
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:25.000]   I told you a lie and pastors are not supposed to lie."
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.600]   Why did I lie to you?
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:31.800]   Well, it's because I wanted to create in you a feeling.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.000]   That feeling you just had,
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   the feeling that made you clap your hands,
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.500]   the feeling of awe, of wonder, of astonishment,
[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:46.800]   the feeling that God could maybe do something like that
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.480]   through generations and generations,
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:52.000]   that God might give a dream to someone
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.800]   and generations later, that dream might come to pass,
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.240]   the astonishment that we actually have a God
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.880]   who could do something like that,
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.840]   that feeling that you just felt,
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:07.840]   welcome to the very first Christmas.
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.640]   'Cause that was the feeling that they had
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:13.020]   at the first time when Jesus was born.
[00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:16.440]   And the reason why I wanted to start with that
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.420]   is because the reality is that for many of us,
[00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:21.280]   myself included,
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:24.960]   we don't really have that feeling about Christmas anymore.
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.160]   Oh, and by the way, you know that other feeling you felt
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.440]   when you found out I lied to you?
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.560]   You know that one where you rolled your eyes
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.120]   and you felt a little frustrated
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.800]   and there was a bit of latent anger
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.040]   and you were very disappointed that I lied to you?
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.480]   You know that feeling?
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:42.620]   That's the feeling of the first Good Friday
[00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:44.260]   when Jesus died on the cross.
[00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.720]   That's how his disciples felt.
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.640]   In fact, the two disciples on the road to Emmaus
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:52.240]   shortly afterwards were having a conversation together
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.560]   and they said, "We thought he was gonna be the Messiah,
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.520]   but I guess he's just a prophet
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.040]   'cause he's just died on the cross."
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:02.240]   Disappointment, rage, upset, anger.
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.200]   It's fascinating, isn't it?
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:08.260]   The feelings that surround Jesus's ministry.
[00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.900]   And I wanted to begin my talk with you today,
[00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.720]   the first talk of our series of Advent.
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:14.880]   If you're new to church,
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:18.060]   Advent is the four Sundays that run up to Christmas.
[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.360]   Advent in the Latin mean coming,
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:23.160]   and it's the time where we prepare our hearts as the church
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.720]   for the coming of Jesus at Christmas.
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:28.200]   I wanted to start our celebration of Advent
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.360]   by creating in you not the feeling
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.160]   that you normally have at Christmas,
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.880]   but the feeling of the actual Christmas.
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.260]   The feeling that the Jewish people had
[00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.160]   when they were longing for the Messiah to come,
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.460]   and the reality that when he did come,
[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:46.400]   they were like a short intake of breath
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.200]   and were like, "Oh my gosh,
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.840]   everything the prophets had ever spoken about this son,
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.360]   he's actually happened.
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:57.600]   The prophets weren't lying, it actually came true."
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.640]   In my fictitious story of Francis,
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:03.240]   writing it down in his journal for generations to read,
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:06.040]   in our scriptures we hold, don't we?
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:10.320]   So many of these prophetic utterances in the Old Testament,
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.480]   utterances that explain to us the hope
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:17.320]   that God's people had for a Christmas to come.
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.300]   And I want you to think about it this way,
[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.760]   because it's quite interesting for us today
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.840]   in 2022 when we celebrate Christmas,
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:27.400]   'cause for us, the celebration of Christmas
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.880]   is something that happened in the past.
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.380]   It's something that happened over 2000 years ago
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:35.120]   that we now celebrate in the present.
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.660]   But when you read the Bible,
[00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:39.120]   you've got to understand that the majority of people
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.640]   in scripture, for them,
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:42.800]   Christmas was not something in the past,
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.320]   Christmas was something in the future.
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:48.320]   That they hadn't had yet the Messiah come into the world.
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:51.380]   And there was this longing, there was this hope,
[00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:55.000]   there was this desire that God in some point in the future
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.360]   would step into human history and change everything.
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:01.320]   And because they had this longing for desire,
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.480]   when it actually took place, they were like,
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:08.480]   "Ah, it is real, he is here,
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:12.280]   and the world is never, ever going to be the same."
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:16.680]   And if you're gonna celebrate Christmas in 2022,
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.120]   that's the feeling I want you to have.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:22.900]   You wanna celebrate Christmas really.
[00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:26.300]   And look, we love trees and presents and mulled wine
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.400]   and all of that good stuff,
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.020]   and I hope you have amazing Christmas that way.
[00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:33.740]   But as your pastor, I want you to feel Christmas.
[00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:34.660]   I want you to feel it
[00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:37.060]   as the original people were feeling it.
[00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:39.880]   And they were longing for this God to come,
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.100]   because the prophets of the Old Testament
[00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:45.200]   had dreams like my story of Francis.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.500]   They had visions and hopes and they wrote them down.
[00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.260]   And these visions and these dreams
[00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:54.500]   drove God's people forward for over 500 years
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:58.420]   as they waited for their dream to come into reality.
[00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:00.660]   And in the Old Testament, you can read in Isaiah
[00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:03.300]   and Jeremiah and Zechariah and Ezra
[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.340]   and some of the other Old Testament prophets,
[00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:07.660]   as they began to lean forward into the idea
[00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:10.340]   that a day will happen when a child will be born,
[00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:12.820]   and they begin to speak over Israel
[00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:16.260]   some things about the coming of this child.
[00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.300]   And so if you look through the Old Testament prophets,
[00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.380]   you'll hear these words, things like,
[00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:23.140]   "Oh, he's a coming son of man.
[00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:26.540]   He's gonna be a son of man who's going to come.
[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:29.060]   And when he comes, we will know him
[00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.380]   like we've known no one before,
[00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:35.080]   that he will come be born of a virgin.
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.540]   Like this virgin will give birth to him.
[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:38.460]   And when that happens,
[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:39.860]   everybody will know that this child
[00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:43.220]   is the saviour of the world."
[00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:45.780]   And because of this, they began to understand
[00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:47.260]   that if the saviour comes,
[00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.540]   then what that means is that evil will be overcome
[00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:51.940]   with good.
[00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:53.940]   And it will be like when this child arrives
[00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:56.820]   that a light has shone in the darkness,
[00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:58.340]   like a light has come around.
[00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:01.060]   And this child, he will have all authority
[00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:03.740]   sit on his shoulders.
[00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:06.380]   And the prophets began to speak of a name
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:08.060]   that this child would hold.
[00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:11.100]   "Oh, he'll be like a wonderful counsellor,
[00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:14.780]   like a mighty God, an everlasting father.
[00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:16.860]   And ultimately we will come to know him
[00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:20.300]   as the Prince of Peace."
[00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.140]   They understood the prophets
[00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:24.740]   as they began to speak of the coming day
[00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:28.140]   that this saviour would arrive.
[00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:30.060]   They understood that he would come
[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:32.660]   through the reign of David's throne,
[00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:34.500]   that it would come through David's lineage
[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.100]   as the ultimate King of Israel.
[00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:39.900]   And this guy, this child to be born,
[00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:43.260]   he will actually establish justice and righteousness
[00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.740]   on earth for all eternity.
[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:49.380]   It'll be like those who are captives will be set free.
[00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.580]   It'll be like those who are in darkness
[00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:55.020]   will come out like prisoners coming out of the darkness.
[00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:57.900]   And they began to say that when this child is born,
[00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:02.620]   it'll be like the year of the Lord's favour forever.
[00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:06.740]   So all of this stuff on the screen behind me right now
[00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:11.740]   is spoken 500 years before the birth of Jesus.
[00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:15.580]   And all of this stuff helped to form in Israel
[00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:18.900]   their expectations of that very first Christmas.
[00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:22.540]   Sometime in the future, this child will be born
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:25.020]   and not only will he be born as a child,
[00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:27.460]   but when he grows up and through his life
[00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:30.260]   and all that he does, he'll deal with our sin.
[00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:32.580]   He'll actually forgive us and restore us.
[00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:35.100]   We'll be in right relationship with God again
[00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:38.500]   and the world will be just as it was designed to be.
[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.860]   So Christmas for those in the Old Testament
[00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:44.500]   was about one central theme.
[00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:48.860]   The promise of better days.
[00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:56.380]   'Cause when Jesus comes, when this son of man comes,
[00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:59.060]   the world will not be like it is right now
[00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:01.380]   with all of its tensions and sin and destruction
[00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:03.780]   and pain and hurt, but the world will be changed
[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.900]   and transformed in the beautiful renewal of a God
[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:10.900]   who comes down to meet with his people and sets them free.
[00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:15.460]   Oh, and so the people longed for the promise of better days.
[00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:18.880]   Christmas for them was not just a spiritual thing,
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:21.300]   but it had political, social,
[00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.500]   and cultural connection to it.
[00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:24.780]   Christmas for them.
[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:27.300]   The reason why they longed for it so much
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.780]   was 'cause they believed that if God entered the world
[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:32.300]   like this child, then the world would never
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:33.300]   be the same again.
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:36.740]   And I think we've lost so much
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:39.820]   of the original power of Christmas.
[00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:43.140]   There's one thing I want for all of you
[00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:44.960]   over the next four weeks of Advent.
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:49.960]   It's to recapture something of the promise of better days.
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:54.260]   If you're anything like me, that's a good thing,
[00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.060]   because I would like some better days.
[00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:57.740]   I don't know about you.
[00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:00.340]   The world's been a pretty tough place to live in recently.
[00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:01.940]   Hong Kong's been a bit of a challenging place
[00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:03.540]   to live in recently.
[00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:05.860]   Maybe there's stuff going on in your life personally,
[00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:07.820]   things happening in your family.
[00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:09.940]   Maybe it's just stuff going on around you
[00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:12.740]   and you're severe of influence, maybe in your workplace
[00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:14.460]   or the wider sense of your family.
[00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:17.820]   And you would echo that sense of better days.
[00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:20.860]   Oh, I can't wait for 2023.
[00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:24.020]   Like it's gonna be better than now, right?
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:27.060]   And this longing that the Old Testament prophets
[00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:30.520]   placed in Israel for this longing for coming
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:33.620]   for better days had to be held in their spirits
[00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:36.860]   for 500 years, because at the time that Isaiah
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:39.000]   and some of the other prophets finished prophesying,
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.860]   nothing happened, silence for over 400 and something years.
[00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:45.700]   I don't know what it's like for you to wait on a promise.
[00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:47.980]   I can wait maybe about three days.
[00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:52.540]   Imagine having to wait over 400 years.
[00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:56.900]   It's not a surprise then that when the first Christmas
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:01.900]   finally arrived, everybody in Israel was like,
[00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:02.760]   (gasps)
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.620]   that exact feeling I gave you right at the start,
[00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:06.300]   even though I lied to you, not the lying feeling,
[00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:08.060]   but the one before it, okay?
[00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:10.940]   That was the feeling they all had.
[00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:13.320]   And when Matthew and Luke write their accounts
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:15.640]   of Jesus's birth, they wanna try and help us
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.100]   to feel that feeling.
[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:20.400]   They wanna communicate us why Jesus is so important.
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:23.420]   So Matthew in particular, throughout his gospel narrative
[00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:27.280]   of the birth of Jesus, he includes four examples
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:30.560]   of the Old Testament prophetic words about Jesus.
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:33.300]   'Cause in those four examples, he's trying to teach
[00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.400]   the people that will read his gospel
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.360]   what that feeling really is about,
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.480]   what Christmas really is about.
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.280]   That it's not some arbitrary day,
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.240]   it's not just some day where we celebrate something
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.960]   that's happened 2000 years ago,
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.580]   but it's actually a day that fulfills
[00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:49.840]   the Old Testament longing and hope.
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.360]   And so over the next four weeks,
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:54.800]   we're gonna take one of Matthew's four Old Testament
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.680]   sayings, one each week, and we're gonna help you
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:01.120]   to feel really Christmassy.
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:06.120]   And by that, I mean the real Christmas, not the modern one.
[00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:07.960]   Can I have me an amen?
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:11.600]   Let me not lie to you anymore in the name of Jesus.
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:16.960]   And let me read to you the gospel of the birth of Jesus
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.100]   as Matthew tells it.
[00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:21.280]   This is Matthew 1, verse 18.
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.600]   This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about.
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.600]   His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph.
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.400]   But before they came together, she was found
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:32.220]   to be chucked with child through the Holy Spirit.
[00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:34.540]   Because Joseph, her husband was a righteous man
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:37.520]   and did not want to expose her to public disgrace.
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:40.180]   He had in mind to divorce her quietly.
[00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:41.840]   But after he had considered this,
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:45.720]   an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:49.360]   and said this, "Joseph, son of David,
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.700]   do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife,
[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:55.040]   because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.880]   She will give birth to a son,
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:59.740]   and you are to give him the name Jesus,
[00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:03.560]   because he will save his people from their sins."
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:05.120]   Verse 22, note this.
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:08.880]   "All of this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:12.080]   long ago through the prophets.
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:15.760]   The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son,
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:20.760]   and they will call him Emmanuel, which means God with us."
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.040]   Matthew does this amazing thing.
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.920]   He's telling the story about the birth of Jesus.
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:25.980]   He tells about the virgin side of that.
[00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:28.640]   He tells about Joseph trying to be an honorable person
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.200]   and quietly divorcing his wife,
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.040]   not to bring shame on her family.
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:34.000]   And then God shows up in a dream.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.520]   This one really took place.
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:36.680]   I'm not lying to you.
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:37.840]   This dream happened.
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:40.780]   And in that dream, the angel actually says to him,
[00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:42.280]   "No, don't be afraid.
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.240]   Take her to be your wife.
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.600]   Go home together.
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:48.120]   Don't lie with her until you're actually married,
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:50.760]   but you're gonna see this child come through."
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:51.820]   And he says this,
[00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:55.640]   "And this is all to fulfill one of those prophetic words
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:58.200]   that was spoken 500 years ago."
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:02.860]   And then he quotes Isaiah 7, verse 14.
[00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:09.240]   And Isaiah 7, verse 14 starts all of the prophetic utterances
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.600]   about the coming of Jesus.
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.280]   It is the very first
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:16.080]   of what would become many prophetic utterances
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.640]   that would create this messianic hope
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:21.040]   of a child coming in the future.
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:25.200]   And so as we start Advent, may we start in Isaiah 7.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.200]   And I wanna show you what the true Christmas
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.520]   is really all about.
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.400]   Let's start just a little bit earlier
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.800]   so we can get some context here,
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:33.800]   'cause context is important.
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.680]   Isaiah 7, verse 1 says,
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:40.680]   "When Ahaz son of Jotham, son of Uzziah, was king of Judah,
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:46.360]   King Rezan of Aram, and Picah son of Ramiah, king of Israel,
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:49.240]   marched up to fight against Jerusalem,
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.360]   but they could not overpower it.
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.720]   Now the house of David was told this,
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.640]   'Aram has allied itself with Ephraim.'
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:01.000]   So the hearts of Ahaz and his people were shaken,
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.420]   as the trees of the forest are shaken by the wind."
[00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:06.440]   Now, there's a lot of names and places there.
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:08.360]   Let me just pull it all together very simply
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.080]   and tell you what's going on here.
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:12.080]   This is a very important time in Israel's history
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.280]   in the Old Testament.
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:16.040]   At this point, Israel has split into two nations.
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.200]   It's called the divided kingdom period.
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:21.360]   The 10 of the tribes of Israel have gone north
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.080]   to set up a new nation,
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.960]   which annoyingly, when you read the Bible,
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.280]   they call themselves Israel,
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.880]   which confuses you with the previous Israel.
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.640]   But anyway, they're also known as Ephraim,
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.680]   how they're referred to in this passage.
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:34.800]   That's the 10 tribes that went north.
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:38.120]   Two tribes remain south, Judah and Benjamin.
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:41.400]   And they were headed now by a king, King Ahaz.
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:43.760]   And he represented the southern kingdoms.
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.560]   Now, there's a north king and there's a south king,
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.380]   and this gets very game of thrones, okay?
[00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:52.040]   'Cause the king of the north is attacked
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:54.240]   by the Assyrians even further north.
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.280]   And because there's a war happening there,
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:59.840]   the king of the north writes the King Ahaz in the south
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.760]   and says, "Would you come to our aid?
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:05.240]   "Will you come and fight the battle with us and for us?"
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:09.320]   And Ahaz refuses to send his people into war
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:11.360]   for the 10 tribes that are north.
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:15.880]   Now, because of that, the king of the north is upset,
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:17.560]   as you could imagine he would be.
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.120]   And so he decides, "Okay, well,
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:20.400]   "if you're not gonna join us,
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.980]   "we're gonna force you to join us.
[00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:24.220]   "We're now gonna attack downwards.
[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:26.300]   "We're gonna attack into Jerusalem.
[00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:28.620]   "We're going to force your men to come
[00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:31.420]   "and fight our battles."
[00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:34.400]   Now, word of this, that the north are gonna come
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.600]   and attack the south, comes to King Ahaz of the south,
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.780]   and he is filled with fear.
[00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:41.600]   In fact, he's described here in the Bible
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:44.300]   that he is trembling like leaves of a tree
[00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:46.220]   in the wind might tremble.
[00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:49.960]   Not a very nice picture to have in all of history.
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:51.780]   Now, we're told something else about Ahaz
[00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:53.100]   that's really important.
[00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:56.460]   We're told that he's a part of the house of David.
[00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:57.960]   And why is that important?
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.780]   Because the house of David represented
[00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:02.340]   the Davidic kingship through the blood.
[00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:06.100]   Ahaz had been blood related to David.
[00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:08.160]   And scripture will begin to tell us
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.500]   that the coming Messiah would come
[00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.540]   through the bloodline of David.
[00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:14.440]   In fact, right at the birth of Jesus,
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.940]   Matthew starts his gospel with the genealogy,
[00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:20.580]   which goes from Jesus all the way back to King David
[00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:22.700]   through King Ahaz.
[00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:27.100]   So Ahaz is part of the bloodline of the saviour.
[00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:30.060]   And the house of David was supposed to be faithful.
[00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:33.220]   The house of David was supposed to be confident and strong
[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:36.000]   and show their faithful commitment to God,
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.200]   but Ahaz is afraid.
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.940]   I wonder if you've ever had to be faithful,
[00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:43.380]   but you've had to wrestle with fear
[00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:45.340]   in the midst of that faithfulness.
[00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:48.380]   Well, if so, then you're just like Ahaz.
[00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:50.580]   Verse three, notice what happens next.
[00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:51.900]   Then the Lord said to Isaiah,
[00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:56.020]   "Go out, you and your son, Sherjusab, to meet Ahaz
[00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:58.580]   at the end of the aqueduct of the upper pool
[00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:00.660]   on the road to the washerman's field.
[00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:03.980]   Say to him this, 'Be careful, keep calm,
[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:05.660]   and don't be afraid.
[00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:09.220]   Do not lose heart because of these two smouldering stubs
[00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:10.120]   of firewood.'"
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:12.180]   That's the two nations that wanna attack them.
[00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:15.060]   "Because of the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram
[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:16.660]   and of the son of Ramiah.
[00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:20.700]   Aram, Ephraim, and Ramiah's son have plotted your ruin,
[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:22.400]   saying, 'Let us invade Judah.
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.940]   Let us tear apart and divide it amongst ourselves
[00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:27.700]   and make the son of Tebal king over it.'
[00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:30.060]   Yet this is what the sovereign Lord says."
[00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:34.220]   Okay, God shows up to Ahaz, who's trembling scared,
[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:36.620]   and says, "Just chill out, buddy.
[00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:37.900]   I'm with you.
[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:38.900]   I'm here.
[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:40.300]   You don't need to be afraid.
[00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:42.020]   I'm gonna fight some battles with you.
[00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:44.620]   It's gonna be okay, all right?
[00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:46.340]   Yes, they're plotting against you,
[00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:49.300]   but you're not alone."
[00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:50.340]   And he says this to them.
[00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:52.740]   He says, "This, i.e., the attack on you,
[00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:53.980]   will not take place.
[00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:55.220]   It will not happen.
[00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:56.980]   For the head of Aram is Damascus.
[00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:58.720]   The head of Damascus is only Rezin.
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:03.720]   Within 65 years, Ephraim will too be shattered by a people."
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:05.620]   That actually happened, by the way.
[00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:06.920]   Assyria came down,
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.220]   actually defeated the 10 tribes in the north.
[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:13.700]   That happened in 756 years before Jesus.
[00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:14.940]   And he says this,
[00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:16.460]   "The head of Ephraim is Samaria.
[00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:18.740]   The head of Samaria is only Ramiah's son.
[00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:21.200]   If you do not stand firm in your faith,
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.500]   you will not stand at all."
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:24.860]   Ooh, we can preach on that one for a while.
[00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:27.900]   God says to Ahab, "If you don't stand firm in your faith,
[00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:29.540]   you will not stand firm at all."
[00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:32.380]   God is constantly calling his people to faithfulness.
[00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:34.580]   Constantly calling them not to be perfect,
[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:36.060]   not to have it all worked out,
[00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:38.220]   but to be faithful in believing
[00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:40.740]   that God can do the impossible.
[00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:43.020]   Faithful in believing that God could step in
[00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:44.740]   in the worst of circumstances,
[00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:46.180]   and so he says to Ahaz,
[00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:51.180]   "If you just stand faithful, then you will be able to stand."
[00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:53.660]   The question is, did he stand faithful?
[00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:54.580]   Well, let's carry on.
[00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:55.620]   Verse 10.
[00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:57.180]   Is this okay, everybody?
[00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:59.060]   I know it's a lot of scripture,
[00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:02.660]   but track with me 'cause this is about your Christmas.
[00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:04.900]   Verse 10, "Again, the Lord spoke to Ahaz,
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:07.300]   'Ask the Lord your God for a sign,
[00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:09.940]   whether in the deepest depths or in the highest heights.'"
[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:13.420]   God says to Ahaz, "Ask me to act on your behalf.
[00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:15.100]   Ask me to fight battles for you.
[00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:16.100]   Ask of me."
[00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:17.100]   It's like God wants to be
[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:19.060]   in intimate relationship with humanity.
[00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:20.780]   He wants to be in relationship with them.
[00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:23.180]   He wants to have that kind of connection with them,
[00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:25.380]   and so he's saying, "Would you be in communion with me?
[00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:26.820]   Would you just ask me?
[00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:29.100]   Would you actually ask me for a sign?
[00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:30.660]   And if you just simply ask me for a sign,
[00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:31.980]   I will respond to you.
[00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:33.340]   I will act on your behalf.
[00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:34.700]   I will come and fight your battles.
[00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:35.980]   Just ask."
[00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:39.020]   Notice what Ahaz says.
[00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:42.180]   But Ahaz said, "I will not ask,
[00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:45.340]   for I will not put my Lord my God to the test."
[00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:46.340]   Ahaz is so funny.
[00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:47.740]   He's not faithful.
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:49.940]   He doesn't respond in a faithful way to God,
[00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:52.100]   but he tries to hide his lack of faithfulness
[00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:53.380]   behind religious piety.
[00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:56.420]   He quotes the 10 commandments back to God.
[00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:58.500]   He's like, "Those are your rules, buddy.
[00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:00.700]   You said, 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:02.420]   Well, I'm not going to put you to the test."
[00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:04.780]   And it's almost like God is like, "Oh my goodness."
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:06.700]   It's a little bit like when I saw that Advent calendar.
[00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:08.220]   I was like, "Oh my goodness."
[00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:11.780]   It's Ellison again.
[00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:17.820]   His God going, "Oh my goodness," Ahaz.
[00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:20.460]   Like, "Dude, you just had to ask me for a sign.
[00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:23.780]   Thursday, the 1st of December.
[00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:25.380]   That's all you had to remember."
[00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:37.740]   Notice how the Lord responds.
[00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:40.620]   Verse 13, then Isaiah says this.
[00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:41.900]   The Lord's speaking through Isaiah.
[00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:43.780]   "Hear now, you house of David.
[00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:46.780]   Is it not enough to try the patience of men?
[00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:49.780]   Will you also try the patience of my God?
[00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:52.300]   Therefore the Lord himself will act,
[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:53.500]   will give you a sign."
[00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:54.340]   Here's the sign.
[00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:56.460]   The virgin will be with a child
[00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:58.420]   and you will give birth to a son
[00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:01.220]   and she will call him Emmanuel.
[00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:03.860]   Here's the very first mention of the Messiah.
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:06.660]   The very first mention of the coming messianic hope.
[00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:09.580]   The very first time God steps into his people and says,
[00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:11.420]   "If you are not gonna be faithful,
[00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:13.620]   I am still gonna be faithful on your part.
[00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:15.900]   I'm gonna step into your brokenness
[00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:17.380]   and I'm gonna send you a sign."
[00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:18.660]   And you wanna know what that sign is?
[00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:20.620]   The sign's gonna be the most amazing thing
[00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:21.900]   you could ever expect.
[00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:23.500]   I'm gonna take a virgin,
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:25.380]   someone who has never laid with a man.
[00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:26.780]   She's gonna be pregnant.
[00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:28.620]   She's gonna bring forth a child
[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:31.940]   and that child is gonna be called Emmanuel.
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:35.340]   The word for virgin here is the Hebrew word Alma.
[00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:37.140]   It's a very old, rare word.
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:38.900]   It's only used six times in the Old Testament.
[00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:41.340]   It doesn't actually specifically mean virgin.
[00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:43.940]   It means a woman or a girl
[00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:47.100]   who is too young to carry a child.
[00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:50.140]   And so this girl is going to carry a child.
[00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:51.780]   And what basically Isaiah is saying
[00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:55.660]   is God is gonna act in a miraculous, impossible way,
[00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:58.740]   just like we had in that prophetic word from Hudson earlier,
[00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:01.380]   that God can do the impossible.
[00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:03.180]   This is exactly what Isaiah is saying.
[00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:04.700]   God is gonna come in the future
[00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:07.340]   and do something where all we can respond to
[00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:09.660]   is to say, "That's crazy."
[00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:12.860]   In other words, that they will have the same feeling
[00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:15.100]   that you had at the beginning of this sermon
[00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:17.300]   when you were like, "Wow, that's amazing."
[00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:20.620]   Then he says this,
[00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:24.220]   "This child is gonna be known by this.
[00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:27.100]   His name will be Emmanuel."
[00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:32.300]   Now that doesn't sound particularly amazing to us,
[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:34.060]   or perhaps it does sound familiar to you
[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:35.740]   because we sung it in a song earlier,
[00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:38.780]   and we often use that name around Christmas time.
[00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:40.940]   But I wonder whether you've actually ever stopped
[00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:43.580]   to wonder why Isaiah mentions it here
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:46.100]   some 500 years before Christmas.
[00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:48.140]   His name will be Emmanuel.
[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:52.100]   Emmanuel means literally God with us.
[00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:54.780]   Here's the question you should ask
[00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:56.900]   as a good biblical scholar.
[00:33:56.900 --> 00:34:01.900]   Why is God being with Israel important in Isaiah chapter 7?
[00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:04.460]   And why is that also important
[00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:06.620]   when we think about the first Christmas?
[00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:10.540]   Well, we have to wind all the way back
[00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:11.660]   to the beginning of the biblical story
[00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:12.740]   to answer that question.
[00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:14.820]   Are you ready for a bit of biblical history?
[00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:16.860]   I know it's 11 o'clock, you're getting hungry.
[00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:18.540]   You wanna go to lunch and visit the market,
[00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:20.860]   but just stay with me for a few more minutes, okay?
[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:23.140]   'Cause this will blow your mind even more
[00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:26.500]   than my story at the beginning when I lied to you.
[00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:27.940]   In Genesis 1 and 2,
[00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:29.620]   right at the beginning of the biblical story,
[00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:33.540]   we see a picture of what God with us looks like.
[00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:36.300]   See, Adam and Eve were created to be in intimacy with God.
[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:38.540]   They were created to be in His presence.
[00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:41.140]   And God is actually spoken of in Genesis 1 and 2
[00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:44.020]   as walking in the garden with Adam and Eve.
[00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:47.140]   He communed with them in the fullness of His presence.
[00:34:47.140 --> 00:34:51.140]   There was this beautiful intimacy between humanity and God.
[00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:53.540]   So much so that at the end of Genesis 2,
[00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:56.940]   it actually says that Adam and Eve were naked and unashamed.
[00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:58.900]   It wasn't just talking about their physicality,
[00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:01.900]   it was talking about their emotion and their mental state.
[00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:03.980]   It was talking about how they thought of each other,
[00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:05.140]   how they thought of God.
[00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:06.940]   There was nothing between them.
[00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:09.540]   There was nothing to separate them.
[00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:12.580]   There was this complete openness, a brokenness,
[00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:15.460]   a vulnerability between themselves and the other.
[00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:19.620]   It was like nakedness without any shame at all.
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:22.740]   And the Bible describes this as shalom.
[00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:25.060]   The way the world is supposed to be,
[00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:27.860]   the way the world was created by God to be Him
[00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:29.900]   in relationship with Adam and Eve,
[00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:32.500]   walking in that garden, creating intimacy,
[00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:34.220]   where they were naked and unashamed.
[00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:37.380]   It's like God is saying, "This is very good."
[00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:41.060]   And then in Genesis 3, we know what happens next.
[00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:42.380]   Through Adam and Eve's choices,
[00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:44.940]   they bring sin into the equation.
[00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:46.700]   They disobey the obedience of God
[00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:47.860]   and what God had asked them to do.
[00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:49.900]   And they bring sin and brokenness.
[00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:51.820]   And immediately everything is ruptured.
[00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:53.940]   All of that intimacy of Genesis 1 and 2
[00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:55.140]   is completely ruptured.
[00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:57.980]   And suddenly Adam and Eve start fighting against each other,
[00:35:57.980 --> 00:35:59.260]   the first married couple
[00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:01.180]   to have a bickering argument together.
[00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:02.740]   They start blaming each other.
[00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:04.460]   Then they start blaming God.
[00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:06.500]   Then they start blaming creation.
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:08.460]   And all of the intimacy of the relationships
[00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:11.380]   in Genesis 1 and 2 are totally ruptured in Genesis 3.
[00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:14.820]   So much so that at the end of Genesis 3,
[00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:16.740]   a statement takes place from God.
[00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:20.740]   He casts Adam and Eve out of the garden.
[00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:23.220]   And in doing that, it was his way of saying,
[00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:25.180]   because of the choice that has been made,
[00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:26.740]   the brokenness that is here,
[00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:29.260]   there is no longer the ability, because I'm holy,
[00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:31.780]   for us to be present with each other.
[00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:33.780]   And so he sends them out of the garden.
[00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:38.500]   And basically God is no longer with us at that point.
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:40.780]   Are you with me still?
[00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:44.020]   And really the whole rest of the Old Testament,
[00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:46.380]   from Genesis 4 all the way to the end of Malachi,
[00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:49.380]   is a story of a people, Israel,
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:52.460]   longing to be back in relationship with God.
[00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:54.740]   Wanting to be back in relationship with Him.
[00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:57.660]   Wanting to know the intimacy that was there in the garden.
[00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:00.220]   Wanting to feel that naked and unashamed.
[00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:03.420]   Wanting to know what it would be to be in a place of shalom,
[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:05.260]   where everything is good again.
[00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:08.020]   And what you see in the Old Testament narrative
[00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:10.380]   is God's people desiring intimacy,
[00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:14.300]   and God Himself desiring to be close to them.
[00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:17.820]   But because of the sin and the reality of brokenness,
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:20.340]   there's this tension in the Old Testament
[00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:22.540]   between a people that long for intimacy,
[00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:24.740]   a God that longs to be with His people,
[00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:28.500]   and yet now a necessary separation.
[00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:32.860]   So for example, God is with His people,
[00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:35.060]   but now He's a burning bush.
[00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:37.500]   And Moses has to stand at a distance.
[00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:41.020]   God comes as a cloud of fire on the top of Mount Sinai,
[00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:44.220]   but only Moses is allowed to come up and be in His presence.
[00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:47.260]   God comes in a pillar of fire into the tabernacle,
[00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:49.340]   but Israel are not allowed to go into the tabernacle.
[00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:51.100]   They're only allowed to stand outside of their tents
[00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:53.820]   and experience His glory from a distance.
[00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:55.820]   Then God's presence comes into the temple
[00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:57.020]   to the Holy of Holies,
[00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:59.140]   and God is with His people like never before,
[00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:01.460]   but only one person is allowed to go
[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:03.900]   into the Holy of Holies, and only on one day a year,
[00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:05.340]   and only after they spent weeks
[00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:07.220]   cleansing and purifying themselves,
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:08.660]   otherwise they would be consumed
[00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:10.020]   in the Holy presence of God.
[00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:13.020]   So yes, God is with His people,
[00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:15.940]   but He's not really with His people in the fullness
[00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:18.020]   that Genesis 1 and 2 suggested.
[00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:19.420]   Are you tracking with this?
[00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:21.040]   Why is all this important?
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:23.700]   Because by the time you get to Isaiah 7,
[00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:26.540]   Israel has never been in a worse situation.
[00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:29.260]   War, they split up as a nation.
[00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:31.080]   There's now two different nations.
[00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:33.100]   They're dealing and struggling with idolatry and sin
[00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:34.220]   like never before,
[00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:36.020]   and they're wondering what's next for them.
[00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:39.980]   And God breaks into the worst moment of their lives
[00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:42.100]   and their history, and He says, "Guess what?
[00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:43.260]   Here's a sign.
[00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:45.420]   I am sending a child to you,
[00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:50.420]   and he will be known as Emmanuel, God with us."
[00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:53.740]   In other words, it's happening.
[00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:55.260]   It's gonna happen.
[00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:57.580]   I'm gonna restore my intimacy with you.
[00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:00.100]   I'm gonna restore that presence in your life.
[00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:02.380]   You're gonna know what it is to have that awe
[00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:03.700]   and that astonishment.
[00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:05.660]   There is a time coming in the future
[00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:07.860]   where you will know the fullness of the presence of God.
[00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:09.860]   And all of God's people began to lean
[00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:11.760]   into the messianic hope,
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:14.780]   this future long for intimacy with God.
[00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:18.060]   Oh, if this could only happen, if God could come.
[00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:20.980]   And the reason why they wanted that intimacy again
[00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:23.020]   was not just so they could feel nice and fluffy
[00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:24.860]   and like they're floating on clouds.
[00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:28.040]   They wanted the intimacy 'cause they desired shalom.
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:31.380]   They wanted peace on earth.
[00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:33.840]   They wanted victory from their brokenness.
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:36.460]   They wanted victory from all of the danger
[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:38.500]   and the anger and the hurt.
[00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:40.020]   They wanted to be set free
[00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:41.860]   from the things that were chaining them.
[00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:44.100]   They longed to know the goodness
[00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:46.340]   of what it was like in Genesis 1 and 2
[00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:50.060]   to finally experience the goodness and the liberation
[00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:51.380]   and the freedom of God.
[00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:56.380]   So Emmanuel is not just a statement about God's proximity,
[00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:59.520]   it's also a statement of his victory.
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:03.420]   When they heard Emmanuel, God with us,
[00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:05.140]   it wasn't just like, oh, great,
[00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:06.580]   God's gonna come and be with me.
[00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:10.020]   It was, oh, great, there's gonna be victory finally.
[00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:11.180]   I'm gonna know freedom.
[00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:12.340]   I'm gonna know joy.
[00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:14.220]   I'm gonna be set right again.
[00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:15.820]   Are you still with me?
[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:20.820]   Now, all of that sits behind the moment in Matthew,
[00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:27.440]   the moment where God comes and does something crazy
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:29.540]   with a virgin, with a woman
[00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:32.300]   who should not have been able to have a child,
[00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:35.380]   just like Isaiah had prophesied,
[00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:39.020]   to a man who didn't really know what was next
[00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:42.140]   or what to do, to a moment in Israel's history
[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:44.460]   where they are under the greatest oppression and slavery
[00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:47.260]   that they had ever been under in the Greco-Roman Empire.
[00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:52.260]   And God shows up and Isaiah knows it.
[00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:56.140]   Isaiah has prophesied this some 600 years before.
[00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:58.260]   And Matthew takes that prophecy.
[00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:00.000]   And I want you to see what Matthew does.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.020]   This is not arbitrary.
[00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:03.500]   He sees Jesus.
[00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:05.740]   He understands the birth of Jesus.
[00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:07.900]   And he's the first one in all history to go,
[00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:09.620]   hang on a second.
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:12.740]   This is exactly what Isaiah had mentioned 600 years ago.
[00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:14.900]   And he takes the prophecy of Isaiah 7
[00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:16.900]   and he plants it right in his narrative
[00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:17.940]   of the birth of Jesus.
[00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:19.220]   And he's saying, don't you realize
[00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:21.300]   this is Emmanuel, God with us.
[00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:23.940]   He's talking about the incarnation of Jesus.
[00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:26.060]   He's talking about the reality that in Jesus,
[00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:28.220]   we have fully God and fully human.
[00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:31.780]   You see, Emmanuel is not about God being near us.
[00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:35.340]   Emmanuel is about God being one with us.
[00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:38.500]   The incarnation is the representation
[00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:40.700]   of the greatest amount of intimacy
[00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:43.200]   God could ever have with humanity.
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:45.700]   There is no more intimate reality
[00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:48.220]   that you can have than Jesus Christ,
[00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:52.660]   fully God, fully human, now merged completely as one.
[00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:55.420]   That's the power of the incarnation.
[00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:57.400]   That's what we see at Christmas.
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:59.580]   That's the birth of Jesus.
[00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:04.580]   And this incarnation sets everything else on its axis.
[00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:09.460]   'Cause the victory is now here.
[00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:12.500]   Jesus would go on in his life, death and resurrection,
[00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:14.380]   to pay the price for sin,
[00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:17.380]   to stand in the gap as the only perfect sacrifice,
[00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:18.660]   the one to give up his life
[00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:20.020]   so that others could know freedom.
[00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:21.540]   He would, in his resurrection,
[00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:23.340]   show us that death is defeated,
[00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:26.060]   that we are now alive in the greatest amount of living
[00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:27.100]   that we could ever feel.
[00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:28.820]   And yes, we still wrestle with sin.
[00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:31.260]   We still sit in the reality of darkness around us
[00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:33.860]   as we wait for his triumphant return.
[00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:37.300]   But Christmas is God drawing a line in the sand
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:40.580]   and saying, "I am now with you."
[00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:43.020]   You see, what was a messianic hope
[00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:44.620]   for everybody in the Old Testament?
[00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:46.300]   Oh, a time is coming when he comes,
[00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:49.580]   is our present reality.
[00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:50.580]   And this is why,
[00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:53.180]   if we just casually show up for Christmas day,
[00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:54.780]   and we're like, "Yay, Christmas day,
[00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:57.060]   I guess I get presents."
[00:42:57.060 --> 00:43:00.020]   I think God goes, "Oh, come on."
[00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:03.060]   And I think you're more Ahaz than Matthew.
[00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:06.300]   And I want you to feel Christmas again.
[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:08.380]   I want you to own it again.
[00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:10.020]   And here's what Christmas means to you.
[00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:12.820]   You are so privileged to live
[00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:16.300]   on this side of the birth of Jesus.
[00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:18.900]   'Cause for many people for centuries,
[00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:22.180]   he was just a hope, a promise for a better day.
[00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:24.860]   You're living in the better days.
[00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:27.940]   So when you come to Christmas,
[00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:32.940]   you come accepting his presence in all of you right now.
[00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:35.260]   In every single part of you,
[00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:38.260]   in all of your brokenness and your hurt, your messiness.
[00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:40.460]   See, Jesus just doesn't come to you
[00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:42.260]   when you're feeling good about it.
[00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:43.660]   He doesn't show up in your life
[00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:46.780]   when you've got everything worked out nice and neat.
[00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:49.900]   The beauty of Christmas is that he's a present for everybody.
[00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:52.820]   He's here for all humanity.
[00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:56.980]   No matter how dirty or distant you might feel right now,
[00:43:56.980 --> 00:44:00.180]   the fullness of his presence is here.
[00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:05.060]   The promise of better days are your days.
[00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:07.940]   So Emmanuel, God with us.
[00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:09.780]   Emmanuel is not for the religious.
[00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:12.940]   Emmanuel is not for the church.
[00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:15.820]   Emmanuel is not for songs that we sing.
[00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:17.620]   You wanna know what Emmanuel is for?
[00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:19.940]   Emmanuel is for the drug addict
[00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:21.340]   who's struggling to keep his life together
[00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:23.300]   whilst he searches for his next fix.
[00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:26.100]   Emmanuel is for the single mother
[00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:27.940]   who's selling her body in one shot
[00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:29.260]   to provide for her family.
[00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:31.020]   Emmanuel is for the investment banker
[00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:33.220]   who's struggling with suicidal thoughts
[00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:35.420]   because of a position he took on the markets.
[00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:38.820]   Emmanuel is for the refugee family
[00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:41.220]   who's embedded in difficult neighbourhoods in Hong Kong
[00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:43.140]   with racial overtones.
[00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:45.700]   Emmanuel is for your senior pastor
[00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:47.980]   who knows his brokenness,
[00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:51.340]   even amongst his best ability to lead God's people.
[00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:54.460]   And Emmanuel, mostly, is for you,
[00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:58.540]   for your story, for your narrative,
[00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:00.180]   for your narrative, your brokenness,
[00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:02.700]   your great highs, your great lows,
[00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:04.100]   for the great things that are happening in your life,
[00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:05.540]   for the messy things that are happening in your life.
[00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:08.220]   His presence is here.
[00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:11.540]   See, Emmanuel does not mean he is close when you deserve it.
[00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:13.540]   Does not mean he is sometimes close.
[00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:17.020]   It means that he is here, right here, right now.
[00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:19.620]   That victory is yours.
[00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:22.140]   That's Christmas.
[00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:24.100]   That's the feeling I want you to have,
[00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:26.900]   awe, astonishment, wonder,
[00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:30.780]   that you were chosen to live this side of Christmas
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:33.180]   so that you might be able to now walk
[00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:36.340]   with Emmanuel, God, with you.
[00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:39.260]   I wonder whether I could pray for you.
[00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:40.740]   Let's pray.
[00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:41.940]   Father, I thank you so much
[00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:43.820]   for every person here in this room.
[00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:47.140]   I thank you, Lord, for every family represented,
[00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:48.900]   every community represented.
[00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:53.100]   Father, I thank you that each person here
[00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:55.900]   is on the side of better days.
[00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:57.300]   And Lord, it's easy for us to experience
[00:45:57.300 --> 00:45:59.660]   all that we have in Hong Kong in the last three years
[00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:01.780]   and ourselves long for better days,
[00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:03.060]   and perhaps rightly so.
[00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:07.140]   But Lord, we don't have the same longing
[00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:10.740]   that those some 400, 500, 600 years
[00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:13.420]   before the first Christmas held in their hearts,
[00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:15.500]   because we're now walking in the time of your life,
[00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:17.300]   death, and resurrection.
[00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:18.340]   We're now walking in a time
[00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:20.940]   where your Holy Spirit is made available to us.
[00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:21.940]   We're now walking in a time
[00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:24.100]   where it's not just one person, one time a year,
[00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:25.740]   that can go into the Holy of Holies,
[00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:28.500]   but it is every person all the time
[00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:30.380]   welcomed into your presence.
[00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:33.380]   And so, Lord, I wanna pray for that for each person here.
[00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:34.820]   I wanna ask, Father, that you would move
[00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:36.700]   by your Holy Spirit right now.
[00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:38.860]   Lord, I pray that we would start our Advent season
[00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:41.500]   with this declaration of your presence,
[00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:44.100]   of Emmanuel, God with us,
[00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:46.020]   not drawing us back to the garden,
[00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:49.140]   but taking us forward to Revelation 21, 22,
[00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:52.540]   to a new Jerusalem, a time where you will be with us.
[00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:53.740]   There will be no more suffering,
[00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:55.380]   no more pain, no more hurt,
[00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:57.380]   where there'll be healing for all the nations,
[00:46:57.380 --> 00:46:59.780]   where every tribe and tongue will confess
[00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:01.660]   that you and you alone are Lord.
[00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:05.020]   Lord, you are taking us that direction.
[00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:07.100]   Lord, may our celebration of Christmas
[00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:11.260]   still retain the awe and wonder of that first Christmas.
[00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:14.540]   And as we long for better days,
[00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:20.300]   may we not forget that we have our victory here in you.
[00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:24.660]   And Lord, we thank you for this in Jesus' name.
[00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:26.900]   Everyone says, would you stand with me?
[00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:28.180]   And we're gonna respond together
[00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:32.220]   as we sing once again of this incredible victory
[00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:33.380]   that we have in Jesus.
