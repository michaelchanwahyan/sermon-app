1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
 Hey, it's so good to see you.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:09,560
 I don't know why I just pulled my sleeves up because it's actually kind of cold, but

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,560
 I'm ready.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,400
 I hope you guys are.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:20,120
 So when I graduated from seminary, I ended up going to Germany and I was in a church,

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:26,360
 I was a youth pastor, young adults pastor, and I became part of the leadership team.

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:32,760
 So as a leadership team, after a few years, we decided that we are going to go to a leadership

8
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:39,280
 conference to be inspired and to also take some time as a leadership team to discuss

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,720
 some of the direction and vision of the church.

10
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:49,260
 And so here I was at this conference, all these amazing speakers, and after like three

11
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:57,880
 sessions or so, I remember sitting in the big hall against the wall and just really

12
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:07,220
 feeling out of place, really feeling that I don't belong.

13
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:11,600
 But I didn't know why I was feeling this way.

14
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:18,280
 And it wasn't until the evening when the evening speaker shared and spoke that it dawned on

15
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,380
 me what was going on.

16
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:25,020
 So in the evening, the speaker was talking about some of the challenges, some of the

17
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:30,580
 struggles that he was facing and that he was going through.

18
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:35,260
 But he also talked about how God was meeting him, how God was with him and how he brought

19
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:43,140
 him through these challenges and how it was so inspiring.

20
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:50,220
 And then it dawned on me, the reason why I had felt so out of place was because the other

21
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,180
 speakers, they all spoke from a place of success.

22
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,300
 Everything they did turned into gold, so to speak.

23
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,680
 Everything they did worked out perfectly.

24
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,960
 And I was like, that is not my life.

25
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,500
 Not everything that I do is working out perfectly.

26
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:11,200
 Now, don't get me wrong, my youth and young adults ministry was going okay, but there

27
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,860
 were some real challenges that were going on there as well.

28
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:21,760
 What I needed was to hear from someone who has gone through this stuff, who God met in

29
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:29,820
 the midst of that and who knew how to work and walk through that with faith, with courage.

30
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,200
 And so that's what was going on.

31
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,800
 And then once I heard this message, I suddenly didn't feel so much more out of place.

32
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:41,820
 And I'm sure, or I'm very confident, most of us here feel the same way.

33
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:46,620
 What's actually helpful for us is not that people talk about all their one victory to

34
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,740
 the next victory to the next victory and their life is just this upward projective of going

35
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,180
 up.

36
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,460
 But what we need is people who authentically share their lives, their joys.

37
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,900
 Of course, that's inspiring, that's beautiful.

38
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:08,180
 But also their struggles and how God meets them in the midst of that and helps them to

39
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,180
 walk through that.

40
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,360
 That's what I need to hear.

41
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:15,420
 And I believe that that's what we need to hear because our lives, there are challenges,

42
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,220
 there are struggles, there's also victories and joys.

43
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:24,420
 But we need to hear from people who have gone through stuff and who've made it through or

44
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,760
 who've encountered God in the midst of it.

45
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:33,160
 And so I'm excited today because we're going to look at scripture.

46
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:42,080
 And scripture, it doesn't just portray people or characters that have perfect lives.

47
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:49,600
 As a matter of fact, if you read the Bible, you see there's a lot of very messy families,

48
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,840
 super messy families.

49
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,400
 But God works in and through them.

50
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,560
 And one of those peoples is Joseph.

51
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,960
 And so today I'm really excited.

52
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:08,960
 We are going to start a sermon series that we've titled "The Story of Joseph," where

53
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,680
 we're going to look at his life.

54
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:18,040
 And Joseph, he had some very extreme lows, some very painful, some very difficult experiences.

55
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,400
 But he also had some great success.

56
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,760
 So it wasn't just struggle, but he also had some great success.

57
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,080
 And we're going to look at the highs and lows and how Joseph walks through this with faith

58
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,400
 and with courage and how God meets him in all parts of his life journey.

59
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:41,720
 I believe that God wants to speak to us through the life of Joseph.

60
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:49,720
 And as I was preparing the sermon series, I really sensed that God wants to build a

61
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:56,760
 stronger and more resilient and more courageous faith into our hearts, into our lives.

62
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,920
 And I don't know about you, but I want that.

63
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,320
 I want a stronger faith.

64
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,560
 I want to be more resilient when stuff happens that's not the way I pictured or when doing

65
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,280
 what's right doesn't seem to be paying off.

66
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,880
 I want a faith that's strong enough to get through whatever it is that is going on.

67
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:25,360
 And so last year as a church, a lot of our focus has been that Jesus is healer.

68
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,840
 And we're always going to focus on that.

69
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:34,840
 We're the divine church because Jesus continues his healing work.

70
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:42,040
 But part of the healing journey is also growing, maturing.

71
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:48,640
 And so I believe that the series is especially an invitation for a more mature faith, for

72
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:57,320
 growing big people, which is the vision of divine church, for us to attain the full measure

73
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,320
 of the fullness of Christ.

74
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,160
 I think I got that a little bit wrong, but let me get it 100% right.

75
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,880
 Attaining the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.

76
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,880
 There we go.

77
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,120
 That's what Paul says to the Ephesian Christians, because that's what God wants to do with us.

78
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:17,400
 He wants to make us mature followers of Jesus who reflect his character more fully and fully.

79
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,960
 And I believe that through the story of Joseph, that God wants to speak to us and start working

80
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,120
 that into our lives.

81
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,920
 So I'm excited about that.

82
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,960
 Now, before we go into the specific passage for today, I do want to do a little bit more

83
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,800
 background work with you.

84
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,240
 Most of the time we don't do that in as much detail, but today I felt like I need to set

85
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,280
 really the backdrop of the story of Joseph and what that story is located in the book

86
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,280
 of Genesis.

87
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:49,560
 So we're on the book of Genesis, which is the beginning of the first book in the Bible.

88
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,880
 It's a book of origins.

89
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,600
 And this book can be broken down at many different ways, but I just chose a simple structure

90
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,000
 and a threefold structure.

91
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,480
 So it's up here.

92
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:06,440
 There is a prehistory, there's a patriarchal narratives, and then there's a story of Joseph.

93
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,560
 Let me tell you about each of them a little bit.

94
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,680
 So the prehistory is about creation.

95
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,360
 It's about the fall.

96
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,040
 It's about humanity made in the image of God.

97
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:31,120
 But it's also about evil and evil progressing, but a loving God not giving up on his creation.

98
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,220
 So that's the first 11 chapters.

99
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,880
 Then there's the patriarchal narratives.

100
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:45,080
 And this is really where God starts his rescue mission of what was lost in the Garden of

101
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:55,280
 Eden, where God is at work of restoring and redeeming a humanity, a world that has experienced

102
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,400
 the fall, where sin has taken its effect and he wants to restore relationships between

103
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,960
 us and God, relationships between us and others, a relationship between us and creation, and

104
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,640
 relationship even to ourselves.

105
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:19,080
 And so this redemptive narrative starts with a covenant that God makes with Abraham.

106
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:25,520
 And in this covenant, he promises them land, descendants, and blessing.

107
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,360
 So he promised Abraham the land of Canaan.

108
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,920
 He promised Abraham that he will have numerous descendants, that he will be a father of a

109
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,680
 great nation.

110
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:44,420
 And he promises that his people, his ancestors, will be a great blessing to all nations.

111
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:49,200
 And so God sets aside this group of people because he wants them to be an alternative

112
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,480
 community.

113
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,440
 He wants them to reflect his character, his justice, his holiness, and how they relate

114
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,380
 to each other and how they relate to the rest of the world.

115
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:05,640
 And so this promise or this rescue mission is set in motion through this covenant with

116
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,080
 Abraham.

117
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,720
 Then Abraham passes this covenant on to, or God passes this covenant on to Isaac, his

118
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,720
 son.

119
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,640
 And then Isaac passes on this covenant and this promise to Jacob.

120
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,880
 And Jacob is the father of Joseph.

121
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,320
 And this is where we get in the third part of the story.

122
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:33,980
 Now we refer to it as a story of Joseph, but really it is a story about Jacob's family.

123
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:39,880
 Jacob had 12 sons, one daughter that we know of, maybe more, but we only know of one.

124
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:46,780
 But the 12 sons, they start caring for this covenant promise that God has made with Abraham.

125
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:54,100
 And actually, the 12 sons become the, so to speak, founding fathers of the nation, later

126
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,380
 on nation of Israel.

127
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,100
 And so this covenant gets carried forward.

128
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:08,300
 And in the Joseph story, we see that what God has promised, which at first seems so

129
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:14,100
 unlikely that there will be many descendants, that that is now starting to unfold.

130
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:19,900
 And we also see in the story that God's purposes, God's plan, God's word will come to pass.

131
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,060
 You know what he sets out to do, he accomplishes.

132
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:26,100
 Now within the narrative, there's always this challenge and this tension.

133
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,100
 Will this happen?

134
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:31,620
 Will God's promise come to fruition?

135
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:36,300
 And then there is a lot of opposition, but we see that it does.

136
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:43,500
 So that is the book of Genesis and, you know, in the threefold structure of what's going

137
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,500
 on.

138
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:49,940
 And then the story of Joseph takes place as part of this redemptive, grand narrative of

139
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,500
 the Bible.

140
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:56,900
 Now, I also think that it's important, not only that we have this over, you actually

141
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:02,180
 think we need to give you an overview of the story of Joseph, because when every week,

142
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:05,660
 when we look at different parts of Joseph's story, we actually always have to keep the

143
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:11,220
 whole story in mind so that we understand what's going on.

144
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,780
 We have to have the whole picture in mind.

145
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:16,820
 So I'm going to quickly narrate the whole story of Joseph.

146
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:21,200
 And by the way, it's only chapter 37 to 50 in the Bible.

147
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:27,620
 So I'm just going to start reading right now, maybe like in an hour, we're going to be done.

148
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:31,980
 No, I'm going to do it quicker, hopefully.

149
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:37,220
 So here's the story of Joseph in a nutshell.

150
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:42,260
 Jacob loves Joseph more than he loves the other brothers.

151
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,500
 It's his favorite.

152
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,860
 He gives them a special robe.

153
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:49,660
 The brothers are extremely jealous of the father's love, so they decide that they are

154
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,700
 going to kill him.

155
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:55,700
 But instead of killing him, they end up selling him into slavery.

156
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,820
 And then through the slavery, he's brought to Egypt.

157
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,460
 In Egypt, he ends up in Potiphar's house.

158
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:05,300
 He's actually quite successful in Potiphar's house.

159
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:11,460
 But then Potiphar's wife accuses him of attempting to rape her.

160
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,780
 And so then he's thrown in prison.

161
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:17,060
 So just when you thought that Joseph's life might be getting better, it actually gets

162
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,460
 worse.

163
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:28,140
 And in prison, he meets two people from the court of Pharaoh, the cupbearer and the baker.

164
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:31,820
 And he interprets dreams for them.

165
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:36,620
 And he asks the cupbearer to not forget him once he is restored back to Pharaoh, which

166
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:40,300
 is part of his dream interpretation, which comes to pass.

167
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:46,860
 But the cupbearer forgets, and another couple of years pass until Pharaoh has a dream that

168
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,580
 nobody knows how to interpret.

169
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,660
 And so he remembers.

170
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,500
 He remembers that there was this guy in prison.

171
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,620
 And so they bring Joseph to Pharaoh, and Pharaoh interprets the dream of Joseph that there

172
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:07,140
 will be seven years of plenty and abundance, and then a seven-year famine.

173
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:11,420
 And he also comes up with a plan of what they can do, and Pharaoh sees that the spirit of

174
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:15,180
 God is in Joseph, is with Joseph.

175
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,500
 And so he puts him in charge.

176
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:24,820
 He's second in charge of Egypt to implement a plan to not only save Egypt, but then also

177
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:29,540
 to actually save the region, the whole region, from starvation.

178
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:37,060
 And so then Jacob and his sons, the sons are sent to Egypt because they need grain, they

179
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:40,940
 need food, because they have none in Israel.

180
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:47,660
 And so he finds himself suddenly confronted with his brothers who sold him into slavery.

181
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,420
 But they don't recognize him, and he tests them.

182
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,060
 He ends up forgiving them.

183
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:57,540
 He brings the whole family to Egypt, and the family is safe and secure and makes it through

184
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,540
 the famine.

185
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:05,180
 And the promise of God, the covenant promise, is carried forward.

186
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:10,580
 And even the famine cannot stop the promise of God.

187
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,700
 So that's the quick version.

188
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:20,420
 I hope that was quick enough, better than reading.

189
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,980
 But there is, at the end, there's a verse that I think is important for understanding

190
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,980
 the whole.

191
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:31,980
 So Jacob dies, and then his sons start freaking out again that Joseph is going to retaliate,

192
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,380
 even though he already has forgiven them.

193
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,140
 And so they ask him to be his servant.

194
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:39,100
 And this is, I want to read this verse.

195
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,260
 If you've been in church, you might have heard this before.

196
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:48,580
 Genesis 50 verse 20 says this, "You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to

197
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:56,860
 accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives."

198
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:03,540
 So God was working through all the evil, all the horrible things that were happening, and

199
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:11,820
 he brought about his purposes for Joseph, for his family, and he brought out good.

200
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:19,300
 You know, God's purposes, God's plans, they cannot be stopped.

201
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:25,140
 He will accomplish what he sets out to accomplish in our lives.

202
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:28,220
 But anyhow, let's actually get to our passage for today.

203
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,220
 Does that sound good?

204
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,820
 Yes, let's do it.

205
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:36,540
 All right, Genesis 37 verse 2, here we go.

206
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,740
 This is the account of Jacob's family line.

207
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:44,580
 Joseph a young man of 17 was tending the flocks with his brothers, the sons of Bila and the

208
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:50,660
 sons of Silpa, his father's wives, and he brought their father a bad report about them.

209
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:54,020
 All right, Joseph is 17 years old.

210
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:57,620
 A little bit background story.

211
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,420
 Jacob has four wives.

212
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:09,900
 There is Leah, Rachel, which are his main wives, and then there are Bila and Silpa,

213
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,740
 who are basically the maids of Leah and Rachel.

214
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:18,460
 And so Jacob right now is with his half-brothers in the field, and there might be a little

215
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:22,900
 bit of a hint that his father also has sent them there to spy on his brothers, and he

216
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,980
 brings a bad report about them.

217
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:30,860
 Now, I don't know about you, but as kids or even nowadays, when somebody just tells on

218
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:35,500
 someone that usually doesn't go across well.

219
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,980
 You're not making friends, especially if you're telling on your older brother, right?

220
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:42,380
 So he's not making friends, but let's continue what happens next.

221
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,380
 So verse 3.

222
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:48,620
 "Now Israel loved Joseph more than any of his other sons, because he had been born to

223
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:54,380
 him in his old age, and he made an ornate robe for him.

224
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:59,500
 His brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them.

225
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:06,640
 They hated him and could not speak a kind word to him."

226
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:13,580
 So Joseph, he publicly expresses his favoritism for his son by giving him this ornate robe.

227
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:17,300
 Now the Hebrew word for this robe is actually not that clear.

228
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:22,220
 It can mean ornate robe, it can mean long-sleeved robe.

229
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:28,140
 And what that basically means is, this is like the robe of a prince.

230
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:36,840
 Now Jacob's family work is livestock and working in fields.

231
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:42,740
 So if you have a robe like that, you're not the one who most of the time works there.

232
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:47,580
 So he's basically treating Joseph like a prince.

233
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:59,340
 Now as parents, especially if you have multiple children, not just one child, it's easy to

234
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:03,140
 more easily get along with one of your children than maybe over other children.

235
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,380
 You know, if we're just honest, right?

236
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:08,620
 Because we have different temperament, they have different personality, maybe even it's

237
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:13,020
 the gender, maybe you can just more easily relate to the same gender or something like

238
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,460
 that.

239
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,820
 And so that's quite a natural thing.

240
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:23,100
 But what becomes a problem is when this maybe natural ease that you can navigate with one

241
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:29,480
 child when that turns into favoritism.

242
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,980
 And favoritism is actually sin.

243
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,940
 The Bible actually refers to favoritism as sin.

244
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,180
 When we show favoritism, you know, somebody else.

245
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:42,580
 But John Lennox, he's an apologist, like somebody who defends the Christian faith.

246
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,220
 He's also a mathematician, a professor in Oxford.

247
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,940
 And he defines favoritism in this way.

248
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:53,540
 He says, "Favoritism involves preferential treatment of some over others, particularly

249
00:18:53,540 --> 00:19:00,260
 in relations that should be equal."

250
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:05,700
 And then James, Jesus' brother, he says this in James 2.1.

251
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:10,260
 He says, "My brothers and sisters, believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ must not

252
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,140
 show favoritism."

253
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:16,660
 He's actually talking to the church where some of the people were showing favoritism

254
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,260
 to the rich over the poor.

255
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,860
 And he's saying, "Nuh-uh.

256
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,900
 Should treat nobody with favoritism.

257
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,860
 Should all be treated equal."

258
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:29,140
 And that same truth applies whether it's in family, whether it's in the church, whether

259
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,420
 it's in your workplace.

260
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:36,060
 That's what God desires of us.

261
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:39,980
 And so many parents, they put forth an effort.

262
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:44,220
 If they have two children, they put forth an effort of not showing favoritism to the

263
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,580
 child that they may be more easily related to.

264
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,420
 And that's awesome, and that honors God.

265
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,780
 But Joseph is not one of those parents.

266
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,340
 He just shows the favoritism.

267
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:58,660
 He just publicly expresses it.

268
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:04,980
 And it ends up leading his brothers to have this deep hatred and resentment because they're

269
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,920
 not as loved as Joseph is.

270
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,920
 They want that same love, but they're not getting it.

271
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,780
 And so we're told that they're not able, they hated him, and he could not speak a kind word

272
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,780
 to him.

273
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:21,300
 Now, I don't know if you've ever had this experience.

274
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:27,180
 Maybe it's in your family, maybe it's in a workplace where you step into the room and

275
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:30,380
 somebody's just hating on you.

276
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,900
 Everything you do, they have a negative word to say about you.

277
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,140
 Everything you do in their eyes sucks.

278
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,500
 And they let you know.

279
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:46,380
 Or I don't know if this was a thing back in that time where they rolled their eyes.

280
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:52,500
 Or maybe they just sneer at you, or they do that whole sound.

281
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:58,820
 Isn't that a beautiful sound when somebody else makes that sound to you?

282
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:03,380
 I remember when I first came to Hong Kong, and I was unaware of how stuff works, I got

283
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:06,940
 a lot of...

284
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,940
 I don't know what that means.

285
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,780
 I was like, "Why are people making a sound?"

286
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,780
 And I don't know what I did.

287
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:18,180
 Now, it doesn't happen anymore, so I must have learned to avoid that sound.

288
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,140
 But that's like Cold War, right?

289
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:24,300
 You're stepping into a room and your brothers are just hating on you.

290
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,540
 Man, it's horrible.

291
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,140
 What a horrible environment.

292
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:36,660
 And I think we all, in different ways, whether it's at workplace, in family, or whether it's

293
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:43,580
 ourselves even doing it, have experienced the negative effects of favoritism.

294
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:47,940
 Maybe we didn't get the love that we should have gotten.

295
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:55,740
 Maybe we were unfairly treated, that one person always gets a promotion, always gets the boss's

296
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,420
 attention, but we don't.

297
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:02,620
 Or maybe we're the ones who are doing it, who are showing the favoritism.

298
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:08,740
 Because we're not always just the recipients of things, we also have issues ourselves and

299
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,740
 do that as well.

300
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,980
 And as I was praying over this message, I did...

301
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:16,980
 There's a couple of things with that that I sensed that I just want to say at this point.

302
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:21,740
 One of them was, I do believe that we need to examine ourselves.

303
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:28,020
 Is there favoritism that you are showing to someone where you shouldn't do it?

304
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:33,660
 And if you are, whether it's in your family, whether it's at work, whether it's with your

305
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:37,540
 students, actually, we need to repent.

306
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,260
 We need to ask God for forgiveness for that.

307
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:42,300
 We need to start living differently.

308
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,420
 Because when we do that, it just creates a mess.

309
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:49,100
 And it just hurts people, and it doesn't honor God.

310
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,300
 So that was the first thing.

311
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:57,660
 The second thing that I was sensing was that some of us weren't shown the love that actually

312
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:01,740
 we were meant to be loved, especially from our parents, from our mother, from our father.

313
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:09,300
 And I just have this overwhelming sense of God's love for you.

314
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,340
 That He loves you.

315
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,780
 He sees you.

316
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:17,060
 And He wants you to know that love.

317
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:21,260
 Now, interesting, earlier when Chapman was servicing, he was talking about basically

318
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:29,620
 Romans 5.5, where it talks about the Holy Spirit pouring God's love into our hearts.

319
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:35,460
 And I believe that the Spirit of God, if you have not received the love that you were meant

320
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:43,140
 to receive, God wants to pour His Spirit, His love into your hearts.

321
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,820
 That you know you are loved, you are worthy.

322
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,300
 He does see you.

323
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,540
 You have not been overlooked.

324
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:57,860
 And He wants you to know that.

325
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:06,380
 So favoritism brings hurt and pain into people's lives, and it soured the relationship between

326
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:09,260
 Joseph and his brothers.

327
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:14,420
 The brothers projected, even though the father was showing favoritism, but the brothers projected

328
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,780
 their hatred and their anger on Joseph.

329
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,380
 You see, with favoritism, there is no winner.

330
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,820
 Everyone's a loser.

331
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:29,300
 Because Jacob loved Joseph more, but by loving him more, he put him in a really difficult

332
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:34,460
 spot because it destroyed the relationship with his brothers.

333
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:38,220
 The brothers suffered because they didn't get the love they were meant to have.

334
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:42,260
 It's just a mess, and it really just shows how sin works itself out in our lives, in

335
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,800
 our families, in our workplaces.

336
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,620
 So there is no winner.

337
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:53,620
 But let's continue to see how the story unfolds.

338
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:57,660
 Genesis, or continue in verse 5, Genesis 37.

339
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:03,620
 It says this, "Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him

340
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,620
 all the more.

341
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:08,660
 He said to them, 'Listen to this dream I had.

342
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:14,780
 We were binding sheaves of corn out in the field when suddenly my sheave rose and stood

343
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:21,880
 upright while your sheaves gathered around mine and bowed down to it.'

344
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,120
 His brothers said to him, 'Do you intend to reign over us?

345
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,340
 Will you actually rule us?'

346
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:32,280
 And they hated him all the more because of his dream and what he had said."

347
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:38,520
 Now just, I mean, even by the way I read it, you already kind of sense the ridiculousness

348
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,520
 of this.

349
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,440
 But just imagine you're sharing a dream, "Hey guys!

350
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,440
 Hey church, I had a dream!

351
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,960
 And it was me, and it was this sheave, and it stood up to all my sheaves, and all of

352
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,920
 your sheaves started bowing down to me.

353
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,760
 Isn't that a great dream?

354
00:25:53,760 --> 00:26:01,280
 Yay, everybody loves me!"

355
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:06,720
 You know, I don't know who would ever think this is a good idea to share that dream.

356
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,200
 And so they hate him more, and they even respond to it, they understand what it means.

357
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,440
 They respond, "Do you intend to reign over us?

358
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,920
 Will you actually rule us?"

359
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:18,360
 You know, they actually ask that question.

360
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:26,400
 And it just further escalates that hatred and the tension between the family.

361
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,440
 Now I really just wonder, because Joseph is actually about to tell the next dream.

362
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,520
 So you get this, you tell the first dream, and you have this reaction.

363
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:42,120
 I wonder how in the world can you not realize what's going on and tell the next dream?

364
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:45,000
 Like seriously, like really, it's like baffling.

365
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,480
 Like why would you tell the next dream?

366
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,040
 You know, if the first one's already like this, and your brothers respond.

367
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,160
 And I mean there's, you know, three, I think three possibilities.

368
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:58,360
 One of them is he's just oblivious to it, and he just lacks social skills.

369
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:03,520
 You know, the other one is that he's so excited about what God has spoken to him.

370
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:08,840
 That all of that enthusiasm, you know, he shares it, but in that enthusiasm he is not

371
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,600
 aware of how that impacts the brothers.

372
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:15,200
 Or there's some pride, and he's rubbing it in.

373
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,440
 He's enjoying it.

374
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:22,720
 You know, he's pushing, you know, as siblings you know how to push a button from your family

375
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,760
 members to get them upset, so maybe he's pushing a button.

376
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,520
 But in the end we actually don't know.

377
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,040
 The Bible doesn't tell us what Joseph was thinking.

378
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,800
 It just tells us that he told the dreams.

379
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:38,800
 So let's look at the second dream that he shares.

380
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:43,240
 Continuing in verse 9 it says, "Then he had another dream, and he told it to his brothers.

381
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,800
 'Listen,' he said.

382
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:50,580
 'I had another dream, and this time the sun and the moon and the eleven stars were bowing

383
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:53,240
 down to me.'

384
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:58,280
 When he told his father as well as his brothers, his father rebuked him and said, 'What is

385
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,640
 this dream you had?

386
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,840
 Will your mother and I, your brothers, actually come and bow down to the ground before you?'

387
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,440
 So his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind."

388
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:16,720
 Now I think at the very least we can say that Joseph lacked wisdom in sharing this dream

389
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,840
 in the way that he did, or maturity.

390
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,120
 But we see here now his father who loves him.

391
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,720
 He's his father's favorite, and his father rebukes him.

392
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,000
 He says, "What are you thinking, man?"

393
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:38,840
 Well, it's interesting in verse 11 there's a little afterthought, and it says this, "But

394
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:42,300
 his father kept the matter in mind."

395
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:49,080
 So it seems like he doesn't outright disregard what Joseph says.

396
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,880
 And his brothers, they react with jealousy.

397
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,760
 "But his father kept this matter in mind."

398
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:57,240
 It reminds me of Mary when she ponders some of the things that the angel told her.

399
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,240
 So he's pondering these things.

400
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:06,040
 I think we're meant as listeners or readers also meant to ponder, what's about this dream

401
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,560
 from Joseph?

402
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:13,040
 But we're going to actually continue the story next week.

403
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,560
 Pastor Chapman, you're preaching next week, right?

404
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,560
 Yes, okay, good.

405
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,240
 So he's preaching next week.

406
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,680
 We're going to, at this point in time, we've had three things happen.

407
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,560
 We had him tell on his brothers.

408
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,040
 So he's like a telltale, right?

409
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,520
 He's telling on his brothers.

410
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:35,320
 He got the robe, and then he shared his dreams.

411
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,440
 So we're at almost a breaking point, right?

412
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,240
 And a tension in this narrative.

413
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,360
 Stuff is about to escalate, and we're going to look at it next week.

414
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:47,480
 But what I want to do with you, I want to at this point in time ask the question, what

415
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:53,680
 God might be saying to us through this story?

416
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,000
 And so here it goes.

417
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,120
 Every person has a story.

418
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:07,320
 Every person has a family background, a history, every one of us.

419
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:13,120
 And if the Bible would only include family stories of ideal families who do beautiful

420
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:23,560
 things, who turn into incredible men and women of God, I think we would be very discouraged.

421
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,920
 Because our lives are not that way.

422
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,400
 Our families are messy.

423
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:33,640
 Not just the ones we grew up in, but our own ones as well.

424
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:39,480
 Because there is brokenness, there's sin, there's offense, there's hurt, there's pain.

425
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:48,480
 And I'm so grateful that God's Word does this real talk in Scripture.

426
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:59,680
 Because of that, we get to see that God works even in broken families' lives.

427
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:06,120
 And that having a messy family doesn't exclude you from the work that God wants to do in

428
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,760
 your life.

429
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:15,280
 And it doesn't exclude you from the work that God can do to change your life so that you

430
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:19,320
 don't perpetuate maybe what's been done to you.

431
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,600
 Because we carry things ourselves with us.

432
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,440
 You know, that is good news.

433
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,240
 God is a God of messy people and messy families.

434
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:38,720
 Now, the Bible describes family life as it truly is.

435
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:45,800
 Messy and filled with strained relationships, dysfunction, favoritism, envy, and pride.

436
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:49,280
 I should say also good stuff, I didn't put this in here.

437
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,680
 Also good things, right?

438
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:59,000
 Yet it also speaks over God who understands your family background.

439
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:06,880
 And can work in and through the messiness to fulfill his purposes in your life and in

440
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,260
 your family's life.

441
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:13,820
 So how do we connect with God about this?

442
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:16,300
 About ourselves, about our family?

443
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,800
 What do we do?

444
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:23,360
 Well, I want to share a story from my father.

445
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,680
 So I brought a photo, which is scarily old.

446
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:34,280
 All right, this is my family, 1999, we're in the 90s.

447
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:38,720
 And so this is my brother Mark, my mom Mary, so my mom's American, my father Heinz, like

448
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,960
 Heinz Ketchup, he's German, my sister Ruth, and there's me.

449
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,540
 I think you know my name.

450
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:52,800
 And my father, he grew up post-World War II in Germany, just a little bit less than three

451
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,800
 years after that.

452
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,360
 He grew up in ruins.

453
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:01,800
 Just like the Germans bombed other cities and completely flat bombed things, well, the

454
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,480
 Allies did that to Germany as well.

455
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,800
 So he grew up in Frankfurt and was pretty much bombed down.

456
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:11,200
 So he grew up in ruins, he played in ruins, he thought it was normal.

457
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,360
 His family struggled to put food on the table.

458
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:21,240
 Every day there was a question, where will the food come this day?

459
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:26,160
 And he had an unhappy childhood.

460
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,080
 But his childhood doesn't have to do with the ruins, it doesn't have to do with not

461
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,240
 having much food.

462
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:35,640
 It had to do with his relationship with his father, my grandfather.

463
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:43,680
 Because his father himself had not an easy childhood, and so there's this generational

464
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,680
 sin.

465
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:54,960
 I was passed down of anger, and my father was like the rod that got the lightning.

466
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:01,560
 But the anger was targeted towards, he experienced emotional and physical abuse.

467
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:09,240
 And I'm not going to share too much, also don't want to trigger people too much, because

468
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:13,160
 I know that some of you have gone through extremely difficult things yourself.

469
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:18,280
 But one of the stories he recounts often, or recounted often, he passed away quite a

470
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:26,160
 while ago, is that while the family was eating together, he was not allowed to eat with the

471
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,160
 family.

472
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:36,640
 They made him eat outside on his own to let him know that something was wrong with him,

473
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:42,000
 that he was not really part of the family, that he was being punished.

474
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,080
 And so he had to eat on his own.

475
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:47,920
 Just think of it as a child.

476
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:52,680
 If you're told that there's something so wrong with you, that you're not even allowed to

477
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:56,320
 eat with your family.

478
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,640
 You know, but that's real life.

479
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,640
 That's family life.

480
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,960
 Family life is messy.

481
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,600
 There's brokenness.

482
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:11,040
 So when he married my mom, he didn't want to repeat that cycle of anger that was so

483
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:16,920
 destructive that made his childhood so difficult, where he doesn't have a positive memory of

484
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,920
 his childhood.

485
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:25,560
 He didn't want to repeat that.

486
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:31,120
 The way he did that was through his relationship with Jesus.

487
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:38,360
 Because he invited Jesus into his life, and he asked God to meet him, and to provide for

488
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:44,680
 him, and to help him not to repeat that, because there was also something there in him, in

489
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,680
 my father.

490
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:54,680
 And so even though he didn't have a loving father, and he never experienced that from

491
00:35:54,680 --> 00:36:02,400
 a human father, he was a loving father to me and my siblings.

492
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:11,680
 And it was because of the love of our heavenly father that he was able to break the cycle

493
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:17,640
 of anger, and of emotional, and of physical abuse.

494
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,600
 Now I don't want to pretend my father was perfect.

495
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,600
 He was not.

496
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:26,160
 You know, just like every family, I have some stuff to work through, too, right?

497
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:32,520
 Because I don't want to hold him up as just what I said the Bible does not do.

498
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:38,400
 But he was a loving father, and he did not abuse us emotionally or physically.

499
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,960
 And so praise God.

500
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:49,160
 What an incredible testimony to that where you begin in life does not have to determine

501
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,440
 where you end up in life.

502
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,920
 Because if you invite God into your life, he can change the trajectory of your life,

503
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,080
 where you do not have to repeat, you do not have to continue in the patterns that were

504
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,680
 set by your parents.

505
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:11,240
 And he can break the power of sin and of brokenness in your life, and he can set you on a different

506
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:19,400
 trajectory.

507
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:25,400
 So God works in and through your life, no matter what your family background is, if

508
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:29,400
 you are surrendered to him.

509
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:34,420
 So if you did not receive the love that you were meant to love, if that was your starting

510
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:40,540
 point in life, that does not determine that that's where your life needs to finish.

511
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:42,840
 Because God can pour out his love.

512
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,460
 He can show you his love, the Father's love.

513
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:51,080
 He can place other people in your life that can show you love that you did not receive.

514
00:37:51,080 --> 00:38:02,120
 And so God, he's inviting us, all of us, people with broken lives, people with messy families,

515
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:07,360
 messy backgrounds, to surrender to him and to ask him to come to our lives and break

516
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,840
 these patterns that cause so much pain.

517
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:18,160
 I want to invite the worship team to come up.

518
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:25,720
 Don't think that your less than perfect family situation will keep God from moving and working

519
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,520
 in your life.

520
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:35,840
 And when God works in your life, what he starts, he will bring to completion.

521
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:41,400
 Just like we see with a covenant promise, what he promised to Abraham, he is bringing

522
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,400
 to completion.

523
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,840
 He will move forward.

524
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,800
 God's purpose is God's plan in your life.

525
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:52,880
 It cannot be stopped when you live a life in relationship with him.

526
00:38:52,880 --> 00:39:01,900
 And so I just want to do something very simple at the outset of the story of Joseph.

527
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:09,000
 I want to invite you, if you're like, "I need change in my life.

528
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,520
 I don't want to repeat what my father has done, what my mother has done.

529
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:18,280
 I don't want to repeat that pattern."

530
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:22,480
 You can stretch out your hand as a symbol of saying, "Jesus, I want to surrender my

531
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,920
 life to you.

532
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,280
 I want to surrender this situation to you because I need you to come into this situation

533
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,160
 and I need you to meet me.

534
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:35,000
 I need you to provide for me because I don't want to continue.

535
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,160
 I need change, Lord.

536
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,320
 I need something to change.

537
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,400
 I need your love to work in my life.

538
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,400
 I need hope."

539
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:54,880
 So I want to invite you to stand all right now.

540
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,720
 God changed my father's life.

541
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:03,080
 God changed Joseph's life, as we're going to see throughout the series.

542
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:11,880
 God has changed my life and he for sure can change your life.

543
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:16,720
 You know, whatever is going on is not the end point of your story.

544
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,720
 God has something new.

545
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:21,720
 He has something better for you.

546
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:26,800
 But he's inviting you right now to turn to him, to place your trust in him, to open up

547
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,960
 your life to him and say, "Lord, come into my life, work in my life, move in my life

548
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,680
 by your spirit, by your power because I need change.

549
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,760
 I need you to move, Holy Spirit.

550
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:43,600
 I need to know your love that was not shown to me.

551
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:48,600
 I need to find healing."

552
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:53,160
 So if that is you, I want to encourage you to stretch out your hands before you and I

553
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:57,040
 just want to pray over you right now.

554
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:04,600
 Jesus, I thank you so much for every single person here.

555
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:13,800
 Thank you that you are the God who works with messy and messed up people and messy families.

556
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:19,880
 That our mess is not the end point, but Lord Jesus, that you can come in, that you can

557
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:26,920
 turn chaos, you can turn something that is messy into something beautiful.

558
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:31,560
 And Jesus, I thank you for every outstretched hand right now.

559
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:40,720
 I pray that by your Holy Spirit, you'd fill your people right now.

560
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:47,160
 That you would fill your people right now with your love, with your hope.

561
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:52,720
 And that as your word says that if anyone is in Christ Jesus, he is a new creation.

562
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,200
 The old is gone, the new has come.

563
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,540
 Lord, we declare this newness right now.

564
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:03,200
 That what this pattern in our families was, what this hurt was, the old is gone, the new

565
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,720
 has come.

566
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,800
 Thank you, Jesus.

567
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,040
 Thank you, Jesus.

568
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:15,280
 That you are the perfecter of our story.

569
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,600
 That with you, our story takes a turn and it turns beautiful because of who you are.

570
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:25,900
 Not because of us, not because of perfection, but because of your grace, because of forgiveness,

571
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:26,900
 because of your mercy.

572
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:32,280
 So Holy Spirit, will you pour out your mercy over us right now.

573
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:43,240
 We say we need you, we long for you, we desperately desire for you to work in our lives.

574
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:50,220
 And we trust and we believe that something has shifted now.

575
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:56,040
 That this is a fresh start, a new beginning.

576
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:59,600
 Jesus, we give you all the praise.

577
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,480
 So I pray this in the name of Jesus.

578
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,480
 Amen.

579
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,640
 Amen.
