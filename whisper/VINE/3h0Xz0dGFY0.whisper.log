[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680]   Now, one of the most common questions when you go to a job interview
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.920]   is describe a challenge you faced and how you overcame it.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.480]   Now, I'm curious to hear who here has been asked that question in a job interview.
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.240]   All right, so a few people. Okay.
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.920]   Now, I myself, when I interview people, actually do ask that question as well
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.360]   because I want to hear what challenges has this person faced,
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.320]   how did they deal with them, were they resilient,
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.400]   did they figure out a way to solve the problem, are they adaptable,
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.000]   do they have a positive mindset about what's going on?
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.640]   And there's also something telling when you don't have anything to share,
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.760]   like when there is no challenge that you can think of.
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.120]   And so for me, that's one of the questions I asked.
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.920]   But work challenges is one thing and they can be a major thing.
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.840]   But what about all the other things in life, all the other challenges that we face?
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:11.480]   And I'm actually wondering what challenges you are facing right now.
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:17.600]   You know, what are some of the things that you are walking through that are not that easy?
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.120]   And how are you doing with coping with those things?
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.600]   Are you confident and you're like, yeah, I'm going to tackle this,
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.160]   you got that fight in you and you're dealing with it?
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:35.880]   Or has this thing been grinding and going on and you're actually worn out and tired?
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.400]   And maybe there's some despair with what's going on.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.040]   You know, is there faith? Does your faith play a role in how you navigate this?
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.880]   Or even like, God, where are you?
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.000]   Like, what are you doing here? Why am I going through this?
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.080]   And so what I want to do with you in the sermon series, in this message today,
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.560]   is I want to explore with you the question, how do you respond to life's challenges and setbacks?
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.400]   You know, how do you do that?
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.240]   And we're going to look at what does God's word have to say to us
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.600]   about dealing with challenges and setbacks in our life?
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.760]   And how might he encourage us today and speak to us so that we can face,
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.320]   you know, whatever it is that we're going through, that he can give us some guidance,
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.120]   some perspective on how to go through that.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.200]   And I want to also say, if you're not going through a challenge, praise God, right?
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.360]   That's awesome.
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.720]   But this is also, I think, helpful for as you help other people
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.200]   who are facing challenges right now to walk with them through that.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.000]   So I think there's something here for everyone in this message.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.280]   So we're going to continue in our sermon series through the book of,
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.080]   or it's not actually the book of Genesis, it's the story of Joseph.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.400]   And so this is the fourth sermon in the series.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.960]   And we're picking up at a point where Joseph's life is not working out
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.920]   the way he probably dreamed or hoped for.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.760]   So he went from being the favorite son, who had privilege, who had position,
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.960]   who had a special robe.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.920]   He went from that to getting all of that stripped from him.
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.440]   Like actually the robe literally taken from him, betrayed cold-bloodedly
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.840]   by his brother, sold into slavery.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.080]   And so he's on the way to Egypt in a caravan.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.920]   And we're going to pick up the story when Joseph arrives in Egypt.
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.480]   So let me take you to Genesis 39, we're starting in verse 1, it says this.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.640]   Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt.
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.880]   Part of an Egyptian who was one of Pharaoh's officials,
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.600]   the captain of a guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites,
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.480]   who had taken him there.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.400]   The Lord was with Joseph, so that he prospered.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.360]   And he lived in the house of his Egyptian master.
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.800]   When his master saw that the Lord was with him, and that the Lord gave him
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.920]   success in everything he did, Joseph found favor in his eyes and
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.640]   became his attendant.
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.960]   Potiphar put him in charge of his household, and
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.600]   he trusted to his care everything he owned.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.400]   From the time he put him in charge of his household and all that he owned,
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.080]   the Lord blessed the household of the Egyptian because of Joseph.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.800]   The blessing of the Lord was on everything Potiphar had,
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.720]   both in the house and in the field.
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.040]   So Potiphar left everything he had in Joseph's care.
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.200]   With Joseph in charge, he did not concern himself with anything,
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.760]   except the food he ate.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:44.040]   Now, this is a quite impressive way that Joseph seems to be dealing with
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.960]   these adverse circumstances that he's in.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.200]   And I don't know if you know these social media posts where people,
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.200]   like they post a picture and they say, caption this.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.400]   Anyone?
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.560]   You've seen those, right?
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.440]   Are you one of the people who actually comments on that,
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.600]   who writes a caption?
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:09.880]   So if you picture Joseph's life right now, I mean, he's a slave in Egypt.
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.160]   He's in a foreign country.
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.720]   His life is totally not turning out the way he pictured.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.600]   And we look at this as a picture, and we'd say, caption this.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.840]   What caption would you write over his life?
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:28.760]   Is it like, the fall of Joseph?
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.240]   Or Joseph in the pit?
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.800]   I mean, those are the captions probably that, if we're honest,
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.680]   that we would write over his life, right?
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.000]   So it's fascinating that the biblical narrator,
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.920]   that he gives it quite a different caption.
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:55.320]   Cuz he says, the Lord was with Joseph, so that he prospered.
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:02.800]   That's the caption that the narrator puts over Joseph's life at this point in time.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.920]   Now, that's crazy.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.200]   I mean, how we're supposed to understand this?
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.520]   He's in the most undesirable circumstance.
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.800]   I mean, he's in slavery.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.960]   He's fallen low.
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.760]   How can this be true?
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.120]   And if you think of your own life, like when we're doing well,
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.240]   maybe we would put that as a caption over our life.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.760]   The Lord was with Tim, when everything was working out perfect and well.
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.240]   But we wouldn't put that over those times when we're going through a difficult time,
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.480]   or at least not it would be the first thing that would come to our mind.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:44.360]   But the narrator, he alerts us to a truth.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.840]   And this actually goes back to the covenant promise that God has made with
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.560]   Abraham, with Isaac, with Jacob.
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.280]   And that covenant promise is now also true for Joseph.
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.800]   That the Lord is with Joseph.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.600]   He has not abandoned him.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.840]   He is not alone.
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.280]   He's with him, even in that darkest moment of his life.
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.360]   So the Lord was with Joseph.
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:21.200]   Now, the narrator also highlights something else that's absolutely fascinating.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:27.000]   In verse three, it says, when his master saw that the Lord was with him.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:34.240]   How do you see when you look at somebody else's life that the Lord is with him?
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:41.760]   What does that life look like if somebody looks at you in your workplace,
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.840]   or in your home, even in your family?
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.720]   How do they see that the Lord was with you?
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:54.920]   That there is this tangible difference in your life that they can see that.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.920]   And so part of her sees this in Joseph's life.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:02.840]   And again, this is remarkable because he just went through this traumatic,
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.320]   difficult experience.
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.320]   But yet he's somehow carrying himself differently.
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:14.520]   That it stands out to part of her that the Lord was with him.
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:18.080]   I mean, he's observing him in the workplace.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:23.960]   And there must have, so part of her must have been one of the wealthiest people
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:24.520]   in Egypt.
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:25.840]   So this is like a huge household.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.960]   There's a ton of people there.
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.600]   And Joseph sticks out.
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.480]   Now we're told that one of the reasons why he sticks out is because everything he
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.000]   touches prospers.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.240]   So there's that aspect, but that is not everything.
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:41.160]   There's more to it.
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:45.760]   Joseph is seeking to honor the Lord, to give him glory with his work.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.840]   Again, that's remarkable.
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.040]   It would be so understandable if he had a bad attitude, right?
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.240]   I mean, you just had this horrible experience.
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.960]   You're in a place you don't wanna be.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.600]   You have a job you didn't choose.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.000]   You just have to do it.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.200]   And it'd be easy to just have a bad attitude, right?
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.160]   But Joseph doesn't have a bad attitude.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:10.200]   He's carrying himself differently, and part of her notices that.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:15.200]   And then we're told that in verse five, it says,
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:25.840]   you know that God brought prosperity to part of her in the house and in the field.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:29.280]   So that means that every aspect of part of her business, he was flourishing.
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.440]   And the only thing he had to concern himself with was what he was gonna eat.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.280]   Now that's an incredible employee, right?
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:39.920]   If you have somebody working for you, and the only thing you have to be concerned
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:44.160]   about is what you eat, because you know that person is gonna take care of what
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.200]   you need, what needs to be taken care of.
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:51.640]   And I don't know about you, but for me, when I think of my own life,
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:58.960]   and I just wonder, are people able to see that the Lord is with me in my life?
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:02.520]   Is there a tangible difference that they can observe in my life?
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.080]   I want that.
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.600]   I hope that.
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.280]   Probably sometimes, maybe not always.
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:10.520]   And what about you in your workplace, in your family?
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:14.320]   Is that something that people can observe,
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.080]   that the Lord is with you by the way you carry yourself?
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:22.320]   But let's see how things continue.
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.640]   So things seem to be going quite well, right?
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:29.320]   They're on the uppity up with Joseph, but let's continue in verse six.
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.680]   Now Joseph was well built and handsome.
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.960]   Now the Bible usually doesn't comment on looks that much, but
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.680]   in this case they do.
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.400]   So you know if the Bible says it's true, right?
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.920]   [LAUGH] So he must have been a good looking guy.
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:48.600]   And after a while, his master's wife took notice of Joseph and
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.120]   said, come to bed with me.
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.320]   But he refused.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.360]   With me in charge, he told her.
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.520]   My master does not concern himself with anything in the house.
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:00.960]   Everything he owns, he has entrusted to my care.
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.160]   No one is greater in this house than I am.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:09.160]   My master has withheld nothing from me except you, cuz you are his wife.
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:13.560]   How then could you do such a wicked thing and sin against God?
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:19.760]   And though she spoke to Joseph day after day, and
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.880]   he refused to go to bed with her or even be with her.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:28.520]   Now just think of this situation.
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:33.760]   Every day at work, somebody who is more powerful than you
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.680]   is trying to pressure you to go to bed with him.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.400]   I mean, she's like super straightforward, right?
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:40.480]   Like it's kind of shocking.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:44.440]   For ancient context, you would think they wouldn't do that.
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.160]   But they're like, hey, sleep with me.
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:50.880]   And we have to remember also the power dynamic.
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:51.920]   Joseph is a slave.
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.520]   He's not an empowered person.
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.640]   Yes, he's in charge of all these things, but
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.160]   he's still not in the position of power.
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.480]   So there's a huge power dynamic between part of his wife and Joseph.
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:05.440]   So there might be sexual temptation.
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:06.280]   We don't know.
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.440]   We're actually not told clearly.
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.760]   I mean, he is a single guy.
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.760]   Maybe there was that.
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:16.440]   But I think the thing that is there for sure is the pressure from somebody who's
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.440]   your boss telling you what to do.
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.520]   And then you have a choice to make.
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.680]   Am I gonna do what my boss is asking me to do?
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:28.040]   And then maybe I can get away, just stay in my position, stay okay.
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.240]   Or do I say no?
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:33.960]   And so we probably have experienced something like that in our workplaces
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.960]   where somebody asks us to do something that's not right.
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.520]   And we're faced with this choice, are we gonna do it to please that person,
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.600]   to maybe keep our job?
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:46.880]   Or are we gonna do what honors God, but there might be a cost to it for us?
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:50.880]   So again, it's like a very real life example.
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.920]   We also have these temptations in the workplace.
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.080]   We also have these pressures in the workplace.
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.720]   And what does Joseph do?
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:00.200]   Well, he says no to her advances.
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.840]   He basically shuts her down and he explains to her, hey,
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.200]   your husband hasn't trusted everything to me.
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.200]   I don't wanna break that trust from your husband.
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.000]   And then even worse, I don't wanna sin against God.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.280]   I wanna do what honors God, what gives him glory, what gives him praise.
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:21.120]   But part of his wife, she does not take no for an answer.
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:25.400]   Every day, she's pushing him to go to bed with her.
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:30.000]   I mean, what a horrible, difficult work environment and experience.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.920]   But let's see what happens next, and let's continue in verse 11.
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:37.720]   One day he went into the house to attend to his duties, and
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.640]   none of the household servants was inside.
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:44.280]   She caught him by his cloak and said, come to bed with me.
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.880]   But he left his cloak in her hand and ran out of the house.
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:52.360]   When she saw that he had left his cloak in her hand and had run out of the house,
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.560]   she called her household servants, look, she said to them,
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:14:00.200]   this Hebrew has been brought to us to make sport of us.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.600]   He came in here to sleep with me, but I screamed.
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:08.320]   And when he heard me scream for help, he left the cloak beside me and
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.640]   ran out of the house.
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:14.720]   She kept his cloak beside her until his master came home.
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.840]   Then she told him his story.
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:21.320]   The Hebrew slave you brought us came to me to make sport of me.
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:26.880]   But as soon as I screamed for help, he left his cloak beside me and
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.440]   ran out of the house.
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:32.520]   When his master heard the story, his wife told him,
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:35.800]   saying this is how your slave treated me.
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:39.960]   He burned with anger, and Joseph's master took him and
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:45.200]   put him in prison, the place where the king's prisoners were confined.
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:54.360]   So Joseph suddenly finds himself in the house alone with part of his wife.
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.840]   And apparently he's been trying to avoid that.
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.400]   Maybe she's cleared out everyone, we don't know.
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.280]   And this time, instead of even just proposing for
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:06.840]   him to come to bed with him, she actually tries to grab him, tries to pull him in.
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:10.520]   And then he again does the right thing.
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:15.360]   He flees, runs out, but the cloak is left behind.
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:20.360]   And then she cites a scream, and she calls a servant and she tells a lie.
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.120]   She doesn't tell the truth of what happens.
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.760]   She's covering up for herself.
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:27.600]   And also I think it's a way of getting to Joseph because he's not doing what she
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:28.320]   wanted him to do.
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:33.480]   And so it's interesting in how she tells a story.
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.800]   It's really twisted.
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.280]   The first thing she calls him this Hebrew.
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:41.040]   Instead of calling him Joseph, she gives him a label.
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:44.400]   It's a little bit like saying this immigrant, or something like that.
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.800]   Where it stirs some emotions for
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:50.080]   some people that are not positive towards a group of people.
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:54.200]   So she's doing that to try to win over some of the other people in the house.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:58.720]   Then the second thing he says is that he tried to make sport of us.
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:03.240]   So it's not just like he tried to make sport of me.
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.880]   When she talks to the servant, she's saying he tried to make sport of us.
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:06.840]   Now what does she mean by that?
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:14.120]   It's like Joseph's attempt to rape me is really an attempt to mess with all of us.
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:15.600]   That's what she's saying.
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:20.800]   And she's trying to rally the servants behind her with what she's sharing.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:23.000]   And then the husband comes home.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.280]   And it's also interesting what happens there because she talks about
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:31.480]   this slave that you brought here.
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:37.040]   It's about who, so she's of course blaming Joseph for
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:41.640]   what supposedly happened, but she's also putting responsibility on the husband.
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.040]   It's like you brought this guy in our house.
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:46.000]   You're responsible for this.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:52.080]   And then we were told that Joseph, he responds with anger.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:58.360]   That's also interesting because who is he angry at?
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.120]   It's actually not clear.
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:05.120]   And so the biblical scholars, as I was preparing for the sermon,
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:10.800]   some of them believe that he actually didn't fully believe his wife.
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:14.640]   And the reason is because he didn't put Joseph to death.
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:17.200]   Cuz he could have put him to death.
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:23.800]   But he put him in prison, which seems like for his position and
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:28.280]   who Joseph was, a surprising move.
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.800]   And so there's some ambiguity around who did he really believe.
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:34.080]   But he had to do something because his wife makes this claim.
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.360]   He couldn't ignore it even to save his own face in front of everyone else,
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.040]   his whole household.
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:41.920]   Now just imagine Joseph's life.
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:46.280]   So he, because of evil of his brother, he's brought into slavery.
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:50.320]   He has these horrible experiences.
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:55.480]   And then now, just when things seem to be going better, he sinks even lower.
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:56.480]   It even gets worse.
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.800]   Now he's accused of something he didn't do.
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.200]   He doesn't have a chance to defend himself, and he is in prison.
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:06.320]   Now let's continue reading a story, and
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:09.080]   we're actually gonna finish here our section in scripture.
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.400]   So continue in verse 20.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:14.440]   But while Joseph was there in prison, the Lord was with him.
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:20.120]   He showed him kindness and granted him favor in the eyes of the prison warder.
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:24.800]   So the warder put Joseph in charge of all those in the prison.
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:28.960]   And he was made responsible for all that was done there.
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:32.840]   The warder paid no attention to anything under Joseph's care.
[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:39.280]   Because the Lord was with Joseph and gave him success in whatever he did.
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:46.160]   Now this is again incredible because the caption over even this yet
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:49.840]   lower point in his life is again, the Lord was with Joseph.
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:52.880]   How can this possibly be?
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:58.000]   And then in addition to it, actually we're also told that
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.200]   the Lord, he showed him kindness.
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:06.240]   Now the word for kindness is actually a lot stronger.
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:09.960]   It's a lot richer than what it reads.
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.800]   It's the word hased, the Hebrew hased.
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:17.560]   It means loving kindness, steadfast love, tender love, faithful love,
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.440]   unfailing love, compassion, mercy, kindness, and loyalty.
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:28.680]   And so God is showing Joseph hased in this darkest moment of his life.
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:32.600]   He's shown him this kindness, this faithfulness,
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:38.840]   this loving kindness in this pit, in this dark place.
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:41.640]   That's incredible, that's amazing.
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:49.800]   And we wonder, no, there's one thing about theoretically affirming that.
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:55.800]   But there's another thing when you actually can feel that hased love and
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.720]   actually receive and know that it's true,
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:01.120]   that you are not alone, that God is with you.
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:05.120]   And so then we're again told that Joseph prospers,
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:08.000]   that he's put in charge of everything, he does an amazing job.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.920]   The water doesn't have to worry about anything.
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:13.400]   And so that's where we are gonna leave off the story.
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:20.240]   But all of this, in the story there's two major temptations that Joseph faced.
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:24.920]   The first temptation is the very obvious one that we already talked about,
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:27.000]   putt of fur, whether it's giving in to work pressure,
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.080]   whether it was a sexual temptation, whatever it was.
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.920]   That was the one we already looked at.
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:36.040]   But I think there's actually a stronger and more powerful temptation
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.120]   throughout this narrative,
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.960]   the sexual scripture that we looked at that Joseph faced.
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:43.360]   And that's the temptation of despair.
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:47.040]   Now what do I mean by that, temptation of despair?
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:53.560]   Well, when you're doing what's right, what honors God, and
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:57.960]   then stuff just gets worse, and
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:04.040]   things don't turn out the way you hoped for, it's easy to despair.
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:07.520]   It's easy to get so discouraged.
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:11.520]   You're like, does it even make sense?
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.680]   Do I even wanna still follow God?
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.120]   Do I even still wanna do what's right?
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:20.280]   And we become hopeless, we become discouraged.
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:25.400]   So that's the temptation of despair, and I think that throughout this,
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:28.640]   I mean, this temptation is right there.
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:33.280]   And this brings me back to the question I asked at the beginning of the sermon.
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:36.000]   How do you respond to life's challenges and setbacks?
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.840]   What do we do?
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:45.040]   Joseph, he didn't just have one setback, he had multiple setbacks.
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.880]   And how do we handle that?
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:53.000]   I think it's so difficult to resist that temptation,
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.160]   just give up and say, screw it, forget it, whatever, I'm done.
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:03.640]   God, I've given you my shot, I'm just done.
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:09.680]   And then to be angry, and just to be frustrated.
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:15.240]   And I wonder, of course we don't have access to this, but
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:18.680]   I wonder what Joseph's inner dialogue in his mind was.
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:23.880]   God, I served you, even when you brought me into slavery,
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.520]   I was faithful to you, I did what was right, I did what honors you,
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:27.640]   even though it was hard.
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:31.280]   And then you bring me here and it's even worse.
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:38.520]   So we can only imagine what dialogue Joseph would have had, but
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.440]   we might know what dialogue we have, right?
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:47.200]   And some of us here, we're going through setbacks and challenges,
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:51.040]   and there's also this temptation of despair.
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:59.400]   The temptation to just say, I'm done, I don't have anything in myself anymore.
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:05.720]   And I don't wanna, we struggle to trust and
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:12.080]   believe that God is good, we struggle to trust that he's good.
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:14.520]   And that he means it well with our lives.
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:18.080]   And we're just at this point of being defeated.
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:22.160]   But there is some encouragement in this passage for us.
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:25.680]   And I wanna share two things at the story of Joseph.
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:30.240]   For those of you who are finding yourself right now in this moment of
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:35.880]   temptation of despair, to encourage you to hold on, to keep trusting in God,
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:38.120]   to keep walking with him, and I wanna share those two things with you.
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:44.320]   The first one is, I believe that God gives us integrity and character tests.
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:52.160]   I mean, Joseph went through some testing of what was in there.
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:58.200]   And the tests, I think they're not so much for God, I think they're more for us.
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:05.080]   That we even can see what's inside of our heart or maybe what's not there,
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:08.040]   and then what God's inviting us to go towards.
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:14.280]   Now we cannot always control what happens to us in our lives.
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:17.720]   Sometimes we make dumb choices or not smart choices and
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.320]   we find ourselves in difficult situations.
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:22.000]   But then still we still have to deal with it.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:29.080]   And then other times things happen to us, like we didn't do anything, but
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.160]   life just happens to us.
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.840]   And so we can't control those things.
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:35.160]   But what we can control is how do we respond?
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:38.680]   How do we choose to respond to what happens to us?
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:41.400]   How do we choose to respond to the situation that way?
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:44.160]   And even if it was of our own causing, you can't change that now,
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.360]   it already happened.
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:46.840]   But how do you respond now?
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:51.520]   Are we gonna remain faithful to God?
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:55.880]   Or do we turn from him, blame him in anger for what we're going through?
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:25:02.720]   God allows you to go through difficulties because he wants to build a more mature
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:05.440]   character and faith into your life.
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:11.680]   He wants to build something more resilient, something stronger inside of you.
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:18.640]   Now James, the brother of Jesus, in his letter to Christians spread throughout
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:22.480]   the Mediterranean world, Christian communities, so James 1, verse 2,
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:23.240]   he says this.
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:26.960]   Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters,
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:29.760]   whenever you face trials of many kind.
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:33.720]   Because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance.
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:38.320]   That perseverance finishes work so that you may be mature and complete,
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:39.880]   not lacking anything.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:45.960]   So as Christians, when we face trials, it says here, and
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:48.160]   it sounds a little crazy, consider it joy.
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:51.560]   It's like, I don't know if that's usually our response.
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:56.520]   But I always wanna be clear what that not means.
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:59.600]   It doesn't mean that we have to rejoice in the evil thing that has happened.
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:01.560]   That's actually not what it's saying.
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:06.320]   What we rejoice in is who God is, who can take this evil thing and
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:09.360]   he can turn it into working something good into our lives.
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:11.880]   That's what we're having joy over.
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:13.400]   Big difference, right?
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:13.920]   I think so.
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:16.800]   And so we have this choice.
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:22.560]   Do we say yes to this refining work of God in our lives?
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:26.080]   Do we submit to it?
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:27.360]   Do we wrestle with God?
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:31.520]   Do we pour our heart to him, cry out to him, but stay engaged with him?
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:35.760]   And let him work something inside of our heart,
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:38.120]   a faith that is greater than we've ever had.
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:43.400]   Faith that is stronger, that is more resilient.
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:47.000]   A maturity, a character that looks more like Jesus
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.400]   than the one that we've been holding prior.
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:54.800]   Or do we go through this and
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:27:03.520]   just say we get angry, we blame God, and we don't engage in that process.
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:07.680]   And we're just frustrated, we're angry, and that's all we're doing.
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:14.760]   And I think we can all have sympathy for either response, right?
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:18.240]   Because difficult things are happening.
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:22.800]   But the story of Joseph really encourages us to lean in so we can experience and
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:25.960]   actually see God's goodness, that we can see God's faithfulness.
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:30.080]   That when we go through the refining process, that we can come through on
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:34.040]   the other end and give a testimony to what God has done in our life,
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.120]   what he has worked in our hearts.
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:40.200]   But you're only gonna see it if you're willing to go through it with God.
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:44.920]   Cuz just going through trial doesn't mean you automatically,
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.000]   God does something in you.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.960]   It's when we're submitted to him, when we're wrestling with him.
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:56.200]   That's when he builds in that perseverance, that maturity into hearts.
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:28:02.360]   And so that's what God is inviting us.
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.520]   And we see that in Joseph.
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:11.560]   I mean, twice, going through horrible things, but yet choosing to honor God.
[00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:16.960]   And it's interesting, as you continue reading the story,
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.720]   now we don't see that in our section yet.
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:25.720]   But Joseph sees later on what God was doing.
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:29.920]   Joseph was faithful in the little things.
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:34.160]   He was faithful as part of his steward and administrating it and
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:38.120]   having, worshipping God through that job.
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:41.640]   He was faithful in the prison when he was entrusted responsibilities.
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:47.880]   And then later on, God is preparing him because he's faithful in the little
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:50.280]   things to later on be the main administrator,
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:54.560]   second highest ranking person in the Egyptian empire.
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:59.600]   To save, to collect food during seven years of plenty and
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.560]   then later on distribute it.
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:05.880]   But it's like it took this phase beforehand to work these things into
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:10.880]   Joseph's life so that he was ready for what God had for him for the future.
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:15.200]   And I wanna encourage you with that.
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:19.720]   We don't understand why is God working perseverance into our character?
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:22.880]   Why is he building a stronger faith and resilience?
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:28.360]   Now we don't know, but he has a reason.
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:31.320]   He's preparing us for
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:34.360]   something greater that he has for us to do in the future.
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:40.360]   So I want you to be encouraged that God is at work.
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:44.640]   He's doing something and he's gonna lead you to something better.
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:49.240]   Because you know him in a different way than if you were not to walk with him
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:51.560]   through the difficulty, so that's the first thing.
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:30:01.200]   The second thing that we can learn from Joseph's story,
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:07.800]   if you're facing the temptation of despair is this.
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:12.920]   Joseph's story assures us that the Lord is with you in your trials.
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:20.920]   The caption over Joseph's life in this darkest hour is the Lord is with Joseph.
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:21.920]   That's amazing.
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:28.640]   And if you're a Christian, if you're a Jesus follower, this is also true of you.
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:31.880]   Like I said, when we're going through difficult stuff,
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:35.400]   most of the time we don't think of putting that caption over our lives.
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:40.440]   But the truth is that the Lord is with you and he's writing that over your life.
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:42.040]   You are not alone.
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:47.840]   He is by your side and he wants to show you his chassé, love, his loving kindness.
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:53.680]   Now many of you know part of my own journey.
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:56.080]   If you're interested, I'm not gonna go into all the details.
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:58.160]   If you're interested, you can listen to it.
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.120]   There is no other name.
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:03.400]   It was a sermon in the Longing for Healing sermon series last year.
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:10.600]   But I, now quite a while ago, I was left in my first marriage.
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:12.600]   My spouse left me.
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:16.600]   And I didn't see it coming.
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:18.600]   I was caught off guard.
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:25.600]   And it really, you know, it was like pulling a rug from underneath my feet.
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:30.600]   And I was a pastor at the time already.
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:33.600]   So theoretically, I know that the Lord is with me.
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.600]   But I didn't feel like the Lord was with me.
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:37.600]   I felt like the Lord had left me.
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:44.600]   You know, I felt like, I was like, and I even, I was like, Lord, I served you.
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:45.600]   Why is this happening to me?
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:53.600]   And so I was going through this dark, difficult, you know, time.
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:57.600]   And I wasn't, you know, I had stopped working as a pastor.
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:00.600]   I didn't have a home at that moment.
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:04.600]   I didn't, there was uncertainty about the relationship.
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:06.600]   So everything was falling apart.
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:10.600]   And I started meeting with a spiritual director.
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:13.600]   And just processing all that was happening.
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:18.600]   And it was just a lot of like just dark processing.
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:25.600]   And then about three months into all of this, he told me,
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:29.600]   Tim, do you see how much God loves you?
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:33.600]   And I was like, come on.
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.600]   What are you talking about, God loving me?
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:40.600]   It's like, no, so then he reflected back to me some of the things that I'd shared with him.
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:47.600]   And, you know, one of the things was that a family in the church that I used to pastor,
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:50.600]   that they took me into their family.
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:52.600]   So I had a home to live in.
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:56.600]   And I was just going to be undercover, you know, stay out of their way, not bother them.
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.600]   But they invited me into their life.
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:00.600]   I ate meals with them.
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:02.600]   I went shopping with them at Costco.
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:05.600]   Bought way too much things there.
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:12.600]   And so the spiritual director was saying, Tim, God loves you.
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:18.600]   You know, he's showing you incredible love in your circumstances, you know, through these people.
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:22.600]   And on my own, I would have not been able to see that.
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:30.600]   But so the caption over my life was, the Lord is with you.
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:37.600]   And, you know, Jesus in the New Testament, he promises us that right before he ascends into heaven.
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:43.600]   And then Matthew 28, 20 says, "And surely I'm with you always to the very end of the age."
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:47.600]   God promises us, Jesus promises us his presence.
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:49.600]   The Lord is with you.
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:54.600]   So whatever you're facing, whatever's going on, whatever challenge you're walking through,
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:57.600]   you might not feel like God is with you, but the Lord is with you.
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:02.600]   That's the caption, even over this challenging time that you are facing.
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:06.600]   This is the caption over your life, and that is the truth.
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:09.600]   Now I want to invite the worship team to come up.
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:19.600]   Now for those of us who are facing this temptation of despair,
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:24.600]   you know, where we're like, I'm just tired.
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:27.600]   I'm just tired.
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:30.600]   So I want to encourage you with those two things.
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:36.600]   The first thing is that God is testing you.
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:38.600]   He's working faith.
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:41.600]   He's working something in your life that is not there.
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:42.600]   He's strengthened you.
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:45.600]   He's making you more in his image.
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:48.600]   You reflect his character more.
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:53.600]   And that is preparing you for something that you cannot even know about yet.
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:58.600]   But maybe one day when you look back, you can see why you needed to go through this challenge.
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:02.600]   So be encouraged by that.
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.600]   God is at work in your life.
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:10.600]   He's working something into you, something stronger, something more beautiful, something more powerful.
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:14.600]   And the second thing is God loves you.
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:18.600]   The Lord is with you.
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:26.600]   He wants to show you his chassé love, his loving kindness, his compassion, his faithfulness in what you're going through.
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:29.600]   So I want to invite everyone to stand.
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:31.600]   I would just love to pray over you.
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:41.600]   If you are going through challenges right now, and you just want to express to God,
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:44.600]   God, I just need you to work in my life.
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.600]   I just need you to meet you.
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:47.600]   I'm tired.
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:51.600]   I want to invite you to stretch out your hands just in front of you, and I just want to pray over you.
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:36:00.600]   Jesus, you see every single hand stretched out here right now.
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:10.600]   Lord, I pray that as we've thought today, that this truth that you are with every single person,
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.600]   that they are not alone,
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:19.600]   that this will not become just words, but you will tangibly people experience your chassé love,
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:25.600]   your loving kindness, your faithfulness in the challenge that they are facing, that they know you are present.
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:30.600]   So Holy Spirit, I pray that you make this love known in a tangible way,
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:35.600]   that they can see you, that they can feel you, encourage you people, Lord.
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:36.600]   We ask for that.
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:38.600]   We long for that.
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:40.600]   Holy Spirit,
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:44.600]   fill your people with your love.
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:51.600]   Lord, I also pray that you give perspective on what you're doing,
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:55.600]   that you're working something into people's lives, something beautiful.
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:58.600]   So I pray that you encourage my brothers and my sisters right now,
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:02.600]   that you are doing a beautiful work as they're holding on to you,
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:06.600]   that you're working something new, something stronger, something more resilient,
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:09.600]   something that reflects you more into their hearts.
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:13.600]   May you strengthen your people right now, Lord.
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:19.600]   And so Lord, I entrust my brothers and sisters to you, the challenge that they face.
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:24.600]   May you lead them through what is going on,
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:30.600]   and may they come out stronger, knowing your faithfulness, your provision, and your love.
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:34.600]   I pray all this in your mighty name, Jesus. Amen.
