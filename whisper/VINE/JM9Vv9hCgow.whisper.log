[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   Wonderful. Good morning everyone. How are we all? It's good to see you. Welcome to
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.560]   everybody online as well. It's great to have you with us. As we continue our
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.800]   sermon series in the book of Acts today, I want to introduce you this week and
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.540]   next week to two of the most important and influential people in the whole of
[00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:24.560]   the New Testament. And I want you, or I want to help you, to understand how their
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:31.240]   story shapes yours. In fact, these two people are not just the most important
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.700]   and influential in the New Testament, but they are actually two people who have
[00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:41.320]   radically reshaped the trajectory of human history. And here's the crazy thing
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:47.540]   about these two people. You are probably not very familiar with them. And I think
[00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.920]   that's kind of, kind of the beauty of Jesus Christ. That I think so often the
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.680]   very people that Jesus Christ uses to change the world are the very people
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.480]   that the world so quickly forgets. And if you're sitting in here today, and if
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.980]   you're feeling a little bit lonely, a little bit forgotten, if you're feeling
[00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:14.440]   like perhaps nobody sees your true value, if you're struggling today with feeling
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.920]   just a little bit outside of community, if you're feeling segregated or alone, if
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.080]   you're feeling like you don't have much to contribute at all to what God might
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.160]   be doing in Hong Kong, or might be doing here at the Vine, or in your sphere of
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.880]   influence, then the next two weeks are about you. I want to say this right up
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:44.040]   front, that in this room, the potential that there is for the power of the Holy
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.760]   Spirit to be ministering around our city in this time and in this hour is
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:57.400]   unfathomable. What sits inside of you, waiting to be released, is nothing short
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:03.440]   of the same Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead. And I want to pray for you
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.600]   that as we open up the story of these two relatively unfamiliar people, these
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.520]   two people that history has forgotten and does not talk much about, you will
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.640]   find a fire being lit inside of you to say, "You know what? I can make a
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:27.160]   difference. You know what? Because of what is inside of me, I can change the world."
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.720]   I wonder whether you pray with me. Father, I just want to thank you for every person
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.040]   in this room and online in this moment. I want to thank you, Lord, for the potential
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.480]   that sits in us, not because of our great strength. Lord, I want to thank you that
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.840]   the potential that sits inside of each one of us is the Spirit of God that has
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.480]   chosen us, set us apart, equipped us, and releases us. And Father, I want to pray
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.600]   that as we look at these two individuals over this week and next, Lord, something
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.280]   would stir inside of this church, Lord, and you would shift us, move us forward,
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.280]   bring us to our knees. Lord, we pray we would be changed. We thank you so much
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.160]   for that by your Spirit alone. In Jesus' name, everyone says. To introduce you to the
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.520]   first of these incredible people, I need to take you to perhaps the most famous
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.800]   passage in the whole book of Acts, the moment where the Apostle Paul has his
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:24.280]   dramatic conversion on the road to Damascus. Now, this story is one in which
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.920]   you could do a whole sermon series around. And as I was preparing for this,
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.040]   there's so much I wanted to say in this story, but I'm actually cutting out a lot
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.200]   of what can be said in this story because I really want to focus in on
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.880]   just the one critical thing that we see here that I think has the most impact on
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.560]   you as a Christian in this moment. And then I'm gonna do a teaching with us
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.280]   today, but I'm also gonna do a bit of a shorter teaching because I want to
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.280]   connect us actually to a practical way, and we're gonna do a practical exercise
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.560]   together before you leave today, where you will be actually trying out that
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.680]   very critical thing that Christ has placed in you. You're all looking really
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.040]   scared right now. It's alright. It's gonna be good. Now, I want to jump straight into
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.680]   this. This is Acts 9, starting in verse 1. Are you ready?
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:21.480]   "Meanwhile, Saul was still breathing out murderous threats against the Lord's
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.280]   disciples. He went to the high priest and asked him for letters to the synagogues
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.200]   in Damascus, so that if he found anyone there who belonged to the way, whether
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.760]   men or women, he might be able to take them as prisoners to Jerusalem." Let me
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.640]   stop there. Saul is the same as Paul, okay? It's the same person. Saul is the
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.880]   name that was used, that he used for himself before he came into Christ Jesus.
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.760]   It's the name that was his Hebrew name, Saul. When he came into Christ Jesus,
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.160]   because his gifting was to go to the Gentiles, he used his Greek version of
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.960]   the name, which is Paul. But Saul and Paul, same thing. I'm gonna call him Paul for
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.440]   the rest of the message. Now, we are introduced to Paul. This is not the first
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.200]   time we're introduced to Paul. We're introduced to Paul just a few chapters
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.760]   earlier in Acts, chapters 7 and 8. And we're introduced to Paul as a Pharisee.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:16.400]   Paul is a passionate, fiery, young Pharisee. And as a Pharisee, he's committed to the
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.120]   law of God. He's committed to making sure that the Jewish people lived in honor of
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.680]   the law. The Pharisees believe that one of the reasons why Israel went into
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.160]   exile in the Old Testament is because they disregarded the law. So when they
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.400]   came back from exile, Ezra took the scrolls and read out the scrolls to the
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.880]   people. And that was the birth point of the Pharisees. They believed from that
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.240]   point onwards that what was most important to make sure that you didn't
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.840]   come under the wrath of God was to understand the law as best you could and
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.880]   to teach that law. And so here's Paul, zealous for the law. And he's so zealous
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:54.240]   for the law that anybody that he and his sect of Judaism deemed was outside of
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.240]   the law, deemed were heretics, he was going to do everything he could to
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:04.200]   persecute those people. And when we meet Paul, we meet him at the trial of Stephen,
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:10.580]   a believer in Jesus. And Paul is watching this trial, hoping that Stephen is found a
[00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.400]   heretic so that Stephen can be stoned to death. Well, Stephen is declared a heretic.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:22.320]   And then Saul comes, or Paul, comes and stands and watches Stephen get stoned.
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.880]   Not only that, but he was the only Pharisee in the presence of that
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.960]   murderous moment. And what the people would do before they pick up a stone and
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.960]   throw it to kill Stephen, they had to take off their cloaks and lay them at
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.240]   the foot of a Pharisee. And because Paul was the one Pharisee there at that time,
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:44.240]   they laid their cloaks at Paul's feet as a symbol to say, "We're killing this man
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.360]   on your authority, on the authority of the high priest and the authorities of
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.840]   the Pharisees. You have declared this man a heretic. We're picking up stones and
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:58.240]   killing him on your authority." And Paul stood there and said, "Grab your rocks."
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:03.880]   See, the Pharisees were super upset that there was a group of people who were
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.440]   beginning to believe that a carpenter from Nazareth was actually the Messiah.
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:15.520]   I mean, imagine believing that. What a ridiculous thing to believe. The problem
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.080]   was, a lot of people were beginning to believe this. By the time of the stoning
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.680]   of Stephen, it was likely that over 5,000 people in Jerusalem believed that Jesus
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:27.480]   was the Messiah. And Saul and his buddies from the Pharisees sect, they knew that
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:31.880]   this was a problem. Because they believed two things about Jesus. Number one, he was
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.880]   a false prophet. There's no way that Jesus, the carpenter from Nazareth, who did the
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:39.320]   things that he did, could ever be the Messiah. He's a false prophet. The second
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.200]   thing they believed is this, he's dead. He didn't raise from the dead. What are you
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.320]   chatting about? What's resurrection all about? Read the Old Testament
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.960]   Scriptures. They don't mention resurrection. What are you talking about?
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:54.920]   He is a false prophet and he's dead. And because of this, he goes to the high
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.600]   priest and he says, "Give me letters of authority. I'm on my way to Damascus and
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.440]   that's an important city in the Greek Roman Empire. If I find anyone there, if
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:07.840]   this virus has spread from Jerusalem to Damascus, give me the authority to arrest
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.360]   these people, bring them back to Jerusalem, let's put them on trial, and
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:19.400]   let's stone some more Christians." Here's the crazy thing. Scholars tell us that
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:29.320]   Paul was 20 years old at this time, radicalized by a sect of religion at 20
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:34.280]   years old. And this 20 year old is about to experiencing something that he's
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:39.880]   never experienced before. Let's read on. Verse 3, "As he neared Damascus on his
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:44.080]   journey, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him. He fell to the ground
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.880]   and he heard a voice say to him, 'Saul, Saul'" I've said this before at the Vine, I'm
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:54.760]   gonna keep saying it, "If the Lord ever says your name twice, watch out. 'Saul, Saul,
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:59.840]   why do you persecute me?' 'Who are you, Lord?' Saul asked. 'I am Jesus, whom you are
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:04.120]   persecuting,' he replied. 'Now get up and go into the city and you will be told
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:08.920]   what you must do.'" I love the way that Luke describes this moment for us. Luke
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:13.160]   is riding axe, right? And he describes this moment. He uses specific language in
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:17.280]   the Greek. That was very important to link this moment right back to the
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:21.320]   opening of the Bible in Genesis. The Greek version of the Bible that Luke and
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:25.320]   many others would have read had the same words in Genesis 1 as he uses now in
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:30.960]   this moment. "A light that flashes from heaven and the ground that Paul falls
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.440]   upon." The ground being like that Adama, the ground from which God created
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:39.600]   humanity. That light that came and broke into the darkness just like in Genesis
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.120]   1. Luke is trying to connect the reader back to that moment because here's what
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:49.840]   Luke is saying. Guess what? Watch out. This is amazing. God's about to do a new
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:55.760]   creation. There's about to be a moment of new creation. I can almost sense
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:01.400]   that Luke has a big bucket of popcorn. He's like, "This is amazing. Can't you see
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:05.320]   what's happening here?" Paul, many years later, would write to the church and he
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:09.560]   would say, "If anybody is in Christ Jesus, you've become a new creation. The old is
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:15.320]   gone. The new has come. He experiences it in this moment. This is his new
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:23.360]   creation." Jesus says this to him, "So, so, why do you persecute me?" I love that. He
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:28.080]   doesn't say, "So, so, why do you persecute my people?" He doesn't say, "Why do you
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:32.960]   persecute my church?" He says, "Why are you persecuting me?" Because Jesus is
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:36.680]   establishing something for the early church to understand as Luke writes this
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:40.280]   to the church. He's establishing something. He's saying, "If you mess with
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:45.160]   my people, you mess with me. If you're coming against my people, guess what?
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.840]   You're not just coming against my people. You're actually coming against me." Many
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:52.560]   years later, Paul would say, "We're the body of Christ." And here in this moment,
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:58.680]   Jesus is saying, "You hurt my body. You hurt me. I feel it. I'm not just aware of
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:04.920]   it. I feel it myself." Jesus identifies with his suffering people, his hurting
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:09.200]   children. That's what he does. He identifies with you. And that's great
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.840]   news if you're in this room right now and you're feeling tired or hurt or
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:17.840]   worn down or oppressed. If you're in this room right now and you're lonely. If
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.320]   you're in this room and you feel like nobody understands you. If you're in this
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:25.560]   room or watching online right now and you're going through a time of mourning
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:29.480]   or grief and you're wondering if anybody connects at all with you. God doesn't
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:33.440]   just see where you are. If you're a Christian in this room or online right
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:39.560]   now, he feels you. And he so personally connects himself to you that when
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:43.880]   something happens to you, it's as if it's happening to him. And it's like he's
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:48.640]   coming to pull and he's saying, "Back off. Because if you touch my people, you're
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:52.240]   touching me. And I'm gonna show up, bolt of lightning, and put you on the ground,
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:58.320]   buddy. Why are you persecuting me?" That should be encouraging to some of you
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:03.760]   today. There's a God who's not just aware of your predicament, but is fighting
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:12.240]   battles on your behalf. Because he loves you and he identifies so personally with
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:23.680]   you that when you hurt, he hurts. Paul's response is awesome. "Who are you, Lord?"
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:28.760]   The irony of this is so beautiful. If there was one person in all of Israel,
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:32.920]   one person who should have known who the Messiah was, there's one person who had
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.760]   studied the Old Testament prophetic words about the Messiah more than anyone
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:40.240]   else. If there is one person who has dedicated his life to protecting the
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:44.120]   coming of the Messiah, if there's one person who wants to make sure that
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:48.520]   Israel is the best prepared for the reality of the coming of the Messiah, if
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:52.600]   there's one person who knows who the Messiah is, it is Paul. And when the
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:13:00.200]   Messiah shows up, he has no idea. "Who are you, Lord? I have no idea who you are." And
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:04.560]   this teaches the church, us today, something so important. You can know
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:11.840]   about Jesus, but never have met him. You can know something of him. You can know
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:16.480]   an idea of him. You can even study him. You can even come to church on a regular
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.840]   basis and hear somebody teach you about Jesus. You can even open the Bible and
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:25.680]   you can read about Jesus, but there's a difference between a knowledge of Jesus
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:32.080]   and an encounter with him. And Paul had somehow got himself so lost in the
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:36.000]   study and in the thinking that he had completely missed the reality of the
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:43.080]   person when he actually showed up. "Who are you, Lord?" Years later, Paul would be
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:46.480]   in Athens and he would sit with the philosophers in Athens and he would say,
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:50.080]   "I've walked around your city. There's even an inscription there that says, 'To an
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:55.720]   unknown God.'" Here's the great travesty of the global church right now, that we are
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:04.240]   in danger of worshiping an unknown God. I think sometimes the churches can get
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:10.280]   filled with people who are excited about singing songs and studying and hearing
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:17.520]   and learning, but have stopped short from actually meeting. I want to invite you,
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:24.720]   not to just know about Jesus, but to encounter him, to make it a regular
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:30.120]   experience of yours, to have a friendship with Jesus, to know his
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.960]   presence in your life. And I tell you what, there's nothing wrong with study. I
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:38.000]   studied the heck out of this passage to preach to you today. I spent hours
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.600]   looking at it in the Greek. I spent hours looking at it in the commentaries. I
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.600]   understand this passage as best I can, but if you leave here today going, "Oh, I
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:51.800]   learned something today," my heart will be broken. I hope you leave today going, "I
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:56.880]   met Jesus." There's that moment, isn't there, in Luke 24 when those two disciples
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:00.200]   have just experienced Jesus, and Jesus has just talked to them about the
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.120]   Scriptures, and afterwards they don't go, "Wow, didn't we just learn something?"
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:07.720]   Afterwards they said, "Were our hearts not burning inside of us as we encountered
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:12.200]   the risen Lord?" My prayer is that your heart would burn inside of you. "Who are
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:20.920]   you, Lord?" He cries out. Well, he's about to find out. Look what happens next. Verse
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:24.240]   7, "The men traveling with Saul stood there speechless. They heard the sound,
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:28.200]   but they did not see anyone. Saul got up from the ground, but when he opened his
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:32.720]   eyes, he could not see anything. He saw nothing. So they led him by the hand into
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:37.480]   Damascus, and for three days he was blind and did not eat or drink anything."
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:42.120]   Notice what happens here in this moment of incredible change for Paul. He
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.880]   suddenly is then lifted up by the companions that were walking with him,
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:50.080]   and he opens his eyes, but he sees nothing. And it's actually described by
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:54.400]   Luke here that he is this way. He's blind. Although his eyes are open, he's blind
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:59.440]   for three days. Now, whenever you read three days in the New Testament, your
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:04.360]   heart should stop immediately, and it should trigger something for you. This is
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:14.400]   Saul, Paul's tomb moment. This is Paul in a moment of his death and his resurrection.
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:20.000]   For three days, his eyes were opened and he was blind. And Luke is trying to
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.960]   communicate something. He's trying to say this. This is what our spiritual condition
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:29.280]   is like before we meet Jesus. Before we meet Jesus, here's what life is like. Our
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:32.480]   eyes are open, but we are actually not seeing the world as it truly should be
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.320]   seen. We're actually not seeing the value in humanity that we really should see.
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:40.000]   We're actually not seeing what society could become. We're actually not seeing
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.520]   love in the way that we should see it. We're actually not encountering people
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:47.280]   in the way that we should encounter them. It's only through the lens of Jesus
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:51.480]   Christ, through his salvation and our restoration in him, that we come to see
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:56.000]   the world as it truly was created to be seen. Before then, we are opened in our
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.640]   eyes, but we perceive nothing. And Luke is trying to say this is the condition that
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:05.680]   Paul was in, not just for three days, but this is his spiritual blindness that
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:11.520]   he's been in for years. His own passion and his study and his radicalization had
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:16.920]   closed his spiritual eyes to the reality of who the Messiah is. And so the Messiah
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:22.480]   has to show up, flash around him, bring him to his knees, rise him up and cause
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:29.960]   him to be blind for him to realize that he had gotten it all wrong. Now I want
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:35.680]   you to put yourself in the sandals of Paul right now. He's in some random house
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:47.280]   in Damascus blind and he feels terrible. Imagine a Pharisee. The one thing a
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:52.320]   Pharisee wants in life is to protect his people for their arrival of the Messiah.
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:57.040]   The one thing a Pharisee wants more than anything is to usher in the Messiah and
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:00.680]   to prepare his people for the Messiah. And Paul realizes he's just
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:05.360]   dedicated the early years of his life. He's just actually seen the stoning of
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:10.160]   Stephen and he's done it all to the ones who are actually the real people of the
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:14.080]   Messiah. That him and his pharisaical buddies had gotten it all wrong. That
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:18.860]   actually Jesus was the Son of God. He's suddenly realizing that what they
[00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:22.360]   thought was a false prophet is actually really the Son of God. He's suddenly
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:25.880]   realizing that who he thought was dead is actually well and truly alive because
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:29.520]   he's just spoken to him and he's just encountered them. And more than that, he's
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:35.480]   realizing that he has murdered the Messiah's people. And if you're a Pharisee
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:40.160]   and you come into the realization that you've actually murdered the very people
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:44.600]   of the very Son of God, that is the worst thing that could ever happen to you. And
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:50.400]   it says here that he refused to eat and drink for three days. Now when you fast
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:56.280]   you just refuse food, but if you don't drink you die. So what Luke is trying to
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:06.840]   tell us here is Paul wants to die. It's over for him. It's done. How could I ever
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:13.120]   live knowing that I persecuted not just the Son of God but his people as well
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:20.200]   and he refused to eat or drink and he was ready to die.
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:28.400]   Here's Paul going, "How could God ever forgive me and how could the Messiah's
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:36.000]   real people ever embrace me?" Well enter into the story the one person who
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:43.520]   changes history. Let's have a read. Is everybody okay? In Damascus there was a
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:49.560]   disciple named Ananias. I love how Luke does this. He's just done this incredible
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:53.560]   story up to this point and then very quietly he says, "In Damascus there was a
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:20:00.640]   disciple called Ananias." I love this because what Luke is telling you is he's
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:08.800]   saying this one was the very person that Paul had come to Damascus to arrest. He
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:13.520]   had gone to Damascus with authority of the high priest to arrest anybody there
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:18.800]   who believed in Jesus and this is one who believed in Jesus in Damascus. This
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:22.040]   is one. In fact Paul would write about him later or speak about him later in
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:26.180]   Acts chapter 2 and he would say he was a passionate follower of Jesus and had the
[00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:30.400]   respect of all the Jewish people in Damascus. So Ananias was quite well known
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:36.040]   in Damascus. Ananias would have been a prime target for the murderous Paul. This
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:39.720]   was the person he went there with these letters to arrest and drag back to
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:44.320]   Jerusalem and put on trial and hopefully see stone and this is such a beautiful
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:49.520]   irony in this story. Note this, the very one who was supposed to become a
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:54.160]   prisoner is about to be the very one who's going to set the actual prisoner
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:21:00.600]   free. Come on church. The one who should have been locked up under Paul's old
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:05.560]   regime is about to be the very one that's actually going to set Paul free
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:12.060]   because it's Paul who is in prison. It's Paul who's in the chains and behind
[00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:17.440]   the bars of his sin and his pride and his selfish ambition that has blinded
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:22.000]   him to the reality of the Messiah around him and it's Ananias who is free. It's
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.960]   Ananias who has all the freedom, who has come into relationship with Jesus, who
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:30.280]   knows who he is, who has that intimate relational connection to him, who knows
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:35.480]   that his own sins have been forgiven and Ananias has this understanding because
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:39.880]   he's like I was a sinner. I was an enemy of God but God in Jesus through
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:43.720]   his death and resurrection has now set me free and I am free not just to
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:48.520]   receive salvation but I am free now to be a minister of that salvation to
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:54.080]   anyone that God allows me to be around. I am so grateful that I am not prisoned to
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:22:03.840]   my sin and death anymore. The one who is in prison wants to kill himself and God
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:13.240]   so loves the world that he sends not just his only son but the children of
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:19.920]   the Son. Look what happens next. The Lord called to him and said this in a vision
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:28.160]   "Ananias!" "Yes Lord" he answered. Luke very beautifully does this. He does exactly
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:31.960]   the same words that were used for Paul's moment on the Damascus Road. Paul had a
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:37.080]   vision of the Lord. Paul heard the Lord's voice but Paul's response was "Who are
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:42.720]   you Lord?" Ananias has a vision. Ananias hears the Lord's voice. His response?
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:50.960]   "Yes Lord." "Yes Lord, what's up?" "I'm here." I mean Ananias had no idea what God was
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:54.080]   about to ask him to do okay and I think if he did know that he might have not
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:57.840]   said yes in that particular moment but he's blind to that right now. He's a
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:01.300]   little bit not aware but God shows up and says "Ananias!" Remember he only says
[00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:07.600]   his name once. Praise God. "Ananias!" Ananias' response is "Yes Lord! I'm ready. It's
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:12.200]   another day. I can't wait. What do you want me to do today?" "All right. You want to
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:19.000]   know what you're gonna do today?" The Lord said to him this "Go to the house of
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.880]   Judas on Straight Street and ask for a man there from Tarsus named Saul for he
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:29.040]   is praying." He's not praying, he's dying. In a vision he has seen a man named
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:33.720]   Ananias come and place his hands on him to restore his sight. "Lord let's just
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:38.080]   pause there for a moment Lord." Ananias says. "Lord we need to chat about this a
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:41.520]   little bit. I've heard many reports about this man and all the harm that he's done
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:46.160]   to your saints in Jerusalem. I was so glad he was in Jerusalem but now he's
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:49.440]   come here and that's not great because he's got authority from the high
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:52.480]   priest and the chief priest and he's gonna arrest all of us that call on your
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:55.680]   name. So I just want to get this clear Lord. You're talking about a different
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:59.400]   Saul from the one I'm thinking right? There's lots of Saul's aren't there Lord?
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:05.920]   This is a common Hebrew name right now. Like this is not that guy right? It's
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:14.320]   amazing isn't it how how God's ability for grace always far exceeds ours. It's so
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:21.160]   easy isn't it for us to wonder "Ah that person. Never that one. Oh really have you
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:26.240]   seen what they've said and done?" And understandably Ananias is here going
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:30.280]   like "Man really like that one?" And I love what we see here in Ananias. We see
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:35.560]   somebody who's not afraid to question God. Not afraid to go "Let's just pause
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:40.160]   for a little bit here before I rush into my own death." Can we talk about this for
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:43.800]   a moment? Am I hearing you right? Like that one is this is this really what's
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:49.880]   on your heart? "But the Lord said to Ananias go hmm for this man is my chosen
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:53.380]   instrument to carry my name before the Gentiles and their kings and before the
[00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:58.840]   people of Israel. I will show him how much he must suffer for my name." And
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:02.820]   Ananias is is wrestling with God in this moment saying "Okay I think I know what
[00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:06.860]   you need me to do but seriously this one could kill me. He's come here to do that.
[00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:11.560]   I'm not sure if I really can go." And God says "No you need to go and guess what?
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:18.600]   This one is my chosen instrument." And I think Ananias is wrestling with this
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:24.280]   because he's like "Do I really need to go?" And Jesus says to him "I want you to go
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:29.000]   and place your hands on him and pray for him so his sight is restored.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.880]   I want you to place your hands upon this man, minister to him so his sight will be
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:40.160]   restored." And here's Ananias going "Is there any other way?" Now think about it.
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:46.000]   There was another way. You see Jesus didn't have to do it this way. Jesus
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.620]   showed up to Paul and did this amazing thing. Light from heaven, fall on the
[00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:51.520]   ground, raise him back up. What Jesus could have done in that moment is
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:55.600]   immediately restored his sight, forgiven him of his sins, filled him with the Holy
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.880]   Spirit and set him off to be the conqueror of the Greek Roman Empire.
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:03.160]   That's what he could have done. It was within Jesus's power but Jesus did not
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:07.320]   decide to do it that way. Instead he blinds Paul, puts him in a place of
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:12.000]   abject terror for three days, raises up another person to go along to pray for
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   him. And the question we should be asking is why does God do it that way? It's
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   because God is teaching his church something. He's trying to tell his church
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.540]   that when the Spirit of God falls upon the church, you will be my witnesses to
[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:30.560]   the end of the earth. You will be my hands and feet. I could have done it on
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:37.380]   the road but I want to do it through Ananias. See as Christians we are to be
[00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:43.720]   ministers. Ministers of the transformative power of Jesus Christ.
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:53.240]   Ones who are led by the Spirit of God to meet souls and invite them to
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:58.500]   become Paul's. That's what we've been invited to do. That's why we've been
[00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:03.960]   saved by Jesus. So that we can partner with the Spirit of God and come
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:07.780]   alongside of people who might be soul in this moment and believe that they
[00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:12.400]   could become Paul's. Ones that could change empires. Ones that could do all of
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:16.120]   this stuff. And here's Ananias and he senses that God has called him beyond
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:20.120]   just what he does in his normal life. And now he gets to participate through the
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:24.720]   simple obedience of the Holy Spirit to lay his hands on someone and see that
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:28.560]   person's life transform. And you need to be really careful that you
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:32.800]   don't think Ananias is some super apostle. His name is never heard about
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:40.400]   in the rest of human history from this point forward. But God says to him, "Paul
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:46.320]   will be my chosen instrument. I'm gonna use him to transform the Greco-Roman
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:51.400]   Empire. He's gonna take the gospel to the Gentiles, to their kings and rulers, and
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:55.400]   he's gonna take it to all the people of Israel." And Ananias is trying to get his
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:28:03.080]   head around this. And Ananias realizes that it's not just Paul who's the chosen
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:08.400]   instrument here. He's also a chosen instrument. That God has also called him,
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:14.500]   equipped him, empowered him, and released him, and asked him to go. And he realizes
[00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:20.480]   I get a part to play in the unfolding dramatic movement of God's gospel in the
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:24.880]   world. It's not just Paul who's a chosen instrument. I too have been chosen by him
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:30.040]   to just do one simple thing. Meet one person with the courage of not being
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:34.040]   killed, lay my hand on his shoulder, pray that he receives the Holy Spirit, and
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:42.360]   watch what God will do. Oh man. Note this. Without Ananias, there would have been no
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:47.920]   Paul. Without Ananias, there would have been no half of the New Testament.
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:53.880]   Without Ananias, perhaps the gospel would only have ever gone as far as Samaria.
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:29:00.800]   Ananias was willing to lay his hands on someone, not aware of all that
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:06.200]   God is about to do through him, to actually change the course of human
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:13.420]   history, which is what Paul does. And it starts because of somebody who is
[00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:23.160]   forgotten in history, but is obedient to the simple call to be a Christian. You
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:30.080]   need to know that large doors swing on small hinges. And I look around this room
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:37.000]   right now and I see a lot of small hinges. The potential in this room for
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:42.720]   what God could do through people who are willing to just lay their hands on
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:50.000]   someone, pray for them, is unfathomable. Could you imagine what the future of
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.200]   Hong Kong might look like if there are just a few more Ananiases and not Pauls
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:30:02.200]   in this place? This idea of being a chosen instrument becomes a fundamental
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.800]   perspective of the early church. Let me read to you just a passage that Peter
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:10.040]   writes just a few years later to the church. He writes this. He says, "But you
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:15.520]   are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people who belong to God,
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:20.520]   that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:25.840]   wonderful light." This is Peter pulling up these very moments from Acts chapter 9
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:28.520]   and then applying them to the whole church. He's saying, "Don't you realize
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:33.880]   it's not just Paul. We, the whole of us, are a chosen people. We're a holy nation."
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:38.360]   And guess what? Just like Ananias, we get to see people go out of darkness into
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:43.120]   incredible light. We get to be the ones who do the simple work of laying hands
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:47.920]   on people. Get to see God do amazing things. We are a chosen people.
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:51.960]   And it's almost like Peter is writing to the church and saying, "Rise up.
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:56.920]   Rise up with your God-given authority. You don't need letters from the chief
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:04.440]   priests. You just need your hands and your hearts." This is the joy of being a
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:07.920]   Christ follower. I don't know if you've ever thought of it this way.
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:13.680]   This is the joy of being a Christ follower. We are a chosen instrument of
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:19.400]   God's good news, equipped with the ability to lay our hands on people, pray
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:25.000]   for them, and see people move out of darkness into God's great new light.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:34.640]   That's who you are. Every single person in this room. A few years ago, me and my
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:40.120]   friend Dogan went out to pray here in Wan Chai. We wanted to go and pray for
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:44.640]   street sleepers. Dogan was an amazing guy, is an amazing guy. He now lives in the US.
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:50.160]   But amazing guy. American-born Chinese. Had a terrible upbringing. Really hard
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:55.960]   life. Drugs throughout his teenage life. Drug addict into his early 20s. Came to a
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:59.080]   dramatic conversion experience with Jesus Christ and had heard about
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:04.760]   Jackie Pullinger's ministry here in Hong Kong. He left his work and left
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:09.480]   his family in California. He moved out here so that he could, in his early 20s,
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:13.640]   minister with Jackie, with the drug addicts of Hong Kong. After that, he came
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:16.200]   and was a part of the Vine community. Him and his family were a part of this
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:19.960]   community for many years. Dogan served in many different ways. On this
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:23.480]   one particular day, him and I, we went out to Wan Chai. We were looking for
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:26.960]   street sleepers. We went into Southern Playground, just over here. We
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:29.560]   looked up into the stadium part of Southern Playground. We saw this man
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:33.560]   sitting up there. He very much looked like a street sleeper. Dogan's like,
[00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:36.320]   "I think that could be the guy." I'm like, "Yep, let's go." So we went up there.
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:40.840]   We sat down. Dogan began to speak to him in Cantonese. Just began to
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:44.360]   share, I guess, a little bit about his story and who he was. He shared with
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:47.120]   this man. After about five minutes of chatting back and forth in Cantonese,
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:51.360]   Dogan asked him if he could pray for him. The man was like, "Whatever.
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:55.720]   If that's what you want to do." So I reached out and put my hand on his
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:58.880]   left shoulder. Dogan reached out and put his hand on his right shoulder. We
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:02.160]   started to pray. Dogan prayed in Cantonese over this guy. I didn't
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:04.840]   really know what they were saying. I didn't understand Cantonese at that
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:08.360]   level. Didn't really understand it. But I began to pray just in myself.
[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:12.640]   Immediately as I began to pray, I felt the Holy Spirit say this, "Hey, Andrew,
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:16.280]   you're wearing a cross." I'm like, "Yeah." He's like, "Okay, I want you to take off
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:20.440]   your cross and give it to this man." In that moment, I had an Ananias
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:24.440]   moment. I was like, "Let's just talk about this for a moment, God. Because this man
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:27.800]   is not even a Christian. Why would I waste this cross on him?
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:33.800]   Secondly, my wife gave me this cross. I like this cross. This cross has
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:37.560]   sentimental value to me. It's an important cross. I'm not just gonna
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:41.000]   randomly take this off and give it to a guy who like five minutes later is gonna
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.920]   throw it in the bin." So I was kind of having that
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:47.400]   conversation with God whilst I was praying for this man. After a few
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:50.400]   minutes, Dogan turns to me. He's been praying in Cantonese. He turns to me in
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:34:01.080]   English. He says, "Are you sensing anything?" I'm like, "Yeah, unfortunately I am." I said,
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:05.240]   "Yeah, I sense that the Holy Spirit wants me to take off my cross and give it
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:10.160]   to him." As I said those words, Dogan just looked at me and he didn't blink for
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:15.360]   like ages. I was worried about him. He goes, "Man, I've been praying in
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:18.280]   Cantonese over this guy for like the last five minutes, but the whole time I've
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:21.720]   been praying, God has been telling me to give my cross that I'm wearing on my
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:28.560]   neck to him, but I told God, 'No, my wife gave it to me.'" We had exactly the same
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:33.640]   conversation with God. God was probably standing back there going, "Look at
[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:42.400]   my unfaithful servants! One of you give your cross!" Anyway, so I'm like, "I think I'd
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:45.200]   better give him my cross." And he's like, "Yeah, yeah, you do that, Andrew. You give
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:49.960]   me your cross. I'll keep praying in Cantonese." So he keeps praying in
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:54.560]   Cantonese, and I take off my cross, and he's explained to the guy what God
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:59.440]   was saying. And the guy unbuttons his shirt, and he's wearing three big fat
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:04.480]   Buddhist medallion idol type stuff on his neck, the big fat ones.
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:10.720]   And he starts to take them off, and as he lifts them up towards about
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:17.360]   eye level, he suddenly starts manifesting a demon. He starts acting demonically,
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:22.080]   manifesting literally a demon. Now, I had seen this a few times, and Dalgan had
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:26.800]   seen this a lot, and here was the fascinating thing. The demon decided to
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:31.960]   speak in English. I was the only one in that party that didn't speak Cantonese,
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:38.560]   so the demon wanted me to know how angry and upset he was at this situation. And
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:42.480]   this demon, I will not repeat what came out of this man's mouth. The man
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:47.120]   obviously didn't speak any English, but this demon with English began to curse
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:51.600]   us out like anything I'd never heard. And Dalgan starts to have a fight with him
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:55.520]   in English back, but not with the guy, but with the demon, and starts to like shout
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:59.720]   back, and it's like Street Fighter in real life, you know. And then he prays, "In
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:03.360]   the name of Jesus, be gone." And this guy just immediately throws his head back
[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:11.880]   and starts crying tears, and I know that these are tears of freedom. And he takes
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:15.520]   my cross, and he puts it over his neck where those Buddhist symbols had been,
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:22.000]   and the demon is gone. Not because I'm special, or because Dalgan's special. I know
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.720]   I'm a pastor, so that story makes you think, "Okay, well he's a pastor. That was
[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:32.440]   long before I was a pastor." We're not special, but we were vessels that day.
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:39.360]   And sitting in this room are vessels of God's glory waiting to be unleashed. Let
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:41.640]   me close by showing you one more thing, and then we're gonna do this practical
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:46.480]   exercise. Is everybody okay still? Two more minutes. Verse 17, "Then Ananias went to
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:50.760]   the house and entered it. Placing his hands on Saul, he said, 'Brother Saul, the
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:54.320]   Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here has sent me
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:57.760]   so that you may be able to see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit.'
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:02.240]   Immediately something like scales fell from Saul's eyes, and he could see again,
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:06.920]   and he got up, and he was baptized, and after taking some food, he regained his
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:11.640]   strength. He didn't want to die anymore because he had come into resurrection
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:16.840]   hope through the power of the Holy Spirit. All Ananias did was place his
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:21.320]   hand on his shoulder, and then he says these two words. What a powerful thing. He
[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:27.640]   says this, "Brother Saul." Could you imagine what those words would have meant to
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:31.840]   Paul? Paul who's wrestling with the reality that God's people could never
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:35.160]   forgive him, who's wrestling with the reality that God will never forgive him,
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:39.240]   and that he was killing people of the Messiah, and here a people of the Messiah
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:45.120]   shows up, and the very first thing he says to Paul is, "You're my brother. I love
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:49.880]   you. You're part of this family. If God's forgiven you, I've forgiven you, and
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:53.280]   guess what? Not only that, I'm about to lay my hands on you, and I'm gonna pray
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:58.200]   that the Spirit of God will come upon you because His grace is sufficient for
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:04.080]   you." This room is filled with Ananiases waiting to be unleashed in your sphere
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:07.080]   of influence, your workplace, your families here in Hong Kong in this
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:12.320]   desperate hour. Would we rise up, lay hands on one another, and pray that the
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:18.120]   Spirit of God would take people from darkness into light? Now here's how we're
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:23.640]   gonna do that. In a moment, I'm gonna invite us all to stand, and then I'm
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:26.440]   gonna pray for the Holy Spirit to come. We're just gonna have a time just
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:30.080]   privately to receive the Holy Spirit. If you're watching this online right now,
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:35.120]   our online team are just about to drop in your chat box a link to Zoom, where
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:39.000]   you could go from just watching this one way to actually being in a room with
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.200]   people who are gonna be doing exactly what I'm gonna be talking about here. So
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:45.840]   just have a look in the chat box right now for the instructions for that Zoom.
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:48.880]   But what we're doing in this room is you're gonna have a moment where I'm
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:51.200]   just gonna pray for the Holy Spirit to come, and you're gonna receive the Holy
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:55.840]   Spirit, and then after that I'm gonna invite you to turn to the person
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:39:00.360]   sitting next to you, whether you know them or not, and you're gonna say, "Hi, so
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:04.880]   nice to meet you," and then you're gonna ask them, "How can I pray for you?" And
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:08.880]   then you're gonna lay your hands on their shoulders, and I don't care about
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:16.440]   COVID. You're gonna lay your hands on their shoulder, and you're gonna pray for
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:20.920]   them, and then after that they're gonna ask you, "How can I pray for you?" And
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:24.040]   you're gonna share what's on your heart, and then they're gonna lay their hands
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:29.040]   on you, and they're gonna pray for you. And I cannot wait to see the potential
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:33.480]   of what it is that the Holy Spirit is about to do in this room. So I wonder
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:36.200]   whether you would stand with me, and we're gonna do this together. I want to
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:40.400]   pray for us first. If you stand, I just want to invite you to open your hands.
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:47.840]   Holy Spirit, thank you. Just open your hands with me right now. We got time to
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:55.960]   do this. We don't need to rush. Holy Spirit, would you come? Holy Spirit, we're
[00:39:55.960 --> 00:40:02.920]   so grateful. Come, Lord Jesus, come.
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:10.080]   Father, I'm so grateful for the people of this room, and the people that are
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:19.040]   watching online, and going into a Zoom right now. Holy Spirit, come. Father, would
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:28.200]   you fill us? We're tired, weary, being beaten down by the last few years. We
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:30.800]   need you, Lord.
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:37.280]   Father, sometimes our eyes are open, and we see nothing. Would you remove the
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:42.920]   scales from our eyes, Lord? Would your Holy Spirit come now?
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:41:01.040]   Just receive the Holy Spirit.
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:10.160]   Come, Jesus, come.
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:28.960]   He loves you so much. He saved you. A small hinge,
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:34.200]   who through the power of the Spirit of God can move great doors.
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:46.440]   You, who can place your hands on those possessed by demons and see them flee.
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:53.320]   You, who can place your hands on someone who's struggling emotionally, and offer
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:55.760]   them peace.
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:04.360]   You, who can place your hands on those you don't even know, and just speak a word
[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:09.760]   of comfort and love through the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:17.480]   But before you do that, receive yourself.
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:21.080]   Come, Lord Jesus, come.
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:28.080]   [praying in tongues]
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:30.080]   More, Lord.
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:39.080]   [music]
