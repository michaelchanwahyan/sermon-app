[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840]   So open our ears, open our hearts,
[00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.740]   and yeah, we just give you this time in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.840]   - Thank you, and no Christmas presents
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.360]   from Promise for me this year, okay?
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.320]   All right, well good morning, it's always good
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.060]   and an honor to be together when we gather on a Sunday.
[00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.980]   Like Promise said, we are continuing our parable series.
[00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.960]   Well I grew up in a Christian home,
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.880]   you know, a third generation Christian family.
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.440]   Both sides of my parents, you know,
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.400]   my parents were also Christian, so my mama, my popo,
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.600]   both made my parents in Christian homes,
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.840]   so you know, going to church, Christian things,
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.180]   all that stuff was a big part of growing up,
[00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.120]   especially praying before you eat, right?
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.840]   All this, and there was one particular prayer
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.640]   that I think most Cantonese-speaking little children
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.780]   learned or taught to pray before you eat, right?
[00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.000]   I would not, you know, especially if grandma was there,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.320]   you would not dare to even touch the chopsticks
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.000]   before saying this prayer, okay?
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.960]   It goes something like this.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.880]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:10.120]   After you said that, then you could eat, okay?
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.120]   A translation would go something like this, okay?
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.040]   Sorry if that was triggering, by the way, all right?
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.020]   But basic translation would be something like this.
[00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.320]   Thank you God for this food, please bless it
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.560]   to give me a healthy body so I will listen
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.440]   and obey my parents, amen, okay?
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.420]   What listening to your parents and having to eat a meal
[00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.120]   has to do with, I don't know, but you know,
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.000]   they threw that in there just in case.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.200]   I do the same with my boys now, right, so.
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.800]   (audience laughing)
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.360]   So you know, being taught to pray
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.240]   was something we grew up with.
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.440]   Now of course, these days, my faith has matured,
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.840]   and hopefully, you know, my prayers sound a bit different.
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.800]   And what I've been realizing is that learning to pray,
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.280]   though, continuing to learn how to pray,
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.520]   it's such an important part of your journey with Jesus
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.920]   as you grow in faith.
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.100]   And as I said, as we continue our series
[00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.060]   in the parables today, the parable we're looking at today,
[00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.180]   Jesus uses a very peculiar, strange,
[00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.380]   almost sort of a humorous story
[00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.580]   to teach his followers about prayer.
[00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.860]   Now before he gets there, though,
[00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.580]   he teaches his disciples how to pray.
[00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.220]   One thing that's quite interesting to note in the gospels
[00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.100]   is that one of the only things that the disciples
[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.980]   ask Jesus to teach them is to teach them about prayer.
[00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.700]   Lord, teach us how to pray.
[00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.180]   Why were they so keen to learn about what prayer is?
[00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.740]   Well, I reckon it's probably because, you know,
[00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.500]   after spending a lot of time with Jesus,
[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.600]   you know, they did life together.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.780]   They were together all the time.
[00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.500]   And so they would have definitely seen Jesus praying.
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.340]   Right, could you imagine what it would have been like
[00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.780]   to just sit in the presence of Jesus
[00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.160]   as he was praying to his heavenly Father?
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.300]   To hear the words that he would have said, right?
[00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.140]   The combination of intimacy and power,
[00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.820]   authority, vulnerability, and affirmation
[00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.340]   would have been so tangible in those moments, right?
[00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.340]   Prayer would have been such a active,
[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.060]   such a beautiful thing as Jesus was speaking to his Father.
[00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.100]   And so as Jesus demonstrated how to pray to his disciples,
[00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.620]   they caught onto this.
[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.740]   And so they ask him, Jesus, Lord, teach us how to pray.
[00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.500]   Luke 11 tells us this.
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.060]   One day, just as Jesus had finished praying
[00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.140]   in a certain place, one of his disciples said to him,
[00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.860]   Lord, teach us how to pray,
[00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.460]   just as John taught his disciples.
[00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.940]   And so Jesus teaches them.
[00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.660]   This is the disciples learning from the master himself.
[00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.160]   And what he teaches isn't just some, you know,
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.700]   some, you know, cheap, cutesy little prayer
[00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.140]   you say before you eat.
[00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.420]   But this is a prayer that shaken the whole entire world.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.820]   It's a prayer that's provided comfort and guidance
[00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.580]   and power for believers over the past 2,000 years
[00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.780]   and continues to do so today.
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.780]   This prayer has become a distinctive mark
[00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.300]   of what it means to be a follower of Jesus.
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.940]   And we often call it the Lord's Prayer,
[00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.740]   but I think actually a more appropriate name
[00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.240]   for it would be the Disciples' Prayer,
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.140]   because this is how Jesus taught his disciples,
[00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.820]   his followers, which means us in this room today,
[00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.320]   those of you who've given your life to Jesus,
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.740]   this is our prayer to him.
[00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.020]   This is a prayer that sits at the very heart
[00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.640]   of every body of Christ.
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.760]   So what did Jesus teach him?
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.280]   What are these words?
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.520]   Jesus said to them, he said this,
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.480]   when you pray, say, Father, hallowed be your name.
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.600]   Your kingdom come, give us each day our daily bread,
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.800]   forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.000]   who sins against us, and lead us not into temptation.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.120]   Now we could spend a whole other sermon series
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.240]   unpacking this prayer, seeing all the implications,
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.880]   but for today, I just want to highlight
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.060]   a few key concepts before we move on to the next part.
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.840]   Notice this, Jesus starts by addressing God as Father.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.880]   What Jesus is doing here is he teaches us
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.880]   the primary way we are to relate to God is as a father.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.480]   Now of course, this begs the question,
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.520]   what kind of a father is God?
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.780]   Because when it comes to our experiences
[00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.720]   with our earthly fathers, probably a lot of us
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.120]   in this room, many of us in this room
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.360]   will have different experience.
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.380]   Some of us have probably a great relationship
[00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:31.220]   with our fathers.
[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.720]   Our fathers were there for us,
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.200]   they were our biggest cheerleaders,
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.280]   supporters, provided for us.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.820]   That's a good father.
[00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.240]   But maybe some of us grew up with absent fathers.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.200]   We never knew our dad, or maybe perhaps even a father
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.600]   that was mean or abusive to us in many different ways.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.420]   Now of course, what Jesus wants to highlight
[00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.460]   is that God is the perfect father, the good father,
[00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.100]   the father who'd give good gifts,
[00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.620]   and we're gonna talk a bit more about this in a minute,
[00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.360]   but God is our father.
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.220]   Jesus wants to remind us of this.
[00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.920]   Then he says this, "Hallowed be your name.
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.680]   "Your kingdom come."
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.000]   What Jesus is trying to highlight here
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.840]   is trying to teach us that prayer
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.880]   is something bigger than ourselves.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.280]   Prayer is about acknowledging who God is,
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.160]   that he is the creator of this world.
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.360]   He is the one who's holy.
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.320]   He is the one who set apart.
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.620]   And prayer is also about knowing that the ultimate purpose
[00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.120]   of Jesus coming to this earth,
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.380]   the ultimate purpose of what God is trying to do right now
[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.760]   is to bring his kingdom here on this earth,
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.840]   to announce that Jesus is returning,
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.200]   to announce that God's kingdom is available
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.540]   to those who put their trust in him.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:47.020]   Next he tells us this, "Give us each day our daily bread."
[00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:51.560]   This is Jesus acknowledging God as our perfect provider.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.940]   It's actually Jesus sort of making a link
[00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.600]   all the way back to Exodus.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.000]   Remember in Exodus when the Israelites were leading,
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.280]   being led out of Egypt into the desert,
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.200]   into the promised land?
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.040]   Before they got there,
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.160]   they were wandering around in the desert.
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.100]   And what did God provide for them each and every single day?
[00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.020]   Exactly what they needed, daily bread, provision for them.
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.560]   Jesus knows exactly what we need.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.360]   He is our provider.
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.400]   Jesus reminds us of that.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.800]   So we can ask him for things.
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.560]   And we're gonna talk a bit more about that
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.520]   in a minute as well.
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.280]   Then he says this, "Forgive our sins.
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.600]   "Forgive everyone who sins against us."
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.040]   What Jesus is trying to highlight here
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.640]   is he's trying to remind us that prayer
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:37.280]   is also about building a relationship with God
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.800]   and about us building a relationship with each other.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.340]   You see, asking for forgiveness
[00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.360]   and being met with love and mercy
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.160]   is one of the greatest privileges we have
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.740]   as children of God, with God as our father.
[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:52.320]   That every time we come to him and ask for forgiveness
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.060]   and we repent and we come to him and we say,
[00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:56.540]   "Lord, I'm sorry.
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:57.380]   "Forgive me.
[00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:58.580]   "I want to do better."
[00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.260]   We are met with love and forgiveness and mercy.
[00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.500]   That's God's heart for us.
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.320]   And without that,
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.340]   without God offering his forgiveness to us,
[00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:07.780]   without Jesus dying on the cross
[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.060]   and his blood being poured out,
[00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.640]   there would be no forgiveness of sins.
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.540]   There would be no relationship.
[00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:14.220]   But because there is,
[00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.220]   we can have a relationship with God.
[00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:18.660]   Prayer is about relationship.
[00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:20.460]   And it's the same with each other.
[00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:23.020]   If we were always sinning against each other
[00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.500]   but never forgiving each other,
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.240]   that would lead to a breakdown in relationship as well.
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.580]   There would be no community
[00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:32.720]   without the forgiveness of sins with each other.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.940]   Finally, he says this, "Lead us not into temptation."
[00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.040]   Prayer is also about acknowledging the need
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:44.360]   for God's help in our spiritual battles.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.800]   We've been reminded a few times throughout this series
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.760]   and in recent weeks that spiritual battles
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.920]   are a part of everyday life.
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.000]   That we have an enemy trying to distract us,
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.600]   trying to destroy our relationship with Jesus.
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.560]   And prayer is one of the key ways,
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.640]   one of the best weapons we have
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.900]   against the schemes of the enemy.
[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.560]   So we pray for God to protect us from evil,
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.540]   keep us away from temptation and sin.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.240]   But there's one more thing that's important for us today.
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.840]   Notice that throughout the prayer, right,
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.880]   it's the use of plural that Jesus uses.
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:20.880]   It's talking about us.
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.600]   Give us this day our daily bread.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.260]   Give us, give us, give us.
[00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.040]   What Jesus is trying to remind us is that
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:31.100]   prayer is actually about the community coming together.
[00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.660]   It's not just our relationship with God,
[00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:38.000]   it's our relationship with each other as well.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.320]   So how do we build friendship?
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.640]   How do we build community?
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.980]   How do we take this prayer and apply it to our lives?
[00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:49.340]   And so with that being said, to continue our time together,
[00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:51.440]   I'm gonna invite some friends up on the stage
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.400]   to share the next part of this message with us.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.000]   So let's welcome Emma, Jethro, and Phil.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:57.840]   Where's Phil?
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:58.680]   All right, there we go.
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.480]   Okay, let's give them a big round of applause.
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.680]   (audience applauding)
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:06.680]   ♪ No one told you life was gonna be this way ♪
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.120]   ♪ You're gonna have to try ♪
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.440]   - Si got the message.
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.960]   Good, okay.
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:14.960]   Emma was thrown off by that this morning.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.440]   It's the best show on TV, I have to say.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.840]   Even after all these years,
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.840]   any time I put on Friends, it's always entertaining.
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.760]   I'm super excited to be together today,
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.160]   to be able to do this, and we've been talking about this
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.120]   and planning this for a while.
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.680]   Emma and Jethro, as you would have seen regularly
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:35.240]   on the stage, they lead us in worship week in and week out,
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:39.000]   but ahead of their heart and their skills and their talent
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.120]   for leading worship and their musicality,
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.760]   which probably two of the best worship leaders,
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.120]   if not in Hong Kong, maybe even the world, I would say.
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.680]   I'm not biased or anything.
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:53.680]   But it's really their heart for Jesus
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:57.800]   and their seriousness about their faith,
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.920]   their passion for the Lord that really shapes them
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:01.760]   as who they are.
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.920]   So I'm really appreciative of Emma and Jethro.
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.680]   And Phil, I'm not sure what Phil's doing here, but.
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.520]   (audience laughing)
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.360]   Phil leads our young adults.
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.840]   Those of you who've been baptized
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.360]   would have sat under his teaching in baptism as well.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.960]   Phil is one of those guys who,
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.600]   when everyone else is being silly, right?
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.640]   Phil's in the office reading his Bible,
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.000]   knows in the Bible, taking notes, doing all this stuff.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.720]   He has a heart of pure gold.
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.220]   I would trust Phil with my life, with everything.
[00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:33.440]   So I'm really glad to call him a friend as well.
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.440]   So, we've heard me talk.
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.520]   We started with talking about the Lord's Prayer,
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.480]   and that sort of sets up the tone
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.640]   for the conversation we wanna have today.
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.240]   But the parable we are looking at
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.800]   is called the parable of the friend at midnight.
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.840]   And so perhaps if you wanna start us, Phil,
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.240]   if you could read the parable to us,
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.520]   and we'll take the conversation on from there.
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:57.160]   - Yeah, so it starts from verse five.
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.920]   And Jesus said to them, "Suppose you have a friend,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   and you go to him at midnight and say,
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.360]   'Friend, lend me three loaves of bread.
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.800]   A friend of mine on a journey has come to me,
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.000]   and I have no food to offer him.'
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.740]   And suppose the one inside answers,
[00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:16.440]   'Don't bother me, the door is already locked,
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.680]   and my children and I are in bed.
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.480]   I can't get up and give you anything.'
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.280]   I tell you, even though he will not get up
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.780]   and give you the bread because of friendship,
[00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:29.640]   yet because of your shameless audacity,
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:33.480]   he will surely get up and give you as much as you need.
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:37.840]   And so I say to you, ask, and it will be given to you.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.080]   Seek, and you will find.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:43.360]   Knock, and a door will be opened to you.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.860]   For everyone who asks receives,
[00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.940]   the one who seeks finds,
[00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:51.760]   and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened."
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:52.600]   - Yeah, thanks, Phil.
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.080]   So, you know, as we've been realizing through the parables,
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.840]   right, it's always a very vivid imagery.
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.680]   You can imagine this being played out like a movie, right,
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.940]   like a scene that's being described very vividly,
[00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:05.120]   all the characters, all the stories.
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.240]   But it's often easy, you know,
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.760]   I think I find parables easy to understand sometimes
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.800]   if we sort of put it into our own context, right,
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.480]   insert ourselves into the story.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.240]   So, Phil, let's say, for example,
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.040]   this happened to you, all right?
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.680]   It's just been, it's been Saturday night,
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:23.480]   you know, 180 is over, you've been there all night,
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.940]   you've been posturing people, you're tired,
[00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:27.880]   you go home, you know, Cyril's still awake,
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.400]   so you had to put Cyril to sleep,
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.960]   and, you know, he was really hard to put to sleep,
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:35.040]   and you finally, everything is nice and quiet,
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.600]   and then suddenly, Jethro, you know,
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.760]   comes up and starts knocking on your door.
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:43.680]   Yeah, what would you do in that situation?
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.620]   - Saturday is probably the worst day
[00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:47.360]   to look for me after 180,
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.320]   and I'm sorry, Jethro, I like you a lot,
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:54.320]   you are the nicest person, but I will get super annoyed,
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:59.320]   and I will make up lots of excuses to make you go away.
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:02.640]   - Yeah. (audience laughing)
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:03.800]   Fair enough, fair enough, right,
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.280]   I would probably do the same, right,
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:09.360]   like the goal, right, to knock on someone's door
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.560]   at midnight to ask for something bread, you know,
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:14.840]   I think in the context of the story,
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:16.360]   it would have been even more annoying,
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:19.720]   because back then, houses were just one big room,
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.520]   and so everybody would have been sleeping
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.980]   on the floor together in, like, the living area,
[00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:25.280]   and apparently, you know, there were, like,
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:27.400]   the way the doors were made,
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.480]   it just made a lot of noise to open the door,
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.800]   all this kind of stuff would have been hugely annoying,
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.180]   the children would definitely have been woken up, right,
[00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:36.460]   this isn't even asking for the friend for himself,
[00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:38.120]   it's a friend of a friend who's come to visit,
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:40.320]   like, what's, you know, why are you bothering with this man?
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.200]   Right, so it's just hugely annoying,
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:47.200]   completely unreasonable, and so you wouldn't expect
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.640]   a reasonable response, right, you would expect Phil
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.540]   or anyone else in their right mind to be like,
[00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:55.680]   go away, you know, stop bugging me, come back tomorrow,
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.760]   or, you know, I'm not talking to you right now,
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.480]   put the phone on do not disturb, right,
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.980]   and just leave it at that, which is precisely
[00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:07.980]   why this story is so weird, because that is not
[00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:11.440]   the response that this person is faced with, right,
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.500]   you would think it would end by saying, go away,
[00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:17.200]   but it's not, right, in the end, the person who asks
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.540]   gets what he needs, and gets what he asked for in the end,
[00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:23.600]   so, you know, why do you think Jesus tells this story
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.600]   in this way, right, it's kind of weird,
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.280]   it's kind of doesn't make sense to us.
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:31.040]   - Yeah, it is pretty weird, and I mean,
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:34.400]   the scripture does say it kind of low-key validates
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.880]   your shadiness, 'cause it's like, you know,
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.480]   the friend is like, no, you can go away now,
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.620]   we're sleeping, I'll find you some other time,
[00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:44.200]   but verse eight, actually, Jesus highlights that,
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.960]   even though the friend doesn't get up to help
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.660]   out of a desire to be a good friend or whatever,
[00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:55.660]   he does, indeed, eventually get up, and it reads,
[00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:58.020]   even though he will not get up and give you the bread
[00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:01.260]   because of friendship, yet because of your shameless
[00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.220]   audacity, he will surely get up and give you
[00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:07.780]   as much as you need, and as we were kind of reading
[00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:10.060]   through this, I was looking at that phrase,
[00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:14.400]   shameless audacity, and I was pulling out, like,
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.420]   different translations of the Bible, 'cause they always
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:19.820]   have, like, different words of it, so that's just
[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:21.660]   a good tip if you're reading your Bible,
[00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:24.100]   and there's a part that's interesting or weird,
[00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:26.420]   just look at other translations to get a sense
[00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.580]   of what the full meaning of the word is,
[00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:32.880]   but anyway, I was doing that, and different versions
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:36.100]   have different words for that, so shameless audacity,
[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:37.620]   persistence,
[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:42.280]   boldness,
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:45.380]   a number of other words that are, like, SAT words,
[00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:47.300]   too fancy for me, and I can't remember,
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.800]   but the sense of it is this notion of someone
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:53.480]   who's so persistent to the point of annoyance,
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.260]   so think of, like, the picture of a kid who's like,
[00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.560]   dad, can we have ice cream for dinner,
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:16:59.920]   can we have ice cream for dinner,
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:02.420]   can we have ice cream for dinner, are we there yet,
[00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:05.860]   you know, like, that consistent push,
[00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:09.620]   and I think the first thing that that taught me,
[00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:12.300]   or that I, that that highlighted for me
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:15.620]   about what Jesus is teaching his disciples about prayer
[00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:18.220]   is just having the audacity to ask,
[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:21.300]   like, daring to approach him at all.
[00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:25.640]   In this story, the scenario really doesn't make sense,
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:29.460]   it takes shameless audacity because it just doesn't
[00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:32.180]   make sense to bother someone at midnight
[00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:34.820]   for three loaves of bread, like, the situation
[00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.900]   doesn't make sense, the request doesn't seem proportional,
[00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:40.220]   you can really wait a couple more hours
[00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:42.780]   and find me when the sun rises, like,
[00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:45.100]   it's not that far away from, like, 5 a.m.,
[00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:47.260]   when probably they would've been up,
[00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.340]   but it's just Jesus encouraging them,
[00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:52.260]   when it doesn't seem like it's important enough,
[00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:55.980]   when the circumstances are not favorable,
[00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:59.340]   when it seems like it'll be too mafan to do it,
[00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:02.780]   do it anyway, right, like, the, just he,
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:06.180]   first he's just inviting them and encouraging them
[00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:09.700]   to come, have the audacity to come.
[00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:12.180]   But then the second thing I realized,
[00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:14.340]   I went further into my rabbit hole of, like,
[00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:16.220]   translations and what actually do you mean
[00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:19.540]   shameless audacity and fell on the Greek bandwagon,
[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:22.340]   and I don't speak Greek, so just looking at scholars
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.180]   who were looking at that phrase, and it turns out
[00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:28.180]   that another way you could interpret the sentence,
[00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:31.580]   in this version it says, because of your shameless audacity
[00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.220]   you will surely get up, but another way to interpret
[00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:37.900]   that phrase is to say, because the person doesn't wanna
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:41.020]   be put to shame, they will get up.
[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:43.540]   So kind of the sense of, they didn't wanna lose face,
[00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.820]   and so they end up, even though they don't want to
[00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:47.220]   and don't feel like it, they get up.
[00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:50.500]   Now, God, what I'm not saying is that's how God thinks,
[00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.980]   and we'll get to that later, that's not necessarily God,
[00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:56.940]   but I think what this did remind me of is how,
[00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:59.300]   in scripture, when people approach God,
[00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:02.860]   often they approached him on the basis of his character,
[00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:05.420]   rather than their own persistence.
[00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:07.700]   So you have Moses, when he's interceding,
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.980]   and God is like, I'm just gonna wipe everybody out,
[00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:11.900]   we're gonna start over, they're not my people,
[00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:15.340]   forget about them, and Moses is like, cool, cool, cool, cool,
[00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:18.400]   but what are people gonna say about you?
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.940]   What are they gonna say about you bringing these people
[00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:23.100]   all the way here, are they gonna say that you weren't
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.500]   able to keep them, so you killed them all off?
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.420]   So that intercession moment wasn't really about
[00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:32.140]   Moses being so deep and so good, even,
[00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:34.900]   or so kind that he could intercede for others,
[00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:37.700]   it was about him understanding the character of God
[00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:41.700]   and saying, yeah, but these people represent you,
[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:43.920]   so what does this say about you?
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:46.940]   Similarly, in later times, when David is praying,
[00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:50.260]   he says, have mercy on me, not because I deserve it,
[00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:52.580]   but out of your unfailing love.
[00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:55.920]   So this second kind of facet of approaching prayer
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:59.720]   based on who God is, and that making up the foundation,
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.740]   that giving us the courage, even if we're not there,
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:05.940]   he is, that we can approach him.
[00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:08.780]   - Yeah, I think one good thing to remember is,
[00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:12.220]   you know, the nature, why Jesus told stories in parables
[00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:14.780]   was because often there was like this subversive message
[00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:17.500]   behind what he was trying to say, and so the idea
[00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.860]   of approaching God with shameless audacity,
[00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:21.740]   just approaching him, would have been completely
[00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:24.400]   countercultural to what people were used to at the time,
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.380]   with sacrifices and all these rituals you had to go to
[00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:29.880]   before you could enter the temple and all this kind of stuff
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:32.120]   but what Jesus is saying, no, just go up to him,
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.800]   just approach him, it's fine, you know,
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.840]   because of his character, we can go to him
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.120]   with the things that we need.
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.080]   Now, of course, that grows out to the other part,
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.900]   the other side of that coin is, now, when we do go to him
[00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:46.360]   with things we need, right, when we ask him for these
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:49.480]   crazy, shameless, you know, things that we are,
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:52.840]   like we seem to be, that seem to be unreasonable,
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.320]   when we go to God with these kind of requests,
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:58.960]   what kind of response can we expect to have from him?
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.900]   And I know, you know, Jethro, you, Phil, also have
[00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:04.820]   had those sort of experiences where you've gone to God
[00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:07.120]   with something, something ridiculous,
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.820]   and you've prayed about it, and in those times,
[00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:12.860]   you know, how do you feel like God has responded to you?
[00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:17.860]   >> Yeah, I think Phil's example is a more serious example.
[00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:21.740]   Well, so mine was a few years, quite a few years back.
[00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:24.420]   The background is my family having a financial situation,
[00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:27.860]   a hardship, and because I was reading the Bible,
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:30.340]   and then this part, right, 'cause he says,
[00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:32.920]   "Ask and it will be given to you."
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:35.700]   And then so I was thinking, okay, I need money.
[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.580]   And not just me, right, like my family needs money.
[00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:40.340]   So I was asking God for $1 million.
[00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:44.860]   Like, you guys are like, "What, is that serious?"
[00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:48.180]   But I was genuinely serious at that point, like,
[00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:52.660]   Lord, can you ask, I'm asking for $1 million, can you,
[00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:54.820]   'cause you know you hear stories of people
[00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:58.940]   receiving mysterious money, and suddenly your bank account
[00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:03.500]   grows a few zeros, and that's what I was expecting.
[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:07.360]   So there was a period in my life where whenever I go
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:10.620]   to the ATM and I plug in my card, put in the pin,
[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:12.700]   and I was like, is this the same?
[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:14.140]   Yeah, it's still the same.
[00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:16.300]   $1 million's not there yet.
[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:18.820]   >> But after you get married, it's like the opposite.
[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:21.580]   It just keeps going down and down and down.
[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:22.980]   Okay, carry on, sorry.
[00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.020]   >> Noted, noted.
[00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:26.620]   >> He's getting ready, so anyway.
[00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:32.180]   >> No, but then like, I think that I was genuinely asking,
[00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:34.900]   because God says, like Emma said, like, you're asking
[00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:36.180]   not because of your persistence,
[00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:38.020]   but because of what God has said, right?
[00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:41.580]   And clearly He said, "Ask, and it will be given to you."
[00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:44.380]   So I'm like, Lord, you said this,
[00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:46.940]   and so now I'm asking you, right?
[00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:50.260]   So if I don't ask, He won't give.
[00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:52.660]   >> What was that, you miss the shots?
[00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:53.940]   You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.
[00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:56.080]   >> Yeah, yeah, that's right, yeah.
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:59.940]   >> But He didn't give me, He hasn't given me yet.
[00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:02.980]   But I think throughout the process,
[00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:04.420]   like I wasn't just asking,
[00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:07.500]   I was genuinely listening to His answers.
[00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:11.220]   I was asking, Lord, if like, I genuinely need
[00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:13.900]   like your support, your provision,
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:17.520]   we need like as a family, but then how are you
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:22.480]   going to provide, and not by that one million instant money,
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:25.720]   but I think throughout that period,
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:29.540]   He's teaching me like, okay, He's put people around me,
[00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:31.280]   He's put circumstances around me.
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.960]   I have, I think at that time I was looking for a job,
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.700]   and then I got a job.
[00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:38.920]   So like, you know, those things are His answers
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:42.080]   to my question of, to my actually deeper question,
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.440]   Lord, will you provide?
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:44.880]   It's not actually about the one million,
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.280]   but if I didn't ask for the one million dollars
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.900]   that seemed ridiculous, I wouldn't have gotten
[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:53.040]   to the point where I'm actually coming to God
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:55.960]   with a need, like a vulnerability,
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:59.080]   like Lord, I need you to provide, I need you to come through.
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:04.280]   So yeah, I think the way that He answers is different,
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:08.200]   and, but you don't get to that answer until you ask.
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.800]   So yeah, what about you, Phil?
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:15.080]   >> Yeah, I can relate to, well, I like to call it
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:20.000]   unanswered prayers, because in my situation,
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.880]   as many of you might know, I have a chronic health condition
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:27.020]   and so I pray about it every day.
[00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:29.720]   My wife, Chris, prays about it.
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:32.760]   The staff team, we've all prayed about it.
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:37.760]   And the awkward elephant is that He has heard the prayer
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:42.440]   and decided to kind of leave me hanging.
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:47.380]   And that kind of creates this, just not wanting
[00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:49.240]   to kind of come to Him.
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:53.040]   And I struggle in the area of kind of unanswered prayers
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:57.560]   a lot, and if I even talk about it a little bit more,
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:01.880]   it gets very dangerous when it starts to,
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:05.640]   when I make it about me, when I think,
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:09.760]   actually, He's not healing, He's not doing something.
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.660]   He doesn't love me.
[00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:18.300]   And so paradoxically, actually, to get out of this trouble,
[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:21.420]   to stay away from trouble, it's to ask even more,
[00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:22.980]   it's to pray even more.
[00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:25.900]   And over the 30 years of having eczema
[00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:30.220]   and praying about it every day, I've realized that,
[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:34.620]   actually, I need Him more than I need Him to heal me
[00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:36.300]   and meet my health need.
[00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:40.820]   And prayer just kind of takes me away
[00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:44.140]   from the center of the universe, the sense of existence,
[00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:48.560]   and it puts God back into the center of existence.
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.860]   - You know, that's really good, Phil.
[00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:55.860]   I think both Jethro and Phil sharing from their experiences,
[00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:58.540]   Phil, going back to the Lord's Prayer, right?
[00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:00.740]   God has provided, that your daily bread,
[00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:03.700]   you're sitting here today speaking to us,
[00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:06.460]   each and every single step of the way, God has provided.
[00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:08.880]   I know, Phil, in your struggles, I was with you
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.380]   in the hospital some of those times
[00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:14.340]   when those flare-ups were just so unbearable.
[00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:16.660]   But to be sitting here today again, right,
[00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:18.980]   and we're still praying as a staff.
[00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:21.300]   I pray for you sometimes, you know,
[00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:23.380]   maybe not as often as I should,
[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:25.420]   but when God reminds me, I do pray for you,
[00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:26.740]   and people are praying for you.
[00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:30.740]   So that's an ongoing thing we have, right,
[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:33.460]   in our relationship with each other
[00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.700]   and in our relationship with God as well.
[00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:38.660]   But I think often, going back to what we were talking about
[00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:40.440]   before as well, there are things that sort of,
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:42.160]   and maybe you guys can relate too,
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:45.720]   things that sort of stop us from taking that first step
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:47.620]   in the first place, right,
[00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:50.080]   to actually ask God for something.
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:53.000]   You know, can I ask God about this?
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.340]   You know, will He even listen?
[00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:55.920]   Is this too big or too small?
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:57.960]   And maybe, Emma, you could share a bit more
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:00.120]   about your thoughts on what are some of those things
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:03.400]   that stop us from initially even engaging with God
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:06.260]   in that conversation of asking about something for prayer,
[00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:07.760]   in prayer? - Yeah.
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:10.260]   I'm sure there's like a million things we can come up with.
[00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:11.940]   I can think of like four or five.
[00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:16.100]   I think the first thing is the,
[00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:18.980]   we are a people, as a generation,
[00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:22.320]   I think that are in our head a lot more
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:23.780]   than maybe generations before us,
[00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:27.020]   so we plan a lot, we live here quite a bit.
[00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:28.960]   And so I think a lot of the times,
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.900]   one obstacle to prayer that's super simple
[00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:33.160]   is just you think about it and you don't do it.
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.040]   Like, you just, you don't, like, you're like,
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:36.760]   oh, yeah, I'll pray about that.
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:40.740]   And then life happens and kids and whatever,
[00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:41.580]   and then you forget.
[00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:44.200]   I remember we had a staff d'evil on Tuesday
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.800]   and I was in the middle of singing a song,
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:48.420]   and as I'm singing a song, I'm reminded of,
[00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:51.300]   I see a colleague and I'm reminded of a need they have
[00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:53.820]   and I make a mental note, like, okay, you know,
[00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:56.400]   in mid-song, like, I will shout for them,
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:58.000]   yeah, I'll pray for them, you know,
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.040]   maybe after this song, after this moment.
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:01.840]   And I remember the Holy Spirit reminding me,
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.340]   actually, you can pray now.
[00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:06.600]   You're talking to me now about how you're gonna do
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.480]   this later, so why don't you just do it
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:09.760]   while you're talking about it?
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:12.240]   So I think this, like, there's a sense of urgency
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.420]   and immediacy to prayer.
[00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:16.200]   We tend to think, we like to do things
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.400]   after we've thought through all of the steps
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.840]   and we've come up with all of the best ways to do it,
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:22.780]   and with prayer, it really is something
[00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:24.600]   that you learn as you do it.
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:28.720]   And so instead of planning to pray, pray, right?
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:31.240]   Like, that's a better use of time than to say,
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.080]   the three minutes it takes you to write down,
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.540]   like, oh, what is that request?
[00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:37.660]   Like, you really can pray at any time,
[00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:40.100]   in the midst of any situation.
[00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:41.700]   So that's probably one.
[00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:46.700]   Another one would be that we don't think we need him, right?
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:48.660]   Technology is really good.
[00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:50.920]   We're not at the place in the world or in history
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:54.860]   where you need the Lord for clean water.
[00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:56.620]   Like, you don't have to pray for your water
[00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:57.980]   to be poison-free.
[00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:00.940]   And so we think, mistakenly, I think,
[00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:04.480]   that because we are not as aware of our need of him,
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.340]   that our need has lessened.
[00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:09.740]   And so, you know, he's strengthened,
[00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:14.740]   and it is his provision that there are less tangible needs,
[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:16.540]   but we need him no less.
[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:19.100]   So I think to those of us that sometimes feel like,
[00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:20.900]   actually, I'm pretty good, I'm doing okay,
[00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:23.460]   and I'm not really reminded of how much I need him,
[00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:24.940]   I'm not in a dire situation,
[00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:28.500]   I think he would say, without me, you can do nothing.
[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:29.700]   Absolutely nothing.
[00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:31.660]   So like, not like you can do some things
[00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:34.420]   or you can do a little bit of things, right?
[00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:37.720]   And it's just, it's that working up that muscle
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:40.360]   to be reminded that we need him.
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:43.760]   I think another reason is that we are afraid
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:46.680]   'cause whatever we're asking for help for,
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.120]   we got ourselves in that situation.
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:51.320]   Maybe he told you not to do it, and you did it anyway,
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:52.600]   and now you're in this situation,
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:54.280]   and you're like, ah, it's kind of awkward
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.240]   to go back to you now.
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:00.560]   But what we heard last week, that parable
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:03.980]   about a father who's open and who's waiting,
[00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:05.920]   and I don't think there's a parent here
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:10.140]   whose child, having gone as far away as possible,
[00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:12.120]   turns and goes back to them, who would be like,
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:13.880]   nah, you went too far.
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:18.240]   Like, whatever condition you're in, when you turn,
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:20.720]   that you turn, is what he cares about,
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:22.820]   it's what he wants, right?
[00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:25.520]   And then I think another thing is,
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:28.000]   we might actually doubt, like, can he do it?
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.080]   What's this gonna change?
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.920]   And to that, I'm reminded of the father
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:35.680]   who asked Jesus to heal his son,
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:38.860]   and he ends up praying, and his prayer is,
[00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:40.900]   I believe, but help my unbelief.
[00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:42.600]   So it's okay, even if I'm not sure.
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.980]   If I'm like, yeah, they said Jesus might heal,
[00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:48.100]   but maybe he won't, and I don't know if he will,
[00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:50.260]   so I'm just not gonna bother.
[00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:51.940]   Still coming to him.
[00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:54.220]   And then the biggest one, I think, for me,
[00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:57.460]   that I think, in terms of where we are in Hong Kong,
[00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:01.100]   and just as a, I don't know, generation of people,
[00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:06.100]   is the fear of being a burden is such a big, big hurdle
[00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:09.800]   for people when it comes to bringing our needs
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:12.160]   to one another and to God.
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:16.060]   I have not met a people that are so stuck
[00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:19.240]   on being self-sufficient, like we are,
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:20.480]   generally as this generation,
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:23.120]   but also Hong Kong is like, next, next.
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:26.300]   Like, it's like, you know, love the Lord your God,
[00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:27.560]   and then don't be mafan.
[00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:31.600]   That's how the commandments work here.
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:37.280]   We really hate feeling like we're imposing
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:38.980]   or being a burden on one another.
[00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:40.580]   We can't stand the notion of,
[00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:42.220]   ah, what are people gonna think?
[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:45.080]   And I think that becomes something we carry,
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:48.860]   maybe subconsciously with us, into a relationship with God,
[00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:51.140]   where it's like, ah, that's gonna be bothersome.
[00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:54.860]   Oh, that's gonna be, you know, he's gonna not,
[00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:55.940]   it's gonna bother him.
[00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:58.040]   And I think there it's really helpful
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:02.080]   that he is not actually the grumpy friend
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:05.080]   that is annoyed with us at midnight, right?
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:06.920]   He's a father.
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:10.920]   >> Yeah, if I can add on to the self-sufficiency nature
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:14.160]   of why we don't tend to pray.
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.080]   Another one, it's, you know,
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:19.000]   as self-preservation creatures,
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.440]   we love to self-preserve in a way
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:25.520]   where we don't want to further humiliate ourselves
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:27.820]   when we've been turned down the first time.
[00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:31.940]   And so what we do is, you know, we don't ask anymore.
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:36.140]   And yet, Jesus teaching about this shameless audacity,
[00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:38.100]   he's actually not just teaching it,
[00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:39.540]   but he models it himself.
[00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:44.540]   If we think about the prayers that he did near his death,
[00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:46.580]   the one at the Mount Olives,
[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:51.100]   Father, if you're willing, could you take away that cop?
[00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:53.740]   That blows my mind.
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:56.460]   Another one to really think about, you know,
[00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:59.200]   the one on the cross,
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:01.600]   Father, forgive them for they didn't know
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:03.120]   what they were doing.
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:05.600]   That shameless audacity, that is, you know,
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:10.600]   being so vulnerable at the cost of being humiliated by all.
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:13.520]   And so he is modeling us something
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:15.120]   that he could do himself,
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:18.660]   and it proves to us that we could also do it.
[00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:20.280]   And he could do it so well
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:22.240]   because he knows the Father's heart.
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:26.140]   And I think that would be the direction we ought to take.
[00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:29.560]   - And just one more thing about being self-sufficient.
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:34.220]   I think, especially when unanswered prayers come up,
[00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:36.740]   I think it's so easy to stop praying.
[00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:39.060]   It's so easy to stop asking.
[00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:42.740]   It's so easy to be self-sufficient in that,
[00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:45.140]   okay, he's not answering my prayers.
[00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:46.220]   I will take over.
[00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:47.640]   I will provide for myself.
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:49.020]   I will strategize.
[00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:50.060]   I will plan.
[00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:51.900]   I will try to do it on my own strength.
[00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:56.900]   But then you end up taking your life into your own hands.
[00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:59.900]   And I think that's not what he wants.
[00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:02.480]   That's not what he wants for us to grow into.
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:05.740]   He wants us to grow into dependence on him every day.
[00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:09.260]   And so I think being persistent,
[00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:10.620]   I think part of it is also like
[00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:13.180]   when your prayers are not answered,
[00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:15.080]   when my prayers are not answered,
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:17.100]   we persist in listening to him.
[00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:19.740]   We persist in asking him, like Phil said,
[00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:24.660]   even there's pain and heartbreak and disappointment,
[00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:27.020]   but you don't turn away from God
[00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:28.420]   because when you turn away from God,
[00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:31.300]   there will be so many other things that will distract you
[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:34.100]   and eventually take the place of God.
[00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:38.940]   But yeah, just being vulnerable and persistent in this age.
[00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:41.780]   - And the reason we can do that, right,
[00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:43.940]   going back to God's character is because
[00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:47.180]   as people of faith, as followers of Jesus, right,
[00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:50.100]   as Christians, we know God's character, right?
[00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:53.340]   That's the thing that sits at the center of our faith.
[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:54.820]   We know God's character.
[00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:57.940]   We know that we can relate to him as a good father.
[00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:00.580]   Like I said, many, perhaps when we talk about
[00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:02.180]   our earthly fathers, there could be
[00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:04.100]   a bunch of different reactions, you know,
[00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:07.260]   maybe that triggers something really, really horrible
[00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:10.180]   in our experiences of fatherhood.
[00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:12.940]   But God is a good father, right?
[00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:15.340]   And we have to put our faith and trust in that,
[00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:16.780]   and which is why he goes on to say this, right?
[00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:20.080]   Which of you fathers, if your son asked for fish,
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:22.020]   would give him a snake instead?
[00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:24.100]   Or if he asked for an egg, would give him a scorpion?
[00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:26.380]   This is how you know, by the way, Jesus wasn't Chinese,
[00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:28.660]   'cause like snakes and scorpions are kind of edible
[00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:29.900]   as well, I guess, right?
[00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:32.060]   [audience laughing]
[00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:34.080]   Snake, sometimes people will eat snake
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:35.340]   instead of a fish, even, right?
[00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:36.180]   Anyway.
[00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:40.300]   Oh, okay, but you know, no father would do that, right?
[00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:42.420]   No, would give something bad in the place of something good.
[00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:43.780]   That's the point, okay?
[00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:45.940]   If then you, though you are evil,
[00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:48.340]   know how to give good gifts to your children,
[00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:50.880]   how much more will your father in heaven
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:55.040]   give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him, right?
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:58.680]   So it's like God going even, when you ask him for stuff,
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:00.640]   he knows you best, he is your father.
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:04.640]   He knows even better than what you think you need, right?
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:06.800]   It's like Isaiah bugging me for days,
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:07.640]   and is it Friday yet?
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:09.080]   'Cause on Friday we eat cereal, right?
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:10.000]   Can I have cereal today?
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.600]   Is this day the end of the week, you know?
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:14.960]   And like, every day he's asking me for that cereal,
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:17.080]   'cause that's all he wants to eat, right?
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:18.300]   But he gets it once a week,
[00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:19.820]   because if he ate it every week,
[00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:22.980]   every day, it wouldn't be good for his health,
[00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:24.060]   for his body, right?
[00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:26.180]   So sometimes when we ask for things,
[00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:29.320]   we have to always keep in mind the character of God, right?
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.900]   That he knows best, and what he gives us
[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:34.820]   is provisions for what we need, right?
[00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:38.700]   Daily bread, things that he knows are good for us.
[00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:41.380]   Now from our limited wisdom and perspective,
[00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:43.860]   we might not always see in that way,
[00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:47.720]   but when we pray to the Father, he responds in love.
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:49.640]   Not like a, and the whole point of the parable
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:51.920]   is God is not a grumpy friend, right?
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:55.440]   God is not someone you have to beg and nag and persist,
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:57.400]   right, in order to get what you want.
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:00.120]   He is the complete opposite of that, right?
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:02.840]   His heart for you, right, like you were saying earlier,
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:05.520]   I'm like, promised her last week, right, is delighting.
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:07.360]   Right, my son's coming knocking at midnight.
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:08.640]   Yes, I'm gonna open the door.
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:09.760]   There's a feast for him, right?
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:11.440]   Everything's already been ready.
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.320]   I've been welcoming this.
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:16.640]   Much more so than a grumpy friend who only reacts
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:18.060]   'cause you've been too annoying,
[00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:22.500]   and finally he has to get up and answer you, right,
[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:24.280]   just to keep you quiet.
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:26.800]   - Yeah, my son's name is Cyril,
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:30.820]   and when I'm thinking about how he asks me of things
[00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:34.980]   in his position as a son, he doesn't really overthink it.
[00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:39.140]   You know, we always do that kind of work in our head
[00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:42.260]   when we do our prayer, but Cyril doesn't.
[00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:45.120]   And, you know, that's probably the perfect way
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:47.480]   to do sonship and daughtership,
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:49.860]   to know that he wants us past midnight.
[00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:52.440]   He wants us when all the shops are closed,
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:53.580]   the doors are locked,
[00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:56.120]   everybody else in the world is sleeping.
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:38:00.060]   He just wants us always, and that's why we can come to him.
[00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:04.140]   - Yeah, so how does the Holy,
[00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:06.700]   but what does the Holy Spirit have to do with this, Sanjay?
[00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:08.900]   Because at the end it tells us, you know,
[00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:10.740]   he'll give you the Holy Spirit.
[00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:13.220]   So when it comes to the Holy Spirit,
[00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:16.140]   obviously there's something in the gift of the Holy Spirit
[00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:19.660]   that empowers us to be able to approach God
[00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:22.300]   and to pray to him, and that sort of influences
[00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.380]   the way we pray to God.
[00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:26.540]   - Yeah, I think just the key part that I notice
[00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:30.260]   is like when you see the passage,
[00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:32.820]   in the first, Jesus teaches about the prayer, right,
[00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:34.540]   the Lord's Prayer, and then he's like,
[00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:36.020]   "Give us this day our daily bread,"
[00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:37.740]   and then the next thing, the parable,
[00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:40.300]   is saying this friend asking for bread.
[00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:41.820]   And then in the end he says,
[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:43.420]   "How much more will your Father in Heaven
[00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:44.580]   "give the Holy Spirit?"
[00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:47.900]   So in my head it's like, what are you asking for, bread?
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:49.540]   What are you asking for, bread?
[00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:51.340]   What is the Father gonna give, Holy Spirit?
[00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:53.980]   So then in my head it's like, the Holy Spirit
[00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:56.420]   is the bread that we need every day in our lives
[00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:58.540]   as Christians, as followers of Jesus,
[00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:01.580]   because he's the one that will help us,
[00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:02.940]   like your experience, right?
[00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:07.100]   He will be the one that will shape our prayers.
[00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:09.020]   He's the one that's answering our prayers,
[00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:10.580]   and he's the one that's teaching us how to pray
[00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:11.480]   at the same time.
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:15.740]   But yeah, we need, I think eventually we need him
[00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:17.900]   more than we realize we need bread.
[00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:22.420]   >> Yeah, 'cause without the Holy Spirit, right,
[00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:23.620]   I think what Emma was doing,
[00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:26.620]   without God we can do nothing, you know?
[00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:29.940]   And so the Holy Spirit is what binds us together,
[00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:31.940]   it's what God has given to all of us,
[00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:35.700]   how he provides for everybody, through the Holy Spirit.
[00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:38.180]   Now Emma, maybe going back to the communal part
[00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:42.940]   of this prayer then, you mentioned something earlier
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:46.900]   about self-preservation, about that being something
[00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:49.460]   that we don't often talk to each other
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:50.720]   about the things we need, right?
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:52.900]   There is maybe perhaps a little bit of shame
[00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:55.540]   in coming to a group of friends and saying,
[00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:57.340]   oh actually, I can't afford this,
[00:39:57.340 --> 00:40:01.940]   or actually, I'm sick, can you help me with something?
[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:05.300]   As a person who's here in Hong Kong without family,
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:07.860]   when you came to this city, perhaps maybe share
[00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:09.100]   a little bit about your experience
[00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:14.100]   about how you being vulnerable and inviting the community,
[00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:17.260]   hopefully we've been a good friend to you
[00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:18.780]   and that you'd be terrible, you'd say,
[00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:20.140]   nobody ever helped me in nothing,
[00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:22.220]   I have to do everything by myself, right?
[00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:25.140]   But how has your community around you,
[00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:27.140]   when you presented those needs, right,
[00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:29.500]   and how did you see God work through,
[00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:31.660]   how the Holy Spirit worked through the community
[00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:35.340]   and people around you into answering some of your needs,
[00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:37.820]   some of your prayers at that time?
[00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:41.020]   - Yeah, that's, wow, I didn't see that question coming.
[00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:45.420]   This is an area where I've been whooped into shape,
[00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:50.420]   like vulnerability and dependence on God
[00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:54.180]   through dependence on his family, the church,
[00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:56.580]   because I, like if you didn't know, I live in Hong Kong,
[00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:59.940]   but my whole family isn't here, so it's just me, right?
[00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:04.580]   My biological family isn't here, and so, I mean, man,
[00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:09.580]   there have been so many, so many instances of being sick,
[00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:14.860]   being, like needing money, needing people to talk to,
[00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:17.620]   not knowing, I'm not only away from home,
[00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:21.140]   I'm also from a culture that's not the most open
[00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:22.740]   about talking about your problems,
[00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:24.780]   so it's like you kind of, like you struggle,
[00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:25.860]   you take it to Jesus.
[00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:28.540]   I'm also a preacher's kid, so I was taught, you know,
[00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:30.660]   you need help, you go find Jesus,
[00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:33.860]   Jesus doesn't answer, you wait until he does,
[00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:38.860]   that's it, so that's just kind of how I,
[00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:41.220]   it's been good in some ways for my prayer life
[00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:43.900]   and dependence on him and my realization
[00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:46.340]   that when he meets me, even if it's through people,
[00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:50.940]   that it is his provision, but I think one of the
[00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:55.940]   probably wildest moments for me was around,
[00:41:55.940 --> 00:42:00.420]   I think 2002, around 2002, this is,
[00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:04.260]   we were in the middle of COVID, so our doors were closed
[00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:06.300]   and we had, huh?
[00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:07.380]   - 2022? - Yeah.
[00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:10.780]   - 2022, not 2002. - Oh, what did I say?
[00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:11.620]   Oh, oops.
[00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:13.380]   - Yeah. - Oh, two, two.
[00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:18.220]   Sorry, 2022, so we are in the middle of the whole craze
[00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:19.860]   and the church doors are closed,
[00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:23.460]   we've just finished recording an Easter special,
[00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:26.580]   so that Easter Sunday, we didn't have to be
[00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:28.700]   in the auditorium, everybody watched it online,
[00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:31.180]   and I'm thinking, and Easter Monday, it's a holiday,
[00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:33.100]   so I'm thinking, oh, I'm just gonna get up late
[00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:36.340]   and we're gonna get brunch and then I'm gonna lounge around.
[00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:38.700]   I think the next day, I was hanging out with Balana,
[00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:41.300]   so it was like a whole weekend, I was excited,
[00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:45.660]   and that Easter Sunday, I started to feel unwell.
[00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:49.780]   And I was, I didn't know what it was,
[00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:51.380]   like I couldn't, it wasn't the kind of unwell
[00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:54.700]   where you can say I have a headache or I just felt off.
[00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:57.180]   And so, and it was so off that I texted a few friends,
[00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:59.220]   I think I texted Balana, Jeth, or Michelle,
[00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:01.140]   I'm like, hey guys, I'm gonna take a nap,
[00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:06.140]   but I feel so weird that in an hour, call me, just check,
[00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:07.980]   and they're like, whoa, what's going on?
[00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:09.340]   I'm like, I don't know, but I'm tired,
[00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:10.180]   so I'm gonna take a nap,
[00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:11.220]   and when I wake up, we'll deal with it.
[00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:13.220]   So I took a nap, anyway, the next day,
[00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:15.820]   I go to the ER to figure out what's going on,
[00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:18.180]   and I'm thinking this is gonna be quick,
[00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:19.900]   I'm gonna go in, they're gonna figure out,
[00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:22.140]   or they're gonna tell me it's fine, get some painkillers,
[00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:23.380]   and then I'm gonna go get my brunch,
[00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:25.460]   like this is properly the plan.
[00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:29.020]   I walk into the ER, and less than five minutes in,
[00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:30.900]   they rush me to see a doctor,
[00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:32.260]   and I didn't realize until later,
[00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:35.820]   that's really, really, you should be afraid.
[00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:38.940]   It doesn't, it was a public hospital on a public holiday,
[00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:41.240]   usually it's not that fast.
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:44.820]   So I get in, and like, they rush me through,
[00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:46.780]   and it's all these tests, all this crazy,
[00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:48.980]   essentially the doctor goes,
[00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:51.160]   looking at your symptoms, and looking at what you've shared,
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:52.780]   you've either just had a heart attack,
[00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:53.940]   or you've had a stroke.
[00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:59.940]   And, and you have to, we're gonna have to keep you.
[00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:01.780]   And we're in the middle of COVID,
[00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:04.300]   so imagine the craziness of like,
[00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:06.380]   you don't wanna be in a hospital,
[00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:10.740]   like away in a local hospital, so it's mostly Cantonese,
[00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:11.580]   they speak English,
[00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:13.700]   but they're more comfortable with Cantonese.
[00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:15.420]   And I didn't know I was gonna be,
[00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:16.420]   it was gonna be this dramatic,
[00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:17.620]   I was just being precautious.
[00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:21.960]   So now I have to text my community, right?
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:23.460]   'Cause I didn't tell them, I was like,
[00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:24.740]   I don't feel well, I'm a grownup,
[00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:25.660]   I can go to the hospital.
[00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:27.460]   And then I'll enforce a text.
[00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:29.980]   Hey guys, I'm in the hospital,
[00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:33.120]   and I'm gonna get hospitalized.
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:34.140]   And they just, you know,
[00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:36.420]   kind of give them the little rundown of it.
[00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:40.180]   And I'm, you know, like half in tears as I'm typing it,
[00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:42.340]   I don't know what to do, don't know, what do you,
[00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:43.260]   what do you say?
[00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:46.060]   But I think I found that through their,
[00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:47.400]   'cause nobody could come to me,
[00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:49.820]   it was definitely like, it's COVID,
[00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:52.060]   so like nobody can get anywhere in a hospital.
[00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:53.620]   But through their prayers,
[00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:57.340]   and I had lawyer friends like break through the system
[00:44:57.340 --> 00:45:01.420]   and deliver like cheese bread at random,
[00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:02.460]   like it was,
[00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:06.300]   I found Jesus to be so present
[00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:09.340]   through the ridiculousness of my community.
[00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:12.640]   From the banter, like there was incessant chat
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:14.660]   throughout the entire time that I was there,
[00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:17.140]   fully covered in prayer,
[00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:20.500]   fully present in bringing me whatever nonsense I needed.
[00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:22.620]   I think Michelle broke into my house,
[00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:24.980]   brought me my Bible somehow.
[00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:27.260]   And it just was like, I found,
[00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:29.620]   I think, and through that experience, that's very dramatic,
[00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:31.560]   but even through little experiences as well,
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:36.560]   I realized I actually do have to say when I need something,
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:39.500]   because they're not gonna know, right?
[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:41.300]   Like they can't read my mind.
[00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:43.940]   And as a people of God,
[00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:48.940]   we have to let go of whatever cultural things we're used to,
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:52.480]   and align with kingdom culture that says,
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:55.040]   you will be provided for if you ask.
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:55.880]   You gotta think about it.
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:58.000]   It's not like God doesn't know what you need, right?
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.380]   Matthew six says, the Father knows what you need
[00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:02.800]   before you ask, before you're even aware
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:04.360]   of how to ask for it.
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:08.280]   But he still requires us to ask.
[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:11.080]   And so for me, it's been a lesson in learning
[00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:15.320]   how to tell people instead of growing bitter
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:17.720]   because it's like nobody ever stands up for me.
[00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:19.200]   Like how are they gonna know?
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:20.040]   How are they gonna know?
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:23.080]   They're not the Lord, and even the Lord says, ask me.
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:26.360]   So in terms of community, it's really been for me
[00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:30.920]   a journey in learning to ask and trust with no expectation,
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:32.800]   trust that God will meet me,
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:35.560]   and how he meets me is his business,
[00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:38.200]   and who he meets me through is his business.
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:41.920]   But my part is to ask, and to let the people
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:44.800]   that he's placed around me know what I need.
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:46.760]   - Yeah, that's beautiful, Amber, right?
[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:47.720]   That's such a, yeah.
[00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:50.080]   (audience applauding)
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:53.720]   So that's how prayer builds our relationship with God.
[00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:57.560]   Like I was saying earlier, we pray, we tell God,
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:46:58.960]   'cause that's how you build relationship,
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:01.200]   by conversation, by talking.
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:03.360]   And it was only ever one way, right?
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:05.880]   And it would not be a relationship.
[00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:07.320]   God wants us to tell him.
[00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:08.360]   He wants us to ask him.
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:10.280]   He wants us to tell him about the things
[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:11.120]   that we're going through
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:13.120]   because that's how we build relationship.
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:14.320]   It's the same with each other.
[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:16.720]   We go through things with each other.
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:18.800]   Those days I spent with you,
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:21.280]   well, those afternoons I spent with you in the hospital,
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:23.840]   right, those were precious times to me, right,
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:27.440]   to be alongside you in that process.
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:31.960]   And so that's what God wants for his community.
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:34.880]   And I think this afternoon, right here in this time,
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:37.880]   perhaps as we close, it's a little bit of time
[00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:40.320]   to do that as well.
[00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:41.360]   We have an opportunity.
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:43.840]   We have brothers and sisters around us, right?
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:46.880]   If you're sitting here in this room today,
[00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:49.040]   if you've called yourself a follower of Jesus,
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:50.920]   then God is your father.
[00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:55.180]   And so as God, as our father, sitting together right now,
[00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:58.200]   it's an opportunity to come before him
[00:47:58.200 --> 00:47:59.800]   with shameless audacity,
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:02.260]   knowing we're not gonna be met with a grumpy God,
[00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:03.800]   but with love.
[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:06.680]   In the same way, knowing that we've come to our friends
[00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:09.760]   with our burdens and things we need,
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:12.240]   hopefully we're not, oh, yeah, Jethro, so annoying, fine,
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:13.360]   here's a million dollars, you know,
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:16.200]   just go and live your life, whatever, okay?
[00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:18.280]   But to have a friend that's concerned,
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:20.280]   you know, that's willing, okay,
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:21.400]   hey, I know you're struggling.
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:24.000]   Well, now let's do this together, figure it out, right?
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.260]   We're in this as a family.
[00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:28.920]   But if we don't share, like Emma was saying, we don't know.
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:33.080]   So what I want us to do is to perhaps take,
[00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:36.920]   we have a little time left before the service closes,
[00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:38.280]   with the people around you,
[00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:40.640]   if you are so brave enough to share
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:42.580]   maybe some of the burdens that you have.
[00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:45.080]   Maybe you came in here today with something that,
[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:46.920]   oh, this is something that I've been needing, right?
[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:49.520]   This is a provision I've been praying for.
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:54.480]   Perhaps the answer is in this room here today, right?
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:58.400]   And as you share, it will be met in some way, right?
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:48:59.520]   So if you're brave enough,
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:01.400]   if you came with people you trust with,
[00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:03.660]   or if the Holy Spirit is prompting you
[00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:05.840]   to share with somebody,
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:07.960]   take the opportunity to do that right now.
[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:10.440]   Or maybe if you just want to talk to God,
[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:11.320]   you know, and let Him know,
[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:13.620]   maybe it's been a while since you've done that.
[00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:16.560]   Maybe you could, maybe this is a time to do that as well.
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:18.560]   But take a couple of minutes to share,
[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:21.520]   and then take a couple of minutes to actually pray
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:23.960]   with each other and for one another,
[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:27.080]   or maybe, like I said, even for yourself.
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:29.440]   And then we're gonna take a few minutes to do that,
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:32.120]   and then Jethro's gonna close us with a prayer
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:35.940]   before we end the service in a little bit.
[00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:37.540]   Does that sound all right, church?
[00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:40.000]   Okay, so yeah, find a spot.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.440]   I'm gonna invite the band to come up.
[00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:43.260]   They're just gonna play softly some music
[00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:45.420]   in the background while we do this.
[00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:48.320]   But really take some time to bring this parable
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:51.540]   and these things, these teachings we've been talking about
[00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:53.420]   to life this afternoon, church.
[00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:56.000]   (gentle music)
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.580]   (gentle music)
[00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:08.580]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
