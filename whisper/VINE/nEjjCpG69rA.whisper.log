[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.880]   All right, well, the first time in my life that I heard people, or probably the first
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:13.800]   time I was paying attention, that I heard people talking about God's calling was when
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.960]   I was in university.
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.280]   There was a men's group and there was this guy, I don't know who he was, but he was there,
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:29.960]   and he was talking passionately about not missing God's purpose, God's calling in your
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.480]   life.
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:39.620]   And as he was sharing so passionately about this, I started wondering, does God have a
[00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.880]   calling for me?
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.520]   Because truth be told, I hadn't thought much about this.
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:52.840]   And I had no idea what God's calling might be for my life.
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.800]   But because he was so passionate and talked about not missing it, I started wondering,
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.240]   how do you discover God's calling for your life?
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.800]   What does that actually look like?
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.400]   And then what if you miss, because he talked about not missing it, I was like, what if
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.020]   I miss it?
[00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.800]   Does that mean I live a second-class Christian life?
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.680]   Is my life just going to be a mess?
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.360]   So I don't know, when you hear about God's calling, what comes to your mind and what
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.360]   you're thinking.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.920]   We're probably at different places here in this room.
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.920]   So for some of us, maybe you're like me.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.840]   You haven't thought much about it.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.040]   This concept comes and you're like, did I need to think about this?
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.920]   What does God want to do in my life?
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.120]   And we have no idea what that might be.
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.040]   Others of you are like, hey, I know what I'm doing.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.000]   I know what God has called me.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   This is what I'm pursuing.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.400]   That's what I've been working on.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.400]   It's amazing.
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.400]   It's incredible.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.400]   Praise God.
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.400]   Right?
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.400]   That's awesome.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.400]   And when you have that clarity.
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.520]   But then there might be others of us, maybe you heard somebody talk like I did, and he
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.600]   talked about missing the calling from God.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:12.080]   And actually this topic has brought anxiety and fear and maybe discouragement in your
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.080]   life.
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.360]   And so you're like, I've been trying, I've been trying to figure out what God's calling
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.520]   is, but I don't know.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.760]   And over time, maybe that's been discouraging and actually a difficult thing.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.520]   So today what we're going to do is I'm going to explore a question with you.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:37.760]   And the question is, how can I understand and discern God's will in my life?
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.560]   What does that look like?
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.360]   What does God's word have to say about this?
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:52.920]   And my prayer is that we can gain clarity to what God is saying to us, but also that
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.400]   if you're holding anxieties, that God can alleviate them, that he can lift that burden
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.120]   off our shoulders.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.120]   Does that sound good?
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.120]   Yes.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.120]   Yes.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.120]   Okay.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.120]   I love the support right here.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.120]   Good.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:14.760]   Well, in order to explore this question, I actually think it's important to define.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.200]   So I've thrown out the word calling and it's easy to talk about things, but if you don't
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.440]   define what you're talking about, everybody's thinking something else.
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.640]   So I want to talk a little bit about when I talk about calling, what I mean, I'm drawing
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.220]   on multiple theologians.
[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.620]   So a lot of times what they talk about different types of callings, and I think it's actually
[00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.000]   helpful to differentiate.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.260]   So there is what's known as the primary calling, and then there's a specific calling.
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.520]   So I want to give you definitions.
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.280]   That's a polos up primary calling and specific calling.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.800]   All right, our primary calling is as Christians, is to be in a personal relationship with God,
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.680]   to know and love him and to serve others.
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.000]   This call is the same for every Christian.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.400]   So that's our primary calling.
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.680]   That's what God calls every person to, what God invites every single person into.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.320]   Now our specific calling is our unique mission in the world.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.880]   It's a particular way we love God and serve others through co-laboring with him, contributing
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.460]   through our work for the flourishing, the thriving of the world in general and people
[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.780]   in particular.
[00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.640]   So these two concepts we're going to be working with as I talk through the message, and I
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:36.140]   think they're both important for us today, but we're going to be in the book of Nehemiah.
[00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:41.200]   And so I want to set a little bit the context for Nehemiah so we know what happened and
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.080]   where we're picking things up.
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:51.800]   So Israel, they had consistently sinned and they were brought into exile.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.440]   They were captured or defeated by Babylon and then they were brought into exile into
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.680]   Babylon.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:06.920]   Now, several years later, I think about 70 years later, roughly, Cyrus, the Persian king,
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.800]   they conquered the Babylonian empire.
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:17.840]   And once they captured it, actually Cyrus allowed exiles to return home.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.360]   So now Israelites were allowed to return home to Jerusalem, to Judah, to where they were
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.360]   from.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:29.920]   Now this of course was significant because the prophets had prophesied about this.
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.920]   And so God's prophets, and so God's word came true.
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.520]   What he had said, they were able to return.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:42.800]   In the book of Ezra, which comes right before Nehemiah, the temple is rebuilt, but some
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.080]   stuff remains not taken care of.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.440]   And that is the broken on walls, a broken on city.
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.440]   That's where we pick up.
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.760]   That's where Nehemiah shows up in the story.
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.320]   So let me take you to Nehemiah one, starting with one, it says this.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:04.040]   The words of Nehemiah, son of Hacaliah, in a month of Kislev in the 20th year.
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:09.720]   While I was in the city deal of Susa, Hanani, one of my brothers came from Judah with some
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:15.840]   other men and they questioned him about the Jewish remnant that survived the exile and
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.640]   also about Jerusalem.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:23.440]   They said to me, those who have survived the exile are back in Providence in great trouble
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.280]   and disgrace.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:31.640]   The wall of Jerusalem is broken down and its gates have been burned with fire.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.800]   When I heard these things, I sat down and wept.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:42.080]   For some days I mourned and fasted and prayed before the God of heaven.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.960]   I'm going to skip some verses, the prayer, where pick up things at the end of prayer.
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:54.840]   Verse 11, Lord, let your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant and the prayer
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.480]   of your servants who delight in revering your name.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:05.440]   Give your servant success today by granting him favor in the presence of this man.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.420]   I was cupbearer to the king.
[00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:15.840]   In a month of Nisan in the 20th year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was brought for him,
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.720]   I took the wine and gave it to the king.
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.460]   I had not been sad in his presence before.
[00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:27.080]   So the king asked me, why does your face look so sad when you are not ill?
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.280]   This can be nothing but sadness of heart.
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:35.640]   I was very much afraid, but I said to the king, may the king live forever.
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:41.360]   Why should my face not look sad when the city where my ancestors are buried lies in ruins
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.000]   and his gates have been destroyed by fire?
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.960]   The king said to me, what is it you want?
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:55.480]   Then I prayed to the God of heaven and I answered the king, if it pleases the king and if your
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:08:01.880]   servant has found favor in his sight, let him send me to the city of Judah where my
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.100]   ancestors are buried so they can rebuild it.
[00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:09.840]   Then the king with the queen sitting beside them asked me, how long will your journey
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.440]   take and when will you get back?
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:18.840]   It pleased the king to send me, so I set a time.
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:24.360]   Wow, so much happening there.
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:31.080]   I want us to think through this story from the perspective of specific calling, the unique
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.200]   mission that God gives us.
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:39.120]   And so as we're looking at this, and I chose a story, let me rephrase this.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:44.220]   I chose a story because I think it's important for us when we try to understand how does
[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:51.240]   God call us that we have examples to look at so we can make sense how God speaks to
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.640]   people.
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.720]   And now every calling is different.
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:59.080]   It doesn't all go the same way, but nonetheless it's helpful.
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:04.200]   So we're going to look at Nehemiah and the specific calling that he received.
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.200]   So let's unpack what actually happens here.
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.800]   So Nehemiah, he hears news.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:17.420]   He hears news that the walls in Jerusalem, they're in ruins and the city gates have been
[00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.280]   burned down.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:31.240]   And that touches him so deeply that he actually has to sit down and he weeps and then he mourns
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.680]   and he fasts and he prays.
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:39.260]   Now that's a really strong emotional response to what happens.
[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:46.560]   So the question is why does Nehemiah react so strongly to what he's hearing?
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:53.160]   Now the first thing he, as I was reading, one of the things that you heard is that while
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:58.280]   Nehemiah lives in Susa, which is in the Persian empire, which is modern day Iran, and that's
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:07.300]   quite far away from Israel and Jerusalem, but his ancestors are from Jerusalem.
[00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.300]   And so this is a personal matter.
[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:18.040]   Like this really concerns him.
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:22.840]   But we also need to understand what it means for an ancient city for the walls and the
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.840]   gates to be broken down.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:31.920]   Now basically what this means is anyone can come, they can raid your town, they can raid
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.320]   the city, they can take whatever they want.
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.920]   You do your harvest.
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:39.120]   And then your neighbor's like, oh, they did their harvest.
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:43.880]   Why don't we come and raid the city and take everything that they worked for?
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.580]   And so it means you're extremely vulnerable.
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:47.680]   You have no security.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:52.380]   And it's not a condition under which people, under which a community can thrive.
[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:56.420]   This is a deeply troubled community.
[00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:00.760]   And so Nehemiah, his heart is stirred.
[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:06.240]   And I would say that the beginning of Nehemiah's specific calling, even though we're not told
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:13.560]   this in a specific way, but that it begins when Nehemiah is deeply touched and moved
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:24.120]   by this news, when God stirs his heart.
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:31.720]   So often God uses our deep empathy for people and a connection to a place to ignite and
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:40.880]   mobilize us to partner with him in this cultivating, redeeming, restoring, and healing work.
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:45.720]   That we see something, that we notice something, that we hear something that deeply touches
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.600]   and moves us.
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.720]   And we want to see this changed.
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:52.840]   We desire for that to be fixed.
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:59.680]   And it's something that starts occupying our mind, our imagination.
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:06.320]   And I wonder when you think of Hong Kong, when you think of your generation, when you
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:12.600]   think of your organization, when you think of your family, what are some things that
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:16.040]   you see that need fixing?
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:19.360]   What are some things where God might be stirring your heart?
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.320]   Where he's moving?
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:30.640]   Now I have some examples of what this might look like, what might ignite our calling,
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.680]   our specific calling.
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:39.760]   Maybe you look at the community and you see vulnerable people that are needing support.
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.840]   Maybe there's policies in place that are unfair to them.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.840]   And you see that and you just want to do something about it.
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.800]   You want to see that changed.
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:54.320]   Maybe you're a teacher in the education sector and you see a group of students that are being
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.120]   left behind.
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.640]   But they're not incapable students.
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.200]   They're just not set up for success.
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.400]   And you want to see that changed.
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.000]   It breaks your heart.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.080]   And you want to see that changed.
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:11.160]   You're not going to accept that.
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:18.320]   Maybe it's in your workplace where there's a poor team culture and it's just not honoring
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.720]   to anyone.
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:23.200]   And you want to see that culture changed.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:27.840]   Maybe it's in your own family and there's no good routines and you want to see some
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:34.040]   routines established that bring and draw your family closer together.
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:38.160]   Maybe there's processes that you see that are inefficient.
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.080]   Does anyone get annoyed with inefficient processes?
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.480]   Yes?
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:48.280]   So when you notice them, does your mind sometimes go to like, "They should do this."
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.520]   So if you're not, everyone sees those things.
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:55.840]   But when you see them, maybe there is something that God is inviting into, right?
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:00.840]   Because you might be the person who is in a position who is able to change something.
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.960]   Service.
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:07.720]   Sometimes people are served poorly and you want to see that changed.
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.880]   Maybe they're being poorly served in the healthcare sector.
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:14.000]   Maybe they're being poorly served in a business.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.800]   And you have a heart for that and you want to see that transformed.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:19.960]   Or maybe the environment.
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:23.480]   Maybe it's a hazardous work environment.
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:29.040]   Maybe it's about the natural environment and you want to see something changed and transformed,
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:34.780]   a practice that is destructive and it doesn't let you go.
[00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:42.560]   And all of these things can be ways in which God ignites something in our hearts and ignites
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:49.040]   our specific calling that we perhaps are meant to move into and start working into.
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:53.040]   Now I want to say, of course we can be stirred and that doesn't have to mean we're called
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:57.640]   to specifically that that is our mission for life and that's what we're meant to do.
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:01.200]   But a lot of times it starts that way.
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.520]   Does that sound good?
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.520]   Yeah?
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:04.520]   Makes sense?
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.520]   All right, cool.
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:06.880]   Let's continue.
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:13.000]   So how did Nehemiah respond to this news that he heard about the broken walls and the burned
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.280]   down city gates?
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:17.440]   Well, he responds with prayer.
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:22.000]   He prayed and fasted, it says for some days, so this was not, when we read it sometimes
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:29.160]   it seems like it's a short prayer but actually he prayed over a period of time.
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:36.960]   And somewhere while Nehemiah was praying, actually his specific calling moved into focus.
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:41.080]   And isn't that interesting a lot of times when we pray that things move into focus,
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:42.440]   that things become clear.
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:49.800]   Maybe there's unclarity about a relationship or unclarity about a circumstance and we start
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:54.040]   praying and praying and praying and then suddenly God brings things into focus.
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.040]   He gives us clarity.
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:16:01.320]   And I want to show you how we can see that Nehemiah got clarity about his specific calling
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.320]   and we see that in verse 11.
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:08.400]   This is the end of the prayer that Nehemiah prayed.
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:14.000]   And we can see that there he prays for success.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.200]   Give your servant success today by granting him favor in the presence of this man.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:26.000]   So he's praying for success and favor because he knows he wants to ask if he can take on
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.640]   this project of rebuilding the walls in Jerusalem.
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:34.280]   But he also knows that there are some barriers, there are some challenges that he needs to
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:37.320]   overcome in order to do that.
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.400]   So Nehemiah asked God.
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:49.920]   Now Nehemiah was uniquely positioned but also uniquely qualified to do this work.
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.120]   Now we're told he's a cupbearer.
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:55.640]   A lot of times we think cupbearer, it's tasting the wine so the king doesn't get poisoned
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.700]   and that is true.
[00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.880]   But cupbearers were highly administrative people.
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:07.520]   It's like the guy that has an MBA from Harvard or Stanford, right, and is able to manage
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.000]   very complex things.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:16.760]   So kings, they assigned, for example, managing financial accounts to cupbearers.
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:17.760]   Guess what?
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:22.800]   Rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem is a complex project that needs good administration for
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.680]   that to happen.
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:31.400]   Well so the specific calling, it fits with who Nehemiah is, with the God-given talents
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.920]   that he has given him.
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:40.120]   So God-specific calling often works this way.
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:45.600]   It's our gifts, talents, and circumstances.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.360]   This certainly was true for Nehemiah.
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:54.280]   Now theologian Gordon Smith, he says this, "God's call on our lives is consistent with
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:58.480]   who God made us to be."
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.800]   Now I do want to give a little caveat.
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:04.060]   Of course it's possible that God calls us for a moment to do something we're not gifted
[00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:13.320]   and good at, but generally God calls us consistently with the gifts and talents he has given us
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.560]   to put them to use, to put them to work.
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.680]   He doesn't work against how he created you.
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:24.600]   And so when we're trying to discern our specific calling, part of it is really gaining self-awareness,
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:28.480]   who God made us, and understanding who we are as a person, what our gifts and talents
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.900]   are, what our experiences are.
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:36.280]   So as you're trying to discern your calling, part of the process is to grow in self-awareness
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.960]   who God has made you.
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:41.560]   And this usually comes into focus over time.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.480]   This is not a one-second thing.
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:50.440]   It's a process of discovering, of trying things out, of failing, of learning, of succeeding,
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.160]   of other people saying, "Wow, you're really good at this."
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:19:00.280]   And then you do something else, like I did one time when I refereed a basketball game
[00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:04.260]   and nobody ever asked me to do it again.
[00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:05.260]   Because I did a horrible job.
[00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:10.080]   I had both sides angry at me.
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:14.700]   It's also a way of figuring out who you are, is through failing, right?
[00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:19.960]   And it's like these stacked up failures that God also gives us clarity about who we are.
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:28.600]   So don't ever ask me to referee your basketball game or any other game for that matter.
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:32.840]   But let me say a little bit more about the circumstances, because our circumstances also
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:36.080]   matter when we're trying to discern our specific calling.
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:45.000]   Because we have limitations, whether it's our relationships or our external circumstance
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.980]   over which we have absolutely no control.
[00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:52.760]   So Nehemiah actually, it was an external circumstance over which he had no control, which was he
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.520]   was employed by the king of Persia.
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:58.000]   So he couldn't just go up and leave.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.040]   But there's even more.
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:11.720]   Because this specific king had made a decree that actually stopped the rebuilding of Jerusalem.
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:15.120]   Ezra 4.21 says this.
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.120]   So this is the decree.
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:21.400]   "Now issue an order to these men to stop work so that the city will not be rebuilt until
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.400]   I so order."
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:30.600]   So that means that Nehemiah, he's trying to, he's praying for favor because he needs the
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.160]   king to reverse his decision.
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:36.520]   He wants the opposite of what the king had decided.
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.400]   That's kind of a scary thing.
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:44.600]   But he knows that this is a God thing, that God, if God is calling him, if God is giving
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:48.760]   him a specific calling, he can open the door.
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:50.640]   And God does.
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:54.040]   And it's amazing.
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:59.100]   So the open and closed doors we encounter in our circumstances can also serve as guides
[00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:01.240]   in discerning our specific calling.
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.040]   Because the circumstances matter.
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:11.080]   God providentially places us in the spaces where he can use us.
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:14.200]   And he can open doors and he can also shut doors.
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:19.480]   So we have to also be honest about our reality.
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:23.280]   What is your reality?
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:32.000]   Now I'm going to stop here in a sense of unpacking the story of Nehemiah, but I want to share
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.240]   a little bit about why I chose this story.
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:36.600]   And there's two reasons.
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:43.200]   The first one is because Nehemiah didn't have this extraordinary revelation.
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:47.840]   Like Moses in the burning bush when God called Moses, or like the Apostle Paul when he's
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:54.080]   on the road to Damascus and there's blinding lights and he encounters the risen Jesus.
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:58.160]   But a lot of times when we think about our calling, that's what we want God to do, right?
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:03.800]   We want this like extraordinary, like burning bush moment or like the blinding lights on
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:04.800]   the street.
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.560]   And we're like, okay, God, I know what to do.
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:13.000]   But the reality is that for most people, that's not how God calls us.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.680]   Now he can, and I'm even, wouldn't be surprised if God has called somebody here in this way.
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:23.120]   But for most of us, it's actually through a process where he just speaks in our everyday
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:28.620]   life and reveals things and touches our hearts and gives us clarity as we pray and puts things
[00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:29.800]   in the focus.
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.400]   So it's a process.
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:36.480]   It's a process over time of discerning what God is inviting us into.
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:44.960]   And what's interesting is that actually this opening of Nehemiah, it takes place in a four
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:51.920]   month span because it talks about Nehemiah 1.1 that it was in the months of Kislev and
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:55.800]   then in Nehemiah 2 when it talks about the month of Nisan.
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:58.480]   That's four months apart.
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:03.080]   So again, a lot of times when we want to discern our calling, we want something quick, like
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:06.240]   even settle it today.
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.240]   Praise God if he does.
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:13.760]   But most of the time it's going to be a process of discerning, of trying things out, of walking
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:19.580]   through open stores, of getting some doors shut, of failing at some things and also succeeding
[00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:20.580]   at others.
[00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:26.360]   That God brings our specific calling into focus.
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:31.400]   Now the second reason why I chose a Nehemiah story is because in church there's a tendency
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:35.000]   to always talk about pastors and missionaries when it comes to calling.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.080]   And of course I was so tempted to do it because I'm a pastor.
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:43.120]   So I want to talk about my calling and how I'm called.
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:48.600]   But Nehemiah, he's a businessman and he has a businessman calling, he does businessman
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:54.600]   administrative work because God calls us not all into church work and missionary work,
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:24:00.080]   but he just calls us into work all over the place.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:04.200]   And so I also thought it was important to choose this example because that's actually
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.840]   for most of us how God calls us.
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.840]   You know, he has something for us in our places of work.
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.440]   He has something for us in community.
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:15.220]   And so that's why I chose this.
[00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:21.880]   One thing I love too, if you read the story of Nehemiah is that over and over again, God
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:29.920]   provides for him as he carries out a specific calling and he makes Nehemiah's work fruitful.
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.000]   God makes our work fruitful.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.920]   Last week, Pastor Chapman talked a lot about how there's a lot of challenges in our work
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.680]   and that is true.
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:43.480]   But when we serve God, when we live for his glory, when we do his work for him, yes, there
[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:44.480]   will be frustration.
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:50.040]   Yes, it's not all fruitful, but God makes your work fruitful and he can do immeasurably
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:53.800]   more than you can ask or imagine through your work.
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.120]   So I want to encourage you with that.
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:58.040]   But now some of you are sitting here, okay, great.
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.040]   Thank you, Tim.
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:06.320]   This was wonderful, but I still have absolutely no clue how to discern or understand things
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:09.000]   around my calling.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.180]   This brings us back to the question, you know, how should I understand and how can I discern
[00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:15.500]   God's calling in my life?
[00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:20.380]   So I've asked Enoch to come and actually share.
[00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:25.600]   Let's welcome Enoch.
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:29.840]   I've come and asked him to share just his whole processing around calling.
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:31.760]   So super excited to have you.
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:32.760]   Take it from here.
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:33.760]   Thank you, Pastor Tim.
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:34.760]   Hi, everyone.
[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:35.760]   I'm Enoch.
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:41.880]   I'm so grateful for the opportunity to share my experience here.
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:46.160]   I think searching for our callings can be very frustrating sometimes.
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:51.240]   For me, at least, a lot of times I do not know what is my calling.
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:58.240]   And there's been so many moments I've asked God to give me some kind of like mission statement,
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:02.000]   you know, just give me some direction.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.600]   But most of the time, the answer won't be like what I hope for.
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:13.640]   And that uncertainty of like not knowing sometimes make me wonder, am I wasting my life?
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:18.360]   Am I not significant enough for calling?
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:24.400]   And sometimes even when I feel that I know my calling, there are times that I'm still
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:30.520]   saying guessing it, and because of things that are not going as smoothly as I hope it
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:32.080]   would be.
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:36.040]   And I would like to share a small episode of my experience.
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:41.680]   And today, it was like quite a few years ago, I feel God called me to nurture a group of
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:48.440]   young people to walk alongside with the marginalized people in Hong Kong and to serve them.
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:54.800]   And I was so excited when I got an offer, a job offer in a university, and it's exactly
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.360]   what I hope for.
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:59.760]   It gives me a good position to work with these young people.
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.920]   And I was so excited.
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.040]   And I went for that offer.
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:05.680]   And I started doing this job.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:12.000]   A few months later, one day, my boss called me into a room and told me that the higher
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.200]   ups has decided to close down the program that I'm responsible for.
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:21.880]   And then and I will be reassigned to some other position soon.
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:25.880]   And I and at that point, I was so frustrated.
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:31.100]   And I couldn't help asking God, did I hear you wrong?
[00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:36.040]   Is it only my idea like to nurture this group of young people?
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:41.720]   And even so, I was even asking God, are you playing with me?
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:46.440]   Are you just bring me here just to take away the reason I'm here?
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:53.600]   So in my frustration, I pray and I sense God saying two things to me.
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:59.400]   One is that he told me, remember, your boss is not your ultimate boss.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.960]   I am your boss.
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:08.320]   And the mission is that I gave you the mission and everything is in my control.
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:13.240]   And if the vision is really from me, then you're going to accomplish it without this
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.320]   program.
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:15.320]   So you have to trust me.
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:16.320]   This is the first thing.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:21.760]   And the second thing is that you have to stop worrying about whether this program is going
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:23.400]   to continue or not.
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:28.360]   You have to focus on what I have entrusted you at this moment, which is the students
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:30.320]   and what you can do with them.
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:34.560]   So you just focus on that and do your best, be faithful, and then I'll take care of the
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:35.560]   rest.
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:41.760]   And I still remember feeling a bit silly for like doubting, but at the same time, I'm strangely
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:44.840]   empowered at the same time.
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:53.000]   And I also feel very grateful for the clarity he has given me, even though the answer may
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.520]   not be like, OK, the program is going to continue, you'll be fine and everything.
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:05.040]   So interestingly, over the next three years, I was told this project is going to be closed
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:08.000]   multiple times.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.760]   So every time I was concerned, every time I'm concerned, a little less maybe, every
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:18.320]   time, but the program was still running by the time I left the job.
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:25.600]   So I think it's a wonderful-- yeah, looking back, it seems really funny and silly to worry,
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:29.640]   but at the time, I was still very concerned and worried.
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:34.320]   And I'm also grateful that I could see some real change in my students.
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:40.580]   Some told me that the program has actually influenced their career choice.
[00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:46.520]   Some has initiated their own project after joining the program, serving the community.
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:51.760]   I'm so grateful God has worked in their lives.
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:59.040]   And thinking back, I realized that I was unconsciously replacing God with the idea of calling.
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:02.120]   Sometimes calling gives us a sense of certainty.
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:08.640]   It gives us a sense of meaning that we should really actually get from our relationship
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.200]   with our God himself.
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:15.400]   The outcome of calling isn't the most important thing.
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:19.280]   Our partnership with God is the most important thing.
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:25.560]   I think calling is really to draw our hearts close to God and to become more like him in
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:27.400]   whatever that we do.
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:33.560]   It's not like what we do doesn't matter because it's actually where God wants us to partner
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:40.040]   with him and also is to influence the people he has placed around us.
[00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:48.720]   But we cannot let the outcome of our calling to replace our relationship with God.
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:53.440]   I think at the end of the day, it's really important that we understand and we partner
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:54.440]   with God.
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:31:02.680]   I'm going to go off script a bit here because just now in the worship, I sense God is telling
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:10.160]   me that the world has somehow convinced many of us, myself included, that our life is only
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:15.240]   a small gear in this whole machine to keep the whole machine going and we are not important
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.240]   enough.
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:20.440]   Sometimes we think that calling is only for gifted people, talented people, and we are
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:23.400]   not one of those people.
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:30.600]   This is really a lie and God's heart is broken that we believe this lie because this is really
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:34.680]   not what he has created us for.
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:39.560]   He really wanted to partner with us and to fulfill the specific callings that he has
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:40.560]   for us.
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:49.880]   I hope this story can encourage you to keep searching for his calling and also stay in
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.480]   the partnership with him.
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:55.600]   So thanks so much and back to you.
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:57.360]   Brilliant.
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:00.080]   Thank you so much, Enoch.
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:04.000]   I feel like going off script now too.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.080]   Actually I will go a little bit off script.
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:15.360]   So the one thing that I thought was interesting is I do have the sense that actually there
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:20.480]   is a lot of discouragement around this topic of calling and that we do feel inadequate
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:25.000]   or that God doesn't have something for us or we think it needs to be like a Nehemiah
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.480]   specific way.
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:31.400]   But the specific calling, the work that God calls us to co-labor with him, to partner
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:33.640]   with him, it can take place in any sphere of life.
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:40.320]   It can be you're a stay-at-home mom and you invest in your children and you raise them
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:44.760]   up to be incredible human beings.
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:49.900]   That is a specific calling that God gives the people in seasons.
[00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:56.640]   Or maybe it is in your workplace and just creating a safe environment for people around
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:01.280]   you that honors God, that brings them glory and God wants to use you.
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:03.960]   So I think it's a really important word.
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:09.960]   We shouldn't minimize the things that God is leading us to do, not God asks us to do.
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:15.440]   Because God wants to work immeasurably more than all you can ask and imagine through when
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:18.480]   you serve him, when you co-labor with him.
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:19.480]   Does that sound good?
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:20.480]   Yes.
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:21.480]   Yes.
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:22.480]   All right.
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:27.440]   So now going back to my script.
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:34.800]   One of the reasons that I'm so grateful for your sharing is that it's authentic.
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:39.600]   One thing I want us, our faith community to be an authentic community where we can talk
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.080]   truthfully about our experiences.
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:45.520]   And there has been frustration in this journey and there has been discouragement for Enoch
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:47.160]   along the way.
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:53.640]   But what I love is also how God spoke to you about focusing on him, on your relationship
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:34:00.240]   with him and not getting so caught up in the specific calling or the outcome of your work.
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:05.200]   It's like, "Hey, if I call you, I'll help with the outcome."
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:11.080]   And I think for a lot of us who are sitting in anxiety and fear when it comes around this
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:17.960]   topic of calling, actually it's good to go back to our primary calling.
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:26.040]   And our primary calling is to be in relationship with God, to love God, to know God and to
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:28.400]   serve those around us.
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:31.880]   And so every one of us can know our primary calling.
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:35.160]   Every one of us can live into this.
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:41.000]   And if the specific calling has been a place of anxiety, then I believe that's what right
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.720]   now is maybe what God is inviting you into, to draw close to him in your relationship
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:47.280]   with him, to love him.
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:49.760]   And then to just serve those around you.
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:54.080]   Maybe you're not sure what the big theme is, but you're just loving and serving those around
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:55.680]   you.
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:35:01.460]   And if we think of it from God's perspective, our heavenly father's perspective, what does
[00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:03.640]   he care about?
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:07.520]   And you're also talking about it a little bit.
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:13.640]   He cares that you have a good relationship with him and that you are growing and maturing
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:18.400]   and becoming the person that God has created you to be.
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:20.280]   That's the father's heart for you.
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:26.320]   And so again, if there's anxiety, let's just focus on our primary calling.
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:33.360]   And I believe that when we do, that God actually meets us in our anxieties and fears and that
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:40.340]   they can melt away over time and he can do some healing work.
[00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:44.900]   But I think at some point in time, we do come back to the specific calling.
[00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:47.920]   And so you may be still wondering, like, well, what do I do?
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:49.540]   How should I think about this?
[00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:53.060]   And I want to share with you a quote from John Mark Homer.
[00:35:53.060 --> 00:36:00.560]   And he says this, that was quite a few pages off here.
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:07.200]   So calling isn't something you choose, like who you marry or what house you buy or what
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:08.940]   car you buy.
[00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:15.000]   It's something you unearth, you excavate, you dig out and you discover.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.240]   And I love that.
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:20.320]   That's how we discover our calling.
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.880]   It's like excavation work.
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:29.240]   It's understanding who God has made you, what your giftings and talents are, what opportunities
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:31.960]   he's presenting to you.
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:38.100]   And he suggests then for us to explore that through a series of questions that we actually
[00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:44.760]   ask ourselves, questions that can help us discern and reflect on who we are and what
[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:45.760]   God might be doing.
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:51.280]   And I know our coaches here in the house, they're getting excited about questions.
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:58.400]   So let me share with you five questions that can help you in discerning your call.
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:06.080]   The first one is what stirs your heart deeply?
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:11.800]   What keeps you up at night?
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:12.800]   That's the first one.
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:16.760]   Nehemiah was stirred deeply by what happened to Jerusalem.
[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:22.260]   Second thing, what has God uniquely equipped you to do?
[00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:24.880]   What are you good at?
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:26.740]   What are you not good at?
[00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:30.200]   Like being a referee.
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:34.400]   Right?
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:41.020]   Third one, what is your world need that you could address?
[00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:49.280]   When you look at systems, at people, at issues around you, what can you fix?
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:52.880]   What can you change?
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:38:01.640]   Fourthly, where do you see open doors?
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:07.560]   What are your circumstances?
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:15.040]   Where has God providentially placed you and places you can walk through?
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:20.400]   And then finally, what is the Holy Spirit stirring in you?
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:30.160]   Is there a burden that he gives you about a group of people, about a certain circumstance
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:40.120]   that will just not let you go?
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:46.640]   Now our specific calling, it's not about self-fulfillment.
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:53.040]   A lot of times when we think about that, that's a temptation to go into self-fulfillment.
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:39:01.320]   It's about serving the world in general and people in particular.
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:07.120]   And a lot of times that means sacrifice.
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:13.040]   But it also means understanding that our sacrifice and some pain in the journey and some suffering
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:21.680]   in the journey is so worth it because of what God is going to do through it.
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:29.320]   And we can keep that big picture and view of what God wants to do.
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:34.360]   So what is the cross that Jesus is asking you to pick up?
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:41.720]   Now I want to invite the worship team to come up.
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:49.360]   And some of us are still like struggling with this idea maybe with specific calling and
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:52.840]   I just want to encourage you.
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:54.840]   Try things out.
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:56.520]   Pray.
[00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:58.520]   Give things time.
[00:39:58.520 --> 00:39:59.840]   Fail.
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:02.000]   Fail plenty.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.360]   I know that's a very hard thing to say in Hong Kong culture, but it's okay because through
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:13.600]   that God continues to sharpen and to bring in the focus who he has made you to be and
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:19.320]   how he wants to work through you specifically in this world.
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:21.400]   And so don't be discouraged.
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:26.760]   Don't be afraid to try and enjoy your relationship with your heavenly father while you're at
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:27.760]   it.
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:28.760]   Right?
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:31.000]   Do you guys feel encouraged?
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   Yeah?
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:37.920]   Well, I want to pray for us.
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:51.600]   And so perhaps your invitation that the spirit has been stirring is maybe that primary calling
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:58.240]   of just drawing closer to our heavenly father, of knowing him, of loving him, and just getting
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:01.760]   back to the basics.
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:07.520]   And then for others of us, maybe there was something that sparked something where maybe
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:08.720]   there is something here.
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:12.160]   Maybe there is a specific thing here that God is saying to me that even through this
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:13.160]   message.
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:20.800]   And I just want to invite you right now just to talk to God and to become aware of maybe
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:24.680]   what's been happening here.
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:26.680]   And I'll just give a minute for that.
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:35.560]   And we'll just invite the Holy Spirit to come and for us just to speak to Jesus.
[00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:37.040]   And then I'll say a prayer over us.
[00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:40.280]   So let's just pray for a minute here.
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:47.560]   Heavenly father, I thank you so much for every single person here that you love, that is
[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:54.280]   created in your image, in whom you poured gifts and talents into.
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:58.440]   I thank you that you've called us to be in relationship with you, to know you and to
[00:41:58.440 --> 00:41:59.440]   love you.
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:05.800]   And I pray that you help us to enjoy that and to grow in our knowledge of you and in
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:07.600]   intimacy with you.
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:15.240]   But Lord, I also pray that you give us courage to respond to what you're saying to us, to
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:22.680]   what we are discerning and to step forth with courage and to try things out and to follow
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:31.120]   you boldly and to not dismiss areas where you're inviting us to partner with you.
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:39.960]   And I pray that you would grow us in clarity as a community in our specific callings.
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:45.360]   Now you use us powerfully in all these different spheres throughout the city that you've placed
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:46.360]   us in.
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:55.040]   And it is you incredible redeeming, restoring, healing and cultivating work.
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:57.600]   Thank you, Jesus.
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:42:58.600]   Thank you, Jesus.
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:00.880]   I pray all that in your name, Jesus.
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:01.720]   Amen.
