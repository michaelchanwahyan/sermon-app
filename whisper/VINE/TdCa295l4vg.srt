1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
 >> Yeah, thank you Justin.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,740
 And good morning, if you're joining online,

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,440
 good morning to you too.

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,940
 Honored as always to be here.

5
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:07,780
 And like Justin said,

6
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,940
 we are wrapping up our Ephesians series today.

7
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,720
 It's been a great journey through this book

8
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,720
 and I'm glad to be finishing off today.

9
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,560
 So, something, I mean my colleagues at the Vine here

10
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,400
 know this very well.

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,120
 People who know me know this quite well.

12
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,520
 In general, I'm not a very serious person, okay?

13
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,480
 I mean like I'm serious about God's word,

14
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,660
 but my general demeanor is,

15
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:30,500
 why are you brief a lot?

16
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,800
 It's like, Justin, you're not surprised, okay?

17
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,960
 Like I like to play jokes, I like to play pranks.

18
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,640
 Around the office, there's a little bit of a reputation

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,240
 about the guy who like plays the practical jokes

20
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,800
 on people and all that kind of stuff.

21
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,960
 The most often victim of these sort of sneak attacks

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,400
 or these practical jokes are of course my wife, okay?

23
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,800
 So, sometimes these jokes work well,

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,800
 sometimes not so well, okay?

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,840
 This was one that works well.

26
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,720
 Okay, take notes, okay?

27
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,740
 So, you turn on the shower, okay?

28
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,940
 You draw the curtain and so, you know,

29
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,860
 she thinks I'm in the shower, okay?

30
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,760
 The shower's going shh and then I call out,

31
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,420
 but actually I'm not in the shower,

32
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,640
 I'm hiding under the sink, okay?

33
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,680
 So, hey honey, could you pass me my toothbrush?

34
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,160
 Okay, so she goes into the shower, you know,

35
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,460
 she says, hey, okay, here's your toothbrush,

36
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,860
 here you go, here you go, but no one's responding

37
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,060
 'cause there's no one behind there, right?

38
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,780
 So, she opens the curtain, no one's there,

39
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:23,940
 it's like, what's happening?

40
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,940
 And then right at that moment, under the sink,

41
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,180
 I grab her by the ankle, ah, okay,

42
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,060
 and she screams, okay, that's a good one, okay?

43
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,780
 Often it works, okay.

44
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:37,540
 Sometimes, however, these jokes don't work so well.

45
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,240
 Okay, Akin was taking notes, okay.

46
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,620
 One time I saw my wife, we were out separately

47
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,060
 and we just happened, my wife and I,

48
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,620
 Brittany and I, were coming home at the same time

49
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,420
 and so I thought, okay, perfect opportunity,

50
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,140
 I'm gonna play a prank on her.

51
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,020
 And so, you know, with stealth-like movements,

52
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,260
 I went ahead of her and I hid behind,

53
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,500
 you know, sometimes you get one of those electrical boxes

54
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,500
 that sit on the side of the street.

55
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,060
 So I hid behind one of those electrical boxes,

56
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,780
 hoping that when she would walk past,

57
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,140
 I would jump out and scare her

58
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,780
 and it'd be, you know, really funny, okay.

59
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,040
 Problem was, I was just focusing on like,

60
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,500
 watching where she was going

61
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,460
 and not anything else around me, right?

62
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,780
 What I didn't notice was, this light box

63
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,180
 was next to the bike path, okay.

64
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,160
 And so, I was hiding behind, she was walking past,

65
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,020
 but as she was walking past and I jumped out,

66
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,140
 like, boo, and tried to scare her,

67
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,700
 a biker on his bike was coming full speed down

68
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,020
 and he hit me, okay.

69
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,300
 And so I go flying back onto the path,

70
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,020
 my shoes fly off, you know, everything's crazy.

71
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,780
 This guy is so, understandably, so angry at me.

72
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,780
 He's like, what are you doing?

73
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,220
 You know, starts asking about my mother,

74
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,820
 all this kind of stuff, okay.

75
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,280
 I'm just like, oh, sorry, I don't even know, okay.

76
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,300
 Meanwhile, okay, Brittany is there,

77
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,740
 she's seen the whole thing, apparently.

78
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,300
 She saw me hide behind the light box, like,

79
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,020
 what's this person doing, okay?

80
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,620
 And then she saw me jump out, get scared, okay.

81
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,700
 In the end, I ended up with a fracture wrist

82
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,780
 and a trip to the ER, right, so, yeah.

83
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,440
 Moral of the story, right?

84
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,340
 Do better when you're trying to scare your wife,

85
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,180
 all right, now.

86
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,620
 I know that this is just a silly story,

87
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,740
 but I wanna illustrate something.

88
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,380
 Maybe you can think about it this way.

89
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,820
 As you go about life, does it ever feel like

90
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,160
 you're under attack?

91
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,500
 As you go about life, does it ever feel like

92
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,260
 there's something or someone out there

93
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,480
 who's trying to get you?

94
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,040
 I mean, what if I told you right now,

95
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,980
 in this very moment, we're actually in the middle

96
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,460
 of a battle that's being fought, right?

97
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,380
 It's just that you can't see what's happening all the time.

98
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,340
 It's not something you can always see

99
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,300
 with your eyes or feel with your senses.

100
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,740
 Okay, I'm not talking about tinfoil,

101
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,780
 conspiracy theories, or anything like that, okay.

102
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,180
 What we're talking about today is spiritual warfare.

103
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,220
 Let me lay a little bit of a definition

104
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,140
 before we go any further.

105
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,700
 Right, throughout the Bible and throughout history,

106
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,020
 right, there is this belief,

107
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,460
 and it's a biblical teaching as well,

108
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,120
 that there is a spiritual realm, right?

109
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,260
 Scholars sometimes call this an unseen realm, right?

110
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,580
 It exists side by side by this physical world,

111
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,980
 this realm that we're living in right now.

112
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,260
 And so the Bible teaches us there are spiritual beings,

113
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,160
 right, these beings were created by God

114
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,460
 just like human beings were.

115
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,740
 They've been there since the beginning of this world.

116
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:28,060
 And God created these spiritual beings

117
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,300
 in order to help him rule the world.

118
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,820
 It's a sort of an illustration of this,

119
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,820
 could be you can picture God as like a CEO,

120
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,280
 it's not the best example, but you know,

121
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,340
 he is a CEO, he's the big boss, okay,

122
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,420
 and he has his staff team, okay,

123
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,220
 the council of these divine beings

124
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:51,260
 that were created to help him in his rule of the world.

125
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:55,660
 However, just like human beings rebelled,

126
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:59,460
 his children wanted to be God instead of be God's children.

127
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,100
 In the same way, these spiritual beings

128
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,820
 also rebelled against God.

129
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,540
 Some of these beings also rebelled against God.

130
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,460
 And instead of them enticing and turning

131
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,140
 and encouraging people to worship God,

132
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,540
 they started to get people to worship them instead, right,

133
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,180
 and they crossed many boundaries.

134
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,140
 Genesis 6, two tells us that the sons of God,

135
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,740
 referring to these spiritual beings,

136
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,700
 saw that the daughters of humankind were beautiful.

137
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,660
 Thus, they took wise for themselves from any they chose.

138
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,700
 This is the Bible teaching us

139
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,180
 how rebellious these beings have become.

140
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,240
 They came down to earth and had relations with humans,

141
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,540
 all right, it's kind of weird,

142
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,980
 but it's in the Bible, it's there, right.

143
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,980
 Another example, in the book of Job.

144
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:49,300
 Job gives a really clear story, a really clear picture

145
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,700
 about these rebellious spiritual beings

146
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,660
 having some sort of influence

147
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,500
 and power and authority on this earth, right.

148
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,820
 Now, the day came, Job 1, when the sons of God again,

149
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,380
 okay, came to present themselves before the Lord,

150
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,580
 and Satan also arrived among them.

151
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,380
 The Lord said to Satan, "Where have you come from?"

152
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,740
 And Satan answered the Lord,

153
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,180
 "From roving about on the earth

154
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,980
 "and walking back and forth across it."

155
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,580
 And as you know, in the book of Job, in the story of Job,

156
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,260
 there's a season in Job's life, right,

157
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,180
 chaos and ruin permitted by God,

158
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:25,020
 but all orchestrated by the enemy.

159
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,800
 We could talk about this stuff forever.

160
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,140
 If you wanna talk more, I love talking about this stuff,

161
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,820
 okay, take me out for a coffee,

162
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,380
 and then we can talk more about it, okay.

163
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,980
 But the point I'm trying to make is this,

164
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:41,500
 is that yes, there really are dark and evil forces

165
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,620
 in this world, and they are trying to do everything they can

166
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,260
 to sabotage, to distract,

167
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:52,460
 and to destroy your relationship with Jesus.

168
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:56,200
 The enemy out there is out there, and he is not a friend.

169
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,060
 And I think this is especially relevant

170
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,580
 for the people in the Ephesians, of course,

171
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,740
 but like the Ephesian city, Hong Kong, right,

172
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,540
 is a city full of opportunity

173
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:13,060
 to turn to other spiritual sources for guidance,

174
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,740
 right, from things like feng shui, to fortune tellers,

175
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,420
 to the da si yang, the hitting small people down the road,

176
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:22,100
 okay, visiting temples to spin the wheel,

177
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,940
 playing with Ouija boards.

178
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,240
 All these are examples of how the enemy

179
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,620
 tries to capture our attention.

180
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,260
 And so as followers of Jesus in this culture,

181
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,460
 in this city, we have to be very, very careful,

182
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,660
 'cause when we see these things,

183
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,620
 it's not just a little bit of harmless fun.

184
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,380
 Like it's not harmless just to go to a fortune teller

185
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,220
 and say, "Oh, I'm interested in my love life.

186
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,780
 "Can you tell me a little bit about that?"

187
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,500
 Okay, it's not okay.

188
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,700
 It's not okay just to invite a feng shui master

189
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,260
 to come to your office and give you some tips

190
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,580
 on where you should put the fish tank and the tank,

191
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,860
 and you should do this with the windows,

192
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,780
 all that kind of stuff, okay?

193
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,820
 It's not okay, because these practices

194
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,060
 are clearly not from God,

195
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,420
 which means that the source of power

196
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,280
 is from a dark and evil place.

197
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:17,560
 Therefore, as Christians, as followers of Jesus,

198
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,960
 we should have nothing to do with these practices.

199
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,320
 Because like I said just now, there's a fight happening

200
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,520
 between the forces of good and evil in these unseen realms,

201
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,080
 unseen to us, but definitely can have effect

202
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,840
 on our lives and even our souls.

203
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,920
 And so this is why what we're talking about today

204
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,460
 is important.

205
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:40,320
 In fact, the whole letter of Ephesians,

206
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,160
 Paul has been preparing his readers for this moment.

207
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,280
 Throughout the letter, Paul has called them,

208
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,640
 has encouraged them to challenge them

209
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,980
 in the way they live their lives, right?

210
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,020
 To be counter-cultural, to live in a way

211
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:57,800
 that reflects the fact that we are followers of Jesus.

212
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,320
 To live in a way that puts the power of God

213
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,200
 at work in display, right?

214
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,600
 A power so strong, Paul says, it's able to do

215
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,560
 more than we can ever ask or imagine, right?

216
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,680
 This is the power that we carry as followers of Jesus.

217
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,560
 And as followers of Jesus, everybody is invited

218
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,400
 into this community.

219
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,780
 So another thing Paul reminds us of,

220
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:23,120
 we've been called to live in radical unity.

221
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,960
 Doesn't matter who you are, slave, free, Greek, Jew,

222
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,840
 doesn't matter, man, male, female,

223
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,880
 everyone has been called into this community

224
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,120
 to live in radical unity, serving each other,

225
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,340
 submitting to each other, working with each other

226
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,520
 for the glory of God.

227
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,360
 Paul also reminds us that we have been brought

228
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,060
 out of the darkness into the light.

229
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:49,080
 That we were once dead, but now we are alive

230
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,760
 in the love of Christ.

231
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,720
 And because of this, everything we do should be done

232
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,480
 in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

233
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,360
 And so what here is what Paul's saying.

234
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,000
 Here's what scripture is saying.

235
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,920
 If we're really gonna live like this,

236
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,680
 if we take these words seriously,

237
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,420
 if we're gonna take this series I've been walking through

238
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,920
 and apply it to our lives, then you best believe

239
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,320
 we're gonna expect some opposition from the enemy.

240
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,040
 Because the enemy will attack.

241
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,380
 And when he does, if we're not ready,

242
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,380
 if we're not equipped to take a stand

243
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,520
 and to fight back in some way, we'll be in trouble.

244
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,420
 But here's the other thing, and this is the encouraging part.

245
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:37,200
 We don't need to freak out and be super scared about this.

246
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,700
 Because as we're about to find out,

247
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,400
 God has given us everything we need.

248
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,460
 Not only to withstand against the enemy,

249
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,800
 but to fight back against his schemes.

250
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,500
 Listen to these ending words of this letter.

251
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:56,000
 Ephesians 6.10, "Finally, be strong in the Lord

252
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,240
 "and in his mighty power.

253
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,140
 "Put on the full armor of God so that you can take

254
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,100
 "your stand against the devil's schemes.

255
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,780
 "For our struggle is not against flesh and blood,

256
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,000
 "but against the rulers, against the authorities,

257
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,120
 "against the powers of this dark world,

258
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,240
 "and against the spiritual forces of evil

259
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,220
 "in the heavenly realms.

260
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,100
 "Therefore, put on the full armor of God

261
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,100
 "so that when the day of evil comes,

262
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,540
 "you may be able to stand your ground,

263
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:25,720
 "and after you have done everything, to stand.

264
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,760
 "Stand firm then with the belt of truth,

265
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,180
 "buckled around your waist,

266
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:32,500
 "with a breastplate of righteousness in place,

267
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,380
 "and with your feet fitted with the readiness

268
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,020
 "that comes from the gospel of peace.

269
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:40,220
 "In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith

270
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:44,240
 "with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows

271
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,900
 "of the evil one.

272
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,460
 "Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit,

273
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,540
 "which is the word of God.

274
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,120
 "And pray in the Spirit on all occasions,

275
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,260
 "with all kinds of prayers and requests.

276
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:59,040
 "With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying

277
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,280
 "for all the Lord's people.

278
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,520
 "Pray also for me that whenever I speak,

279
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,400
 "words may be given to me so that I will fiercely,

280
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,880
 "fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel,

281
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,580
 "for which I am an ambassador in chains.

282
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:15,660
 "Pray that I might declare it fiercely as I should."

283
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,560
 It's a beautiful passage.

284
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,840
 It's well-known, it's descriptive,

285
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,580
 but it's also super practical.

286
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,120
 So we're gonna walk through this together,

287
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,760
 hand in hand, okay, and see how it equips us

288
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,620
 for this battle we have ahead.

289
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,600
 Well, Paul starts with this.

290
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,100
 It starts with telling us to be strengthened.

291
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,720
 It starts with strength.

292
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,120
 Whatever battle you're fighting in,

293
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,940
 it's always gonna require strength.

294
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:49,260
 But notice here, the strength, the source of this strength.

295
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,600
 Where is this strength coming from?

296
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,160
 This is not a strength we must up in ourselves, right?

297
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,720
 Paul is calling us to be strong in the Lord

298
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,800
 and in his mighty power.

299
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,600
 Our own efforts will only ever get us so far in this battle.

300
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,640
 If we wanna prevail, if we wanna stand firm,

301
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,160
 we have to know what it means to be strong

302
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,020
 and live in his power, in God's power.

303
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,800
 The psalmist refers to this all the time

304
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,760
 as you read through the psalm time and time again, right?

305
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,540
 "My refuge is in the Lord.

306
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,280
 "God is the strength of my heart."

307
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,280
 Jesus reminds his followers of this before he dies.

308
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:32,180
 He told his disciples, "Without me, you can do nothing."

309
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:36,280
 So church, let us ask ourselves this morning,

310
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:40,040
 what is the source of your strength?

311
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:44,240
 It's easy to rely on all sorts of other kind of things.

312
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,120
 Right, some of us are pretty physically fit and strong.

313
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,800
 That's great.

314
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,680
 Right, some of us are super smart.

315
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,280
 We have the brains and that's really good.

316
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,180
 Some of us have resources and money

317
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,000
 and all that kind of stuff.

318
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,760
 That's a source of strength.

319
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,720
 But all of these earthly sources

320
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,760
 will never be enough in this battle

321
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,560
 because as it says,

322
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,800
 our battle is not against flesh and blood.

323
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,480
 So the first step of today,

324
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,840
 the first thing we need to do is,

325
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,820
 as we fight this battle together,

326
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:18,820
 is to find your strength in the Lord and his mighty power.

327
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,800
 And how do we do that?

328
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,600
 What does strength in the Lord look like?

329
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,000
 Well, actually, I think the answer is quite simple.

330
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,960
 Strength in the Lord is total surrender to him.

331
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:39,800
 To do what he says, to be obedient to God.

332
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,080
 Strength in the Lord is what Paul reminds us of

333
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,640
 early in chapter three,

334
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,640
 to live as Christ is dwelling in our hearts through faith.

335
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:54,580
 Surrendering to the Lord, walking in obedience with him.

336
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,320
 That's where we find our strength.

337
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,020
 So after we've been strengthened,

338
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,460
 we are empowered by the Lord's strength.

339
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:08,060
 Then we're instructed to put on the full armor of God

340
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,500
 so that you can take your stand

341
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,240
 against the devil's evil schemes.

342
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,220
 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood,

343
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,080
 but against the rulers and authorities,

344
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,700
 the dark powers of this world

345
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,160
 and against the spiritual forces of evil

346
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,740
 in the heavenly realms.

347
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,100
 Put on.

348
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,960
 So this is actually action we have to take now, to put on.

349
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,840
 It's not just a display piece in the museum

350
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,420
 for you to admire and to look at.

351
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,220
 You actually have to put this on.

352
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,780
 Again, time and time throughout the book of Ephesians,

353
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,120
 Paul is encouraging us to put things on,

354
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,920
 to take off the old self, to put on the new self.

355
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,480
 Now we're being encouraged to put on the armor of God.

356
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,000
 And in a battle, you're gonna need armor.

357
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,800
 But notice again, the source of this armor,

358
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,480
 it's the armor of God, not your own armor,

359
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,440
 not your own ideas.

360
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,640
 We put on these things because the source of them

361
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,480
 is from God.

362
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:03,560
 And we put it on so we can take a stand

363
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,180
 against the devil schemes.

364
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:12,280
 Just as Jesus has good plans for your life,

365
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,040
 for you to have life and life in the full,

366
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,960
 to live a life free from the chains of sin,

367
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,480
 the enemy also has schemes for your life too.

368
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,720
 And when it comes to talking about the enemy schemes,

369
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,840
 I think it can go a few ways.

370
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:31,920
 Right, one idea, one perspective of this is that

371
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,480
 we refuse to believe that these things

372
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,160
 are actually happening.

373
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,160
 Right, we find it too weird.

374
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,600
 Maybe you're even sitting here right now

375
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,120
 and say, this is weird, Allison.

376
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,040
 I brought a friend today.

377
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,780
 You're talking about all this woo-woo stuff, okay,

378
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,200
 like focus on something else, okay?

379
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,600
 So we just ignore it.

380
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,960
 We don't wanna talk about it, it's weird, and we ignore it.

381
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,840
 Sometimes, though, we might trivialize it.

382
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,400
 Right, this is sort of picturing the devil

383
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:01,360
 as a man in a red spandex suit with a dodgy mustache

384
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,320
 holding a pitchfork.

385
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,600
 You know, it's like, kinda looks kinda comical.

386
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,120
 Yeah, you know, the mentality is that,

387
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,640
 yeah, it might be some weird stuff like that out there,

388
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,160
 but you know, no one takes it that seriously.

389
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,480
 It's just a bit of fun, you know.

390
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,420
 In fact, you know, it might even be interesting

391
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:19,920
 to see what happens there sometimes, right?

392
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,320
 So there's that perspective.

393
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:25,780
 Maybe some of us, though, live in constant fear

394
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,020
 of the enemy's attack, right?

395
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:31,900
 And so everything we do, we interpret it through the lens

396
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,780
 of it's a spiritual attack on me.

397
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,900
 Everything that happens, anything bad that happens,

398
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,180
 it's a spiritual attack on me.

399
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,920
 Like I said, we'll talk about this a bit more

400
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,540
 in a minute, right?

401
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:46,540
 And so, you know, we, it ends up being trapped in fear

402
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,820
 about the enemy's attack, right?

403
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,760
 Around every corner is a devil waiting to attack me.

404
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,540
 And then maybe there's some of us

405
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,240
 who have really crossed that line,

406
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,080
 who have shown too much of an interest

407
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,420
 and actually been drawn into the powers

408
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,040
 of this dark and evil world.

409
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,860
 And we found ourselves in some really, really dark

410
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,780
 and scary and evil places.

411
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,060
 All these, though, have one thing in common.

412
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:15,340
 What the scheme of the enemy is trying to do

413
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:19,180
 is to keep your eyes off of Jesus,

414
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:22,380
 to keep you in the dark, to feed you lies,

415
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,980
 to stir up your worry and your anxiety in your life.

416
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:29,180
 And I think one of the most popular thing he does

417
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:34,760
 is that the enemy loves to make evil look attractive.

418
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,420
 The enemy loves to think that sin

419
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,500
 and living outside of God's will,

420
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,400
 disobedience is something that we can just control

421
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,300
 for ourselves, right?

422
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,020
 Sin is like this little pet,

423
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,700
 like a little thing we can play with.

424
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,620
 When we get bored of it, we can put it away.

425
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,780
 But you know, it's harmless.

426
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,940
 I'm just gonna, you know,

427
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,020
 hang out with this thing for a little bit.

428
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:58,020
 But this is always how it starts.

429
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:01,620
 And this quote I got in my research for this message,

430
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,260
 you know, illustrates it so well.

431
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:06,580
 It says this, "Evil rarely looks evil

432
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,740
 until it accomplishes its goal.

433
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:12,060
 It gains entrance by appearing attractive,

434
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,500
 desirable, and perfectly legitimate.

435
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,580
 But it is a baited and camouflaged trap."

436
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:21,580
 Let's be wise, church.

437
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,220
 Let's not be fools.

438
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,100
 1 Peter 5:8 tells us, "The enemy, the devil,

439
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,100
 prowls around like a roaring lion

440
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,620
 looking for someone to devour."

441
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:35,740
 And sin and disobedience will absolutely destroy

442
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:39,540
 your lives now and even for all eternity.

443
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:43,500
 But this is why we call it a battle, right?

444
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,020
 Life as a Christian is a struggle.

445
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,100
 Because even though when we're aware of these things,

446
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,020
 that there's evil out there, there is a draw to it.

447
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:56,020
 Right, this is the word Paul uses for struggle here.

448
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,460
 It's actually the word, the same word

449
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,780
 for like a physical wrestling match, right?

450
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,620
 Wrestling was one of the popular sports

451
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,700
 in the back in the day, right?

452
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,900
 Like a jujitsu thing they're doing, you know.

453
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,260
 It feels like that sometimes, right?

454
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,940
 When you're wrestling against sin,

455
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,540
 someone's trying to get your back,

456
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,020
 trying to twist your arm, trying to choke you out.

457
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:15,780
 Maybe it's a bit like this in more practical ways.

458
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,580
 When temptation comes up.

459
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,980
 Lots of different examples of this,

460
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,820
 but for example, one thing that I find myself

461
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,980
 wrestling sometimes, right?

462
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,740
 Late at night, you're tired, everyone's asleep,

463
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,460
 and it's finally time for yourself.

464
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,900
 You're trying to settle down.

465
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:34,220
 What are some things that pop up to mind in that moment?

466
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:38,220
 Oh, you feel tired, you know, you've had a long day.

467
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,220
 Turn to this.

468
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,780
 Go onto that website.

469
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,860
 Have that extra drink that you don't need.

470
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:49,820
 Maybe it's drugs, maybe it's gambling,

471
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,540
 maybe it's an out of control shopping habit,

472
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,740
 something like that.

473
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:59,140
 And in those moments, if you do not have on the armor of God,

474
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,940
 if you are not strong in the Lord,

475
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,740
 the enemy will get the better of you.

476
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:11,220
 Which is why Paul says, "And put on the full armor of God,

477
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,180
 "so that when that day of evil comes,

478
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,740
 "when those moments come,

479
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,420
 "you may be able to stand your ground,

480
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:22,260
 "and after you've done everything, to stand."

481
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:26,020
 It's like me trying to play a prank on Brittany, right?

482
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,260
 Always trying to figure her out,

483
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,940
 always trying to trick her, scare her,

484
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,340
 in the same way the enemy is trying

485
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,460
 to do the same thing to us.

486
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:37,860
 Which is why we've been encouraged to stand our ground.

487
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,900
 Stand firm, wearing the full armor of God.

488
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:45,060
 This is how we fight back against the enemy and his schemes.

489
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:50,100
 The enemy is strong, he has influence, he has power,

490
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,220
 but it's limited.

491
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,780
 It's limited, and with this armor of God,

492
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:58,060
 we can stand firm against his schemes.

493
00:21:58,980 --> 00:21:59,980
 So which is why again he says,

494
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,620
 "Stand firm, with a belt of truth

495
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,220
 "buckled around your waist.

496
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,660
 "The breastplate of righteousness is in place,

497
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,460
 "feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel,

498
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,260
 "the shield of faith to extinguish

499
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,300
 "the flaming arrows of the evil one,

500
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,980
 "the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit,

501
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,820
 "which is the word of God."

502
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,460
 So there's a number of components, right?

503
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:23,460
 It's different things that we have been called to put on

504
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,700
 that help us in this battle against the enemy.

505
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,340
 So let's see how these parts fit together.

506
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,740
 First it says this,

507
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:35,820
 "The belt of truth buckled around your waist."

508
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,580
 Now as we're talking about this,

509
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,220
 imagine like a Roman soldier standing there.

510
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,180
 In the context of a soldier,

511
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,420
 the belt would have been the thing that keeps

512
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,860
 all the rest of the pieces together.

513
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:50,420
 Holds everything down so the soldier can be ready for action.

514
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:53,620
 The belt of truth around the waist.

515
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,940
 Now maybe some of us don't want us to see the truth

516
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,500
 around our waist, okay?

517
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,980
 Hips don't lie, you know what I mean?

518
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:03,260
 All right, but as believers of Jesus,

519
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:06,780
 as believers of Jesus, we know the truth.

520
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,180
 Now the enemy, his schemes, right?

521
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,540
 He hates the truth.

522
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:13,860
 John 8, 44 tells us that the enemy

523
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:18,220
 is a liar and the father of lies.

524
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,300
 The enemy hates the truth.

525
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,580
 But this is why we have to say it even more clearly.

526
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:26,100
 So let me remind us, church, of the truth.

527
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,420
 The truth is that Jesus loves you

528
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,740
 and he died for your sins.

529
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:34,580
 The truth is he is alive and resurrected.

530
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,580
 The truth that he has called you to live a life

531
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:41,300
 that reflects and shows his love to those around us.

532
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,500
 The truth is even though there are these other

533
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,620
 spiritual beings, there is only one true,

534
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,580
 all-powerful, almighty God.

535
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:54,500
 And the truth is the war has already been won.

536
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,940
 Jesus, over on this earth, is progressing

537
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:00,860
 and advancing against these unseen powers of darkness

538
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:03,700
 and the kingdom of God has a very clear goal

539
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,460
 and it will reach this goal.

540
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,180
 The reclamation of all peoples and all nations,

541
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,260
 the full restoration of God's creation

542
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,260
 to how he originally created it to be.

543
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,620
 This day is coming.

544
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,940
 That is the truth, church, and the truth doesn't change.

545
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,420
 So church, do you have this belt of truth

546
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,340
 buckled around you?

547
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:27,180
 Does the truth of who Jesus is and what he has done

548
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:31,660
 for you and all humanity hold your life together?

549
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:35,060
 Wrap this truth around yourself tightly.

550
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:39,580
 Buckle up because without it, everything will fall apart.

551
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:45,540
 Then it talks about the breastplate of righteousness.

552
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,940
 Now the breastplate is the largest piece

553
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:52,820
 of the Roman soldier's armor, protects the vital organs,

554
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:55,100
 the heart, the lungs, all that kind of stuff.

555
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,020
 But because the breastplate is the biggest,

556
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,140
 it's the most obvious part.

557
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,140
 It's the part that everyone can see.

558
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,020
 It's the most prominent thing.

559
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:06,940
 And so in our context, in what we're talking about here,

560
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:11,660
 for us, this means God has called us to proudly display

561
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:15,700
 the fact that we are followers of Jesus,

562
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:19,020
 that we are children of the light,

563
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,420
 that we walk in righteousness.

564
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:25,460
 Now the opposite of righteousness is wickedness.

565
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:30,380
 And the enemy, that's what he delights in, in wickedness.

566
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:34,020
 Scripture tells us that the enemy is an oppressor.

567
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:37,700
 The enemy is the orchestrator of injustice.

568
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:41,340
 The enemy would like to see us do unrighteous things,

569
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,620
 unholy things to each other.

570
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,540
 Then the enemy wants us to abuse

571
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,820
 and to take advantage of each other.

572
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,780
 That's wickedness.

573
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:52,380
 That's how the enemy's schemes work.

574
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:55,660
 But when we put on the breastplate of righteousness,

575
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:59,180
 it means that we are in right standing with God,

576
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:02,820
 which also means we are living out God's justice

577
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,700
 in his battle against evil.

578
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:09,780
 So church, put on this breastplate of righteousness.

579
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,700
 We are called to live a life that reflects God's heart

580
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,540
 for the weak and the oppressed.

581
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:19,060
 We are called to speak out and do something

582
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:23,380
 when a situation doesn't fit in to what God's heart is.

583
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,340
 We are called to act justly,

584
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:29,620
 just as God is just and righteous.

585
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:34,860
 So we put on this breastplate so we can be the people of God

586
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,380
 that he has called us to be.

587
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:40,500
 People who walk alongside the weak and the oppressed,

588
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,260
 who look after the widows and the orphans,

589
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,460
 a voice of justice in a world that's unjust,

590
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:50,820
 a people who are unashamedly living for the gospel,

591
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,740
 proudly declaring who they are.

592
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,820
 Put on this breastplate of righteousness

593
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,940
 and wear it proudly, church.

594
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:03,300
 Then it tells us, the feet fitted with the readiness

595
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,700
 that comes from the gospel of peace.

596
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,660
 So much of a soldier's life, right,

597
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,900
 you can imagine is either spent standing firm,

598
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,740
 standing in one place, keeping guard,

599
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,780
 or requiring them to march forward

600
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,300
 and move to a different place.

601
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,940
 Both require strong, steady shoes.

602
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,260
 And time and time again, you have heard it repeated,

603
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,460
 the call has been to stand firm,

604
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,340
 stand firm, to be unmoved.

605
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:33,700
 You see, the enemy doesn't want us to stand firm.

606
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:37,740
 The enemy wants to make us change our minds.

607
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,820
 That's another one of his schemes,

608
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,660
 especially in our relationship with Jesus.

609
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:45,340
 The enemy knows that a double-minded person

610
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:48,300
 is unstable in all that they do.

611
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,660
 James 1:8 tells us that.

612
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,700
 And so what he wants to do,

613
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:56,060
 he likes nothing more than to make us second guess

614
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:59,260
 Jesus' love for us, his plans for us,

615
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:03,380
 to get us to doubt what God has already told us.

616
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:07,260
 In other words, to disrupt the peace that you feel

617
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,300
 when you have the word of God,

618
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,300
 when you have Jesus living with you and in you

619
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,380
 that comes from following the Lord.

620
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:19,220
 Do you feel like you can relate to this?

621
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:23,220
 Have you ever felt yourself doubting the goodness of God?

622
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,780
 Right at the beginning, that was his scheme, right?

623
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,220
 He said to Eve, did God really say this?

624
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:30,020
 Trying to get her to change her mind?

625
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:33,060
 Do you ever find yourself living one way

626
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:36,140
 in certain situations or living another life

627
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,540
 in another situation?

628
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,540
 Big part of my testimony growing up,

629
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,940
 I struggled with that so much.

630
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,060
 I felt like with my school friends,

631
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,300
 and in one context I was this person,

632
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,620
 but in another context I was the good church boy

633
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,500
 and it was so hard trying to navigate my life

634
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,180
 between the two identities

635
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,980
 that I seemed to carry at that time.

636
00:28:54,980 --> 00:29:00,340
 Do you ever hear the enemy make you doubt

637
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:03,860
 if God really has given you the peace he has promised you?

638
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:10,020
 We need to fit our feet in the gospel

639
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,100
 because the gospel is the only thing

640
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:15,420
 that gives us a firm foundation to stand on,

641
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,920
 to build our lives upon.

642
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,420
 Jesus said this before he left earth,

643
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:22,900
 peace I leave with you, my peace I give to you,

644
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,780
 not as the world gives do I give to you.

645
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:28,020
 Let not your hearts be troubled,

646
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,260
 neither let them be afraid.

647
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:33,740
 So we fit our feet with the gospel

648
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,900
 so that we can have a firm place to stand

649
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,180
 and to build our life.

650
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,060
 But here's the other thing,

651
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,900
 at the same time, knowing the gospel

652
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,260
 also allows us to bring this peace

653
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:48,380
 to areas of conflict, to areas that need it.

654
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,620
 We have been called to stand firm, yes,

655
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:55,420
 but sometimes offense is the best version of defense.

656
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:58,140
 And when we see there's a place that needs the gospel,

657
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,820
 when we see our family and our friends,

658
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:04,260
 when we see areas of this society that needs peace,

659
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,220
 then we are called to carry it there.

660
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:09,900
 And when that moment comes for you to carry the gospel,

661
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,580
 to live out the gospel, to speak the gospel,

662
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:15,060
 we also need to be ready for those moments

663
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:17,700
 whenever opportunity presents itself.

664
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,820
 Whenever God calls you,

665
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,660
 will you be able to respond like Isaiah and say,

666
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:27,020
 Lord, here I am, send me.

667
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,940
 So we put on the gospel,

668
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,660
 we fit our feet with the gospel of peace

669
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,060
 so that we cannot just stand firm,

670
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:38,780
 but also bring the gospel to those places that need it.

671
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:43,740
 Then it says we need to take up the shield of faith

672
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,700
 with which you can extinguish

673
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:49,100
 all the flaming arrows of the evil one.

674
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,420
 So the shields for Roman soldier

675
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,460
 were probably about like four feet high,

676
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,980
 about as wide as a body,

677
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,380
 a cover up most of the upper body.

678
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,180
 They were important because

679
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,380
 one of the most common methods of attack back then

680
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:02,460
 was to dip arrows in tar and light it.

681
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,780
 You've probably seen it in the movies, right?

682
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:06,780
 These flaming arrows, literally flaming arrows that come

683
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,980
 and so like with the sword, you can,

684
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:12,660
 with a shield, you can block the enemy's attacks.

685
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:16,780
 The shields will have a special covering on the top,

686
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,540
 like a leather, so the shield itself

687
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:21,260
 wouldn't sort of burn up as well.

688
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,460
 Google it, I don't know.

689
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:25,300
 For us, this is what's important, okay?

690
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:30,340
 The shield of faith talks about our faith

691
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:34,060
 and our loyalty to Jesus, no matter what.

692
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:38,020
 The enemy is a master archer,

693
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:41,860
 and like we said, he fires, all things kind of schemes.

694
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:45,540
 His arrows he fires at us are things like doubt,

695
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:50,540
 things like fear, selfishness, impurity, lust, greed,

696
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:54,340
 adverse circumstances, pride, self-confidence,

697
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:57,140
 persecution, false teaching, all these things,

698
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,300
 the list could go on.

699
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:02,220
 These arrows are there to make us doubt what we believe in.

700
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:07,140
 His arrows are designed to try and burn down our faith.

701
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:13,940
 But the shield reminds us that we walk by faith

702
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,220
 and not by sight.

703
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,660
 So even as the enemy fires these arrows,

704
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:21,980
 we put up our faith, we put up our loyalty to Jesus,

705
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:24,260
 and they will be extinguished.

706
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:27,260
 Even when we do not fully see or understand

707
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,940
 what is happening, faith is acknowledging

708
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:33,060
 that God's ways are higher than our ways.

709
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:37,180
 And in this battle, we cannot defer, we cannot jump ship.

710
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,980
 We have to stay loyal to Jesus.

711
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:43,700
 One of the most amazing displays of faith and loyalty,

712
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,940
 I think, in scripture is through the story

713
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:49,260
 of Daniel's friends, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego

714
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,660
 in the book of Daniel.

715
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:54,700
 Here they are facing the fiery furnace,

716
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,460
 and these are their words.

717
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:59,660
 "If we are thrown into the blazing furnace,

718
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:02,300
 "the God we serve is able to deliver us from it,

719
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,180
 "and he will deliver us."

720
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,140
 That's the faith.

721
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:10,060
 "But even if he does not, we want you to know,

722
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,500
 "your majesty, that we will not serve your gods

723
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,060
 "or worship the image of gold you have set up."

724
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,060
 That's the loyalty.

725
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,900
 So church, we have been called to hold on tight

726
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:26,620
 to the shield of faith, and to loyally follow Jesus

727
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:31,220
 into battle, extinguishing all the flaming arrows

728
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,060
 of the enemy.

729
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:38,820
 Then it tells us about the helmet of salvation.

730
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,380
 Right, for the soldier, the helmet covers

731
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,860
 another important part of the body, the head.

732
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:45,460
 And the helmet was also sometimes a way of determining

733
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,300
 the position and the rank of the soldier,

734
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:50,100
 these plumes on the top of the helmet.

735
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:56,220
 And so for us, this helmet speaks to our identity.

736
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:59,460
 It's knowing who you belong to.

737
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:03,580
 As you battle, as you take your stand,

738
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:06,900
 know that you are fighting for King Jesus.

739
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:10,500
 That as brothers and sisters, as people of Christ,

740
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,780
 we are part of the Lord's army.

741
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,300
 And with the helmet of salvation,

742
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,220
 and what that does, it's that reminds us

743
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:20,460
 that we have already been saved.

744
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:23,860
 This is one of the most important things to hold on to.

745
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,380
 All these things that the enemy's trying to do,

746
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:29,220
 ultimately, they're not gonna change the outcome.

747
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:32,700
 Right, we said this just now, Jesus is already victorious.

748
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:37,580
 He's doing everything he can to try and distract us

749
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,420
 from this fact.

750
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,940
 But through his death and resurrection,

751
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,940
 Jesus has already won.

752
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:46,060
 He has already overcome sin and death.

753
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:50,260
 And the enemy's not attacking from a place of strength,

754
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:53,980
 but from a place of already having been defeated.

755
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,660
 Well, we have to realize this,

756
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:59,220
 the enemy is a desperate loser.

757
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:03,580
 In this time, he might have some influence on earth,

758
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:06,820
 but his fate has already been sealed.

759
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,900
 And when Jesus returns, when the new heaven

760
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,460
 and the new earth comes,

761
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,260
 the enemy and all his deeds

762
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:15,420
 and all these other spiritual forces,

763
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,780
 these evil spiritual forces,

764
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:19,540
 will be destroyed once and for all.

765
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:23,580
 And the helmet reminds us that salvation

766
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,660
 and victory belongs to our God.

767
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,780
 We are on the winning side.

768
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:31,660
 And so yes, we might get wounded.

769
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:34,700
 We might get hurt.

770
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,980
 But following Jesus and doing spiritual battle

771
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:40,260
 against the enemy is not going to be a breeze.

772
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:43,700
 It's not going to be smooth sailing.

773
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,580
 Let's not forget there are people out there,

774
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,660
 other Christians in parts of the world

775
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,740
 who are literally being persecuted,

776
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:53,820
 literally risking their lives for the sake of the gospel.

777
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:57,300
 But even in that situation,

778
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:00,140
 the helmet of salvation reminds us,

779
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:03,180
 even if we were to lose everything on this earth,

780
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:07,700
 everything, we are still victorious

781
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:11,900
 because God has already won the ultimate battle.

782
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:15,580
 So church, we put on our helmet.

783
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:18,780
 Be brave.

784
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:22,140
 Be strong and courageous, as scripture has called us to.

785
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,540
 Take risks for Jesus.

786
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,780
 Go all out and live for him

787
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,660
 because he has already saved you.

788
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:34,940
 And finally, we get the sword of the spirit,

789
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,540
 which is the word of God.

790
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:41,420
 The sword is the one weapon of offense the soldier carries,

791
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,460
 a short little dagger-like thing

792
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,740
 used for close-handed combat.

793
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:49,460
 For us, though, when it speaks of the sword,

794
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:52,460
 this speaks to the power of God's word.

795
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,660
 And we remind ourselves, scripture is reminding us

796
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:59,780
 that the word of God is alive and active.

797
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:02,500
 Throughout scripture, again, you see,

798
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,540
 whenever the word of God is heard,

799
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:08,260
 whenever God speaks, there is power in it.

800
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:11,700
 Things happen when God speaks.

801
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,260
 Situations change.

802
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:17,420
 Therefore, knowing God's word is one of the key ways

803
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,700
 we not only stand firm against the enemy,

804
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,660
 but the only weapon you have in this battle

805
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:25,740
 against the enemy is the sword of his word,

806
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,300
 the sword of the spirit.

807
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:31,380
 Jesus himself is a great example of this.

808
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,180
 When Jesus is tested in the wilderness,

809
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,780
 when the enemy tempts him with lies,

810
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,700
 when the enemy fires his darts at him,

811
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,300
 he stays loyal, he does all that stuff,

812
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,380
 but then he also fights back with scripture,

813
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,860
 with God's word.

814
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:48,060
 In the same way, then, church,

815
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:50,420
 we today need to have a relationship

816
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:53,540
 and a good understanding of the word of God

817
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:57,180
 to withstand the enemy and to fight back against his schemes.

818
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:01,100
 So let's cherish God's word, church.

819
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,620
 Read it.

820
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,740
 Meditate on it.

821
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:04,580
 Cherish it.

822
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,620
 Memorize it.

823
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,820
 Study it together.

824
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:11,700
 Listen to it, because this is our only weapon

825
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,060
 in this fight against the enemy.

826
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:19,020
 But be encouraged also that God still speaks today,

827
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,700
 yes, through his word,

828
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,060
 but one of the key ways God speaks today

829
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,620
 is through the Holy Spirit.

830
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:27,260
 The Holy Spirit, therefore,

831
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:30,540
 also fights back against the enemy when we're attacked.

832
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:33,380
 Since this battle is not against flesh and blood,

833
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,860
 our weapon is also not against flesh,

834
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:38,820
 our weapons are also not physical weapons.

835
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:44,780
 We too now, then, we study God's word

836
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,620
 and we follow the Holy Spirit

837
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:51,300
 and allow him to move in power whenever he speaks.

838
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:55,900
 Now, finally, it's this.

839
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,860
 You see, we're not just individual soldiers

840
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:00,980
 fighting these battles,

841
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,780
 these little squirmishes on our own.

842
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:07,580
 Paul brings everything together

843
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:10,340
 in the central idea of prayer.

844
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:15,460
 Prayer's the final thing that completes the armor of God.

845
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:18,540
 This is why Paul signs off this letter by saying,

846
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:22,060
 and pray in the spirit in all occasions

847
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:25,380
 with all kinds of prayers and requests,

848
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:28,380
 with this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying

849
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,740
 for all the Lord's people.

850
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:34,140
 Pray also for me that whenever I speak,

851
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,900
 words may be given me so that I will fiercely make known

852
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,300
 the mystery of the gospel for which I am ambassador

853
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:43,260
 in chains, pray that I might declare it fearlessly

854
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,580
 as I should.

855
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:51,060
 Paul's writing to a community, to a group of people,

856
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,940
 and he's asking them to pray together.

857
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,660
 Always pray, don't stop praying.

858
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,460
 He says this in other parts of his letter.

859
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:00,340
 Pray in all occasions, keep on praying for God's people.

860
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,900
 Keep on praying for each other.

861
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,540
 And pray also for me.

862
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:07,980
 See, it's a sobering end to this letter

863
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:11,100
 because we're reminded as Paul is writing this letter,

864
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:15,020
 he's not actually writing from a place of confidence.

865
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,260
 He is in prison.

866
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:20,500
 He is actually being held captive and in chains.

867
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,700
 In some commentaries you read, as he's writing this,

868
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,020
 there was probably a literal Roman soldier

869
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,900
 standing there keeping a guard of him.

870
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,380
 But notice what he says.

871
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,940
 He doesn't pray, oh, pray for my release,

872
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:35,740
 pray for justice to be done, pray that I would walk free.

873
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,860
 That's the probably kind of stuff

874
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,700
 I would be asking people to pray for.

875
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,220
 But he gets it.

876
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,460
 In this battle, he doesn't say,

877
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:45,100
 pray that I would be released.

878
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,440
 He says, pray for my wisdom.

879
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,260
 Pray for my courage.

880
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,360
 Pray that I would know what to say

881
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:55,380
 in every single situation for the sake of Jesus.

882
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,800
 You see, this is what it looks like then,

883
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,860
 to stand firm and to fight back

884
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:02,400
 against the schemes on the enemy.

885
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,360
 This is what it looks like

886
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,800
 when no weapons formed against you prosper.

887
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,660
 Because no matter what situation you're in,

888
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,640
 you are strong in the Lord.

889
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:17,240
 And so we pray together as a community.

890
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,560
 When things come up, we join together in prayer

891
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,680
 and walk alongside each other as a community.

892
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:27,520
 Fight as a community of believers, not just on your own.

893
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:34,560
 And so since Paul encourages us to do this,

894
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,320
 this is how I wanna end our time together this morning.

895
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:43,400
 So we're gonna still our hearts for a moment.

896
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:50,360
 And maybe if you came with someone today,

897
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,980
 you know, Paul's asking us to pray together.

898
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:56,560
 Maybe turn to the person you came with right now.

899
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,440
 And we can ask each other for you,

900
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,720
 have a quick conversation, you know,

901
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,060
 how can I pray for you?

902
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:07,320
 Where have you been feeling attacked lately?

903
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:10,440
 Where do you need courage?

904
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:15,280
 Where do you need the Spirit of God to empower you,

905
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,400
 to strengthen you, to walk alongside you?

906
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:23,120
 How can I be a brother and a sister to you this morning?

907
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:28,720
 Prayer is one of those things,

908
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,000
 it's one of those beautiful things

909
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,960
 that help us to acknowledge that, again,

910
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,920
 this is not by our own power.

911
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,600
 It's a mysterious thing that when we pray

912
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,800
 and when God speaks and when he works,

913
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,720
 we see him move in power.

914
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,080
 Even though we can't really explain how it works,

915
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:53,000
 at the same time we know that without prayer, we are nothing.

916
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:59,200
 And so church, just take a couple minutes right now.

917
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,560
 If you came alone, I encourage you,

918
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,160
 you can, if you use a bit of courage,

919
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:06,120
 pray with the, ask for prayer for the person next to you.

920
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:10,320
 In the areas of struggle that you have,

921
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:13,440
 in the areas that you feel like the enemy is attacking you,

922
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,940
 we pray with each other to stand firm in this battle.

923
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:20,120
 So give us a few minutes to do that

924
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,280
 and then I'm gonna close with a prayer.

925
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,660
 (soft music)

926
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:28,080
 (soft music)

927
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,500
 (soft music)

928
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,920
 (soft music)

929
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,340
 (soft music)

930
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:37,760
 (soft music)

931
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,180
 (soft music)

932
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:42,600
 (soft music)

933
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,020
 (soft music)

934
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:47,440
 (soft music)

935
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,860
 (soft music)

936
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,280
 (soft music)

937
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,700
 (soft music)

938
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,120
 (soft music)

939
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,540
 (soft music)

940
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,960
 (soft music)

941
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,380
 (soft music)

942
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:06,800
 (soft music)

943
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,220
 (soft music)

944
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:38,460
 So Jesus, we thank you for giving us this armor.

945
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:42,520
 We thank you that you do not leave us alone

946
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,500
 and defenseless and helpless,

947
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:49,320
 but you equip us and empower us to live on this earth

948
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,680
 in a victorious way,

949
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:55,340
 in a way that doesn't live in carrying fear

950
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:58,280
 of what the enemy might do to us,

951
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:01,880
 but in the confidence that no matter

952
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,760
 what the enemy does to us,

953
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,160
 we can stand firm,

954
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:11,520
 that we have this faith that can quench every single lie

955
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:15,160
 and doubt and attack that the enemy might try

956
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,400
 to harm us with,

957
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,600
 and still stand firm and say,

958
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,640
 I am a child of God.

959
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,920
 I am in the Lord's army and with my brothers

960
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,840
 and sisters around me in community,

961
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,220
 praying with me, praying for me,

962
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:36,300
 the enemy will not be successful

963
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,460
 in the schemes that he has planned for us,

964
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:41,140
 but the plan of God,

965
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:43,140
 his will is what is gonna be done

966
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,700
 and accomplished in this world.

967
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:49,640
 So Jesus, we give ourselves over to you.

968
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:53,100
 Father, I pray for those of us out there

969
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,660
 who may have strayed in this area.

970
00:45:55,660 --> 00:46:00,340
 Perhaps we have switched allegiances

971
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:03,620
 and in a moment of weakness,

972
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:04,700
 in a season of doubt,

973
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:08,520
 we've turned to other spiritual sources for advice,

974
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:12,500
 for direction in how to live our life.

975
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:17,260
 Father, I pray that if any of us listening online

976
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:19,060
 or those of us who are in this room right now

977
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:22,680
 or family members are in that place,

978
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:26,820
 Father, I pray that the Holy Spirit would come right now,

979
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:28,420
 the power would come right now

980
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:30,820
 and just cut off all schemes and all lies

981
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:34,780
 and all attachments that the enemy has made in that space.

982
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:40,420
 That the enemy has no hold on anybody in this room

983
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:45,480
 and with the full armor of God,

984
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,040
 we are standing firm.

985
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:54,660
 And that from this day onwards

986
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:59,040
 and in every moment we trust and rely in you.

987
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,580
 We build our lives,

988
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:06,060
 we put our feet solidly on the solid ground on the gospel.

989
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:11,020
 We rest in the truth of you being the almighty King

990
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:18,860
 and together Lord, with your word, we march forward.

991
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:23,020
 We fight back against the enemy

992
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:27,820
 and we await your coming back to this earth

993
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:30,560
 and reclaiming your rightful place on the throne.

994
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:34,500
 Until then Lord, sustain us in this fight,

995
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:38,260
 keep us strong, keep us unified in your love,

996
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:42,160
 keep us trusting in you, keep us loyal to King Jesus.

997
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:48,460
 We pray these in your mighty, beautiful,

998
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:53,380
 awesome, victorious name, the name of Jesus, amen.

999
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:56,840
 (gentle music)

1000
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,420
 (gentle music)

1001
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:03,020
 If you're still praying.
