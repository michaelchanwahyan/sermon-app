1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,360
 # Oh, it's when you... #

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:14,440
 Imagine with me for a moment a church.

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,440
 This is not a church in the singular, on its own and distinct,

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,840
 but a church in the plural, united across a nation,

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,480
 joined in purpose,

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,280
 focused on building up God's kingdom one life at a time.

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,680
 It is a church that has at the heart of its DNA

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,200
 the grand narrative of the redemptive story of Jesus Christ,

9
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,640
 and that celebrates in the freedom and grace

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,640
 that such a story brings.

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,520
 This church is not constricted by the walls of a building,

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,240
 but actively engaged in the community it is planted in,

13
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,720
 desiring for God's kingdom to take root and bear fruit in local soil.

14
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,840
 A church that sees salvation as holistic,

15
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,600
 transforming God's people for God's work

16
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,680
 and equipping a generation to represent God's heart

17
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,560
 to the poor, the weak, the oppressed and the persecuted.

18
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:15,360
 Imagine this church committed to seeing the family as integral

19
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,640
 to all that it's called to be and do,

20
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,560
 involving intentional, committed and authentic relationships

21
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,760
 across all levels.

22
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,600
 It is the sort of place where both the young and the old

23
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,240
 feel cared for, supported and equipped.

24
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,560
 A church where people of all backgrounds and traditions

25
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,240
 come to feel at home,

26
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,360
 a cultural mosaic that honours and embraces

27
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:45,920
 a richness and diversity that marks us as the body of Christ.

28
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,800
 It is a church that is willing to innovate and express faith creatively,

29
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:56,600
 reflecting the boundless limits of God's creativity as glory to Him.

30
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,640
 A place where people gather, hungry for the presence of God

31
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,360
 and passionate to see this invade all aspects of their lives,

32
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,200
 where they seek to develop an intelligent, spiritual faith,

33
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,040
 rooted in God's word and driven with prayer.

34
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,680
 A church that does not make its Sunday services

35
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,960
 the exclamation mark of its existence,

36
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:24,160
 but instead the comma in its ongoing sentence.

37
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,800
 A time of service, love and engagement that inspires and emboldens

38
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,120
 all equally for the conversation that lies ahead.

39
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:40,280
 A church that cares, disciples, rebuilds, renews.

40
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,520
 This is our city.

41
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,800
 This is our church.

42
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,440
 This is our home.

43
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,760
 And this is the 11.30 service.

44
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,320
 Good morning, everyone.

45
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,920
 Anybody here? Anybody here? Hi.

46
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,360
 All right, so first of all,

47
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,800
 if you're here for the Cantonese service just now,

48
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,440
 who are the Cantonese people here?

49
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,760
 I just want to say hello to you, love you.

50
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,600
 Thank you for coming.

51
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,200
 And then we're starting the English service now.

52
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,240
 So you guys are here for the right service.

53
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,560
 Good, good, good. Okay.

54
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,080
 Like you guys look a little bit tired.

55
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,680
 Are you okay?

56
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,880
 Okay.

57
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,640
 If you come in here, you see it's Chinese New Year soon.

58
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,880
 I can sing you a Chinese New Year song to wake you up if you want to.

59
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,040
 No, that's okay.

60
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,600
 Let's not do that. Let's not do that.

61
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,320
 Gong Xi Gong Xi Gong Xi.

62
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,520
 No, this is not the kind of song we're singing,

63
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,320
 in case you're worried.

64
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:41,480
 Why don't we stand up and we're going to worship together.

65
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,000
 You see, as you know, in Hong Kong here,

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,920
 we celebrate two New Years.

67
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,400
 So in case some of your New Year resolution

68
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,080
 is not working too well,

69
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,680
 in the first month of 2024, you have the second one.

70
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,440
 And we've been preaching this fresh encounter with God.

71
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,440
 So I hope by the end of the sermon today,

72
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,280
 this is the end of the series, Fresh Encounter.

73
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,280
 I hope, I pray that you're ready,

74
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,680
 finally ready for the New Year.

75
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,480
 Amen?

76
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,480
 All right, come on.

77
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,480
 Let's, why don't we pray together?

78
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,480
 Oh God, we love you.

79
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,080
 It's just so good that we can be here on a Sunday morning,

80
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,800
 be with our church family, be in your presence.

81
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,080
 God, we are here to lift you up, Lord God.

82
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:32,080
 I pray for all those who has a great January,

83
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,800
 a great start of 2024.

84
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,280
 We're here to give thanks to you.

85
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,280
 I pray for those who might not have a great start in 2024,

86
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,000
 but God, we thank you,

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 not just because we have another New Year coming,

88
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,880
 but because in you, every day is new.

89
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,680
 Your mercies are new every single morning.

90
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,680
 So God, we praise you.

91
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,960
 We lift you up.

92
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,320
 God, we're here for that fresh encounter today.

93
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,480
 Lord God, whatever we brought with us today

94
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,880
 here in this room, Lord, we lay down at your feet.

95
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,000
 Holy Spirit, I pray you would come and fill this room

96
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,480
 and fill your presence in this place right now

97
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,120
 as we sing in Jesus' name we pray.

98
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,080
 Everybody say, amen.

 - This is the very reason we come week after week,

234
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,240
 month after month.

235
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,240
 We come and worship, we come and celebrate that forgiveness,

236
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,240
 that our Father's arms are open wide.

237
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,240
 And this is why we do this every single month,

238
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,240
 that we come together and we have served the communion.

239
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:09,240
 Our welcome team are going to pass out the bread right now.

240
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,240
 As you are holding this bread,

241
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,240
 let me just read to you what it means.

242
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,240
 So the night before Jesus went to the cross,

243
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,240
 he was having this Passover meal with his disciples.

244
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,240
 And while they were eating, Jesus took bread.

245
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,240
 And when he had given thanks,

246
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,240
 he broke it and gave it to his disciples saying,

247
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,240
 "Take and eat, this is my body."

248
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,240
 What you're holding right now symbolizes God's,

249
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:40,240
 Jesus's body, a body that has been broken for us.

250
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,240
 There is this veil in the temple back in Jesus's day,

251
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,240
 the moment when Jesus died on the cross,

252
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,240
 as he breathed his last breath, the veil was torn.

253
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,240
 That veil represents that something that blocked God's

254
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,240
 and man's, something that separated God and man.

255
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,240
 But that veil was torn the moment Jesus died.

256
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,240
 This symbolizes that his body is broken for us

257
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,240
 so that we could, he sacrificed himself for us

258
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:19,240
 so that there is no more obstacle between God and you.

259
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,240
 And like what Pastor Andrew spoke of last week,

260
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,240
 confession and repentance, it's a way to intimacy.

261
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,240
 It's a way to freedom.

262
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,240
 And that's why the apostle Paul reminded us

263
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,240
 as we come to this table, as we come to the altar,

264
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:40,240
 let's once again, let's come with a joyful confession,

265
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,240
 a joy-based confession today.

266
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,240
 And you can tell God what you are struggling,

267
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,240
 what you are, the things that in your life

268
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,240
 that you're not proud of,

269
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,240
 but knowing that he has set you free

270
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,240
 through breaking of his body.

271
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,240
 So if we all have this bread in our hands right now,

272
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,240
 church, I invite you as you take it,

273
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,240
 take it with this joyful, joy-based confession

274
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,240
 and repentance in front of God.

275
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:18,240
 Let's take this together.

276
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:29,240
 Our team will be passing out the juice right now.

277
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:34,240
 Jesus took up the cup and he had given thanks.

278
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,240
 He passed it to his disciples saying,

279
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,240
 "Drink from it, all of you.

280
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,240
 Drink from it today, church."

281
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:46,240
 Jesus says, "This is my blood of the covenant,

282
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,240
 which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins."

283
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,240
 Jesus made this new covenant with his blood

284
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:02,240
 so that you know your sin and my sins are forgiven today.

285
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,240
 This is your assurance.

286
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,240
 As you come, when you confess,

287
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,240
 why is there a joyful or joy-based kind of confession?

288
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:16,240
 Because Jesus has made a new covenant with you and me.

289
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:22,240
 He has promised you and me that he is going to forgive our sins.

290
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,240
 It's not just freeing us from the consequence of sin,

291
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,240
 but freeing us from the bondage of sin itself.

292
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,240
 He's giving us this new freedom.

293
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,240
 He's giving us this new intimacy that we could have with him

294
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,240
 as we're celebrating in the last couple of weeks

295
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,240
 in the sermon series, Fresh Encounter.

296
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,240
 So let us encounter him once again.

297
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,240
 As we're holding this cup,

298
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,240
 as we're about to take this cup together,

299
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,240
 let's remember this is what we come for.

300
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,240
 When we come to the altar,

301
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
 we come for that open arms of our Father.

302
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,240
 We come for that new intimacy,

303
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,240
 fresh intimacy you could have through the sacrifice of Jesus.

304
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,240
 This is what this communion is about.

305
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,240
 It's about this fresh encounter we've been talking the entire month.

306
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,240
 So if everyone has a cup in their hand,

307
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,240
 why don't we take it together right now?

308
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:28,240
 Jesus, we thank you for your sacrifice,

309
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,240
 for dying on the cross.

310
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,240
 Without your work on the cross,

311
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,240
 whatever we've preached in the last couple of weeks,

312
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,240
 they're nothing.

313
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,240
 We wouldn't have this fresh encounter.

314
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,240
 We wouldn't have this intimacy without your sacrifice.

315
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,240
 So Jesus, we're here today once again

316
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:52,240
 to bring you a praise and a thanks saying,

317
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,240
 God, Jesus, thank you for dying on the cross

318
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,240
 to make this intimacy, to make this freedom,

319
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,240
 to make this encounter today possible.

320
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,240
 So church, why don't we go on, press into his presence today,

321
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,240
 continue to worship him.

322
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:14,240
 [music]

323
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:30,240
 I trust in God, my Savior, the one who will never fail.

324
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:37,240
 He will never fail.

325
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:46,240
 Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine.

326
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:56,240
 He's been my fourth man in the fire time after time.

327
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:06,240
 Born of his Spirit, washed in his blood.

328
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:15,240
 And what he did for me on Calvary is more than enough.

329
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:30,240
 I trust in God, my Savior, the one who will never fail.

330
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,240
 He will never fail.

331
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:49,240
 I trust in God, my Savior, the one who will never fail.

332
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:56,240
 He will never fail.

333
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:05,240
 Perfect submission, all is at rest.

334
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:14,240
 I know the author of tomorrow has ordered my steps.

335
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,240
 So this is my story.

336
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,240
 This is my song.

337
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:32,240
 I praise him, my risen King and Savior, all the day long.

338
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:47,240
 I trust, I trust in God, my Savior, the one who will never fail.

339
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,240
 He will never fail.

340
00:23:51,240 --> 00:24:05,240
 I trust in God, my Savior, the one who will never fail.

341
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:10,240
 He will never fail.

 How many of you believe that?

344
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,240
 He will never fail.

345
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,240
 Sing, I sought.

346
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,240
 I sought the Lord and he heard and he answered.

347
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,240
 I sought the Lord and he heard and he answered.

 That's why I trust him.

00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,240
 That's why I trust him.

 That's why I trust him.

00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:24,240
 I sought the Lord and he heard and he answered.

359
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,240
 That's why I trust him.

360
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,240
 That's why I trust him.

361
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,240
 I sought the Lord and he heard and he answered.

362
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,240
 I sought the Lord and he heard and he answered.

363
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,240
 That's why I trust him.

364
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,240
 That's why I trust him.

365
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:47,240
 God, my Savior, you're the one.

366
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:53,240
 He will never fail.

367
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:58,240
 He will never fail.

368
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,240
 I trust in God.

369
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:06,240
 My Savior, the Lord.

370
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:12,240
 He will never fail.

371
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,240
 We trust in you, Jesus.

372
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,240
 He will never fail.

373
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:22,240
 You're our firm foundation.

374
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:28,240
 Cornerstone on which the house is built on.

375
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:33,240
 That's why we trust in you.

376
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:38,240
 That's why we trust in you.

377
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,240
 We trust you, Jesus.

378
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,240
 We trust you, Jesus.

379
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:52,240
 We trust you, Jesus.

380
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,240
 You will never fail.

381
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:02,240
 I trust you, God.

382
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:09,240
 I trust you, Jesus.

383
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:17,240
 I trust you, Jesus.

384
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:21,240
 It's interesting that the bridge of this song, it talks about

385
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,240
 someone who has sought God.

386
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,240
 I seek him.

387
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,240
 I pray to him.

388
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,240
 And he answered me.

389
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,240
 That's why I trust him.

390
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,240
 I believe there are some of us like this here.

391
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,240
 You see him working in your life.

392
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,240
 He answered you.

393
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,240
 He answered your prayer.

394
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,240
 You see him working in your life.

395
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,240
 Yes, hallelujah, amen.

396
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,240
 Thank you, God.

397
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,240
 He said, yes, I know I can trust him.

398
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,240
 And I encourage you to continue to worship him if you are in

399
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,240
 this category.

400
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,240
 But I do believe right here today there are -- there's another

401
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,240
 camp of people.

402
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,240
 You've been praying.

403
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,240
 You've been seeking him.

404
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,240
 You've been begging him, if you will.

405
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,240
 But you haven't seen anything in your life right now.

406
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,240
 That situation has not changed a single bit.

407
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,240
 That mountain has not been moved yet.

408
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:11,240
 I do want to encourage or I do want to invite, if you're one of

409
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:16,240
 those people, I do want to invite you to put your trust in God

410
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,240
 today equally.

411
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:25,240
 God is a God even if we cannot see he's at work.

412
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,240
 God is a God even when we cannot see it.

413
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,240
 His love never changes.

414
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,240
 And that takes faith to believe.

415
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,240
 And I am inviting you to step into a faith journey if you are

416
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,240
 one of those people today.

417
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,240
 We're going to sing this chorus once again, like I trust the

418
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,240
 Lord, like he will never fail.

419
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,240
 If you have seen his work in your life, go on, sing even

420
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,240
 louder.

421
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,240
 If you haven't seen it yet, I invite you to sing with the

422
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,240
 voice of faith.

423
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,240
 Faith means before you're seeing it, you are believing it.

424
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,240
 So I invite you, church, let's sing.

425
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,240
 Either you sing with a heart of gratitude of thanksgiving or you

426
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,240
 sing with a declaration of faith here today.

427
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,240
 Let's do it, church.

428
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,240
 Let's do it one more time.

429
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,240
 I sought the Lord.

430
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,240
 I sought the Lord.

431
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,240
 And he heard and he answered.

432
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,240
 I sought the Lord.

433
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,240
 And he heard and he answered.

434
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,240
 I sought the Lord.

435
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,240
 And he heard and he answered.

436
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,240
 That's why I trust him.

437
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,240
 That's why I trust him.

438
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,240
 I sought the Lord.

439
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,240
 And he heard and he answered.

440
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,240
 I sought the Lord.

441
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,240
 And he heard and he answered.

442
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,240
 I sought the Lord.

443
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,240
 And he heard and he answered.

444
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,240
 That's why I trust him.

445
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,240
 That's why I trust him.

446
00:29:51,240 --> 00:30:00,240
 Savior, the one who will never fail.

447
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,240
 He will never fail.

448
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,240
 He will never fail.

449
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,240
 I trust my God.

450
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,240
 I trust my God.

451
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:20,240
 Savior, the one who will never fail.

452
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,240
 He will never fail.

453
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,240
 God, I give thanks to answered prayer.

454
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,240
 But God, we come before you with faith and hope for those

455
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:38,240
 unanswered prayer equally.

456
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:43,240
 God, you said hope means believing before seeing it.

457
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,240
 You said if we could see it already, who needs hope for what

458
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,240
 they can see.

459
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:51,240
 So God, today we enter the place and say regardless whether we

460
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:55,240
 see that prayer being answered, my song remain the same.

461
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,240
 I trust the Lord.

462
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,240
 I trust the Lord today.

463
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:03,240
 I trust the Lord today regardless whether I see results.

464
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:07,240
 I trust the Lord with all my heart today.

465
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:13,240
 So God, I come before you, God, I pray for those whose prayer was

466
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,240
 answered.

467
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,240
 God, I thank you for them.

468
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,240
 God, I come before you on behalf of those whose prayers has not

469
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,240
 been answered yet.

470
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:26,240
 God, I pray you would give us a fresh faith and fresh hope today

471
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,240
 to sing this song with conviction knowing that yes, even when I

472
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,240
 don't see it, that doesn't change my faith.

473
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,240
 That doesn't change my trust in you, Jesus.

474
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:42,240
 Because of that communion we have taken, we know what you have

475
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,240
 done on the cross.

476
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,240
 I put my faith in that.

477
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:49,240
 I put my faith in a God who loves me, who died for me and who

478
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,240
 is coming back to right every wrong, coming back to make all

479
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,240
 things new for me.

480
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,240
 So God, we trust you.

481
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,240
 I pray you come and give us this fresh faith, fresh hope, and a

482
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,240
 fresh encounter.

483
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,240
 In Jesus' name we pray.

484
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,240
 Everybody say amen.

485
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,240
 Can we put our hands together for Jesus.

486
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,240
 [Applause]

487
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,240
 Hallelujah.

488
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,240
 And thank you worship team.

489
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,240
 Thank you so much.

490
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,240
 Please be seated, everyone.

491
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,240
 Whoo.

492
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,240
 It's good to see everyone.

493
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:29,240
 Hi, we just want to welcome every single one of you to the

494
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,240
 Vine Yuen Long.

495
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,240
 We're so happy you're here.

496
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,240
 My name is Chapman.

497
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,240
 I am one of the pastors here.

498
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,240
 And we also love to say hello to those if you're visiting for the

499
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:40,240
 very first time, you're coming with a friend or you just Googled

500
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,240
 us and then you decided to come.

501
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,240
 If you're here, I would love to invite you to just wave your

502
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,240
 hand a little bit.

503
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,240
 We want to know where you are.

504
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,240
 Just want to welcome you.

505
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,240
 We're not going to embarrass you, don't worry.

506
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,240
 But if you're here for the very first time, would you like to

507
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,240
 just wave?

508
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,240
 Oh, hi.

509
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,240
 Thank you.

510
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,240
 Good to see you.

511
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,240
 We're so happy you're here.

512
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,240
 And we can't wait to let you know more about who we are as a

513
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,240
 church community and what we do here.

514
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:09,240
 But before that, what we're going to do right now is to release

515
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,240
 the kids in our midst.

516
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,240
 They're going to K4C 3-5, 6-12.

517
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,240
 There they are.

518
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:19,240
 If you have a very, very young baby, you can bring him or her

519
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,240
 into the playroom in the back as well.

520
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,240
 So why don't we stretch out our hands to pray for the kids

521
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,240
 around us.

522
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,240
 All right.

523
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,240
 Jesus, we thank you for our children.

524
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,240
 They have a pure heart.

525
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,240
 Sometimes what they say, what they're thinking, what they're

526
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,240
 perceiving amazes us.

527
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,240
 And God, sometimes we can learn from them as well.

528
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,240
 I can -- yeah, I can recall countless moments where I'm

529
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,240
 learning from my daughter how to pray because of that kind of

530
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,240
 pure faith.

531
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,240
 So God, I just pray you would bless them today.

532
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,240
 I pray for a fresh encounter in every single K4C classroom with

533
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,240
 all the teachers, with all the kids there.

534
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,240
 I pray you would speak to them today and you would encounter

535
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,240
 them in a very special way.

536
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,240
 In Jesus' name we pray.

537
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,240
 Amen.

538
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,240
 All right.

539
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,240
 See you, kids.

540
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,240
 And if you have parents, you may send them to the room and come

541
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,240
 back.

542
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,240
 And if you're remaining here in your seat right now, why don't

543
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,240
 you turn to someone around you and just introduce your name,

544
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:21,240
 say hi, you know, say -- like Chinese New Year is coming and

545
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:24,240
 why don't we just go and spend some time with each other.

546
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:38,240
 [Music]

547
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:48,240
 [Music]

548
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:57,240
 [Music]

549
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:05,240
 [Music]

550
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:10,240
 [Music]

551
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,240
 All right, we're back.

552
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,240
 All right, sorry to interrupt because we have a lot of great

553
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,240
 information we want to bring to you.

554
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,240
 Doing some announcements right now.

555
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:24,240
 First of all, Alpha, who has been to an Alpha before?

556
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,240
 Wow, awesome.

557
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,240
 You must know what Alpha is like.

558
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,240
 You must know that Alpha is for people who don't necessarily

559
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,240
 call themselves Christians.

560
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,240
 And I believe you have a lot of those people around you in your

561
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,240
 workplace, maybe at home, maybe in your neighborhood.

562
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:43,240
 So we're going to talk a little bit about Alpha today.

563
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:47,240
 So the dates, you must see, look at the screen right now, this

564
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:51,240
 round of Alpha starts on the 21st of February.

565
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,240
 That's in about two weeks' time.

566
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,240
 So it's time to invite people.

567
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,240
 I'm going to tell you a little bit more about how to invite

568
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,240
 people, but if you have signed up to be a volunteer, please be

569
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,240
 reminded that our volunteer training starts at 2 p.m.

570
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,240
 today in the library.

571
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,240
 So go grab a quick lunch and come back at 2 p.m.

572
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,240
 We'll start the training on time.

573
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:15,240
 And before I tell you a little bit more about inviting people,

574
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:20,240
 first of all, I would love to invite a friend, two friends on

575
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,240
 stage.

576
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,240
 They'll share a little bit with us.

577
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,240
 So why don't we put our hands together for Leslie and Tinny.

578
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,240
 Let me give you a mic.

579
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:33,240
 [Applause]

580
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,240
 >> Thank you.

581
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,240
 Thank you.

582
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,240
 Good morning.

583
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,240
 Is it good morning?

584
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,240
 Yeah, it's morning.

585
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,240
 Sorry, I was doing the Chinese services this morning.

586
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,240
 Good morning, everyone.

587
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,240
 Very nice to meet you.

588
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,240
 My name is Leslie.

589
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,240
 This is my wife, Tinny.

590
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,240
 I was asked by Pastor Ivan to share my experience about Alpha

591
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,240
 and what it's done for me and my family.

592
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,240
 But maybe I want to take you a little bit back to my journey

593
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,240
 here.

594
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,240
 I started at EIS.

595
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,240
 We came to EIS.

596
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,240
 You probably wouldn't have saw me because honestly I was

597
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:03,240
 categorizing as what I call myself a bare minimum Christian.

598
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,240
 So that just means I come in, I'm here for an hour and a half

599
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,240
 and then I'm gone.

600
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,240
 I just felt that something was missing in my life.

601
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,240
 I just remember sitting here just like you guys looking at this

602
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:17,240
 poster back in 2023 and I thought what a great initiative,

603
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,240
 right?

604
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,240
 A program where I got to debunk some of the questions that were

605
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:25,240
 in my head, try to understand things like why do we pray, how

606
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,240
 do we pray, why do we read the Bible.

607
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,240
 I thought that was quite interesting.

608
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,240
 I'll be honest with you, the program, I didn't complete the

609
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,240
 whole thing, unfortunately.

610
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,240
 I'm not very committed except for my marriage.

611
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,240
 I'm not a very committed guy.

612
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:44,240
 I just remember getting this one message, a WhatsApp message from

613
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,240
 a good friend, Dorothy.

614
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,240
 She really encouraged me to come and check it out.

615
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,240
 I got to say the first thing that really I came up to this,

616
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,240
 down up the stairs and the first thing was the food was amazing.

617
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,240
 So if you guys love good food and the food is always different,

618
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,240
 food is really tasty.

619
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:02,240
 You come in with an empty stomach and an open mind and it's

620
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,240
 so refreshing.

621
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,240
 I came in and met -- kind of sat down with everybody.

622
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,240
 Really talked about -- watched some really interesting videos.

623
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,240
 Talked about those things I just mentioned.

624
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,240
 How do you pray?

625
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,240
 Why do you pray?

626
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,240
 Why do we read the Bible?

627
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,240
 How do you read the Bible?

628
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,240
 I found it so refreshing.

629
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,240
 Those people became good friends.

630
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,240
 We still have really -- we go play badminton every week now.

631
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,240
 That became pretty much my community and my friendship.

632
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,240
 This journey has really had sort of a renowned sort of

633
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,240
 relationship between me and God.

634
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,240
 I really encourage everybody here who wants that,

635
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:38,240
 you know, what I had, to try it.

636
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,240
 They really give it a good shot.

637
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,240
 I'll pass this time over to my wife and maybe let her share her

638
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,240
 experience as well.

639
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,240
 [Applause]

640
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,240
 Hi.

641
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,240
 So for me, I have been going to church since I was young,

642
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,240
 like when I was a kid, teenage.

643
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,240
 You can go to faith because I just trust in God and went there

644
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,240
 and I didn't really question.

645
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,240
 But this time around, I have a chance to go with my husband

646
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,240
 because I need to support him, right,

647
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,240
 because I need to make sure he completes everything.

648
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,240
 So just so you know, we just started the fourth class.

649
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,240
 Yeah, so it's great that, you know,

650
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,240
 you guys are very welcoming, that, you know,

651
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,240
 we can still join in the middle.

652
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,240
 And then for me, at first, of course,

653
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,240
 I was just like being there for him.

654
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,240
 But I found it very different this time because there's a lot

655
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,240
 of topics that I've never asked myself.

656
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,240
 Like, you know, what Leslie said, like what's prayer,

657
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,240
 who's Jesus?

658
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,240
 Like I know, but I kind of like never question, right?

659
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,240
 So like this is something that have a great impact in my life.

660
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,240
 I feel like I have a fresh encounter with God.

661
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,240
 And also like this is a true meaning in our family as well.

662
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,240
 I feel like after that, like two months,

663
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:47,240
 like short a few weeks, it's actually our family,

664
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,240
 our relationship is a lot deepened as well.

665
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:53,240
 So I highly encourage anyone, even with my background similar,

666
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,240
 can also join the Alpha as well.

667
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,240
 Thank you.

668
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:01,240
 [Applause]

669
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,240
 Awesome.

670
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,240
 Thank you so much.

671
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:08,240
 And when you come in, you would find some items on your seat.

672
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,240
 Yes, there's always the envelope for offering,

673
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,240
 but you will also find a postcard.

674
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,240
 This is for us to invite our friends, our family,

675
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,240
 our colleagues, and you see it explain a little bit

676
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,240
 what Alpha is.

677
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,240
 There are the dates and time, and also there's a QR code

678
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,240
 if you scan it, and that's a sign-up link.

679
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:32,240
 And you say when you were listening to Tinny and Leslie,

680
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,240
 they mentioned someone actually invited them.

681
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,240
 And you see there's actually power in our invitation.

682
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,240
 We may not be powerful, like eloquent evangelists,

683
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,240
 we can explain the entire gospel to people,

684
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,240
 but one simple invitation would work as well.

685
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,240
 So that's what we want to encourage everyone to do together.

686
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,240
 You have this tiny little business card size,

687
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,240
 this small card here, it's self-explanatory what it does.

688
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,240
 You can write down three names of the people you would like

689
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,240
 to invite to explore faith, meaning you want to invite them to Alpha.

690
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:10,240
 You can set a daily alarm at 1102.

691
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,240
 There's a meaning.

692
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,240
 There's a scripture, Luke 11, verse 2.

693
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,240
 You can go back and read it yourself.

694
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,240
 But set an alarm.

695
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,240
 You can set it once a day, twice a day, and you can pray for these three people

696
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,240
 or pray for Hong Kong as well.

697
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,240
 And then be open, expectant.

698
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,240
 Of course, don't forget to invite them.

699
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,240
 And just so you know, Alpha is starting in two weeks,

700
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,240
 so if you're thinking, "Let me pray for them for three months,"

701
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,240
 you can try to shorten it.

702
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,240
 Let's do an express kind of prayer.

703
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:43,240
 Make sure you invite them before the start of Alpha.

704
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,240
 Anyway, so this is what the card is for.

705
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,240
 There are three blank spaces there.

706
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,240
 You can write down three names and pray for them every day.

707
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,240
 This card is small.

708
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,240
 It's for you to bring it with you every day.

709
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,240
 So wherever you are at 1102 when the alarm rings,

710
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:00,240
 you can just take out this card, pray for your friends or family or colleagues.

711
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,240
 Sounds good?

712
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,240
 Who's going to do it?

713
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,240
 Oh, like two people.

714
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,240
 All right, great.

715
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,240
 I think we can save--no, I'm not okay.

716
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,240
 I trust in you guys as well.

717
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,240
 So that's awesome.

718
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:17,240
 So Alpha is the first step, and then we can also take one more step in our faith,

719
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,240
 and that is actually baptism.

720
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,240
 I just want to give you the dates.

721
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:24,240
 Our next baptism happens on Easter Day.

722
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,240
 That is the 31st of March.

723
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,240
 The last day of March is Easter Sunday.

724
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:32,240
 There will be two classes, 10th and 17th of March.

725
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,240
 Take out your cameras, save the dates,

726
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:38,240
 and we'll bring you more information in the next couple of weeks.

727
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,240
 Is there anything else I need to talk about?

728
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,240
 I think that's it.

729
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:47,240
 Oh, so you see all the beautiful decorations for Chinese New Year,

730
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:51,240
 and we actually have some--what do we call--like fai chun, is it?

731
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:54,240
 So some very nice calligraphy, Chinese writing,

732
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:59,240
 and someone has very honestly donated their talent to us.

733
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:03,240
 And so you can pick up one of those and donate as well,

734
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:07,240
 donate your finance, and then that would go into ministry as usual.

735
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:12,240
 So that's how we can support what we're doing at church.

736
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,240
 And talking about supporting church financially or where we're at,

737
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,240
 I would love to invite Pastor Tim on stage,

738
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,240
 and he's going to give us a financial update.

739
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:27,240
 Let's welcome Pastor Tim.

740
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,240
 Here we go.

741
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,240
 All right.

742
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:33,240
 Yes, so I know a lot of numbers, right?

743
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:39,240
 One thing that's important for us as a church is we want to be transparent

744
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:44,240
 about our finances and keep you updated in the loop as to what's happening.

745
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,240
 And so we thought it was time for that, beginning of the year, it's a good time.

746
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:54,240
 So I just wanted to share in 2024, so our overall budget is 5.721 million

747
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:59,240
 Hong Kong dollars, and that's made up out of three categories.

748
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:03,240
 So we have rent and facilities, so that's like management fees, of course,

749
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,240
 rent, utilities, you know, all of that.

750
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:11,240
 Then there is pastoral and outreach, so it's everything we do as a church.

751
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:14,240
 The alpha that you just heard about is involved in that.

752
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:19,240
 Our K4C, any collaboration with NGOs that we do together with you,

753
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:24,240
 anything we do here is part of that, any ministry expenses there.

754
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:29,240
 And then the final one is additional operating expenses, that's like IT stuff,

755
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:33,240
 cleaning, those types of things, insurance.

756
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:38,240
 So that's what makes up the 5.721 million.

757
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:45,240
 And so that's the kingdom investment that is needed for us to operate here,

758
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,240
 to do the work that we believe God has called us to.

759
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:50,240
 Now, can we go to the next slide, please?

760
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:57,240
 So we're a church plant, so we don't have these finances as of right now.

761
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:01,240
 And Wan Chai, the church that has sent us the vine in Wan Chai,

762
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:05,240
 they are supporting us, but it tapers off over time.

763
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:10,240
 So in the first year, which is starting this year, they're supporting us

764
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:16,240
 with 80% of our expenses, 60%, 40%, 20%, and then by God's grace,

765
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,240
 we're self-financing at that time.

766
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,240
 But I want to talk a little bit about 2024.

767
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:27,240
 So we're responsible for 20% of the expenses.

768
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:34,240
 So that means 1.144 million a year or 95,000 a month.

769
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:39,240
 And one thing I want to share with that is that actually,

770
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:44,240
 we actually need to already in this year move over here,

771
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:50,240
 because at 2025, you know, this is roughly what we need to cover.

772
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:54,240
 And so that's our aim for this year is to move towards the 40%

773
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:58,240
 so that when we come to the end of the year, we're around that.

774
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,240
 We can go to the next slide.

775
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:05,240
 So I want to show a little bit of where we've been.

776
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:13,240
 So our giving in October, November, December has been between, I think, 76K and 89.

777
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:19,240
 And so we've--in that time, we didn't go over that 95K threshold.

778
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:24,240
 But I'm really encouraged this January, you have given

779
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:28,240
 160,000 Hong Kong dollars in January.

780
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:32,240
 And so I want to just thank you for your generosity in that.

781
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:36,240
 And I was amazed, and I'm, you know, praising God for that.

782
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,240
 And so I hope you're encouraged by that.

783
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:44,240
 So this is--so we're heading in the right direction.

784
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:53,240
 I also wanted to just say for me as a pastor, it's--if this is your home church--

785
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:57,240
 or if you're visiting, I'm sorry, you have to listen to a finance update.

786
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:04,240
 But if this is your home church, I do want to ask you to prayerfully consider what you might give.

787
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:09,240
 We don't--we just trust that God will speak to you about what to give.

788
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,240
 We don't tell anyone what they need to give.

789
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:16,240
 But for me, it would be significant if everybody gives something.

790
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,240
 And so I just want to encourage you in that.

791
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:24,240
 And also another way to bless us as well with this is if you set up regular giving,

792
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:31,240
 because then we know what we're working with, and that is just a blessing for us.

793
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:36,240
 Now, there have been a lot of new donations this month.

794
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:43,240
 And not everyone has given us your name and a screenshot of the receipt of giving.

795
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:47,240
 If you want to get a tax receipt, we do need that information.

796
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:55,240
 You can email your full name and payment slip or a screenshot of your giving to accounts@thevine.org.hk.

797
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:58,240
 We want to make sure we issue also you a tax receipt.

798
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:01,240
 If you have questions about that, you can talk to us.

799
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,240
 You can also talk to Ada.

800
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:04,240
 Ada, do you mind giving us a wave?

801
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,240
 She's back there.

802
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:09,240
 She's actually the head of finance from all of the Vine churches.

803
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,240
 So she can answer all your questions.

804
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,240
 No pressure.

805
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:17,240
 And we're grateful and blessed to have you here and that as well.

806
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:19,240
 But anyhow, so I wanted to give you this update.

807
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,240
 We'll probably do this quarterly.

808
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,240
 I hope you're encouraged.

809
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,240
 Thank you so much for your faithful giving.

810
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:30,240
 And right now, we actually do want to transition into that part of our worship,

811
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,240
 which is taking up our tithes and our offerings.

812
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:37,240
 And so I want to invite the welcome team to come up.

813
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:43,240
 And, yeah, so part of our worship is following Jesus in all areas of our lives.

814
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,240
 And that includes our finances.

815
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:52,240
 And so as Christians, we believe that everything we have belongs to God, everything we have.

816
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:56,240
 And so part of that God has entrusted us with is to be stewards.

817
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:04,240
 And so when we give, we're offering this up to God as part of our worship to contribute to the work that he's doing.

818
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,240
 And so there's a verse down here.

819
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,240
 We have it on here.

820
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,240
 I'll actually just read it.

821
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:15,240
 It says, "Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion.

822
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:20,240
 For God loves a cheerful giver, and God is able to bless you abundantly.

823
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:25,240
 So that in all things, at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work."

824
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:28,240
 So that's from 2 Corinthians 9, 7, and 8.

825
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:32,240
 But I would just love to pray for our offering.

826
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:36,240
 So let's do this right now.

827
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,240
 Jesus, we thank you.

828
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:43,240
 We praise you for your faithfulness and how you have been providing.

829
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:52,240
 We thank you for all that you give us to live, that you can meet us in our needs, that everything we have comes from you.

830
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:58,240
 And right now, we want to turn around and we want to offer these things to you as part of our worship.

831
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:11,240
 And we ask that you use these resources for your work, for your kingdom work here in Yuen Long, that we can love, serve, and impact people with your good news.

832
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,240
 And so we pray that you bless it.

833
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,240
 We pray this in your name, Jesus.

834
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,240
 Amen.

835
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,240
 Amen.

836
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:22,240
 So right now, I have the privilege of inviting up June.

837
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,240
 Let's give June a hand.

838
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:28,240
 [Applause]

839
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:31,240
 So June is our senior pastoral associate.

840
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,240
 That's quite formal, right?

841
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:38,240
 And she has a gift of teaching and preaching.

842
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:43,240
 And so we always love to hear from you, and we love to see that develop and grow.

843
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,240
 And so we'd love to pray for her.

844
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:49,240
 And I want to invite you to stretch out your hands as we pray for her, but also pray for us as well.

845
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,240
 Jesus, thank you so much for June.

846
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,240
 Thank you for all the gifts and talents you have placed in her.

847
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:58,240
 Thank you for the word that you have given her for us here today.

848
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,240
 May you anoint her with your Holy Spirit.

849
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,240
 May you speak powerfully through her.

850
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:08,240
 And may you ready our hearts to receive what it is that you want to say to us.

851
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,240
 So we pray this in your name, Jesus.

852
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,240
 Amen.

853
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,240
 Amen.

854
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,240
 Thank you.

855
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,240
 Thank you, Tim.

856
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,240
 I'm so scared.

857
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,240
 [Laughter]

858
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,240
 But let me also tell you a little bit about myself.

859
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:22,240
 There are a few things that you might find interesting about me.

860
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:27,240
 First of all, when I was young, I'm really not good at reading.

861
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,240
 Well, maybe not even not good at.

862
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:31,240
 I'm scared of reading English books.

863
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:36,240
 When I was young, if I see an English book on the floor, I will not touch it.

864
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:40,240
 Because I know that if I touch it, I'll be responsible for it.

865
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,240
 That means I'll have to read it, and I'm not reading it.

866
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,240
 So I'll just let the English book lie on the floor peacefully,

867
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:49,240
 and I'll just detour around it.

868
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:55,240
 And lucky for me to start teaching English for 10 years in my past 10 years.

869
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:58,240
 So well done, students.

870
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:04,240
 Another surprising thing about me is that sometimes I listen to really loud music to relax.

871
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:09,240
 I find that the louder and more upbeat the music is, the more calming it is for me.

872
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:13,240
 Like it feels so calm when I just hear music blasting in my ear.

873
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:17,240
 I don't know. Did anyone of that find loud music calming?

874
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:21,240
 Awesome. Good, good. Yeah, right?

875
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:29,240
 Another interesting thing about me, well, my friends find about me is that I'm good at connecting with people now.

876
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:38,240
 I have an ex-colleague/friend who was quite surprised that I can actually talk to strangers now when I meet new people.

877
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:43,240
 The last time she saw me on my IG Reels talking about the friends that I met in Australia,

878
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:48,240
 and then she met me and she goes, "Joon, you made friends in Australia?"

879
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,240
 I'm like, "Yeah."

880
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,240
 And I've been friends with her for over 10 years.

881
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:58,240
 And I've met her not only, not like, oh, I've met her once every five months.

882
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,240
 No, I meet her every single day when we were at work.

883
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:07,240
 Even though I left the place that we worked together, I still meet her like once or twice every week.

884
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:13,240
 And she still finds me surprising that I can make friends and connect with people now.

885
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:23,240
 Maybe that's because we've been friends for so long that we've stopped thinking or knowing about each other.

886
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:29,240
 We've stopped knowing anything fresh or the small changes that happens in us every day.

887
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:36,240
 We all need fresh encounters in our relationships, whether it is with our friends that we've known for a long time,

888
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:40,240
 our spouse, or even with God.

889
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:43,240
 Maybe you have been a Christian for a long time,

890
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:51,240
 and seeking fresh encounter with Jesus is something that you've always thought, you've always wanted.

891
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:55,240
 You've known Jesus for a long time, and then the more that you know him,

892
00:53:55,240 --> 00:54:01,240
 the more that you come to church to listen to sermons and read the Bible, and you go, "Yeah."

893
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:07,240
 Whenever June talked about the five fish and the two loaves, I know what she's going to talk about.

894
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:13,240
 Or you open up the Bible and you read Psalms 1, and you go, "I know exactly how this is going to be.

895
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:18,240
 This is another story that I've learned since I was in kids' ministry."

896
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:23,240
 And you need that fresh encounter, and you just don't know how to get it or where to begin.

897
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:31,240
 I hope that this message speaks to you about how to journey through those moments and find fresh encounter with Jesus.

898
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:38,240
 Maybe you are just a new Christian or not yet a Christian, but you have made assumptions with,

899
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:44,240
 "You know, I think God is like that. I've heard that God looks like that, or Jesus is like that."

900
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:50,240
 And you kind of need someone to tell you who Jesus is through his word.

901
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:58,240
 And I hope that this message is going to shine some light on you to show you a pathway of how I did it when I was young

902
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:05,240
 and how I do it when I was walking through some ups and downs when I connect with the word of God.

903
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:15,240
 As I was praying for the sermon, I feel that God is saying that last week, since last week, it is an important week for all of us

904
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:24,240
 because we just came out of a 21-day fast. And in those 21 days, as a church, we fasted from things that were distracting us from God.

905
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:34,240
 Maybe things that we eat, maybe constantly thinking about what to eat next. That's kind of like my life.

906
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:42,240
 Or maybe you were watching Netflix, and you fasted from Netflix, and you carved out time to be with God, to pray and to read.

907
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:49,240
 And every day, the church would send out devotionals, sharings from people about how they encounter God.

908
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:53,240
 And there would be scriptures and questions that came out of the sharing.

909
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:57,240
 And then, wow, every single morning, I just look forward to the sharings that I'm going to read

910
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:03,240
 and the questions that really helped me to respond to or think about my life or think about how I start that morning.

911
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:08,240
 But then last week, I woke up, and there's nothing. I'm like, "Chapman, where's the sharing?"

912
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:18,240
 I wanted to text him that. I didn't. Because there's no more sharing from other people telling me how they encountered Jesus' life.

913
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:26,240
 All I have is the scriptures in my hands right now that I have to wrestle with, that I have to sit with to encounter Jesus on my own.

914
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:37,240
 So this week, I hope that as we just came out of the fast, that we're able to, still as a church, continue our connection with God,

915
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:45,240
 continue our walk with God, not from other people's help, not through other people's encounter, but our own fresh encounter with Jesus.

916
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:51,240
 So today, let's begin our fresh encounter with Him through His Word.

917
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:57,240
 The Word is His revelation to us. It is wonderful and precious and a joy to read.

918
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:02,240
 Should it be, isn't it? But that's not how I felt at the very beginning.

919
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:10,240
 When I first began reading the Bible, I find life's big questions that I can answer, give answers to, how I live my life,

920
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:15,240
 and give me the positive energy that I need to live my life.

921
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:20,240
 But that kind of, that way of describing the Bible kind of threw me off a bit.

922
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:28,240
 Because there are two kinds of people. There's one kind that can follow instructions really well, and there's this one kind that can't.

923
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:32,240
 And I'm definitely the kind that struggles with it.

924
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:45,240
 Let me tell you, when I first arrived in Australia a few years ago, the first task I, after I put down my luggage in my shared room, was to build the Ikea bed.

925
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:49,240
 It was the hardest thing for me to do.

926
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:59,240
 I was exhausted after my 10-hour red-eye flight, and when I opened the manual, I could not, for the life, for the sake of my life, put it together.

927
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:06,240
 I couldn't understand the pictures. I mixed up the screw sizes, and I just don't think the instructions work at all.

928
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:15,240
 Can you put the Ikea bed together? Like, no, I can't. I come from Hong Kong. I'm like, I can't put this together where I'm sleeping tonight.

929
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:22,240
 And when I read the Bible as the manual or instructions for my life, that's how I feel too.

930
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:27,240
 Often when I turn to the Bible for instructions, I'm already at my wit's end.

931
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:38,240
 I must have been, you know, looking and searching for how to solve my life's problem, and reading the Bible is my last resort, so I'm probably overwhelmed and sad and exhausted.

932
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:47,240
 And then when I read the Bible, I feel the instructions are so out of date and not related to my current situation.

933
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:51,240
 Which verse in the Bible tells me if I should accept the job offer?

934
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:57,240
 How do I make sense of the instructions? Invest in seven ventures, yes in eight.

935
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:59,240
 You know, what does that mean?

936
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:08,240
 And let alone the boring incidents about how Israel was split into two, and the mystical book of the Revelations.

937
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:12,240
 Because of these obstacles, reading the Bible seemed like a chore.

938
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:18,240
 I thought to be a good Christian, which I wanted to be a good Christian, I have to read the Bible and pray.

939
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:24,240
 But the struggles and obstacles made it hard for me to even open the Bible.

940
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:27,240
 The words seemed mundane and boring.

941
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:31,240
 I felt nothing when I read, and it seems like work.

942
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:38,240
 All these made it hard for me to connect with the Bible, let alone seeing God through it.

943
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:42,240
 I don't know if you resonate with what I was going through back then.

944
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:50,240
 Maybe you're just starting the Bible reading journey, and the book seems so daunting to you, and you just don't know where to begin.

945
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:58,240
 I remember when I first got baptized and everyone gave me Bibles, and it was this big, and the paper was so thin and so full of words.

946
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:06,240
 Where do I begin? And I vowed, okay, I'm going to read through the Bible from the first book to the last book, but then I got stuck at Leviticus.

947
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:10,240
 I just couldn't get out of it. Like, I'm sorry.

948
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:16,240
 Maybe you've been a seasoned Christian, and there are times in your life you felt stagnant in your Bible reading.

949
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:24,240
 Or that the Bible reading has been a habit, and you feel like there's no new stories or parables that you have not read.

950
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:27,240
 You wish to go deeper into your reading.

951
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:31,240
 You long for a fresh encounter with Jesus through His words.

952
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:36,240
 And what does it mean to have a fresh encounter with Jesus?

953
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:40,240
 Because I've known Jesus for 20 or 30 plus years.

954
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:44,240
 What does it mean to have a fresh encounter with Jesus?

955
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:52,240
 To have a deeply rooted, evergreen, fruit-producing life like the poet described in Psalms 1.

956
01:00:52,240 --> 01:01:00,240
 Let me take you to the book of Luke, to an account that can help us to find some answers to our questions.

957
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:07,240
 So the story is from Luke chapter 24, and here in the story, Jesus has just been crucified.

958
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:16,240
 Now, there are rumors that Jesus was risen from the dead, and a couple on the way to Emmaus had a fresh encounter with Jesus.

959
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:19,240
 Let's have a look at their experience.

960
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:21,240
 So verse 13.

961
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:29,240
 Now, the same day, two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem.

962
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:33,240
 They were talking with each other about everything that had happened.

963
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:41,240
 As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus Himself came up and walked along with them.

964
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:44,240
 But they were kept from recognizing Him.

965
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:48,240
 He asked them, "What are you discussing together as you walk along?"

966
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:53,240
 They stood still, their faces downcast.

967
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:56,240
 One of them, named Cleopas, asked Him,

968
01:01:56,240 --> 01:02:04,240
 "Are you the only one visiting Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?"

969
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:07,240
 "What things?" Jesus asked.

970
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:10,240
 There were two people on the way to Emmaus.

971
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:15,240
 We don't know too much about these two people, but there are a few things we know.

972
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:19,240
 They were among the group of followers of Jesus.

973
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:26,240
 And on that day, the day that Mary Magdalene and other women found out that Jesus had risen,

974
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:29,240
 they were walking to Emmaus.

975
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:37,240
 They had heard about Jesus' risen, but their reaction was different from what we would have expected.

976
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:42,240
 They had heard from the woman, they had heard from the disciples, but they were still downcast.

977
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:46,240
 The Bible said they were kept from recognizing Jesus.

978
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:50,240
 Yes, physically, they were kept from recognizing Him.

979
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:55,240
 They did not know that the man who was walking towards them, who was talking to them,

980
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:58,240
 was the Jesus that they were pining for.

981
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:02,240
 But I doubt if they know who Jesus was before He hung on the cross,

982
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:05,240
 that they still don't know who He truly is.

983
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:09,240
 Let's listen to how they described Jesus to Jesus.

984
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:12,240
 "About Jesus of Nazareth," they replied,

985
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:16,240
 "He was a prophet, powerful indeed before God and all the people.

986
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:22,240
 And the chief priests and all rulers handed Him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified Him.

987
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:28,240
 But we had hoped that He was the one who was going to redeem Israel."

988
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,240
 They had followed Jesus.

989
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,240
 They've heard about what He's done.

990
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:35,240
 Maybe they have even witnessed some of His miracles.

991
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:39,240
 They had hoped that He was the one to redeem Israel.

992
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:43,240
 However, not only physically they could not recognize Jesus,

993
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:46,240
 they probably had the wrong idea of Him,

994
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:50,240
 that they couldn't recognize Him from who He truly is.

995
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:56,240
 In the Scripture, it says they had hoped that He was the one who would redeem Israel.

996
01:03:56,240 --> 01:04:00,240
 This implies that Jesus' death put a stop to everything.

997
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:07,240
 He cannot be the Savior of Israel because who could save Israel if He is now dead?

998
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:12,240
 Their past knowledge and experience has blocked them away,

999
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:15,240
 has blocked them from knowing who Jesus is.

1000
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:18,240
 And when things didn't happen according to their plan,

1001
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:23,240
 they got disappointed, confused, and walked away.

1002
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:26,240
 That could be us, couldn't it?

1003
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,240
 Maybe we have known Jesus for a while.

1004
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:32,240
 We've read books about Him, listened to sermons about Him,

1005
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:35,240
 and met with Him back in the day.

1006
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:39,240
 And we thought we had enough information about Him.

1007
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:45,240
 So we have our own experience about Him and who He is and what He's going to do.

1008
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:50,240
 And so we pray and ask Him to do things according to our own plan

1009
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:53,240
 and our own understanding of Him.

1010
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:56,240
 Jesus could have left them alone.

1011
01:04:56,240 --> 01:05:00,240
 At the end of the day, there were only two of the followers,

1012
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:04,240
 out of the many, that had the wrong expectation of Him.

1013
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:07,240
 They weren't recorded in the Bible afterwards.

1014
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:13,240
 So Jesus could have just left them alone and gone to some more other impactful followers

1015
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:18,240
 who could do something and change their life and so on.

1016
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:22,240
 But yet, Jesus came up to them.

1017
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:26,240
 Jesus knew they needed a fresh encounter of Him, to know Him afresh,

1018
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:30,240
 regardless of who they are and what they can do.

1019
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:36,240
 He met them where they were at, disappointed, confused, overwhelmed.

1020
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:42,240
 He concealed to them who He was and showed them through Scripture who He really is,

1021
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:47,240
 because Jesus knew they needed Him to understand His words.

1022
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:49,240
 Let's look at verse 27.

1023
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:53,240
 It says, "And beginning with Moses and all the prophets,

1024
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:59,240
 He explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning Himself."

1025
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:02,240
 Jesus could have met them in other ways.

1026
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:04,240
 He showed Thomas' wounds.

1027
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:06,240
 He cooked fish for Peter.

1028
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:09,240
 But to these two on the road to Emmaus,

1029
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:14,240
 He opened up the Scriptures to them, showing them who He really is.

1030
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:19,240
 He is the one that they have been reading about, but they didn't get.

1031
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:22,240
 He is the one that they were waiting for, that they have missed.

1032
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:25,240
 Maybe they were disappointed that through all those years,

1033
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:29,240
 even though they have been looking meticulously over the Scriptures,

1034
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:32,240
 looking for signs and wonders and clues about Him,

1035
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:35,240
 but they still didn't get who He is.

1036
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:40,240
 Jesus is telling the couple and to us that He can be found in the Scriptures,

1037
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:43,240
 that everything in the Scriptures points to Him.

1038
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:48,240
 The couple could see it in the past, but now they understand.

1039
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:51,240
 This is a fresh encounter for the couple.

1040
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:54,240
 They probably have been memorizing Scriptures for their whole lives.

1041
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:57,240
 They have been to synagogue week in and week out,

1042
01:06:57,240 --> 01:07:03,240
 asking questions about the Scriptures, looking for and waiting for Him as they do.

1043
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:07,240
 But they were never sure about who the Messiah was.

1044
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:09,240
 But now, now it is different.

1045
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:14,240
 Now their minds are opened and they can understand what it truly means.

1046
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:16,240
 How exciting is that?

1047
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,240
 No wonder the couple said to each other,

1048
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:23,240
 "Were it not our hearts burning within us while He talked with us on the road

1049
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:26,240
 and opened the Scriptures to us?"

1050
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:30,240
 "Weren't our hearts burning within us?"

1051
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:33,240
 The revelation of who Jesus is, the Eureka moment,

1052
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:38,240
 where we understand what He is talking about, sets fire in our hearts.

1053
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:41,240
 Do you remember the time when you were a little kid

1054
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:44,240
 and you were given a really difficult math question?

1055
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:47,240
 And you tried this way and that way and it still didn't work.

1056
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:50,240
 But then suddenly in that moment, you understand how to solve the problem,

1057
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:52,240
 that joy in your heart.

1058
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:55,240
 And maybe there was this one time when you were trying to read

1059
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:58,240
 and the sentences doesn't make sense to you.

1060
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:01,240
 And you go and ask your teacher and she explains to you

1061
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:03,240
 what's the underlying meaning of the story

1062
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:06,240
 and who actually the story was pointing to.

1063
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:12,240
 And you had this sudden realization that the story itself has a bigger meaning behind it.

1064
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:15,240
 And you go, "Oh, that's what the story means."

1065
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:19,240
 That joy that you have, that Eureka moment that you have.

1066
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:23,240
 Jesus is telling us that we can find the same feeling,

1067
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:26,240
 the same burning in our hearts through the Scriptures

1068
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:31,240
 because the whole of the Scripture is pointed to Him.

1069
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:35,240
 When the Bible is interpreted in the light of Jesus,

1070
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,240
 inspired by the Holy Spirit,

1071
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:43,240
 it has a remarkable power to speak directly and personally into our lives.

1072
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:45,240
 Like the couple on the Emmaus Road,

1073
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:48,240
 we will sometimes find our hearts burning within us

1074
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:53,240
 as the Lord reveals Himself to us through the Bible.

1075
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:57,240
 I believe that Jesus wants to do for you precisely

1076
01:08:57,240 --> 01:09:01,240
 what He did for that couple on the Emmaus Road.

1077
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:03,240
 His nature hasn't changed.

1078
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:06,240
 Ask and He will draw alongside you,

1079
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:10,240
 just like how He drew alongside them,

1080
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:14,240
 to open the Scriptures for you as He did for them.

1081
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:19,240
 Until your heart, like theirs, begins to burn.

1082
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:23,240
 The couple on the Emmaus Road draws a beautiful picture

1083
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:27,240
 of a fresh encounter with Jesus through God's words,

1084
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:29,240
 a fresh revelation of who He is,

1085
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:33,240
 having Him speak specifically and personally to them.

1086
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:38,240
 With that said, there have been so many discouraging moments

1087
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:41,240
 where I struggle with the Word of God

1088
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:44,240
 that I felt I get nothing out of reading the Bible.

1089
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:47,240
 I felt that God wasn't speaking to me

1090
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:50,240
 and I didn't get my questions answered.

1091
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:54,240
 I didn't understand what He was trying to say.

1092
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:59,240
 It was then I realized there were too many "I's" in my sentences.

1093
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:02,240
 Just like reading from the IKEA manual,

1094
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:06,240
 I was trying to get something done from reading it.

1095
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:09,240
 I wasn't reading the Bible to get to know Him.

1096
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:13,240
 I read the Bible with my personal agenda.

1097
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:16,240
 Intimacy isn't built on getting my way.

1098
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:19,240
 It is about getting to know the other.

1099
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:23,240
 Am I listening to what He's saying on His terms?

1100
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:30,240
 Or am I restricting Him to only answer to my worries and my questions?

1101
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:33,240
 I've been putting burdens on my Bible reading.

1102
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:37,240
 I put on the burden of wanting to get something out of reading the Bible.

1103
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:42,240
 I put on the burden of forcing myself to understand every single detail.

1104
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:47,240
 And I put on the burden that it depends on me to like reading the Bible.

1105
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:49,240
 And if I don't, I fail.

1106
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:53,240
 But all God wants for us is to be with Him.

1107
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:56,240
 Is to sit by His feet, empty-handed,

1108
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:59,240
 and just ask God to speak to us.

1109
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:05,240
 To challenge us, to surrender to what He wants to do with our time.

1110
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:10,240
 Hebrews 4, verse 12 reminds us that

1111
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:14,240
 the Word of God is alive and active,

1112
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:17,240
 sharper than any double-edged sword.

1113
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:21,240
 It penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow.

1114
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:25,240
 It judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.

1115
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:31,240
 The power of His Word doesn't depend on my intelligence, my preference or maturity.

1116
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:35,240
 It depends on my consistency to be near Him.

1117
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:40,240
 To give Him the time and space to speak to me through His words.

1118
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:41,240
 Let me say that again.

1119
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:45,240
 It depends on my consistency to be near Him.

1120
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:50,240
 Give Him the time and the space to speak to me.

1121
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:55,240
 I remember there was a period of time when I was quite depressed in Australia.

1122
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:59,240
 I cut myself off from friends and I would stay in my room all day.

1123
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:03,240
 And had no motivation in life, let alone getting out of bed.

1124
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:08,240
 I did not know what was the matter with me and I just lost all joy.

1125
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:12,240
 My friends were obviously worried and tried to get me out of my shell,

1126
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:15,240
 but I find that stressful and tiring.

1127
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:19,240
 Through those times, I still kept reading the Bible.

1128
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:21,240
 Though my social energy was low,

1129
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:25,240
 I found the peaceful presence of just reading through the Psalms.

1130
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:30,240
 In a time when I don't even know what happened to me or how I could get out of it,

1131
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:37,240
 the Word seems to be washing and cleansing my heart a little bit every day.

1132
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:41,240
 Then one day as I was reading through the Romans, a verse struck me.

1133
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:48,240
 "The mind governed by the flesh is death, but the mind governed by the Spirit is life and peace."

1134
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:53,240
 It was a verse that I've read before, but never has it been highlighted to me that way.

1135
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:58,240
 I felt like it was both comforting and disciplining me at the same time.

1136
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:01,240
 I do have the Spirit in me since it was there.

1137
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:06,240
 It will bring me peace and joy, things that I felt was missing in my life.

1138
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:10,240
 I do not need to look for it, bend over my knees to beg for it.

1139
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:13,240
 It is there for me by the Holy Spirit.

1140
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:17,240
 But have I been governed by the Holy Spirit?

1141
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:22,240
 Have I been letting Him take hold of me and to guide me in my everyday decision?

1142
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:28,240
 Or have I been letting myself go, letting my emotions decide what I think my future holds?

1143
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:35,240
 I kept reciting this verse every day in various ways too, writing it out, thinking about it as I go to work,

1144
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:40,240
 thinking about what I've been governed by and what is governed by it means.

1145
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:43,240
 And soon things started moving.

1146
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:48,240
 As someone says, "It is blessed to meditate on His Word."

1147
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:52,240
 Reading it and thinking about it in my quiet time is great,

1148
01:13:52,240 --> 01:14:00,240
 but having a phrase to meditate on throughout my day helps the Word to take root in my heart.

1149
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:08,240
 Meditate on it, ask questions about it, and wrestle with it, create moments for God to speak to me.

1150
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:11,240
 Looking back, I think so much was at work there.

1151
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:16,240
 God highlighting the verse to me, the Holy Spirit working in me,

1152
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:23,240
 and I placed myself under the Word of God to believe in it despite feeling sad and rotten.

1153
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:28,240
 The Word of God is alive and active.

1154
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:33,240
 Since then, Bible reading has changed for me because after that period of time,

1155
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:37,240
 I know that God's Word is effective and it can be activated in my life,

1156
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:42,240
 whether I understand how it works or not, or whether I feel that it is working or not.

1157
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:48,240
 Because it is the Holy Spirit who leads me to the truth and opens my mind to understand His Word.

1158
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:52,240
 It does not mean that I don't struggle with connecting with His Word at times,

1159
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:55,240
 but I learn how to journey through it.

1160
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:59,240
 To think about it, no author would write himself into the story.

1161
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:05,240
 Scrooge does not know about Charles Dickens, nor Juliet knows who Shakespeare is.

1162
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:09,240
 But our Heavenly Father reveals Himself to us through the Bible.

1163
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:11,240
 How precious is that?

1164
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:13,240
 Just think about it for a moment.

1165
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:16,240
 God wants us to know Him. He wants us to know Him.

1166
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:18,240
 He wants us to know His plans.

1167
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:22,240
 He wants us to know that He loves us and He has a plan for us,

1168
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:26,240
 and He is assuring us that there is a way out in our lives.

1169
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:29,240
 He's not testing our knowledge with the Bible.

1170
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:34,240
 He's showing me through the record of His Word that He is sovereign of us all.

1171
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:39,240
 The Word that He has said still holds power in my life today.

1172
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:42,240
 He spoke, and the Word was created.

1173
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:47,240
 He spoke, and the Son was created, and then the Son is still shining today.

1174
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:49,240
 The season is still changing.

1175
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:54,240
 The Word that He spoke thousands and millions of years ago is still powerful and at work today.

1176
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:56,240
 And so just read about it.

1177
01:15:56,240 --> 01:16:00,240
 Know what He wants for your life, and know that this is working for you in your life

1178
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:04,240
 through the Bible that He's telling us.

1179
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:08,240
 One of my habits of reading the Bible is through journaling.

1180
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:15,240
 I know that as I put pen to paper, the fleeting thoughts and feelings were articulated and named,

1181
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:19,240
 and I can hand them back to my father for further conversation.

1182
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:26,240
 Journaling slowed me down and got me to take each verse as I write seriously.

1183
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:30,240
 Maybe you haven't tried journaling before and you want to give it a go,

1184
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:32,240
 so let me share with you what I do.

1185
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:36,240
 I start by sitting and quieting myself down.

1186
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:39,240
 Maybe I was rushing in the morning to get myself ready.

1187
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:44,240
 Maybe I was trying to catch the bus in the morning, and so my mind would be everywhere.

1188
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:51,240
 But this slowing and calming down and just not thinking about anything really helped me focus.

1189
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:56,240
 You know, reading the Bible doesn't have to be, "Okay, it's time to study my English."

1190
01:16:56,240 --> 01:17:03,240
 It's about your moment with God, and you just need to create that mind, that mindset in your head

1191
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:05,240
 and go, "Okay, let me slow down."

1192
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:07,240
 I don't have to think about anything.

1193
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:13,240
 I can let my mind go blank and just say, "Thank you, Jesus. You're here."

1194
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:19,240
 And I pray to ask the Holy Spirit to illuminate the words to me

1195
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:25,240
 because I know that from the story of Emmaus, reading the Bible is not about me reading it.

1196
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:32,240
 It's about the Holy Spirit talking to me, showing me what He wants to tell me today.

1197
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:35,240
 And so it's not about reading a lot of scriptures.

1198
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:41,240
 I have to cover the whole Bible in a year, so I have to rush through a chapter every day.

1199
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:47,240
 I just—maybe it's about one or two verses, maybe one psalm, maybe just one psalm.

1200
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:52,240
 And as I read, there would be phrases that stuck out to me,

1201
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:58,240
 and I just start writing and copying that verse out.

1202
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:03,240
 When I start journaling, I won't wait for the whole idea to develop before I write,

1203
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:07,240
 but I start writing and let the Holy Spirit lead me.

1204
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:14,240
 One time when I was reading Romans 8.27—it's Romans again, but it's really one of my favorite books.

1205
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:21,240
 I was reading Romans 8.27, and I stopped at the phrase, "He who searches my heart," or our hearts,

1206
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:25,240
 "He who searches our hearts," because it struck me, right?

1207
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:30,240
 So I just wrote it on my journal, and then I continued to write the following.

1208
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:33,240
 I felt that there are many layers in my heart.

1209
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:40,240
 At the top, it holds all the weaknesses and wrongs that I know I have, and the thoughts I try to hide,

1210
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:43,240
 and then the condemnation that follows it.

1211
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:49,240
 But underneath that, I see the layers of hurt, the brokenness, and the disappointment.

1212
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:52,240
 God doesn't just stop at the first layer.

1213
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:56,240
 He searches my heart. He searches through all those layers.

1214
01:18:56,240 --> 01:19:00,240
 He knows that through the weaknesses or the sin that I made at the top,

1215
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:06,240
 there's this brokenness in me, there's this weakness in me, and He has compassion for me,

1216
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:08,240
 and He will intercede for me.

1217
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:14,240
 I didn't come up with this thought, but it just flows as I copy the phrases.

1218
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:19,240
 You'll be surprised by the thought that you actually have when you start writing.

1219
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:24,240
 It's always refreshing to try different ways to read the Word.

1220
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:29,240
 I do it through journaling. My friends would listen to it meditatively,

1221
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:34,240
 and I've also been listening to it while I get my morning ready.

1222
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:40,240
 But letting the Word sink into our hearts and thinking about it throughout the day

1223
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:46,240
 really helps to create that space for you to meet with God.

1224
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:52,240
 On the welcome table, you can find pamphlets about hearing the Word campaign.

1225
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:58,240
 I don't have it right now. I hold on to it the whole morning, and now it's not here.

1226
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:02,240
 But on the welcome table, there's actually this Hearing the Word campaign.

1227
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:08,240
 It is a Hong Kong-wide event where they planned a 47-day listening plan for the Book of Matthews.

1228
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:11,240
 You can find more information about it after the service.

1229
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:15,240
 But obviously, it is important to read the Word in our own time.

1230
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:20,240
 It is also important to read the Word together in a community.

1231
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:25,240
 I love how last Sunday so many of us gathered together to have lunch together,

1232
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:27,240
 to connect with each other, and to hang out.

1233
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:32,240
 That's the start of building relationships where we get to know each other's names,

1234
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:36,240
 their likes and dislikes, their hobbies, and all of that.

1235
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:44,240
 However, to be a community of faith, it is also important to read and discuss God's Word together.

1236
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:49,240
 We share about a week, but also encourage each other through God's words.

1237
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:56,240
 We discuss and grow together in unity as we listen to insights that each group member brings.

1238
01:20:56,240 --> 01:21:05,240
 We allow the truth from the Scripture to unite us together and encourage each other to be consistent in our reading.

1239
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:11,240
 God's Word is the primary way that God has chosen to make himself known to us.

1240
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:18,240
 So even if we want to know God, we cannot give up on God's Word.

1241
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:24,240
 Yes, it might be a struggle, or we need to learn how to encounter God through his words,

1242
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:27,240
 but God loves revealing himself to us.

1243
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:30,240
 There's a whole book about him that we can read about.

1244
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:36,240
 He loves to speak to us personally through his Word and making himself known,

1245
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:40,240
 just like he did to me when I was struggling.

1246
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:43,240
 So let me end with two encouragements.

1247
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:48,240
 For one, join a community group and learn with others how to read the Word.

1248
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:53,240
 And secondly, carve out time to read a short passage of God's words.

1249
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:58,240
 Ask God to reveal himself to you through his Word.

1250
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:02,240
 Pay attention to what stands out, sit with that,

1251
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:08,240
 and ask God to clarify what he might be saying to you through his Word.

1252
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:16,240
 God loves revealing himself, so we can be confident

1253
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:20,240
 when we ask him in prayer that he will.

1254
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:30,240
 I would love to pray over us, so would you all please stand and the worship team can come forward.

1255
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:34,240
 Maybe you are feeling stagnant in your Bible reading.

1256
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:39,240
 Maybe there were a lot of guilt that you carried when you read the Bible

1257
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:43,240
 and you don't like reading it, and there's a lot of burden that you've put on yourself.

1258
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:45,240
 And I'd just like to pray for you.

1259
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:50,240
 I'd like to pray for us to meet God afresh, to cast all the burdens on him,

1260
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:55,240
 and just come to enjoy his Word with us together.

1261
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:57,240
 So let us pray.

1262
01:22:57,240 --> 01:23:04,240
 Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you that you reveal yourself to us through your words.

1263
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:10,240
 We thank you that we're able to encounter you through the Scriptures that you have given us.

1264
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:14,240
 We also cry out to you that there are times when we don't understand you,

1265
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:16,240
 when it's been a struggle to read your words,

1266
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:22,240
 and there are burdens that come along with it when I don't understand what you are talking about.

1267
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:29,240
 And so we pray, we pray that this is not your heart to have guilt and burden when reading your Word,

1268
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:34,240
 that through your power, help us to cast these worries and burdens aside,

1269
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:39,240
 and help us to enjoy just spending time with you, reading about you.

1270
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:42,240
 You tell us that you are love.

1271
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:46,240
 You tell us that through your words that you come to save,

1272
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:51,240
 that through your words, there's redemption and peace and life.

1273
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:53,240
 And we just want to come to you afresh today.

1274
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:55,240
 We want to seek you through your words.

1275
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:58,240
 We are not satisfied with how we're reading,

1276
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:03,240
 but we want to go deeper and read more about who you are.

1277
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:06,240
 And so God, please come and speak to us through your words.

1278
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:09,240
 Come and let us encounter you afresh.

1279
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:16,240
 We want to know who you really are, who you really, really are.

1280
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:21,240
 Thank you, God, that you love us and you meet us where we are at.

1281
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:24,240
 Thank you, God, even though we don't understand,

1282
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:28,240
 you still come up to show us who you are.

1283
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:33,240
 Thank you that you give us your Word.

1284
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:36,240
 In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

1285
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:51,240
 [music]

1286
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:54,240
 Sing, "Christ is our portion."

1287
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:59,240
 Christ is our portion.

1288
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:04,240
 Christ, our devotion.

1289
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:13,240
 Christ is the center of our lives.

1290
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:18,240
 He is our obsession.

1291
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:23,240
 He is our confession.

1292
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:30,240
 Christ is the center of our lives.

1293
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:32,240
 Sing it again.

1294
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:37,240
 Christ is our portion.

1295
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:43,240
 Yes, he is our devotion.

1296
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:52,240
 Christ is the center of our lives.

1297
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:57,240
 He is our obsession.

1298
01:25:57,240 --> 01:26:02,240
 He is our confession.

1299
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:08,240
 Christ is the center of our lives.

1300
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:11,240
 As for me in this house.

1301
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:20,240
 As for me in this house, we will serve you, glorify you.

1302
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:29,240
 Let it be in this house that we love you and obey you.

1303
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:34,240
 You are Lord of this house.

1304
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:39,240
 You're the first and you're the only.

1305
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:46,240
 In the midst of us now, you are holy.

1306
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:50,240
 You are worthy.

1307
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:54,240
 Christ is our portion.

1308
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:58,240
 Christ, our devotion.

1309
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:05,240
 Christ is the center of our lives.

1310
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:12,240
 He is our obsession.

1311
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:17,240
 He is our confession.

1312
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:23,240
 Christ is the center of our lives.

1313
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:26,240
 And oh, all that matters.

1314
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:32,240
 And oh, all that matters now is you.

1315
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:35,240
 Yes, Lord.

1316
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:41,240
 And oh, all that matters now is you.

1317
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:44,240
 All that matters, Jesus.

1318
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:50,240
 And oh, all that matters now is you.

1319
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:54,240
 Nothing else matters, Jesus.

1320
01:27:54,240 --> 01:28:04,240
 And oh, all that matters now is you.

1321
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:10,240
 And oh, all that matters now is you.

1322
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:16,240
 And oh, all that matters now is you.

1323
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:23,240
 And oh, all that matters now is you.

1324
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:30,240
 And oh, all that matters now is you.

1325
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:36,240
 And oh, all that matters now is you.

1326
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:42,240
 And oh, all that matters now is you.

1327
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:48,240
 And oh, all that matters now is you.

1328
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:54,240
 And oh, all that matters now is you.

1329
01:28:54,240 --> 01:29:00,240
 And oh, all that matters now is you.

1330
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:06,240
 And oh, all that matters now is you.

1331
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:12,240
 And oh, all that matters now is you.

1332
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:18,240
 And oh, all that matters now is you.

1333
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:24,240
 And oh, all that matters now is you.

1334
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:30,240
 And oh, all that matters now is you.

1335
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:36,240
 And oh, all that matters now is you.

1336
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:42,240
 And oh, all that matters now is you.

1337
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:48,240
 And oh, all that matters now is you.

1338
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:54,240
 And oh, all that matters now is you.

1339
01:29:54,240 --> 01:30:00,240
 And oh, all that matters now is you.

1340
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:06,240
