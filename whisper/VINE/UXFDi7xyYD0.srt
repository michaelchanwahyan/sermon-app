1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
 What an introduction, I'm now so scared.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,360
 But let me also tell you a little bit about myself.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,840
 There are a few things that you might find interesting about me.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,080
 First of all, when I was young, I'm really not good at reading.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,680
 Well, maybe not even not good at, I'm scared of reading English books.

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,000
 When I was young, if I see an English book on the floor,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,320
 I will not touch it, because I know that if I touch it,

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,120
 I'll be responsible for it.

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,360
 That means I'll have to read it, and I'm not reading it.

10
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,520
 So I'll just let the English book lie on the floor peacefully,

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,520
 and I'll just detour around it.

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,800
 And lucky for me to start teaching English for 10 years in my past 10

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,320
 years, so well done, students.

14
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,720
 Another surprising thing about me is that sometimes I

15
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,040
 listen to really loud music to relax.

16
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,200
 I find that the louder and more upbeat the music,

17
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,440
 the more calming it is for me.

18
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,360
 Like, it feels so calm when I just hear music blasting in my ear.

19
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,400
 I don't know, did anyone of that find loud music calming?

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,720
 Awesome, good, good.

21
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,360
 Yeah, right?

22
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,320
 Another interesting thing about me, well, my friends find about me

23
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,000
 is that I'm good at connecting with people now.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,400
 I have an ex-colleague/friend who was quite surprised that I can actually

25
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,840
 talk to strangers now when I meet new people.

26
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,160
 Last time she saw me on my IG Reels talking about the friends

27
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,480
 that I met in Australia, and then she met me, and they go, June,

28
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,880
 you made friends in Australia?

29
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,920
 I'm like, yeah.

30
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,360
 And I've been friends with her for over 10 years.

31
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,040
 And I've met her not only--

32
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,360
 not like, oh, I've met her once every five months.

33
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,400
 No, I meet her every single day when we were at work.

34
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,160
 Even though I left the place that we worked together,

35
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,240
 I still meet her like once or twice every week.

36
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,680
 And she still finds me surprising that I can make friends and connect

37
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,320
 with people now.

38
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,280
 Maybe that's because we've been friends for so long

39
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,760
 that we've stopped thinking or knowing about each other.

40
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,720
 We've stopped knowing anything fresh or the small changes

41
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,120
 that happens in us every day.

42
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,080
 We all need fresh encounters in our relationships,

43
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,440
 whether it is with our friends that we've known for a long time,

44
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,480
 our spouse, or even with God.

45
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,320
 Maybe you have been a Christian for a long time,

46
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,920
 and seeking fresh encounter with Jesus is something

47
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,520
 that you've always thought--

48
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,120
 you've always wanted.

49
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,000
 You've known Jesus for a long time, and then the more that you know him,

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,080
 the more that you come to church to listen to sermons and read the Bible,

51
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,440
 and you go, yeah.

52
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,320
 Whenever June talked about the five fish and the two loaves,

53
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,160
 I know what she's going to talk about.

54
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,360
 Or you open up the Bible, and you read Psalms 1,

55
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,280
 and you go, I know exactly how this is going to be.

56
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,600
 This is another story that I've learned since I was in kids ministry.

57
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,800
 And you need that fresh encounter, and you just

58
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,800
 don't know how to get it or where to begin.

59
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,880
 I hope that this message speaks to you about how

60
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:18,800
 to journey through those moments and find fresh encounter with Jesus.

61
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,400
 Maybe you are just a new Christian or not yet a Christian,

62
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,720
 but you have made assumptions with, you know, I think God is like that.

63
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,040
 I've heard that God looks like that, or Jesus is like that.

64
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:37,000
 And you kind of need someone to tell you who Jesus is through his word.

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,640
 And I hope that this message is going to shine some light on you

66
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,960
 to show you a pathway of how I did it when I was young

67
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:49,160
 and how I do it when I was walking through some ups and downs when

68
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,640
 I connect with the word of God.

69
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,520
 As I was praying for the sermon, I feel that God

70
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,040
 is saying that last week, since last week,

71
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,520
 it is an important week for all of us because we just

72
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,000
 came out of a 21-day fast.

73
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,600
 And in those 21 days, as a church, we fasted

74
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:13,320
 from things that were distracting us from God, maybe things that we eat,

75
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:17,160
 maybe thinking about, you know, constantly thinking about what to eat next.

76
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,040
 That's kind of like my life.

77
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,920
 Or maybe you were watching Netflix and you fasted from Netflix

78
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,480
 and you carved out time to be with God, to pray and to read.

79
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,320
 And every day, the church would send out devotionals,

80
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,480
 sharings from people about how they encounter God.

81
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,320
 And there would be scriptures and questions that came out of the sharing.

82
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,680
 And then, wow, every single morning, I just look forward

83
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,360
 to the sharings that I'm going to read and the question that really helped me

84
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,960
 to respond to or think about my life or think about how I start that morning.

85
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,400
 But then last week, I woke up and there's nothing.

86
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,960
 I'm like, "Chapman, where's the sharing?"

87
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,640
 I wanted to text him that.

88
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:03,720
 I didn't because there's no more sharing from other people telling me how they

89
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,720
 encountered Jesus' life.

90
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,720
 All I have is the scriptures in my hands right now that I have to wrestle with,

91
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,120
 that I have to sit with to encounter Jesus on my own.

92
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:20,880
 So this week, I hope that as we just came out of the fast, that we're able to,

93
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,840
 still as a church, continue our connection with God, continue our walk with God,

94
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,160
 not from other people's help, not through other people's encounter,

95
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,840
 but our own fresh encounter with Jesus.

96
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:38,440
 So today, let's begin our fresh encounter with Him through His Word.

97
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,960
 The Word is His revelation to us.

98
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,840
 It is wonderful and precious and a joy to read.

99
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,400
 Should it be?

100
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,360
 Isn't it?

101
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,440
 But that's not how I felt at the very beginning.

102
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,440
 When I first began reading the Bible, I find life's big questions that I can

103
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:00,240
 give answers to, how I live my life and give me the positive energy that I need

104
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,000
 to live my life.

105
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,600
 But that kind of...that way of describing the Bible kind of threw me off a bit

106
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,040
 because there are two kinds of people.

107
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,000
 There's one kind that can follow instructions really well,

108
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,640
 and there's this one kind that can't.

109
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,200
 I'm definitely the kind that struggles with it.

110
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:24,520
 Let me tell you, when I first arrived in Australia a few years ago,

111
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:30,400
 the first task after I put down my luggage in my shared room was to build the

112
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,000
 Ikea bed.

113
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,440
 It was the hardest thing for me to do.

114
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,840
 I was exhausted after my 10-hour red-eye flight.

115
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,600
 And when I opened the manual, I could not, for the life,

116
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,240
 for the sake of my life, put it together.

117
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,160
 I couldn't understand the pictures.

118
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,960
 I mixed up the screw sizes.

119
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,240
 And I just don't think the instructions work at all.

120
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,520
 Can you put the Ikea bed together?

121
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,880
 Like, no, I can't.

122
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,760
 I come from Hong Kong.

123
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:02,080
 I'm like, "I can't put this together where I'm sleeping tonight."

124
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,000
 And when I read the Bible as the manual or instructions for my life,

125
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,160
 that's how I feel too.

126
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,160
 Often when I turn to the Bible for instructions, I'm already at my

127
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,040
 wits' end.

128
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,120
 I must have been, you know, looking and searching for how to solve my

129
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,320
 life's problem, and reading the Bible is my last resort.

130
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,840
 So I'm probably overwhelmed and sad and exhausted.

131
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,520
 And then when I read the Bible, I feel the instructions are so out of date

132
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,880
 and not related to my current situation.

133
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,160
 Which verse in the Bible tells me if I should accept the job offer?

134
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,440
 How do I make sense of the instructions?

135
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,920
 Invest in seven ventures, yes, in eight.

136
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,320
 You know, what does that mean?

137
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52,760
 And let alone the boring incidents about how Israel was split into two,

138
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,880
 and the mystical book of the Revelations.

139
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:00,320
 Because of these obstacles, reading the Bible seemed like a chore.

140
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,840
 I thought to be a good Christian, which I wanted to be a good Christian,

141
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,520
 I have to read the Bible and pray.

142
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:12,360
 But the struggles and obstacles made it hard for me to even open the Bible.

143
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,600
 The words seemed mundane and boring.

144
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,840
 I felt nothing when I read, and it seems like work.

145
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,120
 All these made it hard for me to connect with the Bible, let alone seeing God

146
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,240
 through it.

147
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,200
 I don't know if you resonate with what I was going through back then.

148
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,120
 Maybe you're just starting the Bible reading journey, and the book seems so

149
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,600
 daunting to you, and you just don't know where to begin.

150
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,840
 I remember when I first got baptized and everyone gave me Bibles,

151
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,160
 and it was this big, and the paper was so thin and so full of words.

152
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,400
 Where do I begin?

153
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,720
 And I vowed, "Okay, I'm going to read through the Bible from, you know,

154
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,360
 the first book to the last book."

155
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,200
 But then I got stuck at Leviticus.

156
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,720
 I just couldn't get out of it.

157
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,920
 I'm like, "I'm sorry."

158
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,280
 Maybe you've been a seasoned Christian, and there are times in your life you felt

159
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:07,720
 stagnant in your Bible reading, or that the Bible reading has been a habit,

160
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,880
 and you feel like there's no new stories or parables that you have not read.

161
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,480
 You wish to go deeper into your reading.

162
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,280
 You long for a fresh encounter with Jesus through His words.

163
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:25,160
 And what does it mean to have a fresh encounter with Jesus?

164
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,280
 Because I've known Jesus for 20 or 30-plus years.

165
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:33,280
 What does it mean to have a fresh encounter with Jesus?

166
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:39,080
 To have a deeply rooted, evergreen, fruit-producing life like the poet

167
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,760
 described in Psalms 1.

168
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:47,400
 Let me take you to the book of Luke, to an account that can help us to find

169
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,800
 some answers to our questions.

170
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,960
 So the story is from Luke 24, and here in the story,

171
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,200
 Jesus has just been crucified.

172
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:01,440
 Now, there are rumors that Jesus was risen from the dead, and a couple on the way

173
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,000
 to Emmaus had a fresh encounter with Jesus.

174
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 Let's have a look at their experience.

175
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,200
 So verse 13, "Now the same day, two of them were going to a village called

176
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,880
 Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem.

177
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,440
 They were talking with each other about everything that had happened.

178
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:28,120
 As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and

179
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,160
 walked along with them, but they were kept from recognizing Him.

180
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,880
 He asked them, 'What are you discussing together as you walk along?'

181
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,960
 They stood still, their faces downcast.

182
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:48,040
 One of them, named Cleopas, asked Him, 'Are you the only one visiting Jerusalem

183
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:53,160
 who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?'

184
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,920
 'What things?' Jesus asked.

185
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,640
 There were two people on the way to Emmaus.

186
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,760
 We don't know too much about these two people, but there are a few things we know.

187
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:09,920
 They were among the group of followers of Jesus, and on that day, the day that Mary

188
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:17,440
 Madeline and other women found out that Jesus had risen, they were walking towards Emmaus.

189
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,040
 They have heard about Jesus was risen, but their reaction was different from what we

190
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,040
 would have expected.

191
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,160
 They've heard from the woman, they've heard from the disciples, but they were still downcast.

192
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,080
 The Bible said they were kept from recognizing Jesus.

193
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,280
 Yes, physically, they were kept from recognizing Him.

194
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:42,560
 They did not know that the man who was walking towards them, who was talking to them, was

195
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,200
 the Jesus that they were pining for.

196
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,680
 But I doubt if they know who Jesus was before He hung on the cross, that they still don't

197
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,880
 know who He truly is.

198
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,040
 Let's listen to how they described Jesus to Jesus.

199
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:02,480
 'About Jesus of Nazareth,' they replied, 'He was a prophet, powerful indeed before God

200
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,880
 and all the people.

201
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:08,560
 And the chief priests, now rulers, handed Him over to be sentenced to death, and they

202
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,960
 crucified Him.

203
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,800
 But we had hoped that He was the one who was going to redeem Israel.'

204
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,800
 They have followed Jesus, they've heard about what He's done.

205
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,440
 Maybe they've even witnessed some of His miracles.

206
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,160
 They had hoped that He was the one to redeem Israel.

207
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:33,160
 However, not only physically they could not recognize Jesus, they probably had the wrong

208
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:38,520
 idea of Him, that they couldn't recognize Him from who He truly is.

209
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:44,800
 In the scripture it says, they had hoped that He was the one who would redeem Israel.

210
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,460
 This implies that Jesus' death put a stop to everything.

211
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:56,000
 He cannot be the Savior of Israel, because who could save Israel if He is now dead?

212
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,680
 Their past knowledge and experience has blocked them away, has blocked them from knowing who

213
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,280
 Jesus is.

214
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:09,520
 And when things didn't happen according to their plan, they got disappointed, confused,

215
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,920
 and walked away.

216
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,580
 That could be us, couldn't it?

217
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,600
 Maybe we have known Jesus for a while.

218
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:23,640
 We've read books about Him, listened to sermons about Him, and met with Him back in the day.

219
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,840
 And we thought we had enough information about Him.

220
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:33,360
 So we have our own experience about Him, and who He is, and what He's going to do.

221
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,600
 And so we pray and ask Him to do things according to our own plan, and our own understanding

222
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,800
 of Him.

223
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,400
 Jesus could have left them alone.

224
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:49,480
 At the end of the day, they were only two of the followers, out of the many, that had

225
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,480
 the wrong expectation of Him.

226
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,980
 They weren't recorded in the Bible afterwards.

227
00:13:54,980 --> 00:14:00,520
 So Jesus could have just left them alone and gone to some more other impactful followers

228
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:05,520
 who could do something and change their lives, and so on.

229
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,160
 But yet, Jesus came up to them.

230
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:14,320
 Jesus knew they needed a fresh encounter of Him, to know Him afresh, regardless of who

231
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,500
 they are and what they can do.

232
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:23,500
 He met them where they were at, disappointed, confused, overwhelmed.

233
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:29,800
 He concealed to them who He was, and showed them through Scripture who He really is.

234
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,920
 Because Jesus knew they needed Him to understand His words.

235
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,960
 Let's look at verse 27.

236
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:42,120
 It says, "And beginning with Moses and all the prophets, He explained to them what was

237
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,960
 said in all the Scriptures concerning Himself."

238
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,480
 Jesus could have met them in other ways.

239
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,300
 He showed Thomas' wounds.

240
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,900
 He cooked fish for Peter.

241
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:59,560
 But to these two on the road to Emmaus, He opened up the Scriptures to them, showing

242
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,980
 them who He really is.

243
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:06,360
 He is the one that they have been reading about, but they didn't get.

244
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,780
 He is the one that they were waiting for, that they have missed.

245
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:13,540
 Maybe they were disappointed that through all those years, even though they have been

246
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:18,680
 looking meticulously over the Scriptures, looking for signs and wonders and clues about

247
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,960
 Him, but they still didn't get who He is.

248
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:27,740
 Jesus is telling the couple and to us that He can be found in the Scriptures, that everything

249
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,260
 in the Scriptures point to Him.

250
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:35,500
 The couple could see it in the past, but now they understand.

251
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,060
 This is a fresh encounter for the couple.

252
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:41,820
 They probably have been memorizing Scriptures for their whole lives.

253
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:47,340
 They have been to synagogue week in and week out, asking questions about the Scriptures,

254
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,820
 looking for and waiting for Him as they do.

255
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:54,260
 But they were never sure about who the Messiah was.

256
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,060
 But now, now it is different.

257
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:01,780
 Now their minds are opened and they can understand what it truly means.

258
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,980
 How exciting is that?

259
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:08,740
 No wonder the couple said to each other, "Were not our hearts burning within us while He

260
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:13,580
 talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?"

261
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,000
 Weren't our hearts burning within us?

262
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,420
 The revelation of who Jesus is, the Eureka moment where we understand what He is talking

263
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,180
 about sets fire in our hearts.

264
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:29,500
 Do you remember the time when you were a little kid and you were given a really difficult

265
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,920
 math question and you tried this way and that way and it still didn't work?

266
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,860
 But then suddenly in that moment, you understand how to solve the problem, that joy in your

267
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,060
 heart.

268
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:43,740
 And maybe there was this one time when you were trying to read and the sentences doesn't

269
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,740
 make sense to you.

270
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:49,860
 And you go and ask your teacher and she explained to you what's the underlying meaning of the

271
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,620
 story and who actually the story was pointing to.

272
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:58,460
 And then you had this sudden realization that the story itself has a bigger meaning behind

273
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:02,700
 it and you go, "Oh, that's what the story means."

274
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:08,380
 That joy that you have, that Eureka moment that you have, Jesus is telling us that we

275
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:13,380
 can find the same feeling, the same burning in our hearts through the Scriptures because

276
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:18,700
 the whole of the Scripture is pointed to Him.

277
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:24,260
 When the Bible is interpreted in the light of Jesus, inspired by the Holy Spirit, it

278
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:30,260
 has a remarkable power to speak directly and personally into our lives.

279
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:35,260
 Like the couple on the Emmaus Road, we will sometimes find our hearts burning within us

280
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:40,180
 as the Lord reveals Himself to us through the Bible.

281
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:46,420
 I believe that Jesus wants to do for you precisely what He did for that couple on the Emmaus

282
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,420
 Road.

283
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:50,260
 His nature hasn't changed.

284
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:58,200
 Ask and He will draw alongside you just like how He drew alongside them to open the Scriptures

285
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:06,000
 for you as He did for them until your heart, like theirs, begins to burn.

286
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,540
 The couple on the Emmaus Road draws a beautiful picture of a fresh encounter with Jesus through

287
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:18,940
 God's words, a fresh revelation of who He is, having Him speak specifically and personally

288
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,340
 to them.

289
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:26,700
 With that said, there have been so many discouraging moments where I struggle with the Word of

290
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:31,660
 God that I felt I get nothing out of reading the Bible.

291
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:37,100
 I felt that God wasn't speaking to me and I didn't get my questions answered.

292
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:41,040
 I didn't understand what He was trying to say.

293
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:46,460
 It was then I realized there were too many "I's" in my sentences.

294
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:52,140
 Just like reading from the IKEA manual, I was trying to get something done from reading

295
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,380
 it.

296
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,980
 I wasn't reading the Bible to get to know Him.

297
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:00,680
 I read the Bible with my personal agenda.

298
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,780
 Psychology isn't built on getting my way.

299
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,860
 It is about getting to know the other.

300
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:14,100
 Am I listening to what He's saying on His terms or am I restricting Him to only answer

301
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,740
 to my worries and my questions?

302
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,460
 I've been putting burdens on my Bible reading.

303
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:24,700
 I put on the burden of wanting to get something out of reading the Bible.

304
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:30,660
 I put on the burden of forcing myself to understand every single detail and I put on the burden

305
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:36,820
 that it depends on me to like reading the Bible and if I don't, I fail.

306
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:44,460
 But all God wants for us is to be with Him, is to sit by His feet, empty-handed, and just

307
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:51,380
 ask God to speak to us, to challenge us, to surrender to what He wants to do with our

308
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,380
 time.

309
00:19:52,380 --> 00:20:02,520
 Hebrews 4, verse 12 reminds us that the Word of God is alive and active, sharper than any

310
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,940
 double-edged sword.

311
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:08,620
 It penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow.

312
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:12,780
 It judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.

313
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:18,060
 The power of His Word doesn't depend on my intelligence, my preference or maturity.

314
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:24,980
 It depends on my consistency to be near Him, to give Him the time and space to speak to

315
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,700
 me through His words.

316
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,660
 Let me say that again.

317
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:32,940
 It depends on my consistency to be near Him.

318
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:37,460
 Give Him the time and the space to speak to me.

319
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:42,700
 I remember there was a period of time when I was quite depressed in Australia.

320
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:48,220
 I cut myself off from friends and I would stay in my room all day and had no motivation

321
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,780
 in life, let alone getting out of bed.

322
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:55,300
 I did not know what was the matter with me and I just lost all joy.

323
00:20:55,300 --> 00:21:00,340
 My friends were obviously worried and tried to get me out of my shell, but I find that

324
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,860
 stressful and tiring.

325
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:06,140
 Through those times, I still kept reading the Bible.

326
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:11,380
 Though my social energy was low, I found the peaceful presence of just reading through

327
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,540
 the Psalms.

328
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:18,740
 In a time when I don't even know what happened to me or how I could get out of it, the Word

329
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:24,540
 seems to be washing and cleansing my heart a little bit every day.

330
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:28,540
 Then one day as I was reading through the Romans, a verse struck me.

331
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:34,220
 The mind governed by the flesh is death, but the mind governed by the Spirit is life and

332
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,220
 peace.

333
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:40,220
 It was a verse that I've read before, but never has it been highlighted to me that way.

334
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:45,180
 I felt like it was both comforting and disciplining me at the same time.

335
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,060
 I do have the Spirit in me since it was there.

336
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:53,220
 It will bring me peace and joy, things that I felt was missing in my life.

337
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:57,580
 I do not need to look for it, bend over my knees to beg for it.

338
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,820
 It is there for me by the Holy Spirit.

339
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:04,820
 But have I been governed by the Holy Spirit?

340
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:09,940
 Have I been letting Him take hold of me and to guide me in my everyday decision?

341
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:14,420
 Or have I been letting myself go, letting my emotions decide what I think my future

342
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,420
 holds?

343
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:21,420
 I kept reciting this verse every day in various ways too, writing it out, thinking about it

344
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:26,620
 as I go to work, thinking about what I've been governed by and what is governed by it

345
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,660
 means.

346
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:30,380
 And soon things started moving.

347
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:35,780
 As someone says, "It is blessed to meditate on His Word."

348
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:42,300
 Writing it and thinking about it in my quiet time is great, but having a phrase to meditate

349
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:47,980
 on throughout my day helps the Word to take root in my heart.

350
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:53,620
 Meditate on it, ask questions about it, and wrestle with it, create moments for God to

351
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,980
 speak to me.

352
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,740
 Looking back, I think so much was at work there.

353
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:04,620
 God highlighting the verse to me, the Holy Spirit working in me, and I placed myself

354
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:10,860
 under the Word of God to believe in it despite feeling sad and rotten.

355
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:15,180
 The Word of God is alive and active.

356
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:20,380
 Since then, Bible reading has changed for me because after that period of time, I know

357
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:25,380
 that God's Word is effective and it can be activated in my life, whether I understand

358
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:30,420
 how it works or not, or whether I feel that it is working or not, because it is the Holy

359
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:35,380
 Spirit who leads me to the truth and opens my mind to understand His Word.

360
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:40,340
 It does not mean that I don't struggle with connecting with His Word at times, but I learn

361
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:43,020
 how to journey through it.

362
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:47,420
 To think about it, no author would write himself into the story.

363
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:52,660
 Scrooge does not know about Charles Dickens, nor Juliet knows who Shakespeare is, but our

364
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:57,100
 Heavenly Father reveals Himself to us through the Bible.

365
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,980
 How precious is that?

366
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,660
 Just think about it for a moment.

367
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,160
 God wants us to know Him.

368
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,740
 He wants us to know Him.

369
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,540
 He wants us to know His plans.

370
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:10,700
 He wants us to know that He loves us and He has a plan for us and He is assuring us that

371
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,300
 there is a way out in our lives.

372
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,300
 He's not testing our knowledge with the Bible.

373
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:21,900
 He's showing me through the record of His Word that He is sovereign of us all.

374
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:26,180
 The Word that He has said still holds power in my life today.

375
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:29,480
 He spoke and the Word was created.

376
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:34,540
 He spoke and the Son was created and then the Son is still shining today.

377
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,220
 The season is still changing.

378
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:40,580
 The Word that He spoke thousands and millions of years ago is still powerful and at work

379
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,580
 today.

380
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,860
 And so just read about it.

381
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:47,620
 Know what He wants for your life and know that this is working for you in your life

382
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:51,540
 through the Bible that He's telling us.

383
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:55,500
 One of my habits of reading the Bible is through journaling.

384
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:01,740
 I know that as I put pen to paper, the fleeting thoughts and feelings were articulated and

385
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:07,260
 named and I can hand them back to my father for further conversation.

386
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:13,360
 Journaling slowed me down and got me to take each verse as I write seriously.

387
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,000
 Maybe you haven't tried journaling before and you want to give it a go.

388
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,500
 So let me share with you what I do.

389
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,740
 I start by sitting and quieting myself down.

390
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:26,780
 Maybe I was rushing in the morning to get myself ready.

391
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:31,200
 Maybe I was trying to catch the bus in the morning and so my mind would be everywhere.

392
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,940
 But this slowing and calming down and just not thinking about anything really helped

393
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:37,940
 me focus.

394
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:43,420
 You know, reading the Bible doesn't have to be, "Okay, it's time to study my English."

395
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:49,380
 It's about your moment with God and you just need to create that mind, that mindset in

396
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,420
 your head and go, "Okay, let me slow down.

397
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,300
 I don't have to think about anything.

398
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:58,500
 I can let my mind go blank and just say, 'Thank you, Jesus.

399
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,180
 You're here.'

400
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:07,060
 And I pray to ask the Holy Spirit to illuminate the words to me because I know that from the

401
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:12,240
 story of Emmaus, reading the Bible is not about me reading it.

402
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:19,540
 It's about the Holy Spirit talking to me, showing me what he wants to tell me today.

403
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:22,460
 And so it's not about reading a lot of scriptures.

404
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:27,060
 I have to cover the whole Bible in a year, so I have to rush through a chapter every

405
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,060
 day.

406
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:34,140
 I just, maybe it's about one or two verses, maybe one psalm, maybe just one psalm.

407
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:40,780
 And as I read, there would be phrases that stuck out to me and I just start writing and

408
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:45,260
 copying that verse out.

409
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:50,540
 When I start journaling, I won't wait for the whole idea to develop before I write,

410
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:54,000
 but I start writing and let the Holy Spirit lead me.

411
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,260
 One time when I was reading Romans 8.27, it's Romans again, but it's really one of my favorite

412
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,260
 books.

413
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:07,660
 I was reading Romans 8.27 and I stopped at the phrase, "He who searches my heart," or

414
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,420
 our hearts, "He who searches our hearts."

415
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,680
 And because it struck to me, it struck me, right?

416
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:17,620
 So I just wrote it on my journal and then I continued to write the following.

417
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:20,780
 I felt that there are many layers in my heart.

418
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:25,740
 At the top, it holds all the weaknesses and wrongs that I know I have and the thoughts

419
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:30,500
 I try to hide, and then the condemnation that follows it.

420
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:37,060
 But underneath that, I see the layers of hurt, the brokenness, and the disappointment.

421
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,740
 God doesn't just stop at the first layer.

422
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,380
 He searches my heart.

423
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,780
 He searches through all those layers.

424
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:48,740
 He knows that through the weaknesses or the sin that I made at the top, there's this brokenness

425
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,740
 in me.

426
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,420
 There's this weakness in me.

427
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:56,020
 And He has compassion for me and He will intercede for me.

428
00:27:56,020 --> 00:28:02,220
 I didn't come up with this thought, but it just flows as I copy the phrases.

429
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:07,300
 You'll be surprised by the thought that you actually have when you start writing.

430
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:11,700
 It's always refreshing to try different ways to read the Word.

431
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,260
 I do it through journaling.

432
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:19,460
 My friends would listen to it meditatively, and I've also been listening to it while I

433
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:23,340
 get my morning ready.

434
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:28,380
 But letting the Word sink into our hearts and thinking about it throughout the day really

435
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:34,020
 helps to create that space for you to meet with God.

436
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:39,740
 On the welcome table, you can find pamphlets about hearing the Word campaign.

437
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,580
 I don't have it right now.

438
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:45,700
 I hold on to it the whole morning, and now it's not here.

439
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,020
 But on the welcome table, there's actually this Hearing the Word campaign.

440
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:55,060
 It is a Hong Kong-wide event where they planned a 47-day listening plan for the Book of Matthews.

441
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:58,300
 You can find more information about it after the service.

442
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:02,620
 But obviously, it is important to read the Word in our own time.

443
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:07,220
 It is also important to read the Word together in a community.

444
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:13,080
 I love how last Sunday, so many of us gathered together to have lunch together, to connect

445
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,060
 with each other and to hang out.

446
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:19,980
 That's the start of building relationships where we get to know each other's names, their

447
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:23,540
 likes and dislikes, their hobbies, and all of that.

448
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:29,940
 However, to be a community of faith, it is also important to read and discuss God's Word

449
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,180
 together.

450
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:36,700
 We share about a week, but also encourage each other through God's Words.

451
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:42,860
 We discuss and grow together in unity as we listen to insights that each group member

452
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,940
 brings.

453
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:50,020
 We allow the truth from the Scripture to unite us together and encourage each other to be

454
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,900
 consistent in our reading.

455
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:58,240
 God's Word is the primary way that God has chosen to make Himself known to us.

456
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:05,180
 So even if we want to know God, we cannot give up on God's Word.

457
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:12,000
 Yes, it might be a struggle, or we need to learn how to encounter God through His Word,

458
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,540
 but God loves revealing Himself to us.

459
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:17,860
 There's a whole book about Him that we can read about.

460
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:24,420
 He loves to speak to us personally through His Word and making Himself known, just like

461
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:27,640
 He did to me when I was struggling.

462
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,400
 So let me end with two encouragement.

463
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:35,580
 For one, join a community group and learn with others how to read the Word.

464
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:41,140
 And secondly, carve out time to read a short passage of God's Words.

465
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:46,100
 Ask God to reveal Himself to you through His Word.

466
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:52,220
 Pay attention to what stands out, sit with that, and ask God to clarify what He might

467
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:55,940
 be saying to you through His Word.

468
00:30:55,940 --> 00:31:01,820
 God loves revealing Himself, so if we can be confident that God loves revealing Himself

469
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:07,940
 so we can be confident when we ask Him in prayer that He will.

470
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:13,420
 I'd love to pray over us, so would you all please stand and the worship team can come

471
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:18,140
 forward.

472
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:21,500
 Maybe you are feeling stagnant in your Bible reading.

473
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:26,900
 Maybe there were a lot of guilt that you carried when you read the Bible and you don't like

474
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:30,020
 reading it and there's a lot of burden that you've put on yourself.

475
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,660
 And I'd just like to pray for you.

476
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:38,340
 I'd like to pray for us to meet God afresh, to cast all the burdens on Him and just come

477
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:42,160
 to enjoy His Word with us together.

478
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,340
 So let us pray.

479
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:51,300
 Dear Heavenly Father, we thank You that You reveal Yourself to us through Your Word.

480
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:55,420
 We thank You that we're able to encounter You through the Scriptures that You have given

481
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,520
 us.

482
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:01,900
 We also cry out to You that there are times when we don't understand You, when it's been

483
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:06,360
 a struggle to read Your Word and there are burdens that comes along with it when I don't

484
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,180
 understand what You are talking about.

485
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:14,940
 And so we pray, we pray that this is not your heart to have guilt and burden when reading

486
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:21,540
 Your Word, that through Your power, help us to cast these worries and burden aside and

487
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:26,780
 help us to enjoy just spending time with You, reading about You.

488
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,260
 You tell us that You are love.

489
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:34,140
 You tell us that through Your Word that You come to save, that through Your Word that's

490
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:38,060
 redemption and peace and life.

491
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:40,700
 And we just want to come to You afresh today.

492
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,780
 We want to seek You through Your Word.

493
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:48,340
 We are not satisfied with how we are reading, but we want to go deeper and read more about

494
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,060
 who You are.

495
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:53,940
 And so God, please come and speak to us through Your Word.

00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:56,460
 Come and let us encounter You afresh.

497
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:03,420
 We want to know who You really are, who You really, really are.

498
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:08,060
 Thank You God that You love us and You meet us where we are at.

499
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:15,660
 Thank You God even though we don't understand, You still come up to show us who You are.

500
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:19,780
 Thank You that You give us Your Word.

501
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,860
 In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

502
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:22,360
 Amen.

503
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:22,860
