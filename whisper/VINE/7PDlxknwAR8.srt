00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,320
 Well, welcome to The Vine.

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:02,920
 Welcome, if you're joining us online,

3
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,960
 a big welcome to you as well.

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,880
 We are in week two of our sermon series in James.

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,880
 If you haven't caught up with last week,

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,800
 because we had the typhoon,

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,080
 the messages up online,

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,980
 Pastor Philip gave a wonderful, beautiful message

9
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,040
 to start us off in this series.

10
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,480
 And so if you haven't checked that out yet,

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,720
 I highly encourage you to do so,

12
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,160
 and so we can continue on our journey today.

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,240
 So James chapter two, if you have a Bible,

14
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,880
 you can keep that open.

15
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,640
 We're gonna be reading through the passage together.

16
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,280
 So one thing I figured out about myself

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,160
 is that people have a hard time

18
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,320
 sort of placing where I'm from.

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,240
 Right, so for example,

20
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,000
 and I just got back from visiting my wife's family

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,200
 in Northeast Texas, small town there,

22
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,880
 but every time I'm there,

23
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,600
 inevitably people mistake me for being Mexican, right?

24
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,500
 'Cause there's not very many Asian people there, right?

25
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,280
 And because of my complexion, I tan very, very easily.

26
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,040
 In fact, let me show you a picture right now, okay?

27
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,080
 So take a look at this picture, okay?

28
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,680
 Can you tell me what that is?

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,080
 Right, so that is my arm next to my wife's arm, okay?

30
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,000
 This is after, yeah, right?

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,360
 This is a Stevie Wonder song in a picture, okay?

32
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,340
 Like, it's incredible, okay?

33
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,480
 I just tan very, very easily,

34
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,320
 and my wife is very white, okay?

35
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,100
 But that's just, you know, that's what happens to me

36
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,160
 when I spend some time in the sun, okay?

37
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,000
 I get dark, and people have a hard time

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,440
 placing where I am, right?

39
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,280
 So in Texas, right, in Brittany's hometown, I am Mexican,

40
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,640
 okay, look like Jorge, sound like George, okay?

41
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,360
 So it's like my accent throws people off completely.

42
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,160
 They don't have a clue where I'm from.

43
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,680
 But often here in Hong Kong, too,

44
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,560
 I get mistaken for different ethnicities, nationalities,

45
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,400
 right, people never think I'm Chinese,

46
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,900
 and I know this because when they come and talk to me,

47
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,720
 they always start a conversation in English.

48
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,480
 And so, you know, people think I'm Filipino,

49
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,720
 they think I'm Nepalese or Thai,

50
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,080
 Indonesian, Malaysian, anything else.

51
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,680
 And so it's sort of like a superpower for me, I guess.

52
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,320
 So I can be all things to all people, right?

53
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,320
 Amen, yes, so.

54
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,900
 Actually, this comes in super handy,

55
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,320
 especially when I'm on holiday in Southeast Asia.

56
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,440
 So this one time I was in Thailand on holiday in Hua Hin,

57
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,840
 and I decided to go and check out

58
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,160
 some local kickboxing matches, you know,

59
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,380
 UFC and kickboxing, wrestling,

60
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,300
 I love all that kind of stuff.

61
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,200
 So I go downtown to Hua Hin, I'm dressed like a local,

62
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,080
 so you know, flip flops, faded jeans, faded t-shirt,

63
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,840
 and everyone thinks I'm, I sit down,

64
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,480
 you know, people talk to me in Thai,

65
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,220
 I try to order the food in Thai,

66
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,440
 you know, just very minimal conversation,

67
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,580
 and I'm trying to get by as a local.

68
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,500
 And so when I get down to the kickboxing stadium,

69
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,540
 you notice this, I notice there's two lines,

70
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,380
 one for foreigners and one for locals, right?

71
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,940
 If you go through the foreigner line,

72
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,460
 first of all, it's more expensive,

73
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,340
 and the seats are like up in the bleachers,

74
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,240
 you know, you're away from all the action.

75
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,500
 But if you go to the locals line, it's cheaper to get in,

76
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,180
 and plus, like, you're like right there

77
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,380
 in the pit around the ring, like ringside seats.

78
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,180
 And so I look, people up there seem very, you know,

79
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,380
 conservative and boring, just sitting there.

80
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,900
 Down at the pit, you know, people were like shouting,

81
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,660
 and like, you know, the fighters were hanging out there,

82
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,860
 it just seemed like a more fun place to be.

83
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,260
 So I thought, okay, I'm gonna try, okay,

84
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,220
 I'm gonna go into the local line and see what happens.

85
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,380
 So, you know, I just stand back,

86
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,860
 observe what people are doing, and then that's what I do,

87
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,500
 right, I get my money ready, you know,

88
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,860
 go, don't say much, just give them the exact money,

89
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,740
 and I let get into the local line.

90
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,180
 Nobody questions me about who I am, right?

91
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,700
 And it was amazing, right?

92
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,140
 The atmosphere in there was so loud,

93
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,220
 people shouting, all sorts of things, you know,

94
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,940
 so every time someone would shout something,

95
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,980
 I would just shout the same thing, right?

96
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,240
 Probably curse words or whatever it was I was shouting,

97
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,180
 people taking bets, I was throwing money around,

98
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,820
 I had no idea what was going on,

99
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,500
 but I had the best time of my life, right?

100
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,300
 So exciting being there.

101
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,040
 But then the fights were over.

102
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,900
 And I left the stadium, and I was just back

103
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,020
 to being normal Ellison again, right?

104
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,260
 I was never a Thai local, I just looked the part

105
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,200
 for a moment.

106
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,420
 And so this made me wonder, right,

107
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,720
 does this happen with our relationship,

108
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,600
 with our dedication and our faith in Jesus?

109
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,920
 Most of us in this room today,

110
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,480
 most of us watching online would probably profess

111
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,120
 with our mouth that Jesus is our Lord and Savior.

112
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,080
 Most of us would say we have a faith in Jesus.

113
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,720
 If you remember what Philip talked about last week,

114
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,720
 he was talking about people asking him and his child

115
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,920
 what religion they are, right?

116
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,920
 If people ask you what religion are you,

117
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,360
 you would probably say, well yes, I'm a Christian.

118
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,720
 Right, and we gather together,

119
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,540
 and we all know how to look the part,

120
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,300
 especially in an environment like this, right,

121
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,640
 where we're singing and praising, we can lift our hands,

122
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,640
 we can kneel down on the floor, right?

123
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,920
 If you've been in church for a while,

124
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,840
 you probably know how to speak Christianese, right?

125
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,300
 All these things on the outside we can present

126
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,800
 as a person who looks like they have

127
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,120
 a dedicated faith to Jesus.

128
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,680
 But throughout the book of James,

129
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,920
 one of the key things we're gonna try to be figuring out

130
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,920
 is how pure our religion is.

131
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,700
 In other words, how do I know

132
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,820
 if we really have a faith in Jesus?

133
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,180
 How do you know your faith is genuine?

134
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,300
 And even if I was to ask this more directly,

135
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,460
 does the faith you profess match up

136
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,680
 with the way we live our life?

137
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,060
 Do we have the kind of faith that God is looking for?

138
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,560
 And if so, what are some of the hallmarks

139
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,040
 that genuine faith in Jesus looks like?

140
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,580
 As we walk through the book of James,

141
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,960
 you're gonna figure out this is the kind of faith

142
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,580
 that doesn't get tossed and turned around

143
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,740
 with the trials of life.

144
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,620
 It's a faith that's completely counter-cultural

145
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,100
 to the ways of this world.

146
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:01,900
 It's a kind of faith that is accompanied with action.

147
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,980
 So like I said, James chapter two,

148
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,620
 we're gonna open it up, this is what it says.

149
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,940
 My brothers and sisters,

150
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,260
 believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ

151
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,780
 must not show favoritism.

152
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,480
 Suppose a man comes into your meeting

153
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,340
 wearing a gold ring and fine clothes,

154
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:23,040
 and a poor man in filthy old clothes also comes in.

155
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,700
 If you show special attention

156
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,100
 to the man you're wearing fine clothes,

157
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,180
 say, "Here's a good seat for you,"

158
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,420
 but say to the poor man, "You stand there

159
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,940
 "or sit on the floor by my feet."

160
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,260
 Have you not discriminated among yourselves

161
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,160
 and become judges with evil thoughts?

162
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,860
 So one of the first things James is trying to address

163
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,420
 in this part of his letter

164
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,620
 is something called favoritism.

165
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,280
 Now, this isn't saying that as people of faith,

166
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,980
 you can't have certain preferences at all.

167
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,940
 Like for example, if you like strawberry ice cream

168
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,180
 instead of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream,

169
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,700
 I'd say you're a crazy person,

170
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,280
 but go ahead, right, get strawberry

171
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,300
 if you think that's better, right?

172
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,460
 This is not what it's talking about.

173
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,860
 What James is talking about

174
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,320
 is a toxic, evil kind of favoritism.

175
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:13,900
 Favoritism that is rooted in injustice and discrimination.

176
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,700
 Favoritism that judges people

177
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:20,320
 by worldly standards and values.

178
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,060
 And unfortunately, the scenario James is talking about

179
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,440
 happens all the time in this city in Hong Kong.

180
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,180
 I'm talking about people being judged

181
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,140
 by their economic status.

182
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:34,580
 There is a disparity in the city

183
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,160
 between the rich and the poor,

184
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,880
 and it's very clearly seen as we go about everyday life.

185
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:44,000
 We have in Hong Kong the largest wealth inequality

186
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,840
 in the world.

187
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,360
 Consistently, this is something

188
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,500
 we shouldn't be proud about, right?

189
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,120
 This is one of the top three most expensive places to live.

190
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,280
 Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney, places like that.

191
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,640
 In Hong Kong, it's (speaking in foreign language)

192
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,280
 If you're rich, you can have it all.

193
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,560
 It's often the rich that get the honor and the privileges.

194
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,720
 It's often the rich get special treatment

195
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:10,360
 and recognition, and meanwhile, the poor are overlooked.

196
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,320
 The poor have to eke out a living

197
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,520
 in the world's most expensive city,

198
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,160
 cram their families into these tiny, subdivided flats,

199
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,200
 not being able to afford the many things

200
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,760
 that we might take for granted.

201
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,640
 But the truth is, and this is not a small part

202
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,640
 of our population, 1.39, 1.4 million people

203
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,360
 in Hong Kong live below the poverty line.

204
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,760
 How's this for a statistic?

205
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,800
 Oxfam in 2024 found that the median monthly income

206
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,760
 for the poorest 10% of households was only $1,600,

207
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,480
 $1,600 per month, and this was a drop

208
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,520
 from before the pandemic, okay?

209
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,360
 In contrast, the wealthiest 10% of households

210
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,360
 have a median income of $131,000.

211
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,960
 This is a rise in 10% from 2019.

212
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,320
 The rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer,

213
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:14,320
 a disparity of almost 90 times between these two groups.

214
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,520
 Now, I felt the sting of this firsthand somewhat.

215
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,240
 When I was a teenager, my mom would make me

216
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,920
 do all sorts of jobs, right?

217
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,840
 So I've worked at all kinds of, I've delivered food

218
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,160
 on the street in Central, I've worked at a carnival,

219
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,600
 I've worked at a doctor's office,

220
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,720
 there's a receptionist, all these kind of jobs.

221
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,800
 Her idea was to expose me to the different ways

222
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,280
 that people live from my relatively sheltered

223
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,040
 and comfortable life that I had,

224
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,520
 so all kinds of summer jobs.

225
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,800
 And one of the summers, I found myself working

226
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,280
 at a warehouse in Kwun Tong.

227
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,960
 Now, I got the job there because my uncle

228
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,280
 was the manager of the warehouse, my dad's older brother,

229
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,040
 right, and so, and this is the kind of place

230
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,040
 where all your sort of dry goods at the supermarket

231
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,000
 sort of sit there before they get shipped off

232
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,840
 to the park and shops and welcomes and all that stuff.

233
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:06,880
 So I'm talking about like toothpaste, toilet paper,

234
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,360
 bleach, cleaning products, all that kind of stuff

235
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,440
 is put in these warehouses, and my job was to pull them off

236
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,800
 these shelves, put them into boxes ready for them

237
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,680
 to be shipped to the different locations, right?

238
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,460
 And it was dusty, it was dirty, it was hot.

239
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:25,480
 My salary was 25 Hong Kong dollars an hour, okay?

240
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,080
 $25 an hour, this is about the year 2000,

241
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,520
 something like that.

242
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,800
 Now, for me, I was just doing it

243
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,840
 as some sort of an experience.

244
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,200
 But I worked with two lovely old ladies

245
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,800
 who would sit there with me, and I was climbing up,

246
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,000
 then they were packing the stuff.

247
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,320
 But they were doing this for a living, all right?

248
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,140
 25 Hong Kong dollars to survive in Hong Kong.

249
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:52,080
 And yet, they were some of the most generous people

250
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,920
 I've ever met.

251
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,160
 Every now and then, they would take me out for lunch, right?

252
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,880
 This meant going down to the canteen downstairs

253
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,080
 where a meal was like 25 to like $40.

254
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,560
 So they were spending 40, as much as I insisted,

255
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,880
 I don't need this, 40% of their daily income

256
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,760
 to buy me lunch, living on $25 an hour.

257
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,400
 They had no idea that my uncle was their boss, right?

258
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,360
 They were just doing it because they loved

259
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,160
 and they cared because that was their heart.

260
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,000
 Now, in the same building, there were the corporate offices

261
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 on the upper floors, right?

262
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,640
 This space was cool and air conditioned, right?

263
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,560
 People wore suits and leather shoes,

264
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,440
 making much more than $25 an hour.

265
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,920
 So I remember, true story, one time I needed to go up

266
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,040
 to the office floor to collect something, right?

267
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,720
 I was all dirty and stinky from working in the warehouse.

268
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,200
 I needed a drink of water, so there's a water cooler

269
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,120
 right there, so I went to get a drink of water,

270
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,680
 only to be stopped by a member of staff there

271
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,000
 and said, "Hey, don't do that.

272
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,860
 "Warehouse workers aren't allowed here.

273
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,800
 "If you need a drink, you need to go back downstairs.

274
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,560
 "You're getting everything all dirty up here.

275
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,720
 "Don't stay up here."

276
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,680
 The way I wanted to say, "Do you know who my uncle is?"

277
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,080
 Okay, like I didn't, okay, so, right,

278
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,760
 don't do that either.

279
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,240
 But stuff like that happens all the time in this city, right?

280
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,280
 I'm not sure, I'm sure I'm not the only one

281
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,840
 who has encountered this.

282
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,000
 If there ever was a city where the poor and the rich

283
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,040
 live right next to each other,

284
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,220
 yet are treated very differently,

285
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,680
 it's right here in Hong Kong.

286
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,380
 Being rich gets you preferential treatment,

287
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:32,120
 and it so happens that back then,

288
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,060
 in the time of James, it was the same thing.

289
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,840
 2,000 years, not much has changed.

290
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,500
 Now, the question for us is,

291
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,260
 would we let this happen in our church?

292
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,620
 On a more personal level,

293
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,380
 would you react this way yourself?

294
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,900
 And James tells us in this letter

295
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,280
 that if we find ourselves being inclined

296
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,700
 to treat the rich with special attention,

297
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,620
 but look down on the poor, this is discriminatory.

298
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,020
 It's judgmental, and it's evil

299
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,880
 because it goes against the very heart of God.

300
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,880
 Now, of course, it's tempting to act in this way.

301
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,940
 We like to cozy up to the rich and the powerful

302
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:20,580
 because of the benefits that it might have upon us.

303
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,620
 We honor them in hopes that they will give us

304
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,140
 some of their money and their wealth.

305
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,340
 We do it out of the way for them

306
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,340
 because maybe one day, they're gonna help us back.

307
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,460
 You scratch my back, I scratch yours,

308
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,260
 that sort of mentality.

309
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:36,420
 But what can a poor person offer us?

310
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,540
 They're just gonna drain our resources,

311
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,080
 drain our time, there is no benefit

312
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,560
 when we pay special attention to them.

313
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,820
 Now, listen, church, this might be the way the world works,

314
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:53,820
 but it is ungodly and incompatible with our faith

315
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,140
 as Christians for us to act this way.

316
00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:02,340
 It's evil because it goes against God's heart.

317
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,500
 And as we look through scripture,

318
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,180
 God's heart has always been to side himself

319
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,580
 with the poor and the needy.

320
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,380
 Think about the way Jesus entered into this world.

321
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:15,540
 He didn't come in might, in pomp, in splendor.

322
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:20,500
 He could have, but instead he came humbly, meek,

323
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,900
 with nothing, nothing that we look upon

324
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,640
 that we could desire, physically speaking.

325
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,500
 He chose to identify with the poor

326
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,200
 as he came into this world.

327
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,060
 2 Corinthians 2:9 tells us that though Jesus was rich,

328
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,360
 yet for your sake, he became poor.

329
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,180
 And so how God calls us as a people of faith

330
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:46,180
 to work as opposites of how the world works.

331
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,300
 He tells us that it is the poor

332
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,660
 that we should pay attention to.

333
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,680
 It is the poor that we should open our hands wide to,

334
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,800
 Deuteronomy 15, 11.

335
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,600
 It is the poor that we should be inviting

336
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,620
 to our dinners and our banquets.

337
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,740
 That's in the book of Luke.

338
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,680
 It is the poor that the weak,

339
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,340
 that we must work hard to help.

340
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,900
 Or the poor and the weak that we must work hard to help,

341
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,400
 Acts 20.

342
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,260
 It is the poor that we are called to sell everything

343
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,300
 and give it to them, Matthew 19.

344
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,100
 And this beautifully is summarized

345
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:22,300
 in what James calls in his letter, the royal law.

346
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,980
 It is the royal law because he got this

347
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:28,240
 from his brother, Jesus himself, who is the king of kings.

348
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,260
 It's what Jesus called as part of the greatest commandment.

349
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:36,260
 You are to love your neighbor as yourself.

350
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:39,700
 And our neighbor's church are the needy,

351
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,300
 the widows, the orphans, the poor.

352
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:47,420
 A genuine faith in Jesus will never show favoritism

353
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:51,180
 to the rich in expense of the poor.

354
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,300
 A genuine faith in Jesus will always take action

355
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,940
 and be the hands and feet that he has called us to be.

356
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:01,260
 And by the way, favoritism and discrimination

357
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,220
 isn't just about rich and poor.

358
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,700
 Any form of discrimination and favoritism

359
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:10,540
 that dishonors people is a dishonor and an insult to God

360
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,520
 because we have been made in his image.

361
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:19,100
 But James is using the rich and the poor here as an example.

362
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,300
 And to really drive this point home,

363
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,900
 he goes on to deliver one of the hardest hitting,

364
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,780
 maybe one of the most controversial and challenging passages

365
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,060
 in the whole of scripture.

366
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,960
 He tells us this.

367
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,540
 What good is it, my brothers and sisters,

368
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,740
 if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds?

369
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,480
 Can such faith save them?

370
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,140
 Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes

371
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,200
 and daily food.

372
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,540
 If one of you says to them,

373
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,900
 "Go in peace, keep warm and well fed,"

374
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,340
 but does nothing about their physical needs,

375
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,020
 what good is it?

376
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:55,080
 In the same way, faith by itself,

377
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:59,420
 if it's not accompanied by action, is dead.

378
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:02,520
 Now I say this is controversial

379
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,180
 because it seems to contradict what we love about our faith.

380
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:11,180
 Our faith tells us that Jesus loves us no matter what

381
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:14,420
 and that there's nothing more that we can do

382
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,860
 to make him love us.

383
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,500
 We say that salvation is a free gift, right?

384
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,620
 It's salvation, grace and forgiveness.

385
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,360
 It's a free gift of God.

386
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,540
 There is nothing we can do to earn that kind of love

387
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,120
 that God has for us.

388
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:32,500
 And I would say yes and amen to these statements.

389
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,820
 But it seems as though right now,

390
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,440
 James is saying that there are certain things,

391
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,280
 actually, you do have to do for our faith.

392
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,500
 That faith alone is not enough.

393
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:46,040
 And I would say the answer to that question is also yes.

394
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,460
 Because remember the point we're trying to answer,

395
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,240
 with the point we made at the beginning,

396
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,860
 the point Philip pointed us towards last week.

397
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:56,380
 We are trying to determine whether our faith is real.

398
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:00,160
 We are trying to figure out what this pure religion is.

399
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,160
 And pure religion, real faith has to be backed up by action.

400
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,420
 Now don't get me wrong, okay?

401
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,740
 I'm not saying that your actions are going to save you.

402
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,300
 That's not the point, that's bad theology.

403
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,580
 This isn't what James is trying to say either.

404
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,060
 But what we're trying to say

405
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,660
 is that those who truly follow Jesus

406
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:24,140
 will always be able to show you in some way

407
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,980
 that the faith is real.

408
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,720
 Genuine faith has real deeds behind it.

409
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,740
 Right, this is how, when I was doing some research,

410
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,820
 this is how one of the commentaries put it.

411
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:38,540
 James is not arguing that works must be added to faith.

412
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,940
 His point, rather, is that genuine biblical faith

413
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:46,580
 will inevitably be characterized by works.

414
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,220
 These are hard-hitting questions,

415
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,900
 but we need to get to the bottom of it

416
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:55,760
 because our entire relationship with Jesus is on the line.

417
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,140
 James asks us, what good is it, my brothers,

418
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,940
 if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds?

419
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,460
 Can such faith save them?

420
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,040
 Let's answer these questions.

421
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,760
 Notice first that James says claims.

422
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,020
 Now look, just because we claim something,

423
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,140
 it doesn't always mean it's true.

424
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,940
 People make all sorts of wild claims,

425
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,860
 but if we believed everything that everyone said,

426
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,320
 we would be fools.

427
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,500
 I could tell you that LeBron James and I,

428
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,300
 we have the same basketball skills, okay?

429
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,660
 What he can do on the court, I can do too.

430
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,260
 I can do a slam dunk and shoot threes.

431
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,780
 I can do all that kind of stuff, right?

432
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,400
 You would rightly say, okay, prove it, right?

433
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,860
 There's a court right down there next to the MTR station.

434
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,740
 Bring a basketball, show me your skills.

435
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,340
 And it's the same thing when it comes to our faith.

436
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,020
 If someone claims to have a faith in Jesus,

437
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:47,720
 they should be able to show you evidence of their faith.

438
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,980
 Otherwise, how will we know

439
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,140
 that what they're saying is true?

440
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,620
 We can't unless we see their faith in action.

441
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:59,340
 And the second part of that question is even a bit scarier.

442
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:03,140
 Like I said, these things have eternal consequences.

443
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:08,060
 One of the main motivations that people have

444
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:11,100
 in the journey of faith and becoming a Christian

445
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,900
 is because they want some sort of assurance of salvation.

446
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,020
 They want to know that after they die,

447
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,920
 they're not gonna end up in some horrible place called hell,

448
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,500
 but rather live out all of eternity in heaven

449
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,000
 where there's joy and bliss

450
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,140
 and all the nice, wonderful things you can think of.

451
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:32,780
 Now, going to heaven, being in the kingdom of God

452
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,860
 for all eternity after we die,

453
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:38,420
 salvation, eternal life is a promise

454
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,060
 and a reward from Jesus.

455
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:45,860
 But only for those who have a real and genuine faith

456
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:50,660
 that demonstrates real acts of service and love

457
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,060
 to those around us.

458
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,900
 So the answer to the question is no.

459
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,680
 A faith that does not live itself out with deeds

460
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:03,020
 is not the kind of faith that leads to salvation.

461
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:07,360
 James makes it even clearer for us.

462
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,200
 He gives another scenario for us to imagine.

463
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,880
 He says, suppose a brother or sister

464
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,000
 is without clothes or daily food.

465
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,800
 If one of you says to them, go in peace,

466
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,320
 keep warm and well-fed,

467
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:23,140
 but does nothing about their physical needs,

468
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,120
 what good is it?

469
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,060
 It's not a complicated question.

470
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,200
 The answer is simple.

471
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,100
 The Cantonese translation for this type of situation

472
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,680
 is [speaks in foreign language]

473
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,140
 It's kind of like an insult we use in Cantonese.

474
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,260
 If you see someone in need but you don't help them,

475
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:47,900
 it's like a pitiful, shameful thing to do.

476
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,400
 So what good is it, asks James.

477
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,480
 The answer is it's no good.

478
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,120
 Faith that is not accompanied by action

479
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,960
 is a dead kind of faith.

480
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,360
 It's no good just to give people your words and well wishes

481
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,740
 when the needs that they have are right in front of you.

482
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,840
 It's interesting because this kind of behavior

483
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,840
 sort of makes sense.

484
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,360
 If you follow on from what James was talking about before,

485
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,800
 well, if we're only showing favoritism to the rich

486
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,320
 and the powerful and the wealthy,

487
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,120
 well, they don't really need anything,

488
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,940
 and so there's nothing really we can do for them,

489
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,660
 and so when the needs of the poor are presented to us,

490
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,700
 we too are inclined to do nothing

491
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,860
 'cause it doesn't benefit us.

492
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:27,860
 There's nothing in it for us.

493
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,580
 But at the same time, of course, now, we're not monsters,

494
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,140
 and so let's give them a prayer.

495
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,460
 We don't wanna totally ignore them.

496
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,500
 Let's scratch that itch on our conscience

497
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,540
 and give them our well wishes and send them on their way.

498
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,220
 At least we did something, right?

499
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,280
 I've been asking myself, and I ask you, church,

500
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,340
 is that what Jesus would do?

501
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:53,560
 Does that reflect God's heart for his children?

502
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:58,140
 And in preparing the message series in James

503
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,740
 and in working with our team,

504
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:02,540
 I went through and I'm currently going through

505
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:05,820
 a lot of wrestling when it comes to this message

506
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,060
 because if I'm honest, quite often,

507
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,820
 when it comes to a situation like this,

508
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,500
 I feel like my reaction doesn't always reflect

509
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,740
 the faith that I claim.

510
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,680
 When there's physical needs in front of me

511
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:22,600
 that are to be met, sometimes I panic, I shrink back,

512
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,680
 I don't want to do anything about it.

513
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,640
 And I make excuses.

514
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,440
 Oh, well, you know, if I help them now,

515
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,180
 I'm gonna be stuck helping them forever.

516
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,780
 I don't have the time and the resources for that.

517
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,580
 Or you say, is it really gonna help that much

518
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,360
 if I just do this right now?

519
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,100
 It doesn't really help them in the long run,

520
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,660
 so maybe it's better for me not to get involved.

521
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,200
 Or maybe, you know, like you say,

522
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,140
 I've already prayed for them, right?

523
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,800
 God can do immeasurably more than I can do,

524
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,500
 so I've already prayed for them.

525
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,420
 I'll leave it in God's powerful hands

526
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,940
 and he'll take care of it.

527
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,820
 And then I start to feel guilty and ashamed

528
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,820
 because I knew I was supposed to do

529
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,300
 and I didn't do anything about it

530
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,780
 and it all gets super overwhelming

531
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:05,440
 and anxiety starts to set in and all this kind of stuff.

532
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,100
 Maybe you can relate to this too.

533
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,980
 And I'm working on it, okay?

534
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,140
 And this is how I try to resolve it

535
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,340
 and figure it out.

536
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,220
 And I'm just being honest and real with you here.

537
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,540
 I don't have the answer to really,

538
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,940
 haven't got it all figured out yet,

539
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:23,500
 but this is what I feel like God is leading me to

540
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,060
 in situations like this.

541
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:30,420
 So like I said, as people who possess faith in Jesus,

542
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,260
 if we ever come across a situation

543
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,700
 where we can meet an obvious physical need,

544
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,720
 like if we're taking the words of James literally here,

545
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,800
 something immediate that we, tangible that we can do,

546
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,720
 then we have to respond.

547
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,980
 We must respond.

548
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:49,080
 So for example, one thing that I personally try to practice

549
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,060
 as much as possible, when I see someone on the street

550
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,940
 that's homeless or sleeping rough,

551
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,960
 someone asking for money, I will stop and ask,

552
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,880
 can I get you something to eat?

553
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,540
 Are you hungry?

554
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,200
 And if the answer is yes,

555
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,900
 okay, then I go and get them something to eat, right?

556
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,620
 Go and get a fine hot from down the road,

557
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:09,660
 go to 7-Eleven, get some snacks, whatever, okay?

558
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:12,440
 If I see an elderly lady, often it is a lady, right,

559
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,880
 pushing those heavy carts down the street,

560
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,720
 I will stop her and say, hey, where are you going?

561
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,320
 Down to the collection point,

562
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,240
 let me push it the rest of the way.

563
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,920
 You take a rest and I'll push it for you, okay?

564
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,100
 Take a break, it's hot, it's sweaty,

565
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,360
 I can do this much easier, right?

566
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,920
 Now, 10, 15 minutes out of my day,

567
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,320
 but that should be okay, right?

568
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,080
 It's always the right time to do the right thing.

569
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,280
 At the same time, I've also had to learn

570
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,520
 to let go of the idea that I have to solve

571
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,400
 all their problems.

572
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,120
 I don't think that's the point either.

573
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,840
 Also, that's impossible, right?

574
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,400
 I'm just a man, right?

575
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,280
 I'm nobody, I'm just a man, I'm not the savior.

576
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,560
 Jesus is the savior and ultimately, of course,

577
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,280
 we want to point people towards them,

578
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,080
 but I don't want to do nothing.

579
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:06,240
 I'm not content with just to leave them

580
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,040
 with my thoughts and my prayers.

581
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,760
 In that moment, in that space,

582
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,760
 I've done as much as I could.

583
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,400
 I've tried my best to show them Jesus' love,

584
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,720
 I've responded in obedience with some sort of action,

585
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,120
 and I try to be at peace with that.

586
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,400
 And I think this is what Jesus is expecting

587
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,040
 of his followers.

588
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,180
 He knows we can't do everything.

589
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:30,520
 He is the savior and his call ultimately

590
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,160
 is for us to bring people to him

591
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,520
 and he is indeed able to do all,

592
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,860
 more than we ask or imagine.

593
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,460
 But he's also looking for people

594
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,680
 who are willing to take action.

595
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,400
 And if you want to be very clear about this,

596
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,600
 Matthew 25 lays it down so clearly.

597
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,180
 He says this, "For when I was hungry,

598
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:53,040
 you gave me something to eat.

599
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,440
 I was thirsty, you gave me something to drink.

600
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,720
 I was a stranger and you invited me in.

601
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,480
 I needed clothes and you clothed me.

602
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,200
 I was sick and you looked after me.

603
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,400
 I was in prison and you came to visit me."

604
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,360
 Jesus tells us that whenever we care

605
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,280
 for the least of our brothers and sisters

606
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,720
 in these sort of situations,

607
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,900
 we are doing it for him.

608
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,920
 These are the people who get to enjoy

609
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,660
 the inheritance and the kingdom of eternal life.

610
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:22,100
 But he also gives us a sobering warning

611
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,960
 for those who ignore these needs.

612
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:28,260
 When he was hungry and we gave him nothing to eat,

613
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,720
 we were thirsty and we gave him nothing to drink,

614
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,820
 he was a stranger and we don't invite them in,

615
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,580
 they needed clothes and you did not clothe me.

616
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:39,220
 I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.

617
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,440
 Jesus tells us that those who fail to respond

618
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,900
 in love and compassion but yet claim to know him

619
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,900
 are not just ignoring people, they're ignoring him.

620
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:50,580
 Whatever you did not do for one of the least of these,

621
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:53,800
 you did not do for me and the consequences

622
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,820
 are eternal fire and punishment.

623
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:02,580
 Now, let's remember the main point

624
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,300
 of what Jesus is trying to say.

625
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:08,580
 How do we know that our faith is genuine?

626
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,700
 A faith that leads to salvation,

627
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:14,100
 a faith that matches up with what we profess

628
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,580
 with our mouth.

629
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,380
 But because both these groups of people

630
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:22,380
 claim to know Jesus but only one is accepted

631
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:25,220
 and welcomed into his kingdom.

632
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:32,360
 It's not just believing in Jesus that counts as faith.

633
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,960
 Right, James goes on to say, right,

634
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,440
 you believe that there is one God, good.

635
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,960
 Even the demons believe that and shudder.

636
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,440
 Just let that sink in for a moment, church.

637
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,760
 I mean, it is a brutally honest reflection

638
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,080
 that we're looking at today, I get it, okay?

639
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:53,200
 But if a faith is just words, James is telling us

640
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,560
 that your faith is no different from the faith

641
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,480
 that demons have.

642
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,280
 And we see this all the time in scripture

643
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,160
 as Jesus is casting out demons, right,

644
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,760
 the demons are declaring, yes, this is the savior,

645
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,600
 this is the Messiah.

646
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,520
 Jesus has to actually say, don't tell anyone about this,

647
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,280
 okay, because they even know who he is.

648
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:14,360
 Now, wouldn't it be a shame if a group of Christians

649
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:18,360
 that profess faith in Jesus to have the same kind of faith

650
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,320
 that demons have?

651
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,880
 Demons that are actively trying to do everything they can

652
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,020
 to distract people from the Lord?

653
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:29,920
 Demons who are losers, who have already lost the battle?

654
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,040
 We don't wanna be on that side, right, church?

655
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:38,040
 This is a call to embrace genuine faith,

656
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:44,500
 a faith of active, working obedience to Jesus.

657
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:48,080
 And yes, part of this is our concern

658
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,340
 for the poor and the needy,

659
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:54,820
 but it applies to every single part

660
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,300
 of how we live our lives.

661
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,320
 It's a life that's gonna take action and risk and sacrifice.

662
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:08,280
 And for example, James finishes

663
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:13,040
 with two contrasting characters, Abraham and Rahab,

664
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,960
 to let us know what God is expecting

665
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,760
 for those who follow him.

666
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,960
 Let's look at Abraham first.

667
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,880
 James writes, "Was not our father Abraham

668
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,040
 "considered righteous for what he did

669
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:27,000
 "when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?

670
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,160
 "You see that his faith and his actions

671
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,740
 "were working together, and his faith was made complete

672
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,960
 "by what he did.

673
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,460
 "And the scripture was fulfilled that says,

674
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,240
 "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him

675
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,180
 "as righteousness, and he was called God's friend.

676
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,680
 "You see that a person is considered righteous

677
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:48,440
 "by what they do and not by faith alone."

678
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,840
 If you recall the story of Abraham, right,

679
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,760
 what he called to do was absolutely wild.

680
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,280
 It was insane, right?

681
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:00,520
 Imagine you having to wait till you're 100 years old,

682
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,520
 right, before finally God gives you the thing

683
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,640
 that you've been hoping for,

684
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,120
 a son that's gonna finally, your true son,

685
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,760
 that finally is gonna pass down your bloodline,

686
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,800
 that through this son you're gonna have generations

687
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,960
 and generations, as many as stars in the sky,

688
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,920
 only for then God to say, here he is, give him back to me.

689
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,440
 Sacrifice him on the altar.

690
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,840
 Now what would you do?

691
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,520
 Now honestly, for me, I don't know.

692
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:33,600
 But Abraham had a faith that even if God asked him

693
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,880
 to do something that made no sense to him whatsoever,

694
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,980
 he would respond in obedience and do it anyway.

695
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,940
 I was trying to put myself in Abraham's shoes

696
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,520
 as I was preparing this, right?

697
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,440
 I have sons, two boys, right,

698
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,840
 and as ungentle as my parenting is sometimes, okay,

699
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,960
 I can't imagine the fear, the guilt,

700
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,080
 the gut-wrenching torture it must have been

701
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,760
 to take Isaac, bind him up, put him on the altar,

702
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,360
 to raise the knife, it was only at the final second

703
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,760
 before he plunged that knife into his son's heart

704
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,380
 that God said, stop, do not harm the child.

705
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:14,000
 Abraham put action behind his faith.

706
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,260
 And Rahab is the same.

707
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,760
 She translates her faith into action,

708
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,000
 even though it was super risky for her.

709
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,080
 She had no idea, if you know the story,

710
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,960
 if the spies would honor their word.

711
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,680
 But what she had heard about was this God

712
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,940
 that was able to part the Red Sea,

713
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:35,200
 that people were able to walk across dry land

714
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,920
 to be saved from slavery,

715
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,720
 that these people had a God behind them

716
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,240
 that was destroying all their enemies.

717
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,720
 She had only heard about these stories

718
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,040
 and she decided, I'm gonna put my faith in a God like that,

719
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:49,040
 not in these pagan gods that my family

720
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,560
 and my people have been worshiping,

721
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,520
 I'm gonna put my faith in this most high,

722
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,120
 living, powerful God.

723
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,800
 And she puts her faith in God and she hides the spies

724
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,400
 and she and her family are saved

725
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,820
 because she put her faith into action.

726
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:08,440
 Now on the surface,

727
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,000
 these two people couldn't be more different.

728
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,500
 We have a male and a female.

729
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,960
 We have the founding father of the Judeo-Christian faith

730
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,960
 and a Canaanite prostitute.

731
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,960
 And James does this on purpose.

732
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,280
 He does this because he's saying,

733
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,960
 it doesn't matter who you are,

734
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,120
 but this are the people that God is looking for,

735
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:32,400
 those who have an obedient, action-filled faith,

736
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,880
 faith expressing itself through love of God.

737
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,040
 So how about us?

738
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:44,880
 Are we willing to take risks for Jesus?

739
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,320
 Are we willing to put our faith into action?

740
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,800
 Are we willing to face danger

741
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,680
 to demonstrate our faith in Him?

742
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:57,880
 What has God been calling you to respond in obedience to?

743
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,980
 What has God been calling you into action?

744
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:06,120
 Translating belief into action,

745
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,560
 even when it seems impossible or downright dangerous,

746
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,060
 that is the faith that matters.

747
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:18,040
 Faith without deeds is dead.

748
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:21,320
 So having heard all of this,

749
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,880
 let me ask you one more time today.

750
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,740
 Is your faith genuine?

751
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:29,440
 Because let me tell you,

752
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,480
 if you're banking on the fact

753
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,560
 that you went to a rally one time or at youth camp,

754
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,920
 you said a little prayer,

755
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,680
 and maybe even you were baptized,

756
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,000
 and since then, your life hasn't changed,

757
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,880
 you haven't done anything to put your faith in Jesus,

758
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,080
 your actions haven't shown that you live a life

759
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,640
 that is obedient to Christ,

760
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,400
 your heart does not break for the things

761
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,360
 that break His heart,

762
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,600
 you're not engaged in looking after the poor

763
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,000
 and the marginalized,

764
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,260
 I'm sorry to tell you that's a dead kind of faith, church.

765
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:02,160
 But if we serve a risen and living God,

766
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,420
 a God that has come to give us life,

767
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,640
 Jesus loves you too much

768
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:11,000
 to let you keep going down that road.

769
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,620
 He loves you so much that He gave His life for you.

770
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:18,040
 Think about that for a moment.

771
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,520
 How did Jesus show His love for us?

772
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,260
 Not just by telling us with His words,

773
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,700
 as comforting and as beautiful as they are,

774
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,360
 but they're only comforting and beautiful

775
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,800
 because He put action behind His words.

776
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,040
 Right, Jesus stepped out of His throne in heaven,

777
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,960
 He lived among us, He healed us,

778
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,280
 He fed us, He served us,

779
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,760
 He washed our feet, He embraced us,

780
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:44,680
 He invites us, He spoke up for us,

781
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:48,000
 and ultimately He went to the cross to die for you,

782
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,320
 to show you His love.

783
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,480
 He put His love into action.

784
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,800
 And He loves you so much

785
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,680
 that He perfectly lived on this earth

786
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:02,660
 to tell us what an active faith looks like.

787
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:06,260
 He knows you too well to be content

788
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,880
 just to watch you waste your life

789
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,580
 by not putting your faith into action.

790
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,180
 And when Jesus comes back,

791
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:16,580
 He's looking for those who are truly faithful.

792
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,460
 Is this what He's going to find

793
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,940
 when He comes back for this church?

794
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:24,900
 Is this what He's gonna find when He looks at your life?

795
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:30,820
 So I'm gonna ask you to close your eyes for a moment, church,

796
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:33,420
 and just think about those things for a minute.

797
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:37,620
 I know it's been hard, and you know,

798
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:43,140
 we've been wrestling a lot with the book of James

799
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:46,840
 as we prepared this.

800
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:53,500
 And in this beautiful gathering of God's children

801
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,000
 who make up this community,

802
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,060
 and as God has called us into the uncharted,

803
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:04,000
 He's calling us into action.

804
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,500
 [congregation murmuring]

805
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:13,440
 And like I said, all this is rooted.

806
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,440
 This is not a guilt trip.

807
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:19,200
 This is not a bashing over your head.

808
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,260
 At least I hope not.

809
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:28,420
 But this is a reminder of the love that God had for you.

810
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:35,620
 This is a reminder of the potential that lives in you.

811
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:42,340
 That God, the plans that God in mind when He created you,

812
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:45,460
 when He knitted you together in your mother's womb,

813
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:50,880
 that He had a plan and a purpose for you to live out.

814
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:58,020
 And for sure, that's one that includes obedience to Him,

815
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,540
 of doing things in the sake of His name

816
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:06,240
 that you never thought you'd able to experience or see.

817
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,220
 But because you allowed God's love

818
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,580
 and power to work through you,

819
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,600
 you bring honor and praise to Him,

820
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,660
 and life to others by doing that.

821
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:23,260
 And like I said just now, Jesus loves us too much

822
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:26,780
 to let us just be content with this comfy,

823
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:29,980
 cozy Christianity that is so easy to embrace.

824
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,820
 (soft piano music)

825
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:38,700
 But rather, it's this life-changing,

826
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,620
 radical obedience to God

827
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:46,220
 that will bring salvation to you and those around us,

828
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:50,220
 that declares God's kingdom on earth as it is in heaven.

829
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:53,980
 And so, Jesus, we pray.

830
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:59,380
 If I could be so bold on praying

831
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,100
 on behalf of my brothers and sisters,

832
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:04,060
 that we would not be content just to have a faith

833
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:07,960
 that's based upon lip service,

834
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,620
 that's based upon a few songs

835
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,520
 that we might sing every now and then,

836
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:16,580
 but it's a life of obedience.

837
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:26,700
 It's a life that's constantly looking out for ways

838
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,580
 that we can show your love to others,

839
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,700
 no matter who they are,

840
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:34,100
 knowing as we saw in the video earlier,

841
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,140
 that your grace is sufficient for us,

842
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:41,300
 that even if it's the most challenging, mind-boggling,

843
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,080
 not-make-sense thing to this world

844
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,480
 that you've called us to do,

845
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,180
 that we will have the faith to put that into action

846
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,980
 and do it anyway, knowing you'll meet us where we are,

847
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,420
 that you'll never leave us abandoned,

848
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,540
 that you'll never leave us or forsake us,

849
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,620
 that we have a helper in the Holy Spirit.

850
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,620
 (gentle music)

851
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,020
 And we have the most high God

852
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:04,380
 who fights every battle on our behalf.

853
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:12,780
 So Jesus, make this our hearts, our lives.

854
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:18,420
 May we be your good and faithful servants,

855
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:22,100
 sons and daughters, as we live out our life in this world,

856
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:26,380
 truly worshiping you with everything we have.
