1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
 - Amen.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,760
 - Amen, thank you Carla.

3
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,380
 Good morning everybody.

4
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,120
 How are you guys doing?

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,420
 Good, well we are starting a brand new series

6
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,460
 and I wanna kick this off by telling you a story

7
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,140
 of, I think, when was it?

8
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,920
 July 3rd, 2018.

9
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,960
 I had this experience, this really big,

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,760
 life-changing, life-altering,

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,880
 hit me at my core kind of experience.

12
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,960
 An experience, an encounter actually,

13
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,160
 that has stayed with me every day,

14
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,620
 literally every day since.

15
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,400
 It has shaped who I am in so many ways.

16
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,520
 It has given me things to think about.

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,360
 It was unexpected, things didn't go according to plan,

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,320
 but it stuck with me.

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,480
 I wanna share with you about the time I had dinner

20
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,680
 with Pastor Jethro.

21
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,160
 Who's sitting over there?

22
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,680
 So let me tell you about Jethro.

23
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,040
 Back in 2018, I was new to the Vine.

24
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,160
 I'd been here for a few months maybe.

25
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,640
 I was a worship pastor and I was learning the ropes

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,160
 and trying to get to know everyone here.

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,060
 So Jethro was a core team member.

28
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,600
 He was like the best keyboard player on the team.

29
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,080
 And I'm like, I'm gonna get to know Jethro.

30
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,320
 I'm gonna learn some things about this team.

31
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,580
 So I ask him to dinner.

32
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,960
 And we're texting back and forth,

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,240
 like us young people do.

34
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,880
 And I'm like, yo Jeth, let's have dinner.

35
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,160
 He's like, all right, cool.

36
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,720
 Where do you wanna go?

37
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,200
 So this is my version of the story.

38
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,500
 You can fact check me later if Jethro says otherwise.

39
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,200
 But what happened was, I texted him.

40
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,340
 I'm like, LCK, okay?

41
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,760
 Now, if you spend all your time on Hong Kong Island,

42
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,740
 you don't know what LCK is.

43
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,000
 But if you ever go to Kowloon,

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,360
 LCK stands for Lai Chi Kok, right?

45
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,400
 That's where I used to live.

46
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,240
 That was my hood.

47
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,640
 All the CIS teachers are clapping

48
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,640
 'cause that's their hood as well.

49
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,420
 So I say, LCK, okay?

50
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,600
 And that was the last of kind of

51
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,480
 what I thought the conversation was.

52
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,060
 I don't know, about like 30, 45 minutes, an hour later,

53
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,880
 I get a message from Jethro and it says,

54
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,140
 I'm in Wan Chai.

55
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,200
 I'm like, what's wrong with Jethro, right?

56
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,200
 Like, I'm just getting to know him.

57
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,640
 I'm like, what's his issue?

58
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,760
 So I look at my phone and I'm like,

59
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,600
 why are you in Wan Chai?

60
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,400
 He goes, dinner, dot, dot, dot, question mark,

61
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,180
 with a little creepy eye emoji.

62
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,640
 So then I go back and I'm like,

63
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,200
 why does he think we're supposed to be in?

64
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,120
 So I go back to my messages.

65
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,680
 I'm like, about to call him out,

66
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,800
 be like, buddy, learn how to read.

67
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,760
 So I'm scrolling through and I'm like,

68
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,520
 oh no, I realized that I had been a victim of autocorrect.

69
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,600
 See, I had typed LCK, okay, right?

70
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,760
 So LCK, okay.

71
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,320
 What came out was, pick, P-I-C-K.

72
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,080
 So Jethro did that, he picked.

73
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,560
 And he picked Wan Chai.

74
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,480
 And I was in, and apparently I actually agreed to this.

75
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,640
 So he went back and read the messages

76
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,600
 and apparently I'm not thinking when I'm responding.

77
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,480
 He's like, yeah, yeah, sure, sure, sure, whatever.

78
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,200
 So I'd actually agreed to the thumbs up

79
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,400
 to coming to Wan Chai.

80
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,100
 And I'm standing in Lai Chi Kok MTR waiting for Jethro.

81
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,440
 He's in Wan Chai waiting for me.

82
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,840
 And Jethro, being the saint that he is,

83
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,400
 leaves Wan Chai and goes all the way to Lai Chi Kok.

84
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,480
 Let me explain, he was in Science Park up in Taipo,

85
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,120
 came all the way down to, oh, yes, feel bad for him.

86
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,360
 I'm a terrible friend, that's the moral of the story.

87
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,440
 But regardless, this has never left me

88
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,420
 because Jethro to this day still judges me for my typos,

89
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,540
 regularly coming at me about the typos that I have,

90
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,520
 whether it's in the WhatsApp message or in like an email,

91
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,240
 anything, he's always looking at my typos.

92
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,200
 It's the one thing he focuses on.

93
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,160
 To the point where my birthday was this past Thursday.

94
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,680
 I turn 34 and I'm excited and I get my first happy birthday

95
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,280
 and it's from my friend Jethro, which is great.

96
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,680
 But then online, so that everyone can see it,

97
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,640
 he posts this beautiful post.

98
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,400
 Thanks for coming into my life and staying into my life.

99
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,800
 But in that same post, he's like, I love you,

100
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,840
 typos and all.

101
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,280
 The shade, y'all.

102
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,480
 He just has not left me alone.

103
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,680
 This was not just an experience,

104
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,120
 it was an encounter with Jethro and with proofreading

105
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,520
 and with autocorrect.

106
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,720
 And let me just say, I have learned my lesson,

107
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,760
 or I try at least, I think I still have some typos

108
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,440
 here and there, but it stayed with me.

109
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,960
 I share this because it was more than an experience,

110
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,800
 it was an encounter, it's something that has,

111
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,760
 it has actually shaped me.

112
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,080
 I really do think about what I text and I do go back

113
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,720
 and if I'm meeting someone somewhere,

114
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,560
 I double check where it's at, right?

115
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,800
 It has stayed with me, it has shaped me in a certain way.

116
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,980
 And encounters do this to us all.

117
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,560
 When we have a big, meaningful encounter, it shapes us,

118
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,280
 it redirects us, it changes our perspective

119
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,360
 to some extent.

120
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,040
 And when we have encounters with God,

121
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,080
 well, that changes us even more.

122
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,200
 It seems like the impacts that come from an encounter

123
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,840
 with God somehow are more magnified.

124
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,400
 They are multiplied to a higher degree.

125
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,760
 When we have an encounter with God,

126
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,080
 it shapes our intimacy with him,

127
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,600
 it helps us to get to know him better.

128
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,860
 When we have an encounter with God,

129
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,240
 we get shaped and molded more into his likeness.

130
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,720
 We become more like him when we encounter him.

131
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,240
 And these encounters help us see God more clearly.

132
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,060
 These encounters help us shake lies

133
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,340
 that we once believed about ourselves.

134
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,800
 It helps us shake delusions and stand on truth.

135
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,160
 Encounters with God is important.

136
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,560
 It's very important 'cause the effects of an encounter

137
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,840
 with God can last with us for the rest of our lives.

138
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,880
 The effects of our encounters with God show us

139
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,960
 that we don't have to solely rely on ourselves to get by.

140
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,600
 It's not just us looking out for us.

141
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,920
 An encounter with God, God encounters us

142
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,960
 to show us that we are not alone in this

143
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,920
 and all that we do.

144
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,000
 So with this in mind,

145
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,760
 we've designed this five-week sermon series

146
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:33,760
 to look at five very familiar passages in the Old Testament,

147
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,760
 some key biblical figures that you might have heard of,

148
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,760
 might have read before, and their encounters,

149
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,000
 hoping that as we look and see the moments

150
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,640
 where God showed up, it would encourage us

151
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,960
 to allow God to show up in unexpected ways

152
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,480
 at unexpected times in our lives

153
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,160
 'cause it seems like when we allow those things to happen,

154
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,440
 we get changed at our core.

155
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,440
 I pray that it allows you to posture yourself

156
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,880
 as we study these encounters to become open

157
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,640
 to a holy disruption that will shake who you are

158
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,960
 to the core of who you are.

159
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,080
 Does that sound okay?

160
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,880
 So that's where we're gonna be going.

161
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,400
 So let me just bring this up to us

162
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,960
 and kind of give us a good working definition

163
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,800
 of an encounter.

164
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,560
 Encounters with God are these impactful moments,

165
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,720
 oftentimes unexpected, unprepared for, unanticipated,

166
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,640
 yet they end up changing us,

167
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,440
 helping us see God more truly for who he is

168
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,600
 and who we are, giving us strength,

169
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,840
 giving us confidence and resolve.

170
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,240
 This is what an encounter of God can do.

171
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,600
 But it's good to know that encounters

172
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,020
 don't all look the same.

173
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,440
 They don't all happen the same way.

174
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,240
 Encounters aren't just limited to certain kinds of people.

175
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,680
 I think by nature, we might think an encounter with God

176
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,840
 must mean that we are living rightfully

177
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,880
 and we are the most holy of people.

178
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,120
 But encounters of God we'll see range from men to women,

179
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,200
 to priests, to sinners, to liars, to anybody.

180
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,320
 So many people can encounter God.

181
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,760
 And I say that because I want you to know

182
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,680
 that you don't have to have all your stuff together

183
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,220
 to have an encounter with God.

184
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,960
 You don't have to be a certain level of Christian

185
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,840
 to encounter God.

186
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,200
 Like I said, encounters don't all take place

187
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,040
 in the same way.

188
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,200
 Some encounters take place in a cave.

189
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,080
 Some encounters take place on mountaintops.

190
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,160
 Some encounters take place in the flames

191
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,400
 of Nebuchadnezzar's furnace.

192
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,360
 Some encounters take place in the temple.

193
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,000
 Some encounters take place in the room.

194
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Some encounters take place at the Ford of Jabbok,

195
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,040
 crossing over and exist with the wrestling of God.

196
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,520
 So today our first encounter we're gonna look at

197
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,580
 is a man who is a liar, who's a thief,

198
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,040
 who swindles, who doesn't have it all right,

199
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,260
 who cheats to get ahead.

200
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,960
 We're gonna look at the man called Jacob today.

201
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,320
 Jacob's, well, there's a Jacob here.

202
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,240
 I'm sorry, bro.

203
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,040
 Jacob has a wild story.

204
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,120
 He's a twin.

205
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,760
 He's a younger brother, right?

206
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,720
 And God would tell his mother that the youngest son

207
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,760
 would lead the oldest.

208
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,520
 I think the verbatim is the oldest will bow down

209
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,360
 and submit to the younger one.

210
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,600
 This was Jacob's prophecy.

211
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,680
 This was counter-cultural.

212
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,640
 This wasn't normal.

213
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,320
 Normally the inheritance and the blessing

214
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,840
 goes to the oldest son, but Jacob as a twin

215
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,200
 ends up being the second son, and there's a promise

216
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,160
 that he would be the one to carry it forward.

217
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,680
 And it's important that we understand Jacob's name

218
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,560
 'cause names mean something.

219
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,160
 Names are not just, you know, what's popular,

220
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,120
 top 100 girl names or guy names this year.

221
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,840
 Names were super significant.

222
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,760
 You named someone something because you wanted

223
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,200
 to see something in them or in a response to a promise

224
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,760
 or because God had done something.

225
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,480
 So your name was a sense of your identity.

226
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,160
 A name was a sense of foreshadowing or reputation.

227
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,400
 And Jacob's name would mean the supplanter

228
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,440
 or the heel grabber because, silly enough,

229
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,680
 when he came out of the womb, he was holding on

230
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,360
 to his brother's heel.

231
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,560
 So his parents saw that and they're like,

232
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,000
 oh, this guy's ambitious.

233
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,960
 We're gonna call him Jacob.

234
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,800
 And that would be his name.

235
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,640
 In Genesis 26, God would tell Rebecca

236
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,560
 that the children wrestle and struggle inside of you.

237
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:23,640
 Jacob would earn the full aspect of his name later on,

238
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,480
 which I think some of us who are familiar

239
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,560
 would think Jacob means deceiver.

240
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,720
 So for those of us familiar with the story,

241
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,720
 Jacob tricks his older brother Esau.

242
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,400
 He deceives him into selling his birthright for some stew,

243
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,800
 for some stew.

244
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
 I mean, talk about a low bar.

245
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,880
 So his brother sells his birthright.

246
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,040
 Jacob ends up taking it.

247
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,400
 Jacob ends up lying in the inheritance swap

248
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,480
 and he takes what was just meant for his brother.

249
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,280
 And Esau would say this in his complaint.

250
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,200
 Is he not rightly named Jacob

251
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,280
 for he has cheated me these two times?

252
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,840
 He took away my birthright

253
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,880
 and behold, he has taken away my blessing.

254
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,360
 Jacob is a deceiver.

255
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,120
 He's the one who steals to get ahead.

256
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,240
 He's the one who cheats to get to first place.

257
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,880
 He supplants or trips up his brother.

258
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,800
 He wrestles him in the womb, wrestles him in birth,

259
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,000
 and wrestles him in their relationship.

260
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,120
 But don't worry, it gets better.

261
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,000
 Jacob is holistic in his wrestling.

262
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,040
 He doesn't just leave it to his brother.

263
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,280
 He continues wrestling in other aspects of his life.

264
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,760
 His brother wants to kill him

265
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,200
 because he has taken what belonged to him.

266
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,680
 So Jacob runs and flees

267
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,720
 and he meets this woman named Rachel.

268
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,720
 Beautiful woman, I guess,

269
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,400
 because he's willing to enter into a contract

270
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,600
 to work seven years so that he can marry her.

271
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,240
 The story goes he works seven years

272
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,600
 and he thinks he's gonna get Rachel.

273
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,240
 On the wedding day, he actually doesn't get Rachel.

274
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,600
 The dad tricked him.

275
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,880
 The dad deceived him.

276
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,240
 The dad wrestled with him.

277
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,520
 And actually he gives him the other daughter, Leah.

278
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,720
 And Jacob's annoyed because, Bible says this,

279
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,040
 Rachel was the beautiful one, Leah was not so much.

280
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,480
 So he couldn't get Rachel because he had just gotten Leah.

281
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,480
 So the father's like, well, if you want Rachel,

282
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,600
 I'm not gonna give you both of my daughters for one price.

283
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,600
 You have to work another seven more years.

284
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,360
 So Jacob's been working for 14 years

285
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,640
 just to get the thing he thought he deserved.

286
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,520
 Wrestling.

287
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,360
 And it continues.

288
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,360
 His land and his property, his sheep and his cattle end up,

289
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,720
 him and Laban live in the same area.

290
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,960
 They've decided to separate into two parts of the space

291
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,800
 so that there would be no mixing.

292
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,520
 And all of Laban's things would be Laban's,

293
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,200
 all of Jacob's things would be Jacob's.

294
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,040
 But all of Jacob's cattle are bigger and stronger

295
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,760
 and look better and look healthier than Laban's,

296
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,360
 which creates conflict between him and his father-in-law.

297
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,200
 Wrestling.

298
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,200
 This theme of wrestling just continues

299
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,080
 and continues for Jacob.

300
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,240
 He wrestles with Esau.

301
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,160
 He wrestles with Laban.

302
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,040
 He uses strategy to try and figure out

303
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,640
 how do I get myself out of these situations?

304
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,320
 How do I get what I deserve?

305
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,240
 He fights, he wrestles.

306
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,320
 This is just his life at this point.

307
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,520
 But it would appear that God wanted more

308
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,720
 from him and of him.

309
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,400
 And so when we take a look here at Genesis 32

310
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,880
 where we have that famous encounter,

311
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,320
 starting at verse 22, it says this.

312
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,400
 The same night he, speaking of Jacob, arose,

313
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,520
 took his two wives, his two female servants,

314
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:33,040
 his 11 children, crossed the ford at Jabbok.

315
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,440
 He took them and sent them across the stream

316
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,400
 and everything else that he had.

317
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,400
 And Jacob was left alone.

318
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:44,080
 And a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the day.

319
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,480
 When the man saw that he did not prevail against Jacob,

320
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,880
 he touched his hip socket and Jacob's hip

321
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,880
 was put out of joint as he wrestled with him.

322
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,240
 Then he said, "Let me go for the day is broken."

323
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,280
 But Jacob said, "I will not let you go

324
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,040
 unless you bless me."

325
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,240
 And he said, "What is your name?"

326
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,280
 He said, "Jacob."

327
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,880
 Then he said, "You shall no longer be called Jacob,

328
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,720
 but Israel, for you have striven with God and with men

329
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,880
 and have prevailed."

330
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,280
 Then Jacob asked him, "Please tell me your name."

331
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,840
 But he said, "Why is it that you ask my name?"

332
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,080
 And there he blessed him.

333
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,800
 So Jacob called the name of this place Peniel,

334
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,240
 saying, "I have seen God face to face

335
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,240
 and yet my life has been delivered."

336
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,040
 What has happened in this moment?

337
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,120
 Just a little bit of more context

338
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,160
 so that we really get this wrestle

339
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,960
 because this is a massive encounter with God.

340
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,160
 This is an orthodox encounter with God.

341
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,320
 We have to understand.

342
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,120
 So Jacob is getting ready to go back home.

343
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,920
 He's been away from home for all these years

344
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,000
 and he's carrying his family and all the things he has.

345
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,600
 And he gets word that his brother,

346
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,760
 who hated him, wanted to kill him, was ahead of him.

347
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,520
 So naturally that scares him.

348
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,520
 Then the word gets worse.

349
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:00,520
 His brother is with 400 men ahead of him.

350
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,000
 Naturally, Jacob gets a little nervous,

351
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,320
 slows down a little bit and thinks,

352
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,240
 "Okay, well, what do I do?

353
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,440
 I have a wife, I have two wives, I have kids,

354
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,280
 I have 11 children, I have all this stuff.

355
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,600
 How are we gonna make it if my brother

356
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,440
 wants revenge for what I've done?"

357
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,480
 He is in a desperate, broken moment.

358
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,680
 So he gets clever.

359
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,400
 He sends some of his best stuff ahead.

360
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,960
 He goes, "Take this to Esau."

361
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,600
 And you see Esau say, "These are gifts from Jacob."

362
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,360
 So he tries to use a little bit of cleverness, strategy,

363
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,280
 maybe not trickery, but a little bit of deceit.

364
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,440
 He doesn't really wanna give him gifts.

365
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,360
 He just doesn't wanna get killed, right?

366
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,200
 Makes sense.

367
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,160
 He's doing the best that he can.

368
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,240
 He's doing what he thinks he needs to do,

369
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,080
 but he's worried.

370
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,480
 He's at his lowest point here.

371
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,160
 He has all this stuff, yet he still is at this moment of,

372
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,200
 "What do I do?"

373
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:52,200
 And tension and brokenness, the unexpected, then happens.

374
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,600
 He's unprepared, and unexpectedly,

375
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,760
 he has this encounter with God in the form of a fight.

376
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,840
 I'm just gonna be honest.

377
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,280
 When I encounter God, I hope he's not trying to fight me.

378
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,680
 Right, like that must have been a moment.

379
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,220
 But how poetically beautiful is it

380
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,320
 that most of Jacob's life has been marked symbolically

381
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,960
 with this aspect of wrestling.

382
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,960
 And when he encounters God,

383
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:19,240
 his encounter with him is through what?

384
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,400
 Through a wrestle, through a struggle.

385
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:26,400
 God meets him in a language that he is overly familiar with.

386
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,600
 And the first thing we have to note here

387
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,080
 is how God meets him on these challenging terms.

388
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,040
 The context of his situation were not ideal.

389
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,840
 God meets him here in his mess, in his brokenness.

390
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,560
 When we need him the most, that's when God meets us.

391
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,660
 And I think it's something that we have to keep in mind

392
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,600
 because a lot of us subconsciously live in a way

393
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,600
 that seeks out pleasure and avoids pain.

394
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,560
 But what if it's in the pain

395
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,400
 that God plans to speak the loudest?

396
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,320
 What if it's in the pain that God plans on encountering you?

397
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:04,420
 If our life is constantly avoiding the difficult,

398
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:10,380
 do we potentially avoid these encounters with God?

399
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,880
 So if you're struggling,

400
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,860
 if you're in a place of brokenness,

401
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,600
 if your life is going less than expected,

402
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,240
 if you've run into unexpected conflict and trouble

403
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,040
 and things just don't seem right,

404
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,660
 if you're in your darkest place,

405
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,000
 if you're in a moment of tension and pain,

406
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,600
 if your circumstances leave you desperate,

407
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,420
 that's an open door for an encounter.

408
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,680
 That's what we see here in Jacob.

409
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,860
 God has a funny way of showing up most clear

410
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,840
 in our darkest hours.

411
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,160
 And so I wonder what would happen

412
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,480
 if in those moments of darkness,

413
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,380
 we sought him instead of running away?

414
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:54,280
 It leads me to the second thing that I notice in this story,

415
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,840
 and that's around prayer,

416
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,560
 how prayer is essential to an encounter with God.

417
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,080
 So that's exactly what Jacob does.

418
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,760
 In verse nine, he prays.

419
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,040
 It's gonna come up on here.

420
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,640
 I'm just gonna read a couple of points from his prayer.

421
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,520
 He prays to God.

422
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,200
 He says, "You told me to return to my country

423
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,520
 "that you would do good.

424
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,600
 "I'm not worthy of the least of the deeds

425
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,440
 "of your steadfast love and all your faithfulness

426
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,060
 "that you've shown me.

427
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,440
 "For even though when I only had my staff,

428
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,520
 "I crossed the Jordan, and now I have become two camps.

429
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,460
 "Please deliver me from the hand of my brother,

430
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,240
 "from the hand of Esau," listen to this,

431
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,120
 "for I fear him."

432
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:34,800
 I love that Jacob, when he prays in this moment,

433
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,280
 before he does anything, he doesn't have the best words.

434
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,440
 This isn't like super sophisticated big man prayer, right?

435
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,240
 He's not using anything fancy.

436
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,520
 He's just positioning himself authentically

437
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,840
 in front of God.

438
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,560
 He doesn't have to have a seminary degree.

439
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,360
 He doesn't have to have been in church for all his life.

440
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,280
 He's just exposing his heart to God.

441
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,960
 We can do this, right?

442
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,520
 We can just share where we are with God.

443
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,600
 I mean, what would happen if we did this?

444
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,360
 If there's something that's found

445
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:11,360
 when we turn our dependence on God into a prayer to God?

446
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,280
 What if that's what prayer really is about,

447
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,800
 being honest with him and being honest with yourself,

448
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,600
 that perhaps you've not been worthy,

449
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,920
 but actually God's been good.

450
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,000
 God has done things.

451
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,780
 It's fascinating.

452
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:29,080
 Jacob is at this point where he might get killed

453
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,360
 and everything he has might be destroyed,

454
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,440
 and he recounts the blessings of God.

455
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,440
 He goes, "When I first got here, God,

456
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,320
 "I just had my staff, I had nothing."

457
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,400
 It's the same concept of,

458
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,400
 I just had the clothes on my back and that's it.

459
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,560
 But now I'm here with two camps.

460
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,320
 He's speaking of the wealth that he's accumulated,

461
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,880
 of family, children.

462
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,200
 He has been blessed.

463
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,800
 And he's thanking God, first and foremost,

464
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,840
 I don't know how it's happened.

465
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,440
 I don't even think I deserve it.

466
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,560
 I've been unworthy of this, but you have been good.

467
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:05,120
 He recalls the faithfulness of God.

468
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,160
 His desperation does not blind him

469
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,480
 from the reality that God has been there

470
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,980
 and God has been blessing him.

471
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:15,240
 And then his prayer changes a bit.

472
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,040
 He pours out his heart to God.

473
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,280
 My favorite thing that I learned in this entire passage

474
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,840
 when I was studying it was just,

475
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,680
 there's nothing I didn't learn,

476
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,360
 I just read it and it hit me hard.

477
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,360
 He says, "I fear him, I fear Esau."

478
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,920
 That is as clear, that is as honest,

479
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,980
 probably as vulnerable as it gets.

480
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:36,920
 He's raw, he's not trying to come up

481
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,760
 with anything strategic, he's not trying

482
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,920
 to over-spiritualize or say it's this or say it's that

483
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,400
 or use some big fancy words.

484
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,080
 He is just being bare in front of God.

485
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,440
 That level of authenticity,

486
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,880
 that level of purely exposing where your heart is,

487
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,760
 no pretentiousness, no big words,

488
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,400
 just showing God your heart.

489
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,080
 What if that's an element to prayer?

490
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,720
 What if that's a powerful part of prayer?

491
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,720
 What if that's the gateway?

492
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,480
 What if that's what kickstarts things in our life?

493
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:12,160
 Just truly coming before him and being properly honest

494
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,320
 about what it is we feel, about where it is we are.

495
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:21,560
 See, Jacob, he prays,

496
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,160
 but he doesn't have his big encounter when he prays.

497
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,960
 Think about that.

498
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,960
 He says his prayer and no big moment happens.

499
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,440
 Now the big, the encounter comes

500
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,080
 because he opens himself up.

501
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,480
 He prays, nothing happens.

502
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,880
 In the moment of praying, there's no big miracle or anything

503
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,280
 but praying seemed to open the door.

504
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:51,120
 Prayer, therefore, is essential to an encounter with God.

505
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,280
 See, after his prayer, I love this as well,

506
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,600
 the Bible doesn't sugarcoat things.

507
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,800
 Genesis is for us broken people, right?

508
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,160
 Jacob has this prayer, he's thanked God,

509
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,000
 he's been honest with God and I think for lots of us,

510
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,760
 we think that if we just do it like that,

511
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,160
 then we'll become a better Christian right away.

512
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,200
 Let's look at this one more time.

513
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,400
 He does all these things,

514
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,080
 he does all the right things in his prayer

515
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,640
 and then he goes back to strategizing.

516
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,200
 He goes back to leaning on his own strength.

517
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,760
 He goes back to being human.

518
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,360
 Like he didn't all of a sudden become not human

519
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,360
 all of a sudden 'cause he prayed.

520
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,280
 I think some of us get discouraged 'cause we pray

521
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,240
 and we expect everything to change.

522
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,840
 We just all of a sudden are floating on clouds

523
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,000
 and we're more holy.

524
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 We no longer deal with temptation anymore.

525
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,640
 That's actually not how it works.

526
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,480
 We've got to have the right picture of prayer.

527
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,800
 Sometimes you're gonna pray

528
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,400
 and you're still gonna struggle.

529
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,120
 That's the reality of our life.

530
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,880
 I'm so glad that's clear in here.

531
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,720
 He leans back on his human tendency

532
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,040
 to control his next steps.

533
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:50,000
 But he's opened up a door.

534
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,840
 By praying, he's started something.

535
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,440
 He's allowed something to happen.

536
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,040
 And then it does, it happens.

537
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,440
 He prayed in the beginning of the night.

538
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,880
 Later in the night, he has his encounter with God.

539
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,760
 And his encounter comes with a wrestle,

540
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,880
 which I think is weird.

541
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,880
 Like of all the crazy things God can do

542
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,680
 when he encounters you, like I guess for me,

543
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,520
 sign me up, I don't wanna wrestle God.

544
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,080
 I would much rather just have him talk to me

545
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,440
 and tell me who I am, all these things.

546
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,280
 But Jacob ends up wrestling him.

547
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,240
 And I'm pretty convinced Jacob had no idea

548
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,440
 it was God at first.

549
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,560
 It's the dark of night.

550
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,680
 He probably thinks maybe Esau sent somebody

551
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,280
 knowing I was coming to take me out.

552
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,000
 Maybe there's thieves and robbers around

553
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,120
 trying to take my stuff.

554
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,480
 I mean, I'm carrying all this stuff.

555
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,760
 I'm a well-off guy.

556
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,320
 He wrestles this guy, probably in self-defense.

557
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,880
 But at some point, something clicks in his head.

558
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,920
 This isn't human.

559
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,080
 I'm wrestling divinity.

560
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,440
 I am pushing against the creator of the universe.

561
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,160
 He becomes aware that he's wrestling with God.

562
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,160
 And what does he do?

563
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,200
 He doesn't let go.

564
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,440
 He holds on.

565
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,560
 He digs his heels in.

566
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:03,440
 He wholly commits himself to the fight.

567
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,320
 He holds on more.

568
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,160
 He struggles, he fights.

569
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,400
 He even gets his hip displaced.

570
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,440
 Fun fact, don't fight God, he'll break your hip.

571
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,680
 That's my takeaway today.

572
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:19,360
 But even in that space, it seems like that's when

573
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,160
 the change actually starts to begin.

574
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:26,880
 See, the old Jacob, his strategy, his way,

575
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,040
 his preference in doing things was through deception.

576
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,240
 The old Jacob would have tried to,

577
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,640
 when he realized this was God,

578
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,520
 he would have tried to deceive him.

579
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,080
 He would have tried to supplant.

580
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,360
 He would have tried to trick or try to get ahead

581
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,640
 or get something out of him.

582
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,920
 He would have tried to get his own way.

583
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,600
 But instead, he wrestles him,

584
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,560
 which means he just holds on to him.

585
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,880
 Like, it doesn't say that he beats up God, right?

586
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,800
 Or God beats him up.

587
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,760
 He fights with him.

588
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:57,440
 He's against, he's holding on with all that he has.

589
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,880
 It feels like it's in that moment, he's like,

590
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,600
 "God, if this is you, I have you.

591
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,520
 "I have your attention, you have mine,

592
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,560
 "and I'm not gonna let you go."

593
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,000
 That is his wrestle.

594
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,800
 It's a clinging on to God.

595
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:15,200
 With his one chance, he stays, he wrestles.

596
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,200
 He's got everything to lose, but Jacob clings to God.

597
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,160
 A clear indicator of his transformation

598
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:30,160
 in the middle of all of this is that Jacob then asks,

599
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,760
 what do I mean by this?

600
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,040
 Well, so far, Jacob has been really good at taking, right?

601
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,600
 He's been really good at being clever,

602
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,480
 and whatever he thought was his,

603
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,080
 he would reach for it, he would take it.

604
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,880
 Think specifically to the birthright situation.

605
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,760
 There was a whole prophecy around how he would be the one

606
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,880
 who would get the inheritance.

607
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,960
 But when things didn't go the way he thought,

608
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,240
 when it looked challenging,

609
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,160
 when it seemed like it was out of reach

610
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,560
 and God wasn't gonna do anything,

611
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,480
 he took it upon himself to get

612
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,080
 what he thought belonged to him.

613
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,520
 So that would be the natural way

614
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,760
 that Jacob would engage in this space, but he asks.

615
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,240
 He asks.

616
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,520
 I think this is a big thing for a lot of us,

617
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,400
 because a lot of us live lives

618
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,240
 where we've got to take to get what we need.

619
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,440
 No one's really looking out for us.

620
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,920
 If I don't look out for me, who's gonna look out for me?

621
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,880
 And so we strive and we push and we take

622
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,680
 and we reach and we grab.

623
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,600
 If there's an obstacle in front of me and what I need,

624
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,120
 I've got to figure out a way to get it.

625
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,080
 We reach for whatever is around us.

626
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,280
 This is the natural way that our city operates.

627
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,560
 And this is the reality.

628
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,880
 Getting the right things the wrong way

629
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,640
 will never actually satisfy you.

630
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,840
 I mean, think about it.

631
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,160
 Jacob already got the blessing.

632
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,000
 Isaac actually blessed him.

633
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,640
 Esau actually gave away his birthright.

634
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,040
 He's already received the blessing.

635
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,440
 What is he fighting for?

636
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,720
 He's received the blessing, but he's in a moment

637
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,520
 where he's terrified to go forward,

638
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,760
 where his whole world could be lost.

639
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,040
 He's received the blessing,

640
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,680
 but he's petrified to move forward.

641
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,920
 He has a wife and kids.

642
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,520
 He has all the material things.

643
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,400
 He's been blessed, but yet he's in the darkest,

644
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,040
 most tense moment of his life.

645
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,760
 He's taken rather than received.

646
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,560
 And this is actually something that we can trace back

647
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,960
 to the beginning of scripture in Genesis.

648
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,080
 We know that Adam and Eve, that the tree,

649
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,280
 the fruit on the tree looked desirable,

650
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,280
 looked good for eating.

651
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,440
 And when they are deceived, what do they do?

652
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,760
 Rather than going to the maker and asking him for it,

653
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,920
 they reach, they take for themselves.

654
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,360
 They become their own gods.

655
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,720
 And in doing that, they end up wrecking a relationship,

656
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,480
 absolutely breaking the relationship with them

657
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,360
 and God.

658
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,360
 So here's a crazy thought then.

659
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,800
 Maybe the real blessing isn't the things we receive,

660
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,560
 but maybe it's the relationship we open up

661
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,440
 with the one who gives the thing in the first place.

662
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:05,280
 What if that's the whole thing?

663
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,720
 What if the true blessing is that relationship

664
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,680
 with the one who created it all,

665
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:13,000
 with the giver of the gift, not just the gift?

666
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,920
 And I think what happens is when we reach,

667
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,960
 we bypass the giver and we get the stuff,

668
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,920
 or at least the best that we can reach for.

669
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,200
 And I wonder how many times in our life

670
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,640
 God is planning to intervene, to meet us where we are,

671
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,600
 to show up, to give us what we need,

672
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,000
 but we end up taking matters into our own hands.

673
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,080
 We end up filling our hands with the things

674
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,720
 that we can reach for, giving us absolutely no space

675
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,480
 to receive the thing he has for us.

676
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,120
 We end up filling ourselves with these

677
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,120
 lesser store brand blessings that really don't fulfill us

678
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,040
 in the first place.

679
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,520
 We end up becoming our own heroes, our own God.

680
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,200
 We settle for the beta version, not the true thing.

681
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,680
 And Jacob in this moment has had enough of what he can do.

682
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:07,000
 He's seen what his striving and what his reaching

683
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,080
 has done for him.

684
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,680
 And it's not enough.

685
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,200
 So he reaches this point and in this encounter,

686
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,880
 he asks for the blessing.

687
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,080
 Slight difference.

688
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:23,000
 He asks for the blessing versus taking the blessing.

689
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,040
 And that changes everything.

690
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,080
 I wonder what it would take for us

691
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,600
 to reach that point as well,

692
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,880
 where we recognize that actually,

693
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,080
 he says, "Knock, the door will be opened.

694
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,760
 "Ask and you will receive."

695
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,480
 The father withholds no good gift from his children.

696
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:44,440
 He actually says in scripture that if you wicked people

697
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,480
 can give your kids food and good gifts,

698
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,280
 how much more am I gonna give you things?

699
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,360
 Later in the New Testament, it says that every good

700
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,960
 and perfect thing comes from the father above.

701
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,760
 He is good and a giver of good stuff,

702
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,560
 but we're not gonna be able to see that.

703
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,240
 We're not gonna be able to receive that

704
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,000
 if we've taken for ourselves the best of what we can grab,

705
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,440
 the best of what we can do.

706
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,960
 This was Jacob.

707
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,720
 This was his dark moment, his lonely moment.

708
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,440
 His encounter was so unorthodox,

709
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,640
 yet his healing was in his wrestle.

710
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,280
 And like he should, like we should,

711
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:29,280
 he wrestles through the night till dawn and he prevails.

712
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,640
 And what does it mean for him to prevail?

713
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,760
 It means that the old him has gone

714
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,720
 and a new version of him has come.

715
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,360
 He is no longer Jacob the deceiver.

716
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,200
 He is now Jacob the requester.

717
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,440
 He's truly prevailed.

718
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,460
 He has asked and God has blessed him.

719
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:48,260
 This encounter has been successful.

720
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:51,080
 God has met with him and he gets blessed,

721
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,680
 but I think there's a couple of details

722
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,840
 we need to really sit on before we continue.

723
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,400
 His situation hasn't changed.

724
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,160
 Has anyone noticed that yet?

725
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,760
 He meets with God as this awesome encounter,

726
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,140
 wrestles God, sees him face to face,

727
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:06,120
 but he still has a brother that might wanna kill him

728
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,840
 with 400 men.

729
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,320
 And his encounter with God didn't come

730
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:14,120
 with 400 mercenary angels ready to fight on his behalf.

731
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,740
 It didn't come with extra strength to be able to fight.

732
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,820
 Actually, let's see, what does this encounter

733
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,660
 actually produce?

734
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:23,120
 It says, "Your name shall no longer be called Jacob,

735
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,060
 "but Israel, for you have striven with God

736
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,600
 "and with men and you've prevailed."

737
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,800
 So in his asking of God, in his big encounter moment,

738
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,080
 he's finally done it all right.

739
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,200
 And what does he get?

740
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,480
 A limp and a new name.

741
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,520
 Take that to the battle.

742
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,720
 How does that even work?

743
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,600
 Think about this.

744
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,040
 It wasn't until Jethro pointed it out

745
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,520
 in our conversation about it.

746
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,440
 So this is his point, not mine.

747
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,480
 Jacob is now more vulnerable because he met with God.

748
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,280
 He actually can't defend himself.

749
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,440
 See, sometimes we think if we just pray,

750
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,240
 we're gonna have all the strength to do everything

751
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,600
 and we're just gonna have these results happen overnight.

752
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,240
 What happens when you pray

753
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,520
 and somehow you're more vulnerable afterwards?

754
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,900
 Have you ever felt that way?

755
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,320
 Where you poured out your heart to God

756
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,240
 and your situation hasn't changed immediately?

757
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,600
 Maybe you've walked away with a spiritual limp.

758
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,780
 God gives him a limp and a new name.

759
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:16,080
 But here's the thing.

760
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,900
 The blessing from his encounter with God

761
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,000
 is gonna be for who Jacob is at the core.

762
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,520
 God blesses him by changing not just his name,

763
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,440
 but now his identity.

764
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,760
 If you remember what I said earlier in this sermon,

765
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,720
 the name is so important.

766
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,560
 The name speaks to who you are.

767
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,800
 It speaks to what you're gonna do.

768
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,280
 It speaks to what you have done.

769
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,520
 It is, in essence, your identity.

770
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,160
 The whole of you can be wrapped up in your name.

771
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,040
 And so now after experiencing and encountering God

772
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,360
 in this way, he's no longer Jacob the trickster,

773
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,680
 no longer Jacob the supplant or the heel grabber,

774
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,720
 the one who tries to cheat to get ahead.

775
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,560
 He is now Israel, the one who fought and wrestled with God

776
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,400
 and has been changed and prevailed.

777
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:59,200
 God, in essence, has changed the entirety of who Jacob is.

778
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,000
 God renames him something from their encounter,

779
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,960
 but something for his future.

780
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,680
 Jacob is able to enter this same challenging

781
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:13,040
 and hard and tense and broken situation,

782
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,240
 all the same that it was,

783
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,760
 but as a completely different person

784
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,340
 with a completely new identity,

785
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,880
 having seen the face of God, put it this way,

786
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,160
 the situation didn't change, but the person did.

787
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:29,720
 The situation didn't change, but the person did.

788
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,880
 And this had to have an effect on his perspective.

789
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,080
 He had to look at his moment a bit differently now.

790
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,040
 He's walking with this limp, yes, but with this swagger

791
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,160
 'cause he's just seen God, he's just wrestled with God,

792
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,520
 he's just had the source of all good things with him.

793
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,560
 He has struggled with him.

794
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,600
 And all of a sudden, yes, Esau's still there with 400 men,

795
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,600
 but perhaps he's not longer gripped in fear of his brother.

796
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,560
 Perhaps there's a slight easing,

797
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:01,280
 a confidence that has come because you were with God,

798
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,160
 because you were in his presence,

799
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,640
 because you spent time with him,

800
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,600
 wrestling and contending him.

801
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,000
 Looking now at the situation completely different,

802
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 Jacob can no longer lean on his own strength.

803
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,200
 He literally has to lean on God's ability.

804
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,280
 He literally has to lean on God's strength.

805
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,760
 And the story goes well.

806
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,880
 Jacob ends up going, seeing his brother,

807
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,840
 and his brother's happy to see him.

808
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,160
 That's great.

809
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,000
 That's awesome.

810
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,040
 That's a great, happy conclusion to our story.

811
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,400
 But before we got there,

812
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,440
 before we reached a happy conclusion,

813
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,120
 Jacob is changed and now has a new approach

814
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,280
 with no promises, simply based off

815
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,120
 of his encounter with God.

816
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:46,920
 This encounter exists to show us something

817
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:51,320
 of what an encounter of God can do in us and for us.

818
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,880
 How it can change us at our core.

819
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,560
 How it can bring about a divine confidence,

820
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,760
 reposition who we are,

821
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,120
 helping us learn how to lean on his strength

822
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,160
 in times of trouble.

823
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:07,160
 What we find, we find that we must be a people

824
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:11,200
 who do two things, who pray and the people who wait.

825
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,680
 I'm gonna boil everything down to those two things.

826
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,960
 The people who pray and the people who wait.

827
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,200
 These two things are essential.

828
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:22,000
 Jacob's encounter only comes after he prays.

829
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,520
 Prayer opened the door.

830
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,120
 I love that he prays early in the night,

831
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,520
 but the encounter doesn't come till later in the night.

832
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,200
 Prayer was his pregame.

833
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,040
 It was his way of opening the channel,

834
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,120
 posturing and positioning himself

835
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,000
 to be able to have that encounter,

836
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,240
 that unexpected meeting with God

837
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,720
 that produced unexpected results.

838
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,240
 Honest prayer is where you thank God, yes,

839
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,960
 but you also pour out your heart to God

840
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,800
 and you don't try to over-spiritualize it.

841
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,440
 You don't try to use the big words.

842
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,640
 You don't try to use Greek and Hebrew.

843
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,760
 You just tell him where you are.

844
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,800
 That kind of prayer is essential.

845
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:01,420
 This kind of prayer is what God wants for us, not from us,

846
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:04,000
 because in that it fuels,

847
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,320
 it gives depth to our intimacy with him.

848
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,560
 We spend time with him, we get to know him.

849
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,760
 And it requires that we trust that God hears us

850
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,000
 and that God will never leave us alone.

851
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,960
 It's not our battles to fight on our own.

852
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,120
 And the second thing, Jacob prays, nothing happens,

853
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,720
 but Jacob waits and something begins.

854
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,640
 This is probably the thing you gotta write down

855
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,960
 and keep for this week, all right?

856
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,400
 I think we've got to learn how to do this

857
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,220
 because we live in a society and a generation

858
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,600
 in a world of instant gratification.

859
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,480
 We don't have to wait for anything, right?

860
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,720
 Like everything is kind of quick.

861
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,360
 Everything, whatever we need, it's there.

862
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,120
 Life is like instant noodles, just really, really quick.

863
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,040
 Get what you need, get it really quick.

864
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,520
 And if we live this way in every aspect of our lives,

865
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,760
 we potentially take this way of thinking

866
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,080
 into our spiritual lives.

867
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,800
 So when we go to God, when we actually dare

868
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,680
 to have the courage to pray and be honest,

869
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,660
 we don't have the discipline to wait for his response.

870
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:11,460
 We potentially don't have the discipline to wait

871
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,000
 for his rescue, for his encounter.

872
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,760
 Oftentimes that waiting is a wrestling

873
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,680
 through the feelings, a wrestling through the silence,

874
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,040
 a wrestling with your doubts,

875
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,440
 a wrestling through the whole night,

876
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,160
 as we see here in Jacob's story,

877
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,920
 to stay and to contend with God.

878
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,120
 Jacob's desperation is what fuels his wrestling.

879
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,600
 My question is, are we desperate enough

880
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,480
 to where if we get in that moment,

881
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,480
 we will not let him go?

882
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,920
 I think we've got this weird concept as a society,

883
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:53,920
 as a Christian society, that everything is formulaic.

884
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,640
 And what I mean by that is a lot of times

885
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,440
 we have these specific things that we do.

886
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,140
 You wake up and have a five minute prayer

887
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,640
 and then you go about your day.

888
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,440
 Or every January, we do a 21 day fast.

889
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,640
 Nothing against fasting for 21 days, that's great.

890
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,480
 I do it too.

891
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,980
 But we have our 21 day fast and then we go on.

892
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,160
 But here's my question.

893
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,980
 What happens if it's not the formula?

894
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:17,760
 What happens if God is planning on meeting you

895
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,900
 on the 22nd day?

896
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:24,740
 What happens if God plans on meeting you

897
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,520
 minute six of your devotion?

898
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:30,120
 Sorry God, only five minutes today.

899
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,760
 See, we've gotten this whole idea of quick, easy

900
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,760
 and formula mixed together and ends up happening

901
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,440
 is that we put forth the effort, but we don't wait.

902
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,600
 We don't slow down enough to wait for him.

903
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,080
 So then we end up missing him.

904
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,600
 And not just missing him, we end up going

905
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,400
 and figuring it out ourselves.

906
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,040
 We end up, okay, well God hasn't shown up,

907
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,640
 so let me figure out how I can do.

908
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,760
 Jacob did the same thing.

909
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,640
 God hasn't shown up, what can I do?

910
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,400
 I'll send these gifts, I'll send my kids ahead,

911
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,240
 I'll send this, doing all these things.

912
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,320
 We end up filling our hands with what we can grab

913
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,460
 with our strategies, with our own way of doing things

914
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:05,720
 and we end up missing what it is that God has for us.

915
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,700
 What if we fasted for 22 days?

916
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,320
 What if, actually I have time, Emma told me this

917
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,360
 when we were studying this passage.

918
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,720
 The 21 day fast, the Daniel fast,

919
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,400
 is something that we set up looking back on it.

920
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,600
 Daniel didn't set out saying,

921
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,960
 I'm only gonna fast for 21 days.

922
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,120
 Think about that.

923
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,400
 His fast was until something happens.

924
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,920
 So we look back on it and we're like, all right, 21 days.

925
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,120
 But actually, this is not about the fast,

926
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,000
 this is about us in general.

927
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,320
 It's not the formula, you've got to wait.

928
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,220
 We've got to wait.

929
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:44,480
 We've got to wrestle and wait on the Lord.

930
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,420
 That's where we will renew our strength,

931
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,900
 that's where we will find our hope,

932
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,320
 that's when we'll rise on wings like eagles and soar

933
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,100
 when we wait on the Lord.

934
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:58,980
 The temptation of not waiting on the Lord

935
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:01,040
 means that we enter into this headspace

936
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,100
 that we have to take care of ourselves.

937
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,040
 I was touched on it earlier,

938
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,240
 but it's something we have to remind ourselves.

939
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,840
 It's not just up to you to get you through.

940
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:13,440
 Hear this, you're not the only one that cares about you.

941
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,280
 That's good to know, right?

942
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,200
 There's someone who cares about you significantly more

943
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,760
 in every possible way to the fullest extent,

944
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,840
 holistically cares about you.

945
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,080
 Our world and our lives are not solely dependent

946
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,600
 on what we can do and what we make of it.

947
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,440
 The Christian story is this,

948
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,680
 that we have abdicated the rights to be our own gods

949
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,880
 and we've given that responsibility

950
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,640
 to the only true God in Jesus.

951
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,640
 And hear this, he cares for you.

952
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:45,880
 So could we live like that?

953
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,040
 Could we wait on him?

954
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,080
 Could we wait on God?

955
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,360
 Could we wait on the Lord through the night,

956
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,920
 through the tension, through the anxiety,

957
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,760
 through the stress?

958
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,400
 Could we wait on the Lord?

959
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,880
 Could we wait for those moments

960
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,200
 where we finally have his attention

961
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,440
 and when we have his attention,

962
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,720
 could we hold onto him?

963
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,680
 Could we grab him?

964
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,640
 Could we say, I'm not letting you go until you bless me?

965
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:09,120
 Could we posture ourselves to ask and not reach and grab?

966
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,600
 Could we hold onto him?

967
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:18,000
 Could we choose to not avoid or hide?

968
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 Could we wrestle for more than just a feeling?

969
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,080
 Could we wrestle for all that he has for us?

970
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:28,120
 Can we put our future back in his hands

971
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,120
 where everything is possible

972
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:34,960
 versus our hands where only so much can be achieved?

973
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:39,480
 Can we put it in the hands of him who has no limits?

974
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,640
 He operates in the impossible.

975
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,360
 That's the guy I want in the driver's seat of my life.

976
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:49,600
 So don't take for yourself what you find.

977
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,040
 Leave it to God to give you what he has.

978
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:55,160
 I grew up hearing this song,

979
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,960
 I think I was around maybe between the ages of seven and 10.

980
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,160
 My mom used to sing in the choir,

981
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,280
 which is where I get my ability to sing from.

982
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,840
 And I remember going to choir practices on Monday

983
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,520
 and there's this one song they would sing.

984
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,600
 It was, you're an on time God, yes he is.

985
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,600
 And it's like, he's an on time God, yes he is.

986
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,720
 And the words are, he may not come when you want him,

987
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,800
 but he'll be there right on time.

988
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,200
 He's an on time God, yes he is.

989
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:24,560
 Church, this is my appeal, that we've got to wait.

990
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:29,280
 It may feel like God just should have come five minutes ago,

991
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,680
 he should have been here three weeks ago,

992
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,080
 he should have been here before this challenge happens,

993
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,440
 but he is an on time God.

994
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,960
 And he may not come when you think he should be there.

995
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,880
 He may not do it the way that you want him to do it,

996
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,520
 but that's the whole point of these encounters,

997
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,520
 it's unexpected, it happens in unexpected ways.

998
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,080
 But if we will position ourselves,

999
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,200
 if we will posture ourselves to receive it

1000
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,080
 through praying and through waiting,

1001
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,080
 he does not disappoint.

1002
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:56,960
 He will not leave you alone.

1003
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,760
 He will not leave you to only your strength.

1004
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,800
 Wait on the Lord, wait through the night,

1005
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,840
 wait through the silence, hold on to him.

1006
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:11,800
 Waiting is hard.

1007
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:16,320
 Not gonna pretend like it's something you can theorize.

1008
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,040
 If it wasn't hard, we'd all do it.

1009
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:22,880
 But I pray that by understanding this encounter,

1010
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,880
 that it would produce something in you.

1011
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:31,000
 That your desperation to encounter, to know,

1012
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,960
 to experience that same God

1013
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:38,360
 would fuel your discipline to wait.

1014
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,360
 I pray that the Holy Spirit

1015
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,760
 will give you the strength you need.

1016
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,640
 I pray that he will help and guide you,

1017
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,720
 that he will light your path and lead you forward,

1018
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,080
 that he will clear your mind,

1019
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,960
 that he will remind you of what is in front of you.

1020
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,000
 And that is a God who cares, a God who loves,

1021
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,720
 a God who desires the absolute best for you,

1022
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,320
 a God who loves you more than you can love yourself,

1023
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,040
 and a God who's more capable than what we're capable of.

1024
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:09,400
 And so Jesus, we come before you this morning asking,

1025
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:15,240
 asking, not reaching, but asking for your help.

1026
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,720
 God, would you teach us how to pray?

1027
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,480
 Would you teach us how to be honest in front of you?

1028
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,560
 How to bear our souls in front of you?

1029
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:27,280
 Would you give us the confidence and the trust to know

1030
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,520
 that you hear us when we pray

1031
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,160
 and that you care about the dialogue,

1032
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,160
 about the channel of communication that it opens?

1033
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,720
 Would you remind us that by just being in your presence,

1034
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:38,560
 we are changed?

1035
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:43,360
 Would you remind us that by just being around you,

1036
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:46,000
 we are shaped and molded differently?

1037
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,760
 That these encounters are not limited to the holy

1038
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,560
 and to the saints, but it's also to the sinners like us.

1039
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:56,720
 Would you make us the people who pray?

1040
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:02,240
 And Holy Spirit, would you also be what sustains us?

1041
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,560
 Because starting can be easy, but staying can be hard.

1042
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:10,800
 So God, would you, through the power of the Holy Spirit,

1043
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,480
 sustain us in waiting for you, waiting on the Lord,

1044
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,480
 waiting and renewing our mind

1045
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,200
 and that you would renew our strength,

1046
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,960
 that you would be what we need if we wait on you,

1047
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:26,440
 that we will find joy again if we wait on you.

1048
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,120
 (gentle music)

1049
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:33,320
 That surely we will see you and your goodness

1050
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:36,200
 if we were to wait on you.

1051
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,000
 So Holy Spirit, sustain us,

1052
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,600
 give us the strength that we need to stay,

1053
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:47,160
 give us the discipline, the reminders that we need to stay,

1054
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:50,680
 to rely and to wait,

1055
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,280
 knowing that you're not gonna let us down.

1056
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,120
 You've never let us down before.

1057
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:00,600
 You've been faithful 100% of the time.

1058
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:03,440
 And so we lean on that faithful God this morning.

1059
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,960
 In Jesus' name, amen.
