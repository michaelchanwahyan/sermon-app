[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720]   Welcome to The Vine.
[00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.060]   A big welcome to The Vine.
[00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.060]   My name's Andrew.
[00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.060]   I'm one of the pastors here.
[00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:12.000]   And if you're new to The Vine or relatively new, we are so glad you're with us.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.080]   And we have people in the overflow outside as well.
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.720]   So hi to those who are in the second floor on the overflow.
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.660]   It's great to have you with us as well.
[00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.520]   What a joy it is to be together in Hong Kong.
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.520]   Amen?
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.520]   Yeah.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.960]   We'll try that one one more time.
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.820]   Am I the only one?
[00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.480]   It's great to be together in Hong Kong.
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.480]   Amen.
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.480]   Amen.
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.960]   Well, last week I told you that in three weeks time, we're going to start a new series here
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.960]   on the Book of Exodus.
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.880]   It's a series that we've been planning for about four years.
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.120]   It's a film series.
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.280]   I went to Egypt and Jordan and we filmed the journey of Israel going out of slavery in
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.660]   Egypt into the freedom of the promised land.
[00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.980]   And it got delayed a hundred times because of COVID.
[00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:54.980]   We finally got it finished.
[00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.040]   We're finally going to start to do that series on the 16th of April.
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.720]   And I said last week we're going to show a little bit of that series each week leading
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.720]   up to the 16th.
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.040]   And last week I just showed you a quick 20 seconds of me standing near the pyramids.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.520]   This week I'm going to show you about 45 seconds of some other footage from the series.
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.700]   Next week we're going to look at about a minute and a half from one of the episodes.
[00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.120]   And then on Easter Sunday itself, we'll show you the trailer that we have for the series.
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:28.120]   But here's 45 seconds of me in the middle of nowhere.
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:52.880]   There you go.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.000]   That's a little bit more.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.720]   So the reason why I wanted to show you that is because that place that I was looking out
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.240]   on, I'm going to tell you a little bit more about that place together today.
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:14.680]   But before I do, I think it was in the late, yeah, probably the late month of October 1976,
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.400]   a Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture at the University of Budapest created a 3D
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.760]   model for his students so that they could understand structural engineering a little
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.760]   bit better.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.040]   And he created this 3D model and he showed it to them and they absolutely loved it.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.760]   And they asked him if he would make a 3D model for each one of them.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.320]   And so he made one for every single one of his students.
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.940]   Well one of the students took this 3D model home and showed it to her dad because she
[00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.080]   knew that her dad would love it as well and be fascinated by it.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.320]   And he was.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.080]   Now this father owned a toy store in Budapest.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.400]   And so he said to the professor, "Hey, could you make me a small batch of these 3D models
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.040]   because I would like to sell them in my toy store."
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.400]   And so the professor agreed, made a few more, and he sold them in his toy store.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.840]   Now about exactly that same time, there was a British businessman who was on business
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.500]   in Budapest visiting.
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.940]   And one of the things that he always did when he was overseas visiting somewhere on business,
[00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.480]   he would buy something to take back to his daughter.
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.080]   And so he walks into this very toy store and he sees this very 3D model and he thinks his
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.320]   daughter will love it.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.640]   So he buys it, he takes it back to the UK, and yes, his daughter absolutely loves this
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.640]   thing.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.200]   She thinks it's the most amazing thing, all her friends love it.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:36.040]   And this businessman comes up with a business idea, as businessmen often do.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.080]   And he thinks to himself, "Well, if my daughter and all her friends love this thing, there
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.720]   could be hundreds and thousands of children all across the UK that would want to hold
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.160]   one of these things."
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.240]   So he manages to track down the original guy that created it in the University of Budapest.
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.760]   And he said to him, "Look, I want to go into business with you.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.280]   I want to sell this 3D model around the world, but the first thing you need to do is patent
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.400]   it."
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.980]   And so the professor decides to patent his invention, and that decision ends up making
[00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.200]   him eventually one of the wealthiest people in Hungary.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.080]   And when you patent something, you have to come up with a name for it.
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:21.320]   So he, in a moment of, I guess, just couldn't think of a better word, came up with the name
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.760]   for his invention and he named it after himself.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:30.320]   He called it the "Erno Rubik Magic Cube."
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:38.100]   These, by the beginning of 1980, these started to get sold in toy stores in the UK.
[00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:45.920]   By July of 1980, it was estimated that 70% of families and households in the UK owned
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.880]   one of these.
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.780]   Pretty much every stay-at-home parent had one of these and were desperately trying to
[00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.780]   solve it in the free time when they're not doing nappies or putting the kids down or
[00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:57.780]   feeding them.
[00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.180]   And they were twiddling this thing trying to get it solved.
[00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.780]   Every stay-at-home parent, including my mother.
[00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:12.140]   Some of my earliest memories as a six-year-old is my mother desperately trying to solve the
[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.400]   cube.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.220]   She was in a competition with her best friend, and they were both frantically trying to beat
[00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.860]   the other person in solving the actual cube.
[00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.700]   I remember I would come home after school and she'd be busy trying to sort the thing
[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.180]   out, but the thing never kind of looked like it's looking in my hand right now.
[00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.420]   I'm going to notice to my mom that she didn't realize this, but me and my friends who lived
[00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.380]   on the street were also in a competition.
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:41.140]   We were in a competition to see whose mother could solve the cube fastest.
[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.460]   And so every day after school, we would meet on the street and we'd be like, "How's
[00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.940]   your mother doing with the cube?"
[00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.920]   And everybody would be like, "Oh, she's amazing.
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.280]   She's almost finished it."
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:55.540]   And inside we knew that she was a complete mess and couldn't work it out at all.
[00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:01.380]   Well about nine weeks after my mom had purchased the cube, I come home one day after school
[00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.620]   and she's sitting on the kitchen table with a smile on her face.
[00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.040]   And as I walk into the room, she's like, "Ahh!"
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.940]   And she shows me the completed cube.
[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.300]   We had never seen the completed cube ever.
[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.060]   We'd only ever seen it on TV.
[00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:24.260]   We'd seen it in magazines, but never actually had held one or seen it with our eyes.
[00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.460]   I could not believe that my mom had solved the cube.
[00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:33.900]   She was the greatest mother in the universe.
[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.340]   And then my mom made a mistake.
[00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:44.980]   I asked her if I could borrow the cube so that I could show it off to my friends.
[00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.060]   I'm six years old.
[00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:52.140]   My mother must have had a lapse in concentration because she gave me the cube.
[00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:58.620]   And I had never felt more cool walking down my street holding the cube in my hand.
[00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.860]   All the kids ran up to me with eyes ablaze.
[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.460]   "Oh my gosh, your mother solved the cube.
[00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.920]   Your mother's awesome!"
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.940]   Every kid except one.
[00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.420]   There's always one kid, isn't there?
[00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:17.860]   The one kid who's jealous and envious of your mother.
[00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.740]   This kid asked if he could hold the cube.
[00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.300]   I thought that's a great idea, so I give him the cube.
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.520]   And he goes, "Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh."
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:31.580]   He makes four moves and gives it back to me.
[00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.140]   Panic begins to rise up inside of me.
[00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:38.480]   It's taken my mother nine weeks to solve the cube.
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.940]   It took my friend nine seconds to ruin the cube.
[00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:44.740]   But I thought, "Well, he only just did like four moves.
[00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.420]   If I just reverse the four moves, we'll be fine."
[00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:50.940]   And so I tried to reverse the four moves, and obviously I made it even worse than what
[00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:51.940]   it was.
[00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.580]   I then said to my friends, "Does anybody know how to solve the cube?"
[00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.540]   And of course, all my friends were like, "Yes, I know."
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:00.220]   So I gave the cube to all my friends, and they all tried to solve it.
[00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:04.060]   And after just a few moments, let me show you actually what it ended up looking like.
[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:07.420]   It ended up looking like this one right here.
[00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:12.500]   And I cannot tell you the amount of pain and panic that was going through my body.
[00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:17.140]   My mom has worked for nine weeks to make this thing look like that, and it had looked like
[00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:23.460]   that, but now it looked all messed up just like this one, and I was in absolute fear.
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:28.660]   I thought, "If I go home right now and show her this, she's going to be so angry.
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:29.900]   She's going to blow up.
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:30.900]   She's going to...
[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:31.900]   I don't know what she's going to do.
[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.260]   She's probably going to send me to my bedroom until I'm 21."
[00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.800]   That's what was going through my mind.
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.860]   So I said to my friends, "What's the way we can fix this?
[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:40.860]   How can we fix this?"
[00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.540]   And I thought, "Well, maybe I can give it to one of their mothers, and one of their
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:44.540]   mothers can fix it."
[00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.900]   And we realized that none of the mothers had fixed it.
[00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:51.500]   Then I thought, "Okay, I just need to find a kettle, and if I get the kettle and boil
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:56.660]   water and I can steam off all the individual stickers of this cube, and then I can stick
[00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:00.380]   them back on in the right way and trick my mother, and maybe that's the way to do it."
[00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:04.900]   And then I realized that there are molded plastic squares on here, and they're not stickers
[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:07.580]   at all, and you can't kind of do that.
[00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:15.940]   And so I realized that there was only one way, only one pathway that was in front of
[00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:16.940]   me.
[00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:21.440]   I had to go home and be honest about what I'd done, because I realized that the only
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:29.800]   person who could fix it was the one who had actually done it before.
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:33.540]   I remember walking into the house, and my heart's beating so fast.
[00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.020]   I mean, I'd screwed up.
[00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:38.620]   I had messed up.
[00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:44.420]   And I knew that she was going to be angry, and she had every right to be angry at me.
[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.180]   And as I walked into the kitchen, I could see her sitting at the table, and I put the
[00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:54.200]   cube behind my back like this, and I was crying, six years old, just bawling my eyes out.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.200]   And I walked into the kitchen, and my mom looked up at me, and I couldn't even look
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:07.160]   her in the eyes, and I just basically did this.
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:13.940]   I'm sure my mom was angry, but she looked at her son quivering before her, a complete
[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.380]   wreck.
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.220]   And she says these words.
[00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:23.180]   She goes, "It's okay, son.
[00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:24.760]   I've done it before.
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:28.980]   I can do it again."
[00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:37.440]   Elijah, as we saw last week, is trembling and absolutely shattered inside.
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:42.760]   He had thought that he was going to be bringing revival to Israel, and he'd had this amazing
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:47.140]   moment on the mountaintop where everything seemed to be amazing and perfect, where God
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:52.820]   came through and did great stuff, and the 850 prophets of Baal were defeated.
[00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:56.600]   But immediately after that, he hears of a death threat against his life from Ahab and
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:02.100]   Jezebel, and he's so overwhelmed and so conflicted, having thought that he had brought revival
[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:05.660]   and now realized that there was no revival, no revival in the leadership, and if there
[00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:09.940]   was going to be no revival in the leadership, then there was going to be no revival in Israel.
[00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:14.860]   And suddenly all the feelings, the emotional exhaustion, the feeling of being a failure
[00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:20.820]   hits Elijah so much, and Elijah's life suddenly spins out of control.
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:26.100]   It spins out of control so much that he can't face life anymore.
[00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:30.940]   And so he goes into the desert, and he walks in the desert, and he finds a solitary broom
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:35.020]   tree, and he lies down next to it, and he prays that God would take his life, because
[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:39.700]   he feels like he's screwed up, and he feels like God is going to be angry at him, and
[00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:44.320]   he feels like he can't face it, and God deserves to punish him.
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:47.980]   And so he comes before God, and he's like, "Just take my life.
[00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:49.300]   It's not worth living.
[00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:50.780]   I've failed you.
[00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:52.980]   I've failed Israel.
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:56.300]   Everything has gone wrong."
[00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:00.180]   And we saw last week that God shows up as an angel, in the form of an angel, and touches
[00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:04.840]   him to say, "You're not alone," and then puts food and water in his body to strengthen him
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:09.180]   so that he can go on a journey of 40 days and 40 nights.
[00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:14.460]   And then God begins to say some words over him that begins to say something to the emotional
[00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:18.220]   state that he's actually in himself.
[00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:23.620]   And so he travels 40 days and 40 nights, and he comes to this mountain, Mount Horeb,
[00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:26.100]   the mountain of God.
[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:29.900]   And he goes up into the mountain, and he finds a cave in the mountain, and he goes inside
[00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:35.300]   that cave, and he literally collapses on the floor, because he's so overwhelmed.
[00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:36.540]   He's so done.
[00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:37.920]   He's so worn out.
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:42.820]   He's so frustrated, and he needs rest.
[00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:45.700]   I want you to see what happens next.
[00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:48.820]   This is 1 Kings 19, starting in verse 9.
[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:54.860]   "And the word of the Lord came to him, 'What are you doing here, Elijah?'
[00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:58.820]   Elijah replied, 'I've been very zealous for the Lord God Almighty.
[00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:02.780]   The Israelites have rejected your covenant, broken down your altars, and put your prophets
[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:04.140]   to death with the sword.
[00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:09.500]   I'm the only one left, and now they're trying to kill me too.'
[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:14.940]   The Lord God said to him, 'Go out and stand on the mountain in the presence of the Lord,
[00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:18.580]   for the Lord is about to pass by.'
[00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:25.480]   Then a great and powerful wind tore the mountains apart and shattered the rocks before the Lord,
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.040]   but the Lord was not in the wind.
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:33.220]   And after the wind there was an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake.
[00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:38.180]   And after the earthquake came a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire.
[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:40.900]   And after the fire came a gentle whisper.
[00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:47.420]   And when Elijah heard it, he pulled his cloak over his face and went out and stood at the
[00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:49.100]   mouth of the cave."
[00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.980]   This is one of the most famous stories there is in the Old Testament.
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:55.360]   And I think sometimes when something is so famous, it can be easy for us to actually
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:14:00.180]   miss the depth of what's actually happening here and the true meaning of what's taking
[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:01.400]   place.
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.380]   What we need to understand when we approach this story is that there are things happening
[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:05.940]   in Israel and in Elijah.
[00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:10.820]   In other words, there's stuff that's happening on the national level and on the personal
[00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:12.260]   level.
[00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.860]   On the national level, Israel literally is in tatters.
[00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:22.200]   It has been worshipping the gods of Baal and Asherah for many years to this point.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:27.860]   And that idol worship has ruined their culture, has ruined their thinking.
[00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:30.100]   And they were in a dark, dark place.
[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:33.060]   Literally Israel was shattered.
[00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:37.120]   But not just that, Elijah himself was also shattered.
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:41.040]   There's something very personal going on here for Elijah.
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:44.380]   As I've just explained, he thought he was going to bring revival to Israel, but all
[00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:47.980]   he's felt, all he's thought he's seen is failure.
[00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:50.740]   He's seen the broken down of all of that stuff that's happened.
[00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:53.660]   He's seen the impact that the idol worship has had on his people.
[00:14:53.660 --> 00:15:00.060]   And now he feels like he's completely alone and all he wants to actually do is die.
[00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:07.820]   And God brings him to a very important place in the midst of this overwhelming mental health
[00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:11.260]   challenge that Elijah is going through.
[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:16.060]   God brings him to Mount Horeb, the mountain of God.
[00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:19.980]   Now this is very important to understand the point of this whole story.
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:25.100]   See Mount Horeb is known by another name in the Old Testament, that's Mount Sinai.
[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:28.500]   Mount Horeb and Mount Sinai is the same mountain.
[00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:32.140]   And so this is the place that Moses met God at.
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:36.300]   This is the place where Moses, who was running from his own mental health challenge, his
[00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:41.840]   own emotional exhaustion, having committed murder in Egypt, fled from there and tried
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:46.220]   to start a new life by covering up the brokenness that he had done in his past.
[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:51.180]   God meets him in a burning bush at the foothills of Mount Sinai.
[00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:55.420]   And in this mountain and in God's presence, God shows up in the power of his presence
[00:15:55.420 --> 00:16:01.220]   and he says, "Moses, remove your sandals because the ground you're standing on is holy ground."
[00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:04.060]   And God begins to speak to Moses and says, "I want to raise you up to be a mouthpiece
[00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:05.660]   to go back to Egypt.
[00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:08.180]   And my people have been in slavery there for 430 years.
[00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:12.220]   I want you to release them from slavery and bring them to this mountain.
[00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:16.940]   And when you come to this mountain, I will reveal my power to you and you will worship
[00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:17.940]   me."
[00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:20.220]   Now, I'm going to cut a long story short.
[00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:24.100]   You can show up for the Exodus series and hear it in all its detail over 25 weeks.
[00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.740]   But that's exactly what Moses does.
[00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:27.740]   He goes back to Egypt.
[00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:32.780]   He through the leading and the miracles of God is able to bring Israel back to the foot
[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:34.780]   of Mount Sinai.
[00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:39.780]   And as they gather around the feet of Mount Sinai, God shows up and reveals his power
[00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:40.780]   to them.
[00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:41.780]   How does that happen?
[00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:45.660]   Well, he invites Moses to walk up into the mountain whilst the whole of Israel stays
[00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:47.540]   at the foothills of the mountain.
[00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:51.380]   And as Moses goes up, God moves him into the cleft of a rock.
[00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:56.240]   And for 40 days and 40 nights, Moses is there and God reveals his power to the Israelites
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.560]   in that moment.
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:02.500]   And that power is revealed through this incredible wind that comes and shakes the mountain.
[00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:07.040]   It's revealed in an earthquake which literally shakes all of the rocks around the mountain
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.580]   so that Israel can see the power of God.
[00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:14.660]   It then comes in a pillar of fire on the top of Mount Sinai that burns all up and brings
[00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:15.660]   smoke.
[00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:21.900]   And Moses is then called to go up into the smoke, into the fire where he meets with God
[00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:23.020]   face to face.
[00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:29.980]   So Mount Horeb, Mount Sinai represents this incredible, dramatic encounter of the power
[00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:30.980]   of God.
[00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:33.920]   And Elijah has been called to go there.
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:40.100]   So Elijah is thinking God is going to show up in this place in those dramatic and powerful
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:41.100]   ways.
[00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:44.220]   We've got to be really clear that we see the parallels here.
[00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:48.220]   You see, Moses was on the mountain for 40 days and 40 nights.
[00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:52.580]   It takes Elijah 40 days and 40 nights to walk to the mountain.
[00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:55.620]   Moses is hidden by God in a cleft of the rock.
[00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:59.260]   So Elijah is now in a cave in the rock.
[00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:06.380]   And then God shows up and does exactly for Elijah what he had done for Moses except for
[00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:12.220]   one really, really, really important small detail that we need to notice.
[00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:14.980]   Let me read this to you again.
[00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:18.460]   There is a great and powerful wind that tore the mountains apart and shattered the rocks
[00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:22.780]   before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind.
[00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:27.500]   And after the wind there was an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake.
[00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:31.420]   And after the earthquake came a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire.
[00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:36.620]   This would have been a very interesting experience for Elijah experiencing this in real time.
[00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:39.540]   It's easy when we read the story to kind of think of it like a Hollywood movie.
[00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:43.820]   But Elijah is right there in the midst of this and he knows what Mount Horeb is all
[00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:44.820]   about.
[00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.020]   He was schooled in the Torah.
[00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:49.300]   He understood what would have happened and what normally happens on the mountain.
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:51.540]   He knew what had happened to Moses.
[00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:55.180]   So when this big wind started to whip up when he's in the cave, he's like, "Well, God's
[00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:56.900]   going to show up now."
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.100]   And God doesn't.
[00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:01.940]   And then when the mountain begins to shake, Elijah would have been like, "Okay, that's
[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:02.940]   kind of weird.
[00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:04.980]   He didn't show up in the wind, but I guess he's going to show up now because the mountain
[00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:06.340]   is shaking."
[00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:07.340]   And God didn't show up.
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:11.340]   And then Elijah is thinking, "Well, the last thing that happened for Moses was there was
[00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:13.020]   a fire and suddenly a fire starts."
[00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:14.780]   And he's like, "Okay, this is it.
[00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:16.620]   God's going to show up now."
[00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:19.220]   And God doesn't show up.
[00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:23.900]   And the question that the text is wanting you to ask of it is a simple one.
[00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:25.140]   Why?
[00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:30.620]   Why does God do all the same things that he had done with Moses, with Elijah, but in particular
[00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:34.420]   and specifically does not reveal his presence in those things?
[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:40.500]   Well, I think the answer to that is both national and personal.
[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:45.860]   On the national level, I think what God's doing here is showing Elijah what is actually
[00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:49.900]   happening in the communal consciousness of Israel itself.
[00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:55.340]   I think this is God saying, "Elijah, you are 100% right.
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:57.940]   Israel is in ruins."
[00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:02.700]   You see, the wind and the earthquake and the fire are these dramatic moments, and they
[00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:08.380]   represent the kind of worship that was happening in Israel at this time.
[00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:14.580]   See, the worship of Baal and Esherah was a dramatic and loud kind of worship.
[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:15.980]   There was lots of drumming.
[00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:17.540]   There was lots of noise.
[00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:18.540]   And if this was...
[00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:20.940]   Let's just pretend that this is an altar to Baal.
[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:25.560]   One of the ways in which you were worshiping Baal is you would run around the altar as
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:31.220]   fast as you can, and you would be whipping yourself up into an emotional frenzy.
[00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:35.140]   You'd be shouting out, screaming out, running around, trying to worship Baal, and thinking
[00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:39.980]   that if you can get yourself into this ecstatic emotional state, then you will have a spiritual
[00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:41.340]   experience.
[00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.980]   And I think God shows up to Elijah, and he says, "Here's the wind.
[00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:45.980]   Here's the earthquake.
[00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:46.980]   Here's the fire.
[00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:48.100]   Here's all this great noise.
[00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:49.620]   I'm not in it."
[00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:54.000]   What he's saying is, "Here's Israel and all of their worship and all of their noise and
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.300]   all of their altars."
[00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:59.940]   And they think that some God is going to show up, but I'm not in it.
[00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:05.080]   In other words, Elijah, you're right.
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:12.500]   This is a complete waste of time, and Israel is indeed in shatters.
[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:16.160]   And I think this was important for Elijah, but I think it's important for us.
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:20.780]   I think it's particularly important for us in a church like the Vine.
[00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.780]   We love worship here.
[00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:25.420]   One of the things that I think makes the Vine the Vine is that incredible worship time we've
[00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:27.060]   just had before I started speaking.
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:32.660]   We love to gather in this room and gather online and gather in Yulong and worship God
[00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:34.260]   in the way that we do.
[00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:35.860]   And our worship here is noisy.
[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:36.860]   It's loud.
[00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:37.860]   We have drums.
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:38.860]   We sing loud.
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:39.860]   It's awesome.
[00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:44.720]   But I think what God is saying is we have to be really careful in our journey with Him
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:51.940]   that our worship of Him doesn't become a worship of worship, that our worship of Him doesn't
[00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:57.860]   become some worship of an experience, or our worship of Him doesn't become instead a worship
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:02.540]   of some culture or some traditions or something else that's other than Him.
[00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:06.360]   Even if those things are good, if they're not Him, then He is not in it.
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:10.620]   We can make a huge amount of noise in this room, but if our hearts aren't in the right
[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:15.500]   place, God is not in it.
[00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:21.900]   And so God comes to Elijah and says, "What you're perceiving about Israel is correct."
[00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:26.300]   I'm not in all of that dramatic stuff.
[00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:29.420]   But God's also speaking personally to Elijah.
[00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:35.420]   You see, I think the wind and the earthquake and the fire was representative also metaphorically
[00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:39.420]   to Elijah of what was happening inside of him with his emotions.
[00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:43.020]   He was going through an absolute turmoil in his emotions.
[00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:47.660]   He was so frustrated and so angry and so depressed.
[00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:51.700]   It's almost like there was this kind of roaring wind of frustration in him that he didn't
[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:53.100]   know how to express.
[00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:57.620]   There was this like shaking earthquake anger in him that was deep inside of him.
[00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:02.220]   There was a raging fire, if you will, of depression that he couldn't quench.
[00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:03.620]   He couldn't put it out.
[00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:08.140]   And I think God shows up and shows him all the stuff that's happening around him to try
[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:12.460]   to connect to the reality of what's happening inside of him.
[00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:13.900]   He's like, "This is what it's like for you.
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:15.820]   This is how you're feeling right now.
[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:16.820]   There's all this turmoil.
[00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:18.660]   There's all this noise inside of you.
[00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:22.460]   There's all these competing emotions that are trying to tell you who you are."
[00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:26.060]   Remember last week when I was talking about how our emotions tell us who we are?
[00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:30.020]   All that stuff is happening and God's like, "I'm not there."
[00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:34.180]   And I think God understood something about Elijah here that I think we all need to grasp.
[00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:40.020]   God understood that Elijah in this moment is fragile, that Elijah in this moment is
[00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:41.900]   overwhelmed.
[00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:47.660]   And if God showed up to Elijah like he had shown up to Moses, I think Elijah would have
[00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:50.740]   imploded.
[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:54.420]   You see, Elijah didn't need some big drama in that moment.
[00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:59.060]   He had enough drama going on in himself.
[00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:08.900]   What he needed was God to come, like my mom, drew alongside of him in the time when he
[00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:15.260]   thought he would get an angry word, when he thought he should be told off.
[00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:20.380]   And God comes and gives him grace.
[00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:22.060]   Look exactly what he does.
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:27.540]   God says this, "And after the fire came a gentle whisper.
[00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:31.020]   When Elijah heard it, he pulled his cloak over his face and he went out and stood at
[00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:32.380]   the mouth of the cave."
[00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:37.740]   God wasn't in any of that drama stuff, but God comes and does something unprecedented
[00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:39.260]   in Scripture to this point.
[00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:42.540]   He just comes in a gentle whisper.
[00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:48.780]   The Hebrew here for gentle whisper really means a still, small voice, or it can be translated
[00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:53.500]   a quiet and gentle breath.
[00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:54.980]   And I think this is so beautiful.
[00:24:54.980 --> 00:25:00.300]   God's like, "I know exactly how you're feeling right now, and I'm going to come to you in
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:03.380]   the opposite of what you expect.
[00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:06.380]   I'm going to show you all the things that are happening inside of your heart, and I'm
[00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:11.700]   going to come with the one thing that you least expect that can turn all of that turmoil
[00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:13.260]   around in a moment.
[00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:16.260]   When you thought I was going to get angry at you and shout at you and send you to your
[00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:23.900]   bedroom for 21 years, I show up and say, 'It's okay.
[00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:26.540]   I'm here.
[00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:27.540]   We can do this.'"
[00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:31.660]   It's interesting here, and I think this is really important.
[00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:38.100]   We never ever know or hear the words that God spoke over Elijah.
[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:39.500]   Notice that?
[00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:42.980]   I think if we did know the words that God had spoken over Elijah in this moment that
[00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:47.620]   set Elijah on his path to healing, we would have turned those words into a formula that
[00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:50.340]   we pray for each other every time we're a bit stressed.
[00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:55.720]   I think God is very wise because God understands that every single person's story and situation
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:56.720]   is unique.
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:59.820]   And very rarely is there a one formula that works for all.
[00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:03.900]   And so we never find out what exactly it is that God says to Elijah here.
[00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:06.180]   What we see is the response.
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:11.700]   Elijah is drawn out of his cave, and he comes to the entrance, and he covers his face like
[00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:17.260]   Moses did because he knows that God is about to pass by.
[00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:24.860]   You see, where Moses needed a demonstration of the power of God, God understood that Elijah
[00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:29.220]   needed a demonstration of his intimacy.
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:33.580]   And for every single one of you here, if you've ever dealt with some sort of mental health
[00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:37.060]   challenge like I have and like I've shared with you over the last couple of weeks with
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:46.900]   anxiety, so often the last thing I need is somebody else's loud voice at me telling me
[00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:50.540]   all the things that I should do in order to get better.
[00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:59.300]   And actually what I really need is for them to just sit with me, for them to maybe shut
[00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:05.180]   up a bit and just be present.
[00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:13.660]   And Elijah discovers a God in this moment who is present with him.
[00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:20.660]   Like my mom when I was trembling with the messed up cube, and she says, "It's okay,
[00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:21.660]   son.
[00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:22.660]   I've done it before.
[00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:23.660]   I can do it again."
[00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:27.780]   Words that I least expected, but words that healed and began to transform me, words that
[00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:34.100]   were so powerful to me that I remember them verbatim 42 years later, words that were so
[00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:39.220]   powerful that I've actually tried to hold that in my heart as I've raised my own daughter,
[00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:40.220]   Mia.
[00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:43.460]   And in those moments where Mia's maybe screwed up and messed up and done stuff, and I feel
[00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:47.500]   super angry and I want to do all the things that I want to do, I often will hear those
[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:48.500]   words, "It's okay, son.
[00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:49.500]   I did it before.
[00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:50.500]   I can do it again."
[00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:51.500]   "Ah, okay."
[00:27:51.500 --> 00:28:00.020]   Let me move in an opposite spirit to the ones that the emotions inside of me are telling
[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:01.020]   me.
[00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:03.380]   Are you with me, church?
[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:07.340]   What's really interesting here too is that the idea of a whisper is something that I
[00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:08.660]   think we don't think too much about.
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:11.900]   A whisper is literally defined like this.
[00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:19.420]   A whisper is spoken words without the use of a voice, just breath.
[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:22.300]   Spoken words without the use of a voice, just breath.
[00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:29.780]   Spoken words without the use of a voice, just breath.
[00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:33.060]   And breath in Hebrew Scripture is the word ruach.
[00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:36.260]   It's also the word that's used for spirit.
[00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:42.100]   And so when God shows up to Elijah and holds back his voice and instead just brings his
[00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:48.560]   breath, his spirit, what he's communicating to Elijah in this moment is, "I'm here and
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:54.180]   it's my spirit, it's my breath that can begin to minister to you.
[00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:56.660]   That you don't need all this great big noise around you.
[00:28:56.660 --> 00:29:01.740]   It's actually my breath that can come and bring life to you in this moment."
[00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:08.020]   I think this is so important because power is seldom the thing that we need when we're
[00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:09.860]   at the end of ourselves.
[00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:15.720]   Actually, when we're like that, what we really need is relationships.
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:24.180]   We need the gentle whispers of others to help us to be reminded of our value and worth.
[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:29.060]   And I know countless times in my own journey with anxiety when friends have reached out
[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:34.420]   just to be in relationship with me, not to try to solve all my problems, but just come
[00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:38.420]   and be proximate with me.
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:44.020]   It's been like a gentle whisper nurturing to my soul.
[00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:46.940]   And I want you to know that this is how God will work with you.
[00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:51.780]   When we started this service and I said, "He wants to meet you just where you are at."
[00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:52.780]   This is God.
[00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:54.260]   You know, whispers are an amazing thing.
[00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:59.660]   When you're shouting at people, they can be a long way away from you and hear you.
[00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:04.780]   But when you whisper, you have to be close.
[00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:06.500]   You may not have heard what I said there.
[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:10.020]   I said, "When you whisper, you have to be close."
[00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:15.900]   So God shows up in a gentle whisper, which means that he wasn't far, he was close.
[00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:21.780]   And sometimes the loudness distracts, but the quietness invites.
[00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:24.580]   It welcomes us.
[00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:32.040]   So God draws near to Elijah and intentionally holds back his commanding voice and instead
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:37.140]   communicates to him in the gentleness of his spirit, his breath.
[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:40.260]   And that's exactly what he would do for you.
[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:43.420]   And if you're here today feeling overwhelmed emotionally, if you're here today stressed,
[00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:47.340]   if you're here today feeling like the world is just too much for you, I want you to be
[00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:52.740]   welcomed into the reality of a gentle whisper.
[00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:55.780]   Gentle whispers don't judge.
[00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:58.900]   Gentle whispers invite.
[00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:05.620]   And we know for Elijah, the invitation was for him to come out of his cave and stand
[00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:13.980]   in a place where he was exposed and vulnerable, but open before God to work in his life.
[00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:16.800]   And I think God's doing something else here in Elijah as well.
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:18.580]   I think this bit is really key.
[00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:21.880]   I think one of the critical things that God's doing in Elijah here, he's actually helping
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:27.500]   Elijah to understand not just what he wants to do for Elijah, but how he wants now Elijah
[00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:29.820]   to minister to others.
[00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:34.220]   In other words, the gentle whisper approach is not just so that Elijah, tattered as he
[00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:38.580]   was, could find strength in himself, but so that Elijah could then go and be a gentle
[00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:40.900]   whisper to others.
[00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:44.300]   That Elijah would be then equipped, having gone through that journey himself, to be able
[00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:47.700]   to be the offering to others in the same way.
[00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:51.980]   And I think we get this so often wrong as Christians.
[00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:56.320]   So often when we're walking with people, maybe in our families or our friend group or in
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:32:00.380]   colleagues or even here at the Vine who are struggling with anxiety or struggling with
[00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:06.220]   fear or struggling with depression, I think so often it's easy to get impatient with them.
[00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:09.060]   It's easy to get a little bit frustrated with them.
[00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:16.000]   And one thing I've come to notice is that God is so much more calmer when dealing with
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.820]   us than we are when dealing with others.
[00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:25.700]   God is so much calmer when he comes to deal with us than we are when we deal with each
[00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:27.060]   other.
[00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:31.420]   And we get frustrated, impatient, and oh my goodness, my friend, man, every time I get
[00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:32.860]   around them, they're just so depressed.
[00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:34.460]   They're just so negative all the time.
[00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:36.140]   I don't want to be around that anymore.
[00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:38.980]   We want to go up to them and go, "Look, just snap out of it.
[00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:40.620]   Have you tried smiling a bit more?
[00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:42.700]   Have you just smiled some more?
[00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:43.860]   Maybe then you'd feel better.
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:45.500]   Have you read your Bible lately?
[00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:48.860]   If you just read your Bible, that'll be the answer for all your problems.
[00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:49.860]   Have you gone to church?
[00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:52.500]   When was the last time you went to church?"
[00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:53.660]   Are you with me?
[00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:58.940]   We make an awful lot of noise out of our own insecurity of not knowing how to walk with
[00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:04.660]   people, out of our own frustrations ourselves in the situation we're in, and we end up shouting
[00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:08.980]   a lot at people, and we wonder why they never come out of their caves.
[00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:12.260]   Come on, church.
[00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:22.980]   See, we as Christ's ambassadors are God's gentle whisper to the brokenness of this world.
[00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:33.220]   And if we just stopped shouting, perhaps more people like Elijah would come out of their
[00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:34.420]   caves.
[00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:41.780]   If we could learn what it is to be God's gentle whisper to those that are struggling with
[00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:48.820]   mental health challenges around us, if we could have the courage to recognize that sometimes
[00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:55.660]   the thing they might need the most is not the roaring wind of our positivity, it's not
[00:33:55.660 --> 00:34:02.980]   the earth-shattering earthquake of our encouragement, perhaps it's not even the raging fire of our
[00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:04.460]   advice and wisdom.
[00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:12.180]   Perhaps what they need is just the physical proximity of sitting with them and them knowing
[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:19.980]   that even if we never open our mouths, we love them.
[00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:22.780]   If you've ever struggled with mental health like I have, you'll know that you'll often
[00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:23.780]   feel like this.
[00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:28.460]   You'll often feel totally conflicted and messed up inside, and your emotions are all over
[00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:30.780]   the place, and you wonder, "How do I fix this?"
[00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:34.860]   And the problem with it is that you know how you should look, or you have this perception
[00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:39.860]   of what you think is normal or what you think is right, and because you feel like this and
[00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:43.100]   you think that you should feel like this, it clashes with each other, which makes you
[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:45.260]   feel even more messed up than ever before.
[00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:48.900]   And every time you go into church, you think everybody else is looking like this when you're
[00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:51.940]   like this, when the reality is most people are looking like this and wanting us to still
[00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:52.940]   be like that as well.
[00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:54.180]   Are you with me?
[00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:59.380]   And this thing of feeling like this gets worse and worse for us, and we begin to self-condemn
[00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:00.380]   ourselves.
[00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:04.540]   We begin to look down even on ourselves because we're not kind of what we want to be.
[00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:07.140]   And we've tried everything to try to fix ourselves.
[00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:08.620]   We've tried to work really hard.
[00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:10.260]   We've tried to get our friends to fix us.
[00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:15.380]   We've tried to steam off every square and stick it right.
[00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:20.060]   But maybe we have to realize that just like me that day when I realized that the only
[00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:26.340]   one who could fix this and make it more like this was the one who did this in the first
[00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:29.600]   place.
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:38.920]   So God shows up to Elijah in the cave of his depression and says to him in a gentle
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:45.760]   whisper, "I'm the one who can do it."
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:48.720]   And my prayer for you today, whatever it is that you're facing, whatever mental health
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:52.360]   challenge you might be facing or whatever mental health challenges might be around you
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:36:01.640]   in your spirit of influence, that the shouting would come down, that the earthquakes and
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:11.320]   the fires and the wind would still, and you would hear God say this, "It's okay, my son,
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:13.480]   my daughter, my child.
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:16.440]   I've done it before.
[00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:17.440]   I can do it again."
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:20.440]   Would you pray with me?
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:24.320]   Let's pray.
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:34.600]   Father, I'm so grateful for each person here and everybody watching online.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:40.400]   And Father, we come to you in this moment.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:49.320]   Perhaps many of us are feeling like Elijah, hidden dark in a cave.
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:56.560]   And Father, we're grateful that we can come to you just as we are.
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:01.920]   We're grateful that we can come like the messed up cube, that we don't have to fix ourselves
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:07.680]   before we're accepted by you, that we don't have to get all our squares in the right place
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:12.920]   before we can come into your courts.
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:18.680]   We're grateful that in the story with Elijah, you come and meet him in the gentlest of ways.
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:24.520]   And you understood that Moses needed your power, but you also understood that Elijah
[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:27.520]   needed your gentleness and tenderness and mercy.
[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:34.040]   And Lord, as we journey in mental health together, we're grateful that we have a community here
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:39.400]   where we can be tender and merciful to one another.
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:46.560]   Father, I pray in this moment right now that your breath would come.
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:58.920]   I want to invite you as our eyes are closed, if you'd like just to respond in any way this
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:37:59.920]   morning.
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:07.280]   I invite you just to open your hands just before you, on your lap, whatever is comfortable
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:10.560]   for you.
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:18.040]   Father, we come as your people.
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:21.880]   We can't fix ourselves.
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:30.120]   We don't have the power inside of us to get all the squares back in the right place.
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:38.000]   But we're grateful that you do.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:43.480]   We're grateful that you made us fearfully and wonderfully.
[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:48.440]   We're grateful that you know every hair on our head.
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:52.880]   Grateful that you invite us to come just as we are.
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:39:01.640]   So Father, I pray for every person here, every person watching online.
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:11.560]   And I pray that they would hear your gentle whisper now.
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:33.160]   Just invite the Spirit of God to be with you.
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:35.740]   (gentle music)
[00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:38.580]   (water trickling)
[00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:41.160]   (gentle music)
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:44.000]   (water trickling)
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.580]   (gentle music)

[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:57.420]   (gentle music)
[00:39:57.420 --> 00:40:00.260]   (water trickling)
[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:02.840]   (gentle music)
[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:05.680]   (water trickling)

[00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:13.680]   (gentle music)
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:16.520]   (water trickling)
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:19.100]   (gentle music)
[00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:21.940]   (water trickling)
[00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:24.520]   (gentle music)
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:27.360]   (water trickling)
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:29.940]   (gentle music)

[00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:35.360]   (gentle music)
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:38.200]   (water trickling)
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:40.780]   (gentle music)
[00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:43.620]   (water trickling)
[00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:46.200]   (gentle music)
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:49.040]   (water trickling)
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:51.620]   (gentle music)
[00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:54.460]   (water trickling)
[00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:57.040]   (gentle music)
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.880]   (water trickling)
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:02.460]   (gentle music)
[00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:05.300]   (water trickling)
[00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:07.880]   (gentle music)
[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:10.720]   (water trickling)
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:13.300]   (gentle music)
[00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:38.480]   Father, just thank you so much for
[00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:41.700]   the ways in which you meet your people.
[00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:47.460]   And we ask that your gentleness,
[00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:48.500]   your tender mercy,
[00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:51.080]   would mark us.
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:55.000]   And we thank you for the times that you show up
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:55.840]   in your power,
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:58.460]   when you do shake us.
[00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:03.600]   We're grateful that you do move amongst your people
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:04.440]   in that way.
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:10.600]   But we're also thankful that you come and meet us like this.
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:15.060]   And that you still the busyness of Hong Kong,
[00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:20.560]   all its earthquakes and fires and winds.
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:24.780]   And you meet us as your people.
[00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:29.860]   And you meet us just as we don't expect,
[00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:32.700]   perhaps as we don't deserve.
[00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:35.440]   (gentle music)
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:41.200]   Father, I pray that you would draw us out of our caves.
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:45.860]   I pray we'd meet with you.
[00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:52.160]   Just keep your eyes closed.
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:53.000]   I wanna encourage you,
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.420]   we're gonna close the service in a second.
[00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:58.040]   But if you'd like to stay and just,
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:02.260]   just maybe have somebody pray with you around you,
[00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:03.460]   maybe you've come with some friends
[00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:05.740]   and you want to just receive prayer,
[00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:08.000]   encourage you just to share and maybe pray together.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:08.960]   If you wanna come forward,
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:10.880]   we'll have prayer teams available
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.620]   in the upper house and lower house.
[00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:15.880]   If you need to leave in a moment,
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:17.080]   I encourage you to leave.
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:18.300]   That's great, that's fine.
[00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:20.140]   Just please leave quietly.
[00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:25.340]   But if you'd like to stay and just spend some more time
[00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:28.520]   in the quietness of God,
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:30.440]   you're more than welcome to do that too.
[00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:33.460]   Father, I thank you for today
[00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:35.020]   and for these incredible people.
[00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:37.940]   I pray your ministry would stay with us this week
[00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:39.240]   in such beautiful ways.
[00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:43.060]   Jesus' name, amen.
[00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:45.180]   God bless, guys.
[00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:47.760]   (gentle music)
