1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
 Oh man, it's so good to be here with you.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,360
 If you're new to the Vine, my name's Andrew.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,640
 I'm one of the pastors here, and it's just great that we get to fellowship.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,240
 It's great that we get to come together in a city like we live in and worship God in

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,320
 that way and just for that resurrection power to be at work in that.

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,280
 And that's my prayer for you as we open this time of just hearing from God's Word that

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:27,080
 you would continue to know and to understand and to feel that resurrection power in you.

8
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,960
 A number of years ago, I was in a work meeting.

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,800
 I was in a work meeting where I was feeling way out of my depth, way, way out of my comfort

10
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,800
 zone.

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,360
 I wonder if you've ever been in a work meeting like that where you realize that you're the

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,880
 dumbest person in the room.

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,520
 Anyone ever been in that moment?

14
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,080
 If not, you need a new job, okay?

15
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,960
 You need a new job.

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,960
 I was in a meeting.

17
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:53,520
 At the time, I was working for a US investment bank, and I was in this meeting room in our

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,680
 offices in Tokyo.

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,840
 Now I wasn't actually supposed to be in this meeting, but one of my colleagues had called

20
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,280
 in sick that morning, and my boss had asked me to represent them in this meeting.

21
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:12,200
 And the reason why I was incredibly nervous, sweaty and shaky kind of nervous, was that

22
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:18,200
 this meeting was with four of the top bankers, investment bankers in our bank in the whole

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,200
 of Asia.

24
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,600
 These four people were well known to everybody who worked in the bank.

25
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,160
 They were revered, and they were feared.

26
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,040
 I realized just before the meeting, I was thinking about this.

27
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:33,880
 I was thinking their combined net worth was probably higher than the GDP of some small

28
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,880
 Asian countries.

29
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,000
 I mean, these were very powerful people.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,840
 I was just 24 years old at the time.

31
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,440
 I didn't really know anything, and I was subbing in for a colleague into this meeting that

32
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,680
 I really had no preparation for.

33
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,880
 I made sure that I got to that meeting super early.

34
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,440
 That was a meeting that I was not going to be late to, right?

35
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,560
 So I get there super early.

36
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,080
 I go into this room, big, huge conference room, massive conference table.

37
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,640
 And I'm trying to go, "Okay, where do I sit on this table that would be the best for when

38
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,640
 these people arrive?"

39
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,120
 And I'm looking at the table, and I decide I'm going to sit right down in the middle

40
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,360
 of this long conference table.

41
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,760
 That'll give people the chance to kind of sit around me when they come in, and we'll

42
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,480
 all be gathered in the center of the table.

43
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,920
 Well about five minutes of me just sitting there, kind of sweaty and a bit shaky, these

44
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,320
 four men walk into the room.

45
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,360
 They all come in together about five minutes late, and they're chatting kind of like in

46
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,720
 loud voices together, and that kind of confident tone that people who have incredible power

47
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,680
 and incredible wealth sort of hold.

48
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,560
 And I'm sitting there thinking, "Oh my gosh, this is literally the worst day of my life."

49
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,640
 And as they come in, they sit on the far other end of the conference table, and they sit

50
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,320
 down just the four of them at the head of the table, and I could realize that they had

51
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,920
 no idea there was somebody else in the room.

52
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,880
 Or if they knew it, they were just plain ignoring me.

53
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,400
 And they keep on chatting together, and after a little while, one of them looks up, and

54
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,080
 he stares at me, and perhaps for the first time, they realize that there's somebody else

55
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,360
 in the room, and he says this.

56
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,360
 He goes, "Who are you?"

57
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,360
 It's a great way to start a meeting, right?

58
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,360
 "Who are you?"

59
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,640
 And I'm like, "I'm Andrew.

60
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,840
 I'm Miko's replacement.

61
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,600
 She's sick today, so I'm in this meeting with you."

62
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,640
 And they kind of just stared at me, all four of them.

63
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,800
 And then they turned around and started chatting together again.

64
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,400
 And they weren't even chatting about what we were supposed to be talking about in the

65
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,400
 meeting.

66
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,040
 They were just chatting amongst themselves.

67
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,840
 And as I sat there, really awkward, I listened in to what they were talking about.

68
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,320
 They were talking about the state of the world, and most specifically, actually, they were

69
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,640
 talking about the state of humanity, which was really quite fascinating.

70
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,600
 These four bankers were talking about the state of humanity, and I realized after a

71
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,800
 little while that they were having a debate amongst themselves, and two of them were arguing

72
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,000
 one position, and the other two were arguing the other.

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,720
 Two of them were basically saying humanity is essentially sick, that the human condition

74
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,840
 is essentially sick, and humanity is in need of a doctor.

75
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,840
 And if humanity can work out what it needs to help itself, then humanity can get better,

76
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,600
 and perhaps in the future, it might be able to thrive.

77
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,440
 The other two bankers were arguing the opposite.

78
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,360
 They were saying, "No, no, humanity is not sick.

79
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,720
 Humanity is well.

80
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,400
 Humanity essentially is good.

81
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,400
 Look at our intelligence.

82
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,400
 Look at our wisdom.

83
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,420
 Look at the gifts and the talents that humans have.

84
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:33,160
 Look through human history and the amazing ways that humans have done things in this

85
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,160
 world."

86
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,660
 They were just saying, "Look, humanity is well.

87
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,160
 It doesn't need a doctor.

88
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,680
 It needs opportunity.

89
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,880
 And the more opportunity that's created for humanity, the best, the fittest, and the best

90
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,680
 will emerge to the top, and they'll lead the world into a better future."

91
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,320
 And they were arguing back and forth.

92
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,320
 "Humanity is sick.

93
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,320
 Humanity is well.

94
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,320
 Humanity is sick.

95
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,320
 Humanity is well."

96
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,800
 And I'm sitting there, and after a while, about five minutes of this, one of them turns

97
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,560
 to me and he goes, "Miko's replacement."

98
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,560
 Doesn't even say Andrew, right?

99
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,560
 He's like, "Miko's replacement.

100
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,360
 What do you think?

101
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:10,000
 Do you think humanity is essentially sick and in need of a doctor, or do you think humanity

102
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,400
 is essentially well and just needs some opportunity?"

103
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,920
 All four of them are staring at me to see what I say.

104
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,480
 And this is like the worst position you can be in, right?

105
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,720
 Because whatever I answer, whichever side I take, I'm going to offend at least two of

106
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,960
 these powerful people in the room, right?

107
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,640
 So I'm like, "Is there a right answer here?"

108
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,920
 And I'm trying to desperately work out, "What's the answer that they are wanting me to say?"

109
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,640
 And as I'm trying to think about that, the Holy Spirit speaks to me.

110
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,080
 And the Holy Spirit, out of nowhere, says this to me.

111
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:45,000
 He says, "What would the Apostle Paul say to that question?"

112
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,800
 I wonder if you've ever been in a situation where you didn't want God to speak to you?

113
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,520
 Anyone been in that kind of, anyone been in that sort of situation where God says something

114
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,480
 to your spirit and you're like, "Not now, God.

115
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,680
 I'll get back to being a Christian after this meeting, okay?

116
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,600
 I don't want to interact with you right now.

117
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,280
 I'm trying to save my career with these four very powerful people."

118
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,760
 And God said again, "What would the Apostle Paul say to that question?"

119
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,360
 And I remember this real quick prayer as these guys are watching me.

120
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,160
 I remember saying, "Lord, if I say that, they will probably fire me.

121
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,760
 I will lose my job and my wife will leave me."

122
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,880
 I'm catastrophizing at this point.

123
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,400
 And here's what the Holy Spirit said, "If you believe what the Apostle Paul taught,

124
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,680
 then you should say it."

125
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:43,340
 So I look up at these four men who are staring at me, and I say, "I actually think there's

126
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,440
 a third option.

127
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,680
 I actually don't think that humanity is sick and in need of a doctor.

128
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,840
 I don't think humanity is well and in need of opportunity.

129
00:06:52,840 --> 00:07:04,800
 I think actually humanity's dead and in need of resurrection."

130
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,160
 They did not clap.

131
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:18,480
 In fact, the four of them just stared at me for what felt like a really long time.

132
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,740
 And then they started to talk together and ignored me the rest of the meeting.

133
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:28,280
 They obviously thought I was some religious nut.

134
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:35,060
 And I suddenly in that moment realized that for the first time in my life, I truly resonated

135
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,700
 with what Paul says.

136
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:44,580
 I knew in that moment that my career was dead and desperately in need of resurrection.

137
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:49,100
 You may understand now that I am no longer a banker.

138
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,020
 I'm a pastor.

139
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,540
 That is my story.

140
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:59,460
 It's an interesting thing, though.

141
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:04,100
 This idea that humanity is spiritually dead and in need of resurrection, it's not a very

142
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,220
 popular one in modern cultural society.

143
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:13,180
 Fascinatingly, actually, it's not a very popular one even in a lot of churches.

144
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:17,700
 Because it's easier to tell people that humanity's just sick, a little bit sick and in need of

145
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,700
 a doctor.

146
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:24,100
 And if you get the right amount of self-help and the right amount of exercise and the right

147
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:28,380
 amount of positive thinking, if you read my latest book that I've written on leadership

148
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:33,100
 abilities to you, you'll be able to thrive and flourish as best as possible.

149
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,820
 It's easier to tell people that.

150
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,620
 It's easier, in fact, to tell them that, "No, actually, you're well.

151
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,620
 You're fantastic.

152
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,620
 That everything you should ever need for future prosperity is found within you.

153
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,580
 You just need to try harder.

154
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,100
 You just need to do this.

155
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,660
 You need to read this," or whatever it might be.

156
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,100
 It's actually easy to tell people that they're essentially well and they just need better

157
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,100
 opportunity.

158
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,820
 "Oh, if you had better opportunity, if you had better circumstances in life, everything

159
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,860
 would be fine for you."

160
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:07,340
 It's not easy to actually represent biblical truth, to actually represent how the scriptures

161
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:13,620
 speak about the human condition because it's challenging, because it puts us in a bit of

162
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:20,180
 an awkward space and it asks some really big questions about us.

163
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:25,380
 And when the Apostle Paul is writing to his church in Ephesus and he's trying to communicate

164
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:30,820
 to them the heart of the Father, he's trying to communicate what God's will is in the world,

165
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:36,620
 he's trying to pray for them and show them the power that is put aside for them in a

166
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:41,300
 God who has been raised from death to life and now is the name that is above every name

167
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,620
 and that every knee is going to bow under that as he's talking about all these incredible

168
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,620
 things.

169
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,900
 He comes to the second chapter and he says, "Now I want to talk about you.

170
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:55,940
 I want you to understand who you are and what your condition is."

171
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:02,260
 Because if you can understand the human condition, then you can actually understand in a new

172
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:09,420
 way the profundity and the power and the wonder and the majesty of the gospel.

173
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:13,380
 Because when we understand who we are, we begin to get a different revelation of the

174
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:21,700
 work that Christ has done for us and we cannot step back and say, "Hallelujah!"

175
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:29,260
 Because we realize that it's not about us trying to fix ourselves, but we are literally

176
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:32,820
 dead and in need of resurrection.

177
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:41,780
 And when the one who comes to bring resurrection comes, we find ourselves in a posture of humble

178
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:49,260
 gratitude and thankfulness and an infused life so that we can actually begin to live

179
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,680
 in the way that we were truly created to be.

180
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,900
 We have to journey through death to receive life.

181
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,380
 And Paul writes to the church about this.

182
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:03,900
 These are some of the most famous words that Paul writes in any of his letters in the New

183
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,900
 Testament.

184
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,620
 I'm going to read this to you in a minute and you're going to recognize a bunch of these

185
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:13,360
 things, themes and ideas and a theology that is very familiar to us if you've been coming

186
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,360
 to church for a while.

187
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,580
 It's so familiar to you.

188
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:20,500
 But I pray that as we unpack this a little bit together as a community today, you'll

189
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,740
 come to a deeper understanding about the reality of what it is that Christ has done for you

190
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:29,340
 and that those dead things that we've been talking about so far on the surface, that

191
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:35,060
 in those dead areas you might believe again that they could come to resurrected life.

192
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:40,140
 Let me read this to you from Ephesians chapter 2, verse 1.

193
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:48,940
 As for you, notice this, you were dead, not sick, not well, you were dead in your transgressions

194
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:53,220
 and sins in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the

195
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:58,660
 ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient.

196
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:03,860
 All of us lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our sinful nature and following

197
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,460
 its desires and thoughts.

198
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:11,760
 Like the rest, we were by nature, notice that, by nature objects of wrath.

199
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:17,020
 But because of his great love for us, God who is rich in mercy made us now alive with

200
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:23,340
 Christ even when we were dead in our transgressions, for it is by grace that you have been saved.

201
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:28,260
 And God has raised us up with Christ and now has seated us in the heavenly realms in Christ

202
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:34,100
 Jesus in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his

203
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:38,980
 grace expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus.

204
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:44,100
 For it is by grace that you have been saved, through faith.

205
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,820
 And this not for a work in yourself, for it is the gift of God, not by works so that you

206
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,660
 cannot boast.

207
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:56,700
 For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works which God prepared

208
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,740
 in advance for us to do.

209
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:03,740
 Father, I just pray that as we open your word here, you would move by your spirit, that

210
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:08,420
 there would be a demonstration of your spirit's power and that for some people in this room

211
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:13,020
 who right now feel they are dead, that they would be brought to life, Lord.

212
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:17,580
 And I pray for areas in our lives where we're looking for you to move, you would, through

213
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,580
 your word.

214
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,380
 And we pray this in Jesus' name.

215
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:24,140
 Everyone says, "Paul doesn't mince his words.

216
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:28,900
 He speaks direct to his church because he wants them to understand who they were before

217
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:33,100
 they met Christ and now what Christ has done in and through them."

218
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,820
 And what I want to do with us just over the next number of minutes here is I want to actually

219
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,020
 map out for you how Paul presents this.

220
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:44,900
 Because the gospel presented in this way is such a profound realization for his people

221
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:51,020
 and he wants them to journey through these 10 verses from a place of death to resurrection.

222
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:55,140
 So the first three verses, he starts with this profound thing.

223
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,780
 He says, "We have to understand that we were dead."

224
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:03,260
 Again, not sick, in a need of a doctor, not well, in a need of some opportunity.

225
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:09,780
 Literally when it came to the spirit, when it comes to our soul, humanity is dead.

226
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:13,660
 The word that he uses in the Greek here in these three verses, the way that it's phrased,

227
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,020
 he's talking about absolute and universal.

228
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:19,060
 He's not just saying, "Hey, some people are dead."

229
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,020
 He's not just saying the really bad people, the really evil people, the people like Hitler,

230
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,780
 they're the dead ones.

231
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,540
 He's saying all of us.

232
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:29,780
 No one escapes the reality that because of what happened in the garden, because although

233
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:36,100
 Christ created humanity well and good in Genesis 1 and 2 and blessed them, in Genesis 3 they

234
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,860
 chose to take of that fruit that they were told not to.

235
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:43,340
 In that, the disobedience of sin and rebellion came into the human spirit.

236
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:48,740
 And basically from that point onwards, humanity has been dead in its soul.

237
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:53,140
 And it's dead and crying out for new life.

238
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:57,060
 And so Paul's starting point for his church is to understand that there was a time where

239
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:01,180
 in the transgressions and their sin, they found themselves dead.

240
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:06,340
 In fact, in unpacking this idea of death, he says there are three things in these three

241
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:10,940
 verses, three things that have been at work to cause us to die.

242
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:19,580
 He says it's the world, he said it's the devil, and he said it's flesh.

243
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:25,020
 He says we are in the world and the ways of the world have been acting upon us.

244
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:29,740
 For Paul, this is the area of something that is outside of us, something that is without

245
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:33,740
 us, outside of us, acting upon us.

246
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:39,140
 And he's basically saying that the world and its cultures and its brokenness and this depravity

247
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:43,340
 of sin that's working through the world's cultures and the world's systems is keeping

248
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,340
 you dead.

249
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:49,300
 It's wanting you to follow its way of thinking, but that is not the right way of thinking.

250
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,780
 There is a third way.

251
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,420
 And he's saying that there is this death that is there.

252
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,380
 He then speaks about the devil.

253
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,820
 He says the ruler of the kingdom of air.

254
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:02,260
 It's a beautiful phrase from him, a ruler of the kingdom of the air.

255
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,180
 This is the reality of evil.

256
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:08,260
 He says evil is present in this world and we can't shy away from the fact that there

257
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:13,460
 is good, yes, but there is also evil and this evil is beyond us.

258
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,900
 It's beyond anything that we could ever think or imagine.

259
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,700
 It's out there in the world and there is a ruler of the kingdom of the air and that is

260
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,700
 at work.

261
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:26,100
 And his spirit is also causing us to become disobedient, he teaches.

262
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,740
 He then says that all of us at some point, we have had these cravings inside of us to

263
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,140
 satisfy, to gratify our sinful nature.

264
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,700
 In other places he uses this word flesh.

265
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:42,820
 It's just the idea of our sinful brokenness and this is within us.

266
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:47,620
 So he's saying without us, in other words, what is around, he's saying beyond us is evil

267
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,140
 that is there in the world.

268
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:54,780
 He's saying within us are brokenness and our sin and transgressions that are within us.

269
00:16:54,780 --> 00:17:02,260
 These three things mean that we in our soul, the thing that is eternal in our spirit, we're

270
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,620
 dead.

271
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:07,260
 He's not saying, "Hey, humans can't do anything good."

272
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:12,260
 He's not saying that humans don't have the ability to be kind or to be loving or to be

273
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,480
 selfless or to be generous.

274
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,900
 He's not speaking about just the behavioral stuff we do.

275
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,620
 He's talking about the soul.

276
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:25,380
 He's talking about our spiritual soul and he's saying that is dead.

277
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,020
 Before you met Christ, that's the only way to think about it.

278
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,700
 Are you following this?

279
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,700
 That's the first three verses.

280
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,220
 He's like, "You've got to make sure you're starting in the right place."

281
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:41,260
 But then he actually goes and says in verses four to seven, but he says, "You, we are now

282
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,700
 alive.

283
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:47,420
 We've been made alive in Christ."

284
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,420
 The beautiful phrase.

285
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,340
 He's like, "Even when we were dead."

286
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,340
 Notice this.

287
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:57,780
 "Even when we were dead in our transgressions, Christ came and paid the price, life, death,

288
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:04,020
 and resurrection, so that we now are made alive," is the phrase he uses, "made alive

289
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,020
 in Christ."

290
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,780
 That's the same phrase he uses in other places.

291
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:12,140
 Sometimes it's translated, "Resurrected in Christ."

292
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:16,340
 It's profound what Paul's doing here because he's just spent a bunch of verses in chapter

293
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:20,700
 one, unpacking the idea of what God did in Christ.

294
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,860
 That Christ, in submitting himself to the will of his Father, went to the cross, paid

295
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:32,020
 the price for sin, went into death, but was raised from death to life, then became the

296
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:37,460
 name that is above every name that every ruler and power and authority needs to submit now

297
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,420
 under the authority of Christ.

298
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,620
 Christ is now in this place.

299
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:45,260
 And actually, Paul has just written in chapter one that Christ now sits at the right hand

300
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:50,820
 of the Father in the heavenly realms, and that at the name of Jesus, every knee will

301
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,420
 bow on heaven and earth.

302
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:56,820
 And all of this is happening for the glory of the church.

303
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:01,940
 So he's just unpacked this beautiful picture of Jesus' journey from death to resurrection.

304
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,340
 Now at the beginning of chapter two, he flips it onto us.

305
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:09,100
 He says, "You need to understand the journey you've been in, because you were once dead,

306
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,820
 just like Christ.

307
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:15,580
 But you have, through his Spirit, been raised from death to life."

308
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,860
 And then he takes it a step further.

309
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,100
 This blows my mind.

310
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:23,020
 He says, "And not only that, not only has he raised you, but you are now seated," he

311
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:28,340
 says, "in this area that he calls the heavenly realms."

312
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,620
 I want you to just get your head around this for a moment.

313
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:36,540
 We're not just resurrected in Christ, but we are now raised up to the heavenly realms,

314
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:40,140
 and we sit with Christ in the heavenly realms.

315
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:46,460
 The picture is one of relationship, one of friendship, one of camaraderie, sitting together.

316
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,540
 It's a picture of relaxation and not stress.

317
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:53,300
 When you're sitting with the one who has all authority over everything in the world, we

318
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,620
 find ourselves in shalom, peace.

319
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:02,740
 And Paul's saying, "This is what those who are in Christ Jesus, you are spiritually sitting

320
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:07,420
 with Christ in the heavenly realms, at the right hand of the Father with Christ."

321
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:12,380
 In other words, all of the power that he had spoken about in the prayer that we looked

322
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:16,820
 at last week and that I was preaching about last week, all of that power is now found

323
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:22,600
 in us spiritually because we are at the right hand of the Father as well, seated with Christ.

324
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,700
 It blows our minds.

325
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,500
 Now I want you to see what Paul's doing here in saying this.

326
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:34,580
 He wants to draw this contrast between the lowest possible thing, you are literally dead,

327
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:39,460
 to the highest possible thing, you are now seated in Christ Jesus on the right hand of

328
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,140
 the Father in the Spirit.

329
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,020
 Isn't that beautiful?

330
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:47,780
 And for Paul, the reason why he's saying this, because he wants us to understand that there

331
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:54,900
 are only two types of human beings, those who are dead and those who are seated with

332
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,540
 Christ in the heavenly realms, just two.

333
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:03,700
 Those who are spiritually dead and those who are alive and been made alive in Christ and

334
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,940
 are seated at the right hand of the Father.

335
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:11,780
 This is hope.

336
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:17,700
 But in this, Paul is saying, "Do you want to know how this happens?

337
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,700
 Do you want to know?"

338
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,700
 Because guess what?

339
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:24,780
 Like Ezekiel, when God says to him, "Can these bones live?"

340
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:30,140
 Ezekiel's response is, "Sovereign Lord, only you know."

341
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,580
 And it's the same in humanity.

342
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:40,620
 Can we live when we've been soaked in the travesty of our transgressions and sins?

343
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,780
 Only you, Lord, know.

344
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:47,940
 Only you can bring this dead thing to life.

345
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:53,380
 This is why in verses 8 and 9, Paul explains how that process takes place, how new life

346
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,380
 comes.

347
00:21:54,380 --> 00:22:02,220
 And he says, "This is why you've been saved by grace through faith, not by your own works,

348
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,860
 so that no one can boast."

349
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:09,740
 He talks about a negative and a positive as he's trying to speak about this beauty of

350
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,740
 the gospel.

351
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,380
 First of all, he starts with the negative.

352
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:18,100
 He says there's this thing called works, our human works, the things that we are trying

353
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,260
 to do to maybe try to be better people.

354
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:25,900
 He's saying, "You've got to understand that this cannot ever save you, that salvation

355
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,940
 is not about what we can do.

356
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:32,260
 And this is countercultural to what we see in society."

357
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:36,100
 I want to challenge us that it's countercultural to what we see in Hong Kong, because Hong

358
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:41,980
 Kong is literally built on a culture of meritocracy, on a culture of if you try really hard, if

359
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:46,020
 you work really hard, if you become the best student in your class, you can get certain

360
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:49,860
 things, if you go to the right kind of universities, you can get the right kind of jobs.

361
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:55,780
 And our thinking always in the world around us is, "If I do more, I will get more."

362
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,340
 Are you with me?

363
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:01,300
 And Paul doesn't want his church in Ephesus to bring that into their thinking about their

364
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,820
 spirit or into their thinking about their relationship with God.

365
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:07,500
 If I do more, I'm going to get more.

366
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,420
 And he cuts it out right at the start.

367
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,580
 And he says, "You're not saved by anything you do.

368
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:17,500
 You cannot ever do enough to earn your salvation," he's saying.

369
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,680
 And this is important because he's basically said to us, "You're dead.

370
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,620
 Dead things don't do anything, by the way."

371
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:26,220
 You want to know why works doesn't save you?

372
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,900
 It's because you're dead.

373
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,500
 And if you're dead, you can't do anything.

374
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,840
 That's number one.

375
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:40,460
 Number two is this, even if you could do something, your greatest moral acts will always pale

376
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,160
 into insignificance to the righteousness of Christ.

377
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:48,820
 No matter how great we could be, no matter how much we could do, no matter how much we

378
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:52,980
 could do for charity, how nice of a person we could be, how much love we could give,

379
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:57,660
 it would always pale in significance to the righteousness that is found in Christ.

380
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:03,100
 When we try to compare our righteousness with the righteousness of Christ, pride fills us

381
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,740
 and we're heading towards more and more sin.

382
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:10,140
 And Paul's saying, "Your works, both because you're dead, you can't do in any way, but

383
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:14,300
 even if you could do them, they wouldn't even compare to the righteousness found in Christ.

384
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:21,420
 None of that is going to get you anywhere, so no one can boast."

385
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,700
 This is really important.

386
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,820
 In the Greek and Roman culture, boasting was a huge thing.

387
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:29,740
 We'll talk more about that in another week, but even here in Hong Kong, boasting is a

388
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,740
 big thing still, isn't it?

389
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,740
 Oh, no, it's not.

390
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,740
 Okay.

391
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:37,980
 It's not about the car I drive, the watch I wear, the clothes I have, the university

392
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,020
 that my kids have gone to.

393
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,780
 We love to boast, I think, all the time.

394
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:47,300
 Could you imagine what church would be like if we actually earned our salvation?

395
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,860
 Have you ever stopped and thought about that for a moment?

396
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:53,380
 Can you imagine what church would be like if all of us earned our way into heaven?

397
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:57,860
 Number one, most of us would not be in this room, myself included.

398
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:03,300
 Number two, those of us that did get in, we'd be like, "Whoa, we got in."

399
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,300
 And no one else did.

400
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,300
 We're the cool ones.

401
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,300
 We're the lucky ones.

402
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,300
 We're the great ones.

403
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,300
 We're the awesome ones.

404
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:12,860
 Paul's like, "There is no room for that kind of mental thinking or that attitude within

405
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,860
 the church.

406
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:17,540
 No, you are all dead, even in your transgressions and sin.

407
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:23,900
 But when you were dead, Christ raised you from death to life, not because you did anything

408
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:29,300
 so that no one could boast, so that no other name other than the name of Jesus would be

409
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,540
 heard in the world.

410
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:35,940
 Not a name of a church, a name of a preacher, a name of a worship leader, a name of a song,

411
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,980
 not anything like that.

412
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:41,140
 The only thing that gets to be projected in this world is Christ.

413
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:44,620
 That's why our works don't save us," Paul's saying.

414
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:47,460
 So you're not saved by works.

415
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:52,260
 He says this, "You're saved simply by this incredible idea of grace."

416
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:59,100
 Grace, this Greek word means unmerited favor, this idea of a gift.

417
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:04,180
 This idea of a gift that we have, and we talked about this quite a lot at the Vine, we have

418
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:09,620
 not earned and we have not deserved.

419
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,560
 We actually sing about that quite a bit as well.

420
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,560
 We have not earned it.

421
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,700
 We have not deserved it.

422
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,780
 But we have this incredible grace from God.

423
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:19,180
 And here's the reason Paul is saying that it is not deserved or earned.

424
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,500
 It is not deserved because you're dead.

425
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,660
 It is not earned because none of your works could ever get you there.

426
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,660
 That's grace.

427
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:32,100
 And he's saying that this grace is at work in this world.

428
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:37,820
 And that you, because you have experienced that grace in you, you are now living examples

429
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:40,140
 of that grace.

430
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:44,180
 And Paul is mapping out this beautiful picture because he wants his church to understand

431
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:50,180
 the journey that they've been on, but also the journey that others could go on as well.

432
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:54,540
 Because Christ has gone to the cross, Paul is saying, and he's paid the price for sin,

433
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:58,460
 and he's been raised from death to life, and he now sits at the right hand of the Father.

434
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:05,060
 And anyone who comes to believe in him, anyone who asks for the forgiveness of sins, who

435
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:09,940
 confesses the name of Jesus, they also can be saved.

436
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,220
 Anyone.

437
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,940
 Now this is not universalism.

438
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:15,620
 Christ has done it on the cross, therefore everybody's saved, and it doesn't matter what

439
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,620
 you do in life.

440
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:22,220
 No, Paul breaks the idea of universalism with one simple phrase in the passage here in verse

441
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,220
 8 and 9.

442
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,220
 He says, "Through faith."

443
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:29,020
 It's a really important little phrase he says.

444
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:34,100
 We are saved by grace, not by our works, through faith.

445
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:41,660
 In other words, there is something we as humanity do to align ourselves to the work of the cross.

446
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:45,940
 It's not some universalism where Christ has died for all, and it doesn't matter what you

447
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,940
 do.

448
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,140
 No, we align ourselves.

449
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:51,180
 We receive the power of the work of the cross.

450
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:56,300
 We receive the power of resurrection life through faith.

451
00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:00,060
 Through recognizing that Christ has done this, and moving in that.

452
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,800
 For Paul, the definition of faith is two things.

453
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,900
 It is both belief and trust.

454
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,820
 Is this helping anyone so far?

455
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,980
 Both belief and trust.

456
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,060
 And both of those things are important.

457
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,420
 Sometimes we think faith is just about belief.

458
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,860
 As long as I can believe the right things, then everything's going to be okay.

459
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:21,940
 For Paul, if you look throughout his letters, it's belief and trust.

460
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,300
 Those two things work hand in hand.

461
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,300
 Give you an example of this.

462
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:31,340
 A number of years ago, I was at university in a place called Durham in the northeast

463
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,500
 of England.

464
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:36,300
 Durham has this beautiful river that runs through the center of the town, and there

465
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:41,620
 are some high, maybe 40 feet or so cliffs that are around it, and then the river weaves

466
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,420
 through the town.

467
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,300
 At university, there's this thing called Freshers' Week.

468
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:49,340
 It probably happened at your university too, where all the new people come to the university,

469
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:52,460
 and parties are held, and bands play.

470
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:55,820
 In my time, weird as it sounds, there was a circus.

471
00:28:55,820 --> 00:29:00,460
 They had a circus at the university to welcome in all the new people.

472
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:03,580
 One of the circus acts was the tightrope walking thing.

473
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:11,580
 On one day, this guy strung a metal wire across the two sides of the cliff face over the river,

474
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:15,460
 and he walked from one side to the other on this small little tightrope.

475
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,460
 It was amazing.

476
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:21,540
 There were many of us in the crowd that day watching this guy walk from one side to the

477
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,540
 other.

478
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,820
 We thought halfway across he was going to fall.

479
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,180
 He would shake, but no.

480
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,980
 He got from one side to the other.

481
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:29,580
 We were cheering him when he got to the other side.

482
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,900
 When he got to the other side, he did this crazy thing.

483
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:36,620
 He took a colleague from the circus, a light person.

484
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,620
 They weren't that heavy.

485
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:43,860
 He put him up on his shoulders, and then he walked back the other way with this guy on

486
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,860
 his shoulders.

487
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,100
 It was one of the most amazing things I've ever seen.

488
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:50,340
 I can't believe that he's doing this with a guy on his shoulders.

489
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:53,340
 We surely thought he was going to die every step of the way, but he got there to the other

490
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,340
 side.

491
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,020
 When he got to the other side, we were cheering.

492
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,020
 We were screaming.

493
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:59,240
 This was the coolest thing we'd ever seen.

494
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,300
 As the guy gets off his shoulders, the guy who just walked across, he points to somebody

495
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,300
 in the crowd.

496
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:08,340
 He goes, "Do you believe that I could do this with you?"

497
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:12,420
 The guy in the crowd was trying to shrink away.

498
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,900
 He said what I think all of us were feeling in that moment.

499
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:18,100
 He was like, "Well, I believe you can do it because I've just seen you do it, but I don't

500
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:22,180
 know if I would trust you to do it."

501
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,180
 This is faith.

502
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:27,580
 It's more than just the belief that Jesus died and rose again.

503
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:35,980
 It's trusting your life to him and entrusting, trusting that he will carry you from here

504
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,980
 to here.

505
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:42,100
 So, Paul, what he's trying to do is help everybody to go, "Okay, this is the journey.

506
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:45,740
 You are dead in your sin-induced transgressions because of the world, because of the devil,

507
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:51,900
 because of the flesh, but you have been raised to new life in Christ through faith.

508
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:56,020
 That new life leads you into the heavenly realms where you're now seated at the right

509
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,180
 hand of the Father.

510
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,940
 This is not done for you by works.

511
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:03,860
 No, it's done for you only by grace that is found in Christ Jesus.

512
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:09,460
 And in that grace, undeserved, unmerited by you, through faith, your belief and trust

513
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:15,020
 that Jesus indeed died for your sins and rose again, you are able to also now no longer

514
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:21,060
 be stuck in the death of your soul, but you can find new life through Christ Jesus.

515
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:25,260
 For it is by grace that you have been saved in faith."

516
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,860
 And this, not something that you have accomplished.

517
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:31,260
 "For if it was by your works, you would boast.

518
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:35,860
 This is a work of the Spirit," Paul says.

519
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,860
 Isn't that amazing?

520
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,140
 Nobody thinks that that's amazing.

521
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,140
 Is that amazing?

522
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,180
 That's the gospel.

523
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:46,100
 Now, here's the crazy thing.

524
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,100
 Paul doesn't stop there.

525
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,100
 He has one more verse.

526
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:51,060
 I want you to read this because this is one of the most famous verses that we have in

527
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,060
 Ephesians.

528
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:58,500
 "For we are God's workmanship," Paul says, "created in Christ Jesus to do good works,

529
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,180
 which God prepared in advance for us to do."

530
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,620
 This is how he wraps it all up.

531
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:08,060
 He says, "Now that you understand the journey that there is in going from death to the fullness

532
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:13,140
 of life through Christ by His grace, you have to realize now that you, therefore, are God's

533
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,260
 workmanship," is the phrase he uses.

534
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,620
 The Greek word is the word poiema.

535
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:23,460
 It actually is the word that we translate into the English word poem.

536
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:28,620
 Paul's like, "You are God's poem," that He's written something for the world to see in

537
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,300
 and through you.

538
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:34,100
 When he says, "You are God's workmanship," he's not talking about that first moment of

539
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,100
 your creation.

540
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:38,860
 Elsewhere in the Bible, it says that you were knitted and made in your mother's womb, and

541
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,740
 that's an amazing thing, but that's not what Paul's speaking about here.

542
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:46,660
 When he says that you are a workmanship of God, what he's speaking about is everything

543
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,460
 that he's just said in the passage.

544
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:51,580
 He's talking about the fact that you have been transformed and renewed.

545
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:54,940
 Elsewhere, he says that when you're in Christ Jesus, you're a new creation.

546
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,560
 The old is gone, the new has come.

547
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,080
 This is his phrase for it here in Ephesians.

548
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,660
 You are God's workmanship.

549
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:07,540
 Another way of saying it, you are a masterpiece of art, that Christ has changed your life,

550
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:12,100
 literally taken you from death to life, and He has done that for you by His grace, and

551
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:16,380
 you now are a living embodiment of the grace of Christ in your life.

552
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,180
 That's awesome, he's saying.

553
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:23,380
 You're a masterpiece, a masterpiece of the grace of God, and because you're a masterpiece,

554
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,240
 you shouldn't shy yourself away.

555
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,460
 You should hang yourselves in the galleries of this world.

556
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,980
 You should be in the marketplace.

557
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,300
 You should be in society.

558
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,300
 You should be in your families.

559
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,860
 You should be in your workplaces.

560
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:39,180
 You should be influencing everything out there because you are a work of art.

561
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:46,020
 You're a masterpiece on display for all the world to see, he's saying.

562
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:50,620
 Michelangelo, one of the great sculptors, once was chipping away at a shapeless rock,

563
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:55,100
 and somebody asked him what he was doing, and his reply was this, "I am liberating an

564
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,420
 angel from this stone."

565
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:03,020
 And I think if you were to say to Paul, "How would you help people to understand what Christ

566
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,320
 has done in them?"

567
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:11,960
 He would say, "He has liberated you from the stone of death, and He has shaped and formed

568
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:19,020
 you into someone who can now live, and live in a way that would show the world the glory

569
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,020
 of Christ."

570
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:25,780
 So he says, "There is a work that Christ has done in you so that you can now be a work

571
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,780
 in the world."

572
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:30,380
 It's not the works of salvation that we've just talked about, because we know that those

573
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,060
 works are not what it's about.

574
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:36,380
 This is a new work that we can now do, not one that earns us salvation, but one that

575
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:40,540
 shows the world the grace of salvation.

576
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:43,780
 So he says, "You go now and do that.

577
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:49,920
 You go be Christ in the world, His hands and His feet and His grace, living as this embodiment

578
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,880
 of a different narrative.

579
00:34:51,880 --> 00:35:01,440
 You are Miko's replacement, sat in a room, and when the narratives of the world are presented,

580
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:08,760
 you have the courage to say that there's a third way, that you have a testimony in your

581
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,880
 life of a life that has been changed by the grace of Christ."

582
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:19,680
 If we were to summarize Paul, we'd say it this way, "What you are is a gift of God.

583
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,680
 What you now do is your gift to Him.

584
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:30,840
 You're a gift by grace, because He loves you, and out of love and mercy, He has changed

585
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,080
 and transformed you.

586
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,640
 Now how you live matters."

587
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,960
 Just a little bit further on, we'll see this in a few weeks' time, Paul will say, "Live

588
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,680
 a life worthy of that calling."

589
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,160
 He challenges his church.

590
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,160
 Live a life worthy.

591
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,680
 That's what he's saying here too.

592
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:48,080
 You're God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works.

593
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,320
 I love the way that Erwin McManus puts it.

594
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:57,880
 He says, "You're not just a work of art, but you are also artist at work."

595
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,920
 So if you're a painter, paint.

596
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,440
 If you're a writer, write.

597
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,800
 If you're a teacher, educate and teach.

598
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:10,160
 If you're a banker, bank.

599
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:20,760
 If you're a lawyer, if you're a lawyer, I pray for you, if you're a lawyer, judge fairly.

600
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:25,440
 If you work for the government, lead humbly and diligently.

601
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,320
 Whatever it is that is before you, do it in a way that honors and glorifies Christ, because

602
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,160
 you are no longer dead.

603
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,040
 He can bring the dead things and bring them to life.

604
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:42,960
 My prayer for you is that you would go from here today filled with this joy in your heart,

605
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,600
 that you have been one who has been chosen by Him in grace.

606
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:52,040
 And in your faith and trust and belief in Him, you have aligned yourselves to the forgiveness

607
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:58,480
 that was there on the cross, a forgiveness that sets your soul free, so you can now live

608
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,360
 as you were truly created to be.

609
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:09,000
 May you feel the wind in the Spirit upon you, as you be who you have been created to be,

610
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,400
 in the spirit of influence He has placed you in.

611
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:18,640
 For you have been saved by grace, not by works, so that you cannot boast, but through faith,

612
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:25,080
 so that you as God's workmanship may be released to good works.

613
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,080
 Can I pray for you?

614
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,920
 Let's pray.

615
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:34,480
 Father, we're so grateful for the people in this room, people that you love deeply and

616
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:40,600
 dearly, people that you have saved by a gracious act.

617
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:48,200
 Father, I pray for anyone in this room who perhaps is just exploring faith in this time.

618
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,680
 Maybe spirituality is a new thing for them.

619
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:57,880
 And Lord, maybe they're exploring what it is to explore the truths and the beliefs of

620
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,880
 Scripture.

621
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:04,520
 Father, I pray for anyone here that is in that camp, I just pray, Lord, that today they

622
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:09,840
 would feel the encouragement and the challenge of your Word.

623
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,000
 You love them so much.

624
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:16,400
 It is out of your love and your mercy, as Paul writes in this passage, that you can

625
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,560
 take them from death to life, and the kind of life that they have never felt or never

626
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,560
 lived before.

627
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:29,520
 Lord, I pray for anyone in this room where that's resonating with them now, for the first

628
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:34,200
 time, I pray, Lord, that they would reach out to you today.

629
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,340
 Maybe they would talk with the person that they've come from, or maybe they would come

630
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:40,960
 up and chat with us as a team after the service, and we can help you.

631
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,440
 But if you want to give your life to Jesus, it's really a simple thing.

632
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:50,740
 You just, in a simple prayer, just come before Him and ask Him to be your Lord and Savior.

633
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:56,160
 You confess those sins in you that have kept you dead spiritually, as we've been talking

634
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:03,840
 about today, and you, through belief and trust in Him, thank Him for forgiving your sin and

635
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,160
 giving you new life.

636
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,600
 And then you can just simply pray and ask for His Spirit to help you, to walk with you

637
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,600
 and strengthen you.

638
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,320
 I want to encourage you to do that.

639
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,120
 Do that with the person you came with.

640
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,120
 Come up to us afterwards.

641
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,380
 We'll do that with you personally.

642
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:24,080
 But I guess that there are many of us in this room where we are already Christian.

643
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,880
 I pray that today would be an important reminder for you of the grace that has been in your

644
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,880
 story.

645
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:35,520
 And I pray out of that grace, you would leave here today with a bounce in your step, wanting

646
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:44,340
 to live that grace life publicly before a broken and tired and needy world.

647
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,960
 That you would realize again that you are God's workmanship.

00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,080
 You've been created in Christ Jesus for good works.

649
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:55,400
 My prayer for you is that you would walk out those works in whatever spirit of influence,

650
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:01,080
 whatever gifts and talents that He has placed upon you, would come to the fore in your life

651
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:07,440
 so that Jesus' grace would win many others from death to life.

652
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,620
 Lord, we thank you for this.

653
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,940
 In Jesus' name, everyone says.

654
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:16,360
 Would you stand with me and we're just going to respond together in a time of worship as

655
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:20,040
 we just let the Holy Spirit continue to just minister with us.

656
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,620
 (gentle music)
