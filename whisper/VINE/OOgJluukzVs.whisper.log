[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.840]   Have you ever found yourself in one of those moments in life where everything feels like
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.360]   it's out of control?
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.760]   Where there's literally nothing you can do to advance, to work through your situation.
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:22.360]   One of those moments where there's no amount of resources or money or networking or friendships
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:31.840]   or like there's just nothing you can actually do to get out of a situation, to reach a goal,
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.840]   to change a bad medical report.
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:44.360]   One of those moments where if God doesn't show up, and I don't mean like you get a little
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:51.440]   bit of luck, like I mean if you don't experience something that's undisputably a miracle, you're
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.920]   not going to be able to make it through.
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.080]   You're not going to be able to accomplish or reach that goal.
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.120]   Has anyone been in that space before?
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.960]   For me, I found myself in that very same spot in 2013.
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.520]   So 2013, I was graduating from university.
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.120]   I was super young, younger than I am now.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.080]   And yeah, I was graduating from university and I knew that God had called me to move
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.200]   to this side of the world.
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.840]   I was pretty convinced God wanted me to come to Hong Kong, but there were these massive,
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.080]   massive barriers in my way.
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.080]   There were three things.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.080]   So let's break them down.
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.880]   The first thing, probably the biggest thing was this.
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.120]   I was not a citizen of any country.
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.120]   That's kind of hard.
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.120]   I had no passport.
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.560]   See, my family moved from Liberia.
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:46.360]   No, my family fled Liberia as refugees in 1994 during the Liberian Civil War.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.000]   So I came to the US under what's called a United Nations travel document, which meant
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.160]   I couldn't just leave and go to another country.
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:59.120]   And so if I wanted to come to Hong Kong without a passport, without belonging to anyone, that
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.360]   would have been extremely difficult.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.160]   Now, my family had experienced going through this process of trying to get my citizenship
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.560]   so that I could have a passport.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.440]   We tried years and years and spent thousands of thousands of dollars and to no avail.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.020]   Every time something was wrong or I needed to send another document, there was always
[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.020]   something extra.
[00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:23.520]   And we tried for up to seven years and could not break through this.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.240]   And now I was needing it in three months.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.560]   It felt like a proper uphill battle.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.300]   The second thing was this.
[00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.920]   As I was in university, I was a broke college student.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.760]   I had no money.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.880]   Literally I had no money.
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.760]   So in order for me to come to Hong Kong, I don't know if you guys are aware of this,
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.960]   but Hong Kong is, and they hold the number one ranking in this, the most expensive city
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.720]   to live in for someone who's an expat.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.880]   So you can't just show up to Hong Kong and I'll make it.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.880]   Doesn't really work that way.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.640]   You kind of have to have some money to be able to get around in the city.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.640]   And I had none.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.680]   I had zero, well, not zero.
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.520]   I had a total of, big number here, 11,000 Hong Kong dollars.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.280]   It's not gonna get you very far if it even covers rent, right?
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.120]   We know how expensive it is here.
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.320]   So that was the second big obstacle.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.760]   The third obstacle was around my degree.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.080]   Now I was studying psychology.
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.240]   Yes, I studied psychology.
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.800]   I can help you with your problems.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.800]   But I was in this course.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.160]   In order to graduate, I needed to pass neuroscience.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.080]   Who even knows what neuroscience is?
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.600]   Don't raise your hand.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.600]   Don't do it.
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.080]   I studied it then and I still can't tell you what it is, but this course was extremely
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.080]   difficult.
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.080]   I was coming through Greek 1 and Greek 2, Hebrew 1 and Hebrew 2, and I would much rather
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.120]   take those again than neuroscience.
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.200]   Yeah, so I struggled in this course.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.320]   I remember taking a test and actually being present and going through and filling out
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:01.760]   the answers and getting my score and getting a zero.
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.960]   I needed, so you're saying, three massive obstacles, citizenship, finances, and needing
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.760]   to graduate in order to come here.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.040]   I knew God wanted me here.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.280]   I think we've all been in that space before.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.920]   We knew God is doing something.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.300]   We know He has a plan.
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.720]   We know He's building something.
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:23.080]   But unless the Lord Himself does something, intervenes in our space, we're not going to
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.600]   be able to get there.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.760]   Like think about how we are now.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.080]   Like what do we do when we face that?
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.440]   When we're in those moments where your best effort just isn't good enough.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.840]   How do you respond?
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.120]   Like that.
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.680]   When life seems to not be responding to you, think about what Hong Kong feels like now.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.760]   We've been through massive political changes.
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.560]   The political landscape of our city is vastly different.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.480]   We have friends and families who are leaving the city.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.640]   There's nothing we can really do about that.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.720]   Think wider.
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.680]   It's going to the third year of COVID.
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.680]   It was COVID-19.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.680]   Now it's COVID-20.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.680]   It's COVID-21.
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.120]   It just keeps going.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.600]   And there's nothing we can really do to change that.
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.680]   Our best effort doesn't stop these things.
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.920]   They're bigger than us.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:28.320]   And we sit in this space of anxiety and tension and frustration where we start to lose hope
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.920]   in the promises of God.
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:38.520]   We start to forget who he is because we are engulfed in our fears and our anxieties.
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.000]   It makes us feel restless and tired.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   It makes some of us tired of being tired.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.800]   These tensions that we face now are nothing new to what the biblical audience would have
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.800]   experienced.
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.080]   When we look at scripture, we see that the people of Israel, they had some pretty rough
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.080]   experiences.
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.240]   These are the same people who were once exiled out of their country.
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.280]   So people came in, the Assyrians and the Babylonians came into their country, burned down Jerusalem,
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.820]   burned down their temple, took them back as slaves.
[00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.040]   They had no country.
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.040]   They were exiled.
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:18.480]   Their identity ripped from them.
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:23.160]   They know a thing or two about tension, about anxiety.
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.360]   These are the same people who had foreign people living in their country, occupying
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.720]   their land.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.600]   If we look at the day and age of Jesus, he had the Romans occupying Palestine.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.800]   They know a thing or two about the tension.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.800]   They know a thing or two about anxiety.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:46.400]   And actually, as we look to scripture, that context is what I want us to think about when
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.600]   we look at Psalms 127.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:56.160]   See, 127 is written by Solomon, and he's addressing these very tensions in a unique way to bring
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:02.240]   peace to the followers of God, which sounds odd because there's tension, so how can you
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.240]   have peace?
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.560]   But Solomon was the wisest man in the world, so he was able to get us there.
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.040]   Psalm 127 sits in the middle of a bunch of Psalms.
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.160]   There's Psalm 120 to Psalm 134.
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.520]   These are called the Psalms of Ascent.
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:19.560]   What would happen here is that the Jewish people would keep these songs on their mind
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.280]   as they would travel into Jerusalem.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:27.920]   Jerusalem was located on a hill, hence why it was a song of ascent, right?
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.800]   So they would remember these truths.
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.040]   They would speak these truths.
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.360]   They would recite them.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:37.600]   It would prepare their hearts for something about God in order that they might worship,
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.880]   in order that they might connect with him.
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:45.040]   There was something in these Psalms of Ascent, especially when we look at Psalm 127, that
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:52.840]   really reshaped and reframed perspective.
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.000]   It's how they would remember who God was.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:02.400]   God's word here was a reminder for them, for those moments when it does feel like things
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:09.200]   are literally out of control, so those moments where you do lose hope and lose perspective
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:14.720]   on who you are and potentially even on who God is.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:19.760]   So I want us to crack our Bibles open today and look at Psalm 127 and see what King Solomon
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:27.800]   writes and how that might change our perspective, how that might remind us of some truth to
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:32.400]   address our anxieties, to bring stability into our attention.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.840]   Psalm 127 reads like this.
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:40.920]   It says, "Unless the Lord builds the house, the builder labors in vain.
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:44.880]   Unless the Lord watches over the city, the guards stand watch in vain.
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:50.440]   And in vain you rise early and stay up late, toiling for food to eat.
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:55.480]   For he grants sleep to those he loves."
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.480]   He grants sleep to those he loves.
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.760]   See, this Psalm is speaking about the role of God.
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:04.600]   It's helping us understand a little better what is God's role, what is our role.
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.680]   Who is God and what is his role?
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.520]   Who are we and what is our role?
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.640]   The first thing we can see about this is unless the Lord builds the house.
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.160]   See, who is the house builder?
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.040]   The Lord is, right?
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:21.480]   And so we look at this and we see that God is the one who is responsible for building
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.680]   your house.
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.260]   God is responsible for building your house.
[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.480]   It's up to him.
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.240]   It's not solely up to you.
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.640]   It's not solely up to me.
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.280]   This is good news.
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.960]   This is really good news, actually, because God is the one that's building.
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.200]   He's all powerful.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.380]   What can he not do?
[00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:46.560]   If it's up to him, it's significantly better than if it was stuck with just you and stuck
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.840]   with just me.
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.800]   So the house that's being spoken here can refer to two things.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:59.120]   The first thing being the family household, the actual mom, dad, children, all of that.
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.040]   So potentially you're here today and you're in that space.
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:10.280]   You're experiencing a difficulty maybe being a parent.
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:17.720]   Maybe you're here today and you're trying to have a family and it's hard.
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:23.240]   Maybe you're here today and you don't know how to respect your mom and dad.
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:28.920]   I want to encourage you that God comes alongside.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:34.280]   These efforts are what builds us into what we need to be in order to have a successful
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.280]   family.
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.960]   It's God who establishes the family.
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:39.840]   It's God who builds the family.
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:46.160]   Please don't take that responsibility on only your shoulders.
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.520]   The house also represents a second concept.
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:52.760]   When we think about a house, we think of basic needs, you know, a roof over your head as
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.100]   a basic need.
[00:10:54.100 --> 00:11:01.040]   So when we see it in that light, we realize it is God's responsibility to provide for
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:04.240]   our basic need.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:08.620]   Maybe you're here and the financial times has been a hard struggle for you.
[00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:10.860]   Maybe you haven't found a job yet.
[00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.120]   Maybe you're in between jobs.
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.840]   Maybe you're unhappy at your job.
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.800]   Maybe you feel like you're just waking up to work.
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:21.200]   I encourage you that God builds our house.
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.200]   God's there.
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.320]   He knows.
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.400]   He's with you and He's building alongside you.
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:31.160]   You don't have to burden and carry that on your own.
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.680]   Building the house, building the temple.
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:35.920]   See, we actually talked about this earlier in the year.
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.320]   Pastor Andrew went through a series.
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:42.280]   I remember the one thing I remember from that sermon is God bless it, God bless it.
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.280]   Was anyone here for that?
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.280]   All right.
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.480]   So it's about Zerubbabel back in Zachariah chapter four.
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.720]   And Zerubbabel has laid the foundation for the temple.
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:54.760]   And God speaks to him and He's talking to these people who are going to be laboring,
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:58.080]   physically building things, people who need strength and who need power.
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:06.040]   And He says that it's not by might, it won't be by power, which is conscious.
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:10.480]   How do you build something without might and power?
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.800]   God says it's by my spirit.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:18.960]   We must be partnering with God to build anything.
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:23.640]   It must have something of God in it for it to be built.
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:28.740]   This verse is telling us that apart from God, we actually can't build or accomplish anything
[00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:33.400]   that matters, that's lasting.
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.640]   God is the chief builder.
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.400]   He's the actual one building.
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.920]   He's the only one that can properly establish.
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:44.000]   He brings into existence what is not.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.640]   Further it says that He is leading the charge and He's building the whole thing.
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:54.360]   And if He is not doing that, then our efforts are in vain.
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.560]   Maybe vain's a fancy word.
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:56.560]   I'll break it down.
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:03.960]   It's a waste of our time when we put our efforts into the things that God isn't building.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:08.560]   Like you waste your actual time.
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:09.560]   And why is that?
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:15.800]   Because unless the Lord is actually building it, the things that we might be building end
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:20.040]   up being void of meaning.
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.160]   And who wants to work?
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.360]   Who wants to sweat?
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:27.560]   Who wants to pour resources and years and tons of energy into something that will not
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:35.720]   last, something that does not ultimately matter?
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:42.120]   Notice that God is calling us into this.
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.800]   I think it's a little tricky sometimes.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.840]   We hear this, that God is building and we have to leave it up to God in order for it
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.840]   to be accomplished.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:51.720]   And some of us might think that that means we get to sit on our hands.
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.680]   It's not what it means.
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:58.480]   No, we don't get to just give it all to God and say, "Okay, you figure it out.
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.480]   I'm going to go take a nap."
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.160]   That's not what it's saying.
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.360]   No, see, there's the builder and then there's the laborers.
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:07.280]   There's God's role and then there's your role.
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:11.680]   We are called to, as the New Testament would say, co-labor with Christ.
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.680]   We are called to be a part of what He's doing.
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:15.960]   He has invited us in.
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:20.880]   It's an invitation to join with what God is doing in the world.
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.300]   No, we have a role.
[00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:31.600]   This verse is not an excuse to put down the things that God has put in your hands, but
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:40.120]   instead it's to put down the desire to control your life.
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.880]   We build alongside Him.
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.760]   We build alongside Him.
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:50.960]   See, this is ultimately because you and I, we have a limited perspective.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:55.800]   What we see, where we are, what we can fathom is limited.
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.720]   But God isn't in that same space.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.560]   See, God is above these things.
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.280]   He's the alpha and the omega.
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:02.600]   He's the beginning and the end.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.280]   He knows how the story goes.
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:06.280]   He knows how it ends.
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.060]   He wrote it.
[00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:17.040]   And so when we build what He has designed, it has meaning.
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:23.120]   Unfortunately, we can find ourselves attaching ourselves to things that have no meaning,
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.400]   building and sweating and toiling behind things that have no meaning.
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:30.760]   And the only way for our lives to be fruitful, for the things that we are building to last
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:34.720]   and to matter is if it's partnered with what God is doing.
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:37.480]   See, God has done this funny thing.
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:43.320]   He's put us in a position of not ultimately being in control of our own lives.
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:44.320]   I think about that.
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:49.560]   You actually don't have ultimate control of your own life.
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:57.080]   He's caused you to have to be dependent on Him on purpose.
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.960]   That's by design.
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.360]   And that's probably a scary reality.
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.360]   I mean, think about how our world operates today.
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.640]   It's so overemphasizes what we can do.
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:13.320]   If we just get the right job, if we just marry the right person, if we just go to the right
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:20.040]   school, get the right grades, have the right internship, grease the right elbows, that's
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.560]   actually not what the Scripture is saying though.
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.760]   See, the Scripture is countercultural.
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:31.460]   And the things that our culture and our present age promotes and are overexerting ourselves
[00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.760]   is tiring.
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.440]   It does lead us to anxiety.
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:38.040]   What happens when we do all that and we still don't get there?
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:41.200]   We live in this space, in this cloud of anxiety.
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:45.800]   Remember, Jesus tells us that following Him is different than living in the world.
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.960]   He says His burden is light.
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.880]   Did that sound light to you?
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.760]   His yoke is He and His burden is light.
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.360]   He's not called us to carry all these things.
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:03.360]   See, if we don't let God build, if we don't allow Him to be the chief architect of our
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:12.680]   lives, we end up building a fallen version of God's plans, something that will break,
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:17.120]   something that will wither, something that's imperfect.
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:23.120]   See, the version that God wants to build is meant to be unshakable.
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:26.720]   The version that God wants to build is meant to last.
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:32.360]   And that can only happen if we let God in the driver's seat, if we allow Him to assume
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:38.320]   control, if we build alongside Him and we learn to be dependent.
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.360]   And there's actually a peace in this.
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:45.880]   Like, there is genuine peace in knowing that.
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:49.520]   This peace comes from knowing that it's not just up to us.
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.360]   It's not just up to you and me.
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:56.360]   God is actually the one who's responsible for His people.
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:59.400]   So yes, God is building and He's responsible for the building project.
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.280]   He's responsible for your future and for building up these things.
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:07.680]   But ultimately, He's responsible for those things because He's responsible for you.
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.280]   He's responsible for you.
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.360]   Like, you are His.
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.640]   We belong to Him.
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:16.320]   We're not left to fend for ourselves.
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:19.120]   We've been grafted into His family.
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:24.320]   So whether it's your five-year plan, whether it's your family, whether it's your future,
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:31.560]   whether it's getting into a certain school, know that it all belongs to Him because you
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.720]   belong to Him.
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.680]   So we can breathe, people of God.
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:38.080]   We can take a breath.
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.440]   He's got it.
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.840]   He's got the house.
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:44.760]   He's got our future because He's got us.
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:48.280]   See, for me, I got to witness this firsthand.
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.760]   Coming to Hong Kong was the uphill journey like I explained, right?
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:55.840]   The three things, the passport, the money, and the grades.
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:02.120]   So what happened to me was, again, miraculous.
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:09.120]   We'd been trying for seven-plus years to get my naturalization to the US.
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:15.480]   And within three months, we get a call from immigration saying that my papers had been
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.800]   approved, which was massive.
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.520]   I mean, we kept trying.
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:24.720]   Someone would misspell a name or would say something about this or would write this and
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:29.280]   there'd be something wrong that would restart the whole process, not just like back a step,
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:30.920]   the whole thing.
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.040]   The papers were approved.
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.440]   They set a date.
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:36.720]   This date normally is set for anywhere within the next two years.
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:41.040]   It was set for that month.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:45.360]   I mean, I'm not that smart, but I passed the test.
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:48.960]   It was great.
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:49.960]   But you see what I'm saying?
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.280]   Like, this is something I couldn't do on my own.
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.760]   I genuinely had no control.
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.240]   I had to let go.
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.840]   I had to let God do it.
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:58.920]   I didn't know anyone.
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:04.640]   I couldn't navigate that space, but God came through for me.
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.440]   God broke through the impossible for me.
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.640]   Do we see what he does when we allow the chief architect?
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:10.640]   He was building this.
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:11.640]   This was his goal.
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:16.440]   Do you see what happens when we allow him to step in?
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:18.320]   Let's talk about finances.
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.200]   Remember I was a broke college kid.
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.040]   So coming to Hong Kong was going to be difficult.
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:26.020]   My friends, Irem and Rick, and I prayed.
[00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:30.720]   We said, "God," and you know, when you're young and in your 20s, you can pray crazy
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:31.720]   prayers.
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:35.480]   We're like, "God, give us a free flat."
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:39.240]   Looking back on it, I realized how much faith we had.
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.600]   You're not going to get a free flat in Hong Kong.
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:44.800]   You're not going to get free anything in Hong Kong.
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:45.800]   We prayed and we believed.
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.720]   We said, "God, you want us to get there?
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:50.440]   We don't have...we need this.
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.640]   We genuinely need it."
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:55.680]   And you know, God didn't give us a free flat.
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:21:01.880]   Instead, he gave us a flat where we paid one US dollar for a whole year.
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:04.640]   I think that does the trick, right?
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.840]   Was that good on his end?
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:08.360]   God provided, guys.
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:10.200]   Like, again, this was...I didn't know anyone here.
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:14.520]   I'd actually never been to Hong Kong before I packed my bags and moved all the way over
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:15.520]   here.
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:16.520]   So I didn't know people.
[00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:21.760]   I didn't have networks and communities and I knew no one.
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:29.800]   Unless God went before me and did the things God did, this wouldn't be possible.
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:30.800]   God built the house.
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.480]   He got me here.
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:35.360]   And I believe God wants to do the same thing for us.
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:41.880]   He wants to get rid of the void of us having to stress and toil and strive and live in
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:48.120]   deep anxiety, questioning who we are and questioning our maker.
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.120]   The verse continues.
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:53.320]   Solomon then reveals a second characteristic of God that's pretty important as well.
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:54.320]   Speaking to our attention.
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:58.200]   See, he says, "Unless the Lord guards the city, the watchmen watch in vain."
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:02.760]   So now he's talked about God's ability to build these things up.
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:04.560]   Now he talks about God's ability to protect.
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:07.360]   And what we see here is that God is the guardian.
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.720]   He assumes that role.
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:14.240]   We see that only God can protect what only God can build.
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:18.960]   Now, this can be hard for some of us because we realize God gets us here and we think that,
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:19.960]   "Okay, God's got us here.
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:24.760]   Now it's up to me to keep God's promise alive."
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:29.640]   There's a freedom that it's not all on your shoulders.
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:36.280]   Consider that the sovereignty of God is what brings protection to us as individuals and
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:39.560]   to our wider communities.
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:42.960]   God will protect what God will build.
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:46.400]   You don't have to fight alone.
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:52.500]   There is another person fighting on your behalf, fighting with you because he's responsible
[00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:56.720]   for you and he's got your best interest in mind.
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:00.360]   See, God will build and he will protect what he builds.
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:04.800]   God will build and he will sustain what he builds.
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:09.040]   The second thing we get from this space is that God sees and cares about what happens
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.800]   to us and what's happening around us.
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:16.640]   Now, I think it's awesome that the verse doesn't just say, "God gives the plans for building
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.480]   and then the builders have to do it."
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:21.640]   Notice it's not what Psalm 127 says.
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:25.480]   It speaks of what God does as a verb, an action.
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:29.320]   It says, "Unless the Lord builds."
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:31.480]   So he's involved in the building process.
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:38.480]   He's not sitting far away, removed from us, expecting us to figure it out.
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:44.360]   No, God is there and because he's there, because he's a part of the building, he sees.
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:45.680]   He sees what's happening.
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.540]   He knows the context.
[00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:50.600]   He's aware of the surroundings and the environments.
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:54.240]   Therefore, God knows the things that we need.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:24:00.520]   See, God sees and because he sees, he cares.
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.460]   He knows what's on our heart.
[00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:05.000]   He knows how difficult COVID's been.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.880]   He's not unaware of it.
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.260]   He's still building.
[00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:14.780]   He knows what 2019 looked like for Hong Kong in the aftermath.
[00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:16.080]   He's not unaware.
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:19.860]   He's not confused up there, detached from our reality.
[00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:25.000]   He knows and believe this, he's still building.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.040]   He's still building you.
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.400]   God knows what's around us.
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:35.440]   He knows the things in our space and he cares for us.
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:39.080]   He cares about the things that we face and it's really great.
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.000]   Peter in the New Testament actually says this.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:47.600]   He says, "Cast your burdens onto him because he cares for you."
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:53.860]   Like, yes, our God is able to build and sustain but he does it out of care, not just out of
[00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:56.720]   almighty power.
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.740]   So could we cast our burdens today?
[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:05.440]   See this is where I find my rest when I'm in moments of anxiety, when I'm afraid.
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:10.960]   It's this idea that we can rest when we know he is still fully in control even when we
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.820]   are not.
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:15.400]   God's still building.
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.140]   Here and now, God's still building.
[00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:19.100]   God's still sustaining.
[00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:20.300]   This is where rest comes from.
[00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:23.540]   This is where stability comes from.
[00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:27.640]   This is how you can sleep better at night.
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:32.180]   We find peace when we realize that God's gonna build it and God's gonna be the one to protect
[00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:34.980]   it and he invites us to be a part of it.
[00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:37.060]   So I get to Hong Kong.
[00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:39.180]   We are all learning so much about me today.
[00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:44.740]   I get to Hong Kong and obviously I'm not still living in a flat that's only $1 a year.
[00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:45.740]   That bit ran out.
[00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:51.540]   That would have been great if it stayed this long but it didn't.
[00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:56.660]   So yeah, I'm here and I'm actually working as a volunteer, aka I'm not getting paid.
[00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:59.740]   I am volunteer working.
[00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:02.780]   And it's quite hard to live in Hong Kong as a volunteer, right?
[00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:06.860]   I think we all, not as many people here are just living as volunteers from what I can
[00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:07.860]   tell.
[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:08.860]   I needed money.
[00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:13.860]   I had none and it was really interesting how God put the right people in front of me.
[00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:18.540]   He literally put people in my life that I would have never thought to ask for money.
[00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:21.180]   I'm really bad at asking for money by the way.
[00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:25.260]   I'm glad I didn't have to ask too much or I would have not made it.
[00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:29.180]   But I had friends or acquaintances, maybe not even friends from university, people that
[00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:35.720]   I didn't really talk to that much that would send me near about three and a half thousand
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:39.900]   a month just because they were praying and they felt like they wanted to support Promise
[00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:40.900]   where he was.
[00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:44.860]   Like a guy who I had gotten into a fight about relationship stuff with who tried to date
[00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:46.980]   my now wife.
[00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:49.860]   He sent me money.
[00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:50.860]   Get that.
[00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:54.460]   Only God can make that kind of stuff happen, right?
[00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:55.980]   Like there's no smoothing.
[00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:56.980]   We're best friends now.
[00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:57.980]   He just had a baby.
[00:26:57.980 --> 00:26:58.980]   I just had a baby.
[00:26:58.980 --> 00:26:59.980]   We're great.
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:02.740]   But the point of the story is God was watching out for me.
[00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:05.600]   He was the one sustaining me.
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.300]   Another man in Hong Kong was sending me 2,000 a month.
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:13.540]   Okay, so we got a little bit here, a little bit there.
[00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:15.300]   At that time, my wife and I were not married.
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:16.300]   We were dating.
[00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:17.300]   I was in Hong Kong.
[00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:18.300]   She was in the US.
[00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:21.340]   And I needed money to be able to propose to her because I wanted to get married.
[00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:22.580]   And I wasn't making any money.
[00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:24.540]   And the money that I had, I was eating McDonald's with it.
[00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:27.860]   So I was not able to save it up and propose to her.
[00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:32.100]   And I just remember there was this Sunday I led worship at the church that I was serving
[00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:33.100]   at.
[00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:34.180]   And this couple came in.
[00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:35.440]   It was their first time.
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:38.500]   The guy was this tall, slender, white guy.
[00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:39.820]   The woman was a Chinese lady.
[00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:40.820]   They're from Shanghai.
[00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:41.940]   They've been living there for years.
[00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:43.940]   And they're just up in Hong Kong.
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:46.380]   And afterwards, they were like, "Hey, let's take you for a meal."
[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:47.380]   And I said, "Yes."
[00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:48.380]   Because you know what?
[00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:49.380]   It would be free.
[00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:50.380]   So we go to a meal.
[00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:53.100]   We go to Tai Heng.
[00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:56.420]   I get good cha siu and good iced milk tea, living my best life.
[00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:57.820]   And I'm just telling them about my life.
[00:27:57.820 --> 00:27:59.460]   You know, again, I'm bad at asking for money.
[00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:00.460]   So I'm not asking.
[00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:03.020]   I'm just telling them what I'm doing in Hong Kong and how long I've been there.
[00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:06.800]   And I brought up the fact that I had this beautiful girlfriend back in America who I
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:08.200]   couldn't wait to marry one day.
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:09.520]   I was deeply in love with her.
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:10.520]   She was going to move to Hong Kong.
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:11.520]   We were going to have babies.
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:12.520]   And this whole...
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:15.640]   I had this whole plan mapped out.
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:19.920]   And the very next Sunday, I come back in and I do my thing, get up there, plug the guitar
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:20.920]   and lead worship.
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:21.920]   After worship, the sermon comes up.
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:23.680]   After the sermon, we're getting ready to go.
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:26.480]   And they bring me an envelope.
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:30.960]   And it's full of cash.
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:34.020]   Literally $25,000.
[00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:37.940]   Y'all, that's unreal.
[00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:38.940]   That's unreal.
[00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:39.940]   $25,000.
[00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:46.080]   They said, "We feel like God wants us to bless you."
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:52.500]   The ring that my wife wears now is because of God providing then.
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:57.980]   To make it even crazier, we go to the jewelry store and I only have my 25K, which is like
[00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:00.440]   a trillion dollars in my mind at the time.
[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:02.620]   And I'm like, "I need a ring, but I know nothing about rings."
[00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:04.900]   And rings are expensive.
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:05.900]   Diamonds cost a lot of money.
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:10.060]   I learned that.
[00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:15.460]   And I talked to the guy and he was like, "Oh, I'm a Christian and you work for a church.
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:19.380]   I will give you the ring you want for however much you have."
[00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:21.720]   Again, this isn't normal.
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:24.980]   This doesn't happen every day.
[00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:35.160]   God continued to provide, continued to sustain.
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.160]   So what do we do with that?
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.160]   You've heard my story.
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:39.000]   You've heard what God's done for me.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.640]   And we hear that God builds and He protects what He builds and aligning ourselves with
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:44.640]   Him.
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:49.620]   How do we enter into that space?
[00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:55.640]   Maybe the first thing we can do is in our circumstances, where we are, in the tension,
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:30:00.440]   in the here and now, the first question I think is good to ask yourself is this, is
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:07.160]   this something God is building or something I'm building on my own?
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:09.760]   I think that's really critical, right?
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:12.480]   Because I could not on my own have accomplished those things.
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:15.760]   I had no shot at doing any of that.
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:20.920]   But because the Lord was building, those things were able to be accomplished.
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:24.240]   Ask yourself, is this something God is building or something I'm building on my own?
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:30.580]   Because if God is building it, hear this, it will not fail.
[00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:33.960]   At the same time, it'll probably be hard.
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.800]   Like let's not live in a Christian fairy tale where it's like, "God's doing it.
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:40.280]   Therefore, I will have no problems and butterflies and rainbows everywhere."
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:42.560]   That's not our reality.
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:44.520]   See God grows us in that tension.
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:48.760]   God anchors our faith through those difficulties, but he comes through.
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:53.280]   He doesn't start what he's not going to finish.
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:56.840]   That's not our God.
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:02.360]   It may look different and it will cost you, but your time and your commitment to God will
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:05.040]   not be in vain.
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:08.520]   So let me give us a couple of things that we can do, a couple of little practical steps
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:14.240]   that we can take in order to address the fear in our hearts, in order to address the anxiety
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:20.360]   that we feel, in order to find some sense of peace and stability here and now.
[00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:24.560]   The first thing is this, it's a realization that we have to keep with us.
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:32.240]   We must first realize that we are positioned for success when we are dependent on God.
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:37.640]   Not when we're dependent on ourselves, not when we're dependent on our paychecks or on
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:42.800]   our GPAs or on the people that we know, but when we are dependent on God.
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:47.680]   God builds and guards by his grace, therefore we need him.
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.520]   We need him.
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:55.320]   John would say in the New Testament that apart from him, we can do nothing, right?
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:57.400]   He's the vine where the branch is, apart from him, we can do nothing.
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:03.180]   But then Paul would say that I can do all things through him.
[00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:09.240]   You see that this big thing that we have to have God as a part of it.
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:13.080]   We're dependent on him and one of the best ways that we can be dependent practically,
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:18.040]   I was going to get practical, is this thing called a Sabbath.
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:19.520]   Now I know it's not popular.
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:21.240]   It probably sounds like some old Hebrew word.
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:24.960]   I think it is an old Hebrew word.
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:28.960]   But the Sabbath was instituted from the very beginning for us, for our good.
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:36.800]   We look back at the creation story and we see that after six days of working, God rests.
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:41.480]   And perhaps that is a pattern that we are meant to live within.
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:47.360]   Perhaps God is actually asking us to take a day where we don't assume the position of
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:51.200]   the person who applies or who provides for ourselves.
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:56.080]   Perhaps there's a day where we physically rest, where we mentally rest, where we bring
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:33:01.880]   our anxieties and our cares to God, where we remember who he is.
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:07.480]   See in the Old Testament, when God's people would rest, God would, he would provide for
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:08.480]   them.
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:09.480]   It's interesting.
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:13.700]   It requires you to rest before you get that provision, but he will provide.
[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:19.920]   Do we have faith enough to take a day, a week, and dedicate it just to remembering that we
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:24.680]   are ever dependent on him?
[00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:30.960]   The second thing, point number two, submitting what we have to him.
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:36.880]   See, submitting is an interesting word because I don't think we fully, I won't use the word
[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:37.880]   submit.
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:43.160]   Let's take what we have and let's bring it to God in prayer.
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:44.640]   That's a bit more straightforward, right?
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:48.600]   Let's bring what we have to God in prayer.
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:52.160]   Maybe you don't know if what you're building is aligned with God.
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:54.160]   That's okay.
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:55.600]   You can bring it to him in prayer.
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.440]   You can ask him to search your heart.
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:01.940]   David, the man after God's own heart, is the one that writes the Psalms saying, "Search
[00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:03.760]   my heart.
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:05.680]   Look and see if my motives are clean.
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:08.040]   God, am I aligned with you or am I not?
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:13.160]   I don't want to be building what you have no part of."
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:17.120]   Can we submit ourselves to God in that way?
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:20.520]   One of the ways I think we can do this is through confession, and not just a confession
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:24.960]   of what we've done wrong, but the confession to God of how we actually feel.
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:27.520]   Guys, we're tired.
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:30.920]   It's been a strong and difficult couple of years.
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:32.480]   I don't know how long it's been now.
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:35.000]   It's been a long time.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.520]   Maybe we can get honest with God.
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:41.560]   He doesn't just want to hear your good thoughts and your good prayers.
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:42.560]   Get real with him.
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:45.640]   Tell him that you hurt.
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:48.160]   Tell him where it hurts and tell him why.
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:50.040]   Tell him the things that are on your heart.
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.080]   Bring to him your actual fears.
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:55.260]   Let him know, "God, I'm anxious.
[00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:56.520]   Could you help me?
[00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:59.540]   God, I fear.
[00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:00.540]   Could you help me?"
[00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:01.540]   Guys, he listens.
[00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:04.600]   Remember what we said earlier, he cares for us.
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:06.340]   We can cast those burdens.
[00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:14.120]   We can bring that stuff to him because he cares for us.
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:18.040]   The third thing I want to say is this.
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:20.280]   Seek him first.
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:26.640]   The idea of striving and worrying and anxiety, trying to control things, is all a coping
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:29.600]   mechanism.
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:31.700]   It's all a coping mechanism.
[00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:35.680]   It's what happens when we try to meet our needs and protect ourselves, and that's completely
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.440]   normal.
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:40.220]   You're not odd for feeling that way.
[00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:44.800]   But here's the thing, Psalm 127 is telling us that we don't have to feel the pressures
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:46.400]   to do that on our own.
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:49.440]   We're not ultimately responsible for just ourselves.
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:53.900]   Jesus does something really interesting in Matthew 6, piggybacking off of Psalm 127.
[00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:58.000]   He gives this fantastic example.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.920]   He says, "Look at the flowers."
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:02.640]   These are probably big, tough religious guys.
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:03.960]   He's like, "Look at the flowers."
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.080]   So then they all come down and look at the flowers.
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:07.080]   "Let's look at the flowers."
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:09.500]   He's like, "Look at how they just flower around.
[00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.120]   They just do flower things.
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:16.160]   You don't see flower number one talking to lily number two being stressed.
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:19.760]   You don't hear the rose over here be like, 'My anxiety this week.'"
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:20.760]   Right?
[00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:27.760]   Like they just do flowery things, hang out in the wind and sway and get picked by kids.
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:30.800]   But they are flowers, and that's it.
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:33.160]   And yet God provides for them.
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:34.920]   They don't have to worry.
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:36.760]   Guys, flowers don't have to worry.
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:39.040]   And then Jesus is like, "Okay, let's take it a little further.
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:40.040]   The birds."
[00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:41.040]   So they've looked down, now look up.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:43.520]   "Look at the birds.
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:47.360]   They're just tweeting," and not Twitter, but tweeting.
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:48.700]   They are singing their songs.
[00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:50.000]   They are being birds.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.120]   They can't populate the ocean with the fish they need.
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:57.860]   They can't populate the ground with the worms they need.
[00:36:57.860 --> 00:36:59.280]   But they don't stress over it.
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:02.300]   They're not anxious over it.
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:06.820]   God takes care of that for them.
[00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:12.520]   And how much more will your Father in heaven do for you?
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:15.240]   See, it's a really cool principle.
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:23.240]   He's calling us not to seek the things we need, but to seek God, to seek Him first.
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:24.600]   So what it comes down to is this.
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:30.680]   It's not by seeking after the things that we need that we're actually built and sustained.
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:32.400]   It's the opposite.
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:43.540]   It's by seeking after the builder and the sustainer, focusing on His heart, asking what
[00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:50.620]   He's doing, asking for a new perspective, asking Him to change our hearts.
[00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:52.140]   That's what the birds do.
[00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:53.820]   They just do bird things.
[00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:56.500]   The flowers, they don't have to be anxious.
[00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:59.540]   They don't have to worry about tomorrow and their needs.
[00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:01.900]   God does it for them.
[00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:02.980]   God's building us, guys.
[00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:03.980]   He's building us.
[00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:07.040]   He's building our futures.
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:10.580]   He's finding us where we're weak, and He's saying, "It's okay.
[00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:11.580]   Come.
[00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:12.740]   Come to me because I can do it.
[00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:13.740]   I can build.
[00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:15.720]   Cast your anxieties on me.
[00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:19.900]   Choose to boast in my strength."
[00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:22.580]   Do you feel tired?
[00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:25.620]   Has it been a hard couple of years?
[00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:31.420]   Do you feel like you've hit that spot where there's just nothing left that you can do
[00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:33.980]   to move forward?
[00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:36.180]   God invites us to Him when we're there.
[00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:43.700]   He invites us to dependency on Him, yet to a collaboration into these big, eternal things
[00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:45.140]   that He's building.
[00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:47.340]   Will we submit ourselves today?
[00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:52.300]   Will we seek after Him today?
[00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:55.300]   Let's stand and pray.
[00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:57.900]   God, we come before You.
[00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:00.580]   God, we just thank You for Your Word.
[00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:08.220]   We thank You that You are the Creator God, the one who creates and who builds and who
[00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:09.220]   establishes.
[00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:18.380]   But God, we come to You as people who experience what the world has, and we come to You broken.
[00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:19.380]   We come to You tired.
[00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:23.020]   We come to You with actual anxiety.
[00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:28.540]   And we say, "God, come and speak to us.
[00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:34.940]   Come and remind us more deeply, more personally, that You are the God who is for us, that You
[00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:40.980]   are the God who builds, who protects, who what Your hand pushes forward, no one can
[00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:41.980]   stop.
[00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:48.620]   Give us the rest that we can find only in You, God."
[00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:51.260]   Perhaps you're here today and you're just broken.
[00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:52.340]   You're just tired.
[00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:56.660]   You don't have much hope left.
[00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:59.380]   I feel God saying, "You are welcome.
[00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:00.580]   Come in.
[00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:04.180]   Come into His rest.
[00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:09.300]   Take off the burdens that you're carrying, for you were never meant to actually carry
[00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:10.300]   them."
[00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:11.660]   That's not what He has for you.
[00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:17.580]   See, He sent Jesus so that He would carry those things for you.
[00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:24.940]   And what that looks like is submitting to Him.
[00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:32.740]   So God, we choose to submit to You today, and we ask Your Spirit to come and to reveal
[00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:38.420]   to us the things hidden in our hearts, the things that You're calling us to release and
[00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:41.300]   let go to You.
[00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:42.300]   Come Holy Spirit.
[00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:43.780]   Come Holy Spirit.
[00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:46.360]   (gentle music)
