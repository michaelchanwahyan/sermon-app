[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600]   Good morning.
[00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.600]   Give me a wave if you're still with me after all that administration.
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.960]   Come on, wave to me.
[00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.640]   If somebody's fallen asleep next to you, just give them a little dig in the ribs.
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.840]   Intimacy, deepening our trust and our faith.
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.880]   I was recently on an overnight retreat
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.360]   and I'd been asked to do the devotional the next morning.
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.720]   And I awoke in the middle of the night with these words in my head,
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.960]   "Switch from hope to faith."
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.480]   And I knew it was God and I immediately responded,
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.000]   "I'm sorry, I don't understand.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.680]   Do you ever do that with God? What are you saying?"
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.960]   I said to him, "You're going to have to explain this to me."
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.200]   God showed me that there were important areas of my life
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.520]   where I was asking in hope, not faith.
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.440]   Asking with no sense of assurance or conviction.
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.760]   Hebrews 11, 1 tells us,
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.680]   "Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for,
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.200]   the conviction of things not seen."
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.080]   Faith goes beyond just hope.
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.840]   God was asking me to deepen my faith,
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.480]   to ask in faith for the things that weighed heavy on my soul.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.520]   Now, how does this link to intimacy?
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.320]   Reaching for my journal that night
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.880]   and turning on the bedside lamp,
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.280]   God gave me this.
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.400]   Faith is built on trust.
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.760]   And trust comes from intimacy.
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.040]   So when we deepen our intimacy,
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.160]   trust deepens and our faith deepens.
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.440]   God showed me a personal area of my life
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.880]   where I was not asking with any faith
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.200]   or any sense of authority or conviction.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.640]   I was asking in hope and in desperation,
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.200]   but with no sense of assurance.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.320]   Now, there is nothing wrong with hope,
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.320]   but I sense God challenging me to shift from just hope
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:21.760]   to praying from a place of greater trust and greater faith.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.680]   You see, we all have areas of our life
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.640]   where trust has been eroded in God's ability to bring change.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.960]   Just think for a moment about your life.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.800]   Areas in your life where your trust
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:42.560]   in God's ability to bring change has been eroded.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.400]   In this intimate counter that I had in the middle of the night,
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.160]   God showed me his great love
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.600]   for the situation I had lost faith in.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.320]   And he showed me his grief,
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:01.920]   which matched my own and surpassed my own.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.200]   In that moment, as everything was stripped bare,
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.000]   I was gently brought to a place of repentance.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.360]   My trust restored in a God who does know and who does care.
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.680]   I was able to ask in faith concerning this situation
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.920]   and able to ask with assurance and conviction.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.560]   Matthew 21, 22 reminds us that whatever we ask in prayer,
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.640]   we will receive if we have faith.
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.000]   We as a church and we as individuals
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.160]   have been called to intimacy.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.600]   It is the foundation on which everything else is built.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.800]   When Jesus was asked, "Teacher,
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.560]   what is the greatest commandment in the law?"
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:02.240]   Jesus responded, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.920]   and with all your soul and with all your mind.
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:14.000]   This is the first and greatest commandment."
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.680]   The first and greatest commandment.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.040]   If you leave with nothing else today, leave with this.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:30.840]   The first and greatest thing you need is intimacy with God.
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.560]   Life for you may not be going to plan right now.
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:42.600]   Maybe you're feeling quite distant, unloved, lonely.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.680]   Love the Lord your God with all your heart
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.920]   and all your soul and all your mind.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:56.160]   Come back to the first and greatest commandment.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.480]   I recently read in a Facebook post of one of my friends
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:05.680]   these words, "God is aware of all of our shortcomings,
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.560]   but he's never changed his mind about us."
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.520]   We change our minds about God,
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.240]   we're often quite fickle and unreliable.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:25.200]   But God's desire for intimacy with you has never changed.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.880]   So why is intimacy the foundation on which our faith,
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.560]   our trust, our life is to be built on?
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.320]   What does intimacy do in our life?
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.080]   Before I go any further, I just want to share a truth
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.720]   about intimacy.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.720]   Recently, I caught up with a friend
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.480]   and she was sharing about her journey with God.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.560]   I came away and I remember saying to God,
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.200]   "Wow, she really has an intimate relationship with you,
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.600]   more intimate than me.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.480]   Maybe someone like that should be preaching this message."
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:12.240]   God's immediate response was, "Not more intimate,
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.880]   just different.
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:20.280]   Every person's intimacy with me looks different."
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.160]   And this is really important.
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.560]   Don't compare.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.280]   Just as couples' relationships look different
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.480]   and people express their love for each other
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.360]   in different ways, the same goes with our relationship
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.400]   with God.
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.640]   No two relationships are going to look the same
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.080]   and neither should they.
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:50.160]   Now, why is intimacy so foundational to our lives?
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.640]   In intimate moments, it is like a mirror is held up to God
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.800]   and we see him as he truly is.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.960]   At the same time, that mirror is held up to us
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.240]   and we see ourselves as we truly are.
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.960]   Everything gets stripped away, our false thinking,
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:17.160]   everything that separates crumbles away.
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.160]   In intimate moments with God, it's like we see clearly
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.760]   and we hear clearly.
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.960]   Everything gets exposed, the goodness of God,
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:32.560]   the faithfulness of God, the love of God.
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.040]   And our frailties get exposed.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.600]   Our sin gets exposed.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.280]   Like looking into a mirror, we see ourselves truly
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.840]   and we see God truly.
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.640]   Faced with the overwhelming goodness of God
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:54.520]   and the overwhelming truth of our need for him,
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.080]   we are often gently led to repentance.
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.920]   But our frailties and our sin are not the only things
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.280]   that get exposed when we have intimate moments with God.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:11.320]   He also reveals to us our value.
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:16.960]   He reminds us how precious we are to him.
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.000]   Reflected in the mirror, we often see clearly
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.320]   what needs to change in us.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.480]   2 Corinthians 318 captures this beautiful transformation
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:34.040]   process that takes place in intimate moments with God.
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:39.680]   And we all, with unveiled face, continually seeing
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:44.440]   as in a mirror the glory of the Lord,
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:50.080]   are progressively being transformed into his image,
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.040]   from one degree of glory to even more glory,
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.960]   which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.000]   We emerge from intimate moments with God
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.280]   with greater trust, a greater assurance of God,
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.160]   which leads to a stronger, more assured faith.
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:15.040]   So what does your intimacy with God look like?
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:21.840]   The imagery that came through Pastor Andrew's dream,
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:26.040]   which this sermon series of intimacy was built on,
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:30.520]   was of two armchairs facing each other,
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:35.640]   of you and God sitting face to face,
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.840]   not just hoping for but knowing his nearness,
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.960]   being assured that his gaze is on you.
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:49.640]   Does your intimacy with God need to deepen?
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:53.600]   Is your faith and trust eroded?
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.400]   Do you need to shift your chair?
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:03.400]   Is your armchair at the moment in the same room as God's,
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:07.880]   but it's not facing him directly?
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:12.880]   Or are you even in the room with God?
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:17.880]   Is your armchair even in the room with God?
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:22.880]   I've been a Christian since I was 10,
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:27.880]   and in my journey, I've seen many friends and loved ones
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:32.880]   put their armchair into storage.
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.880]   What I mean by that is,
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:41.880]   is that along the way, their faith and trust gets eroded,
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:46.880]   and their armchair, they just kind of put it away.
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.880]   I've even had some of them say to me,
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.880]   "Well, if God's real, he can just turn up in my life,
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.880]   "but I'm not gonna seek him anymore.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.880]   "He can just turn up."
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.880]   And in my heart, I'm thinking,
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.880]   "It's not God that's moved.
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.880]   "He's still there in his armchair.
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.880]   "It's you that's moved."
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:15.880]   Maybe you've given up completely,
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.880]   or maybe today you haven't even started your journey with God.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.880]   If either of these are true,
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.880]   then you need to know today that he loves you.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.880]   His heart has never changed towards you.
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:35.880]   He is inviting you into a loving relationship with him today.
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.880]   For those of you who do know Jesus,
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.880]   what are the areas in your life where you've lost faith?
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:45.880]   Or your faith in God's ability to bring change
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.880]   has become eroded?
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:52.880]   Are there areas in your life that you feel
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:56.880]   you just can't trust God with that?
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:02.880]   God has not changed his mind about us.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.880]   He tells us that there is nothing
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.880]   that can separate us from his love.
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.880]   A love that seeks us out,
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.880]   pursues us,
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.880]   waits patiently for us to choose
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.880]   to love him with all our hearts,
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:24.880]   and all our souls, and all our minds.
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:29.880]   He has already chosen you wholeheartedly.
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:33.880]   And he longs for you to choose him in the same way,
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.880]   wholeheartedly.
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:41.880]   So if God's intimacy is always available to us,
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:46.880]   if his armchair is always pulled up near,
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:50.880]   waiting for us to join him,
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.880]   if he is ever seeking us out,
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:57.880]   what is preventing you today
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:01.880]   from drawing near?
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.880]   Just stop and think for a moment.
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.880]   Those of you in this room
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.880]   that at some point have come to know Jesus,
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.880]   what impacts on your intimacy with God,
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:19.880]   and ultimately your trust and your faith?
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:24.880]   Those of you who don't know God,
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:29.880]   what is preventing you today from accepting his love for you,
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.880]   his invitation to you?
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.880]   Is it busyness or burnout?
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:40.880]   Does that impact on your relationship with God,
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.880]   your busyness,
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:46.880]   or are you in a place of burnout?
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:50.880]   Elijah experienced both these things.
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:52.880]   And just like Elijah,
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:58.880]   God can still meet you in the midst of your circumstances.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.880]   Is it insecurity,
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:05.880]   feeling like you're just not good enough?
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:10.880]   Does this impact on your relationship with God and your intimacy with him?
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.880]   Moses felt like this.
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.880]   He didn't feel good enough.
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:16.880]   He ran away.
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.880]   He hid in the desert.
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:22.880]   But God still found him there.
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:27.880]   What about fear?
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:32.880]   Does fear impact your intimacy with God?
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:37.880]   Gideon was someone in the Bible experiencing fear.
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:43.880]   And God still found him in his hiding place.
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:47.880]   What about shame?
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:52.880]   Peter was full of shame.
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:57.880]   And God tracked him down.
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:04.880]   He cooked him breakfast and invited him back into his armchair.
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.880]   What about pride?
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:16.880]   Are you still holding on too strongly to control of your life?
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:22.880]   Jonah thought that he knew a better way than God.
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.880]   And God pursued him.
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:34.880]   And he taught him that his way always works out better in our lives.
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:38.880]   There's a beautiful story in the Bible that I love.
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.880]   It's the woman who's caught in adultery.
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.880]   That's not the part I love.
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:51.880]   The part I love is that this woman is experiencing rejection and she's caught in sin.
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:56.880]   And Jesus meets her there in the dirt.
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.880]   And he lifts her head.
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:04.880]   He forgives her.
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.880]   What about grief or disappointment?
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.880]   Disillusionment?
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:13.880]   Loss?
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:19.880]   Naomi in the Bible experienced all these things.
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:32.880]   In the darkest of journeys, God met her and he crafted a new beginning for her.
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:39.880]   Let me share with you the one that impacts my intimacy that I wrestle with the most.
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:41.880]   Laziness.
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:45.880]   A nicer word is procrastination.
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:49.880]   Put up your hand if you're brave enough to join me on that.
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.880]   Procrastinating, yeah.
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.880]   There's a few of us.
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:56.880]   Glad I'm not on my own.
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:04.880]   You see, intimacy requires intentionality and it requires our time.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:12.880]   It requires a slowing down of our fast-paced, crowded minds and hearts.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:17.880]   The verse we shared earlier speaks of loving God with all of our hearts
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:22.880]   and with all our souls and with all our minds.
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:28.880]   That means that some things have to get out of the way.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:34.880]   Some things that have taken up space in our hearts and our souls and our minds
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:39.880]   need to get out of the way.
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:46.880]   Whatever our reasons today, whatever the things are that impact our intimacy,
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:51.880]   many times we don't want to look into the mirror.
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:58.880]   We're afraid of his conviction, afraid of his challenge,
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:06.880]   scared of what he might ask us to give up or surrender.
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:12.880]   Proverbs 3 verses 5 to 6 say, "Trust in the Lord with all your heart.
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.880]   Lean not on your own understanding.
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:22.880]   In all your ways submit to him and he will make your paths straight."
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:27.880]   Trust today that the Lord knows you better than you know yourself.
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:34.880]   He also knows what you need better than you know yourself.
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:39.880]   Trust today that he's a good father.
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:44.880]   Intimate encounters with God change the course of our lives.
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:49.880]   They form the foundations on which everything else is built,
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:53.880]   like faith and trust.
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:58.880]   I want to share an intimate encounter that I had with God with you
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:03.880]   to show you how it can change the course of your life
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.880]   and actually become foundational.
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:14.880]   So in my 20s I was at a conference and I had joined the kind of worship,
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:20.880]   learning about worship, being involved in worship strain that you could choose.
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:25.880]   And part of it was that at the end you got to sing as part of the massive choir
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.880]   at this conference.
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:32.880]   So I'm on stage as part of this huge choir and we're singing this song,
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:36.880]   "He's a Father to the Fatherless."
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:42.880]   Now if you know my story, I was put up for adoption at two weeks old.
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:46.880]   So we're singing this song, "He's a Father to the Fatherless,
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.880]   the answer to my prayer."
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:54.880]   And as I sang those words it was like a video reel went on in my head
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:59.880]   and I could see this video playing out.
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:03.880]   And God showed me that at two weeks of age,
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:07.880]   he showed me lying in a crib in the hospital where I had been put up
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:13.880]   for adoption and I was crying in the crib because I knew that whoever
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:17.880]   had been holding me was no longer there.
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:21.880]   And God showed me that he walked into that room,
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:26.880]   he put his hands on the crib and he leant over me and he said,
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.880]   "I will be your father.
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:33.880]   And what the enemy has determined for evil in your life,
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:38.880]   I will turn it around for good."
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:43.880]   And in this moment, standing in this choir,
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:48.880]   it was like rejection and the things that I had battled,
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:53.880]   I was quite a people pleaser because I was so insecure about my own
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:57.880]   self-worth, I would crave it from other people.
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.880]   So I'd try to please them so that they would, you know,
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.880]   pat me on the back and tell me how good I was.
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:08.880]   But in that moment that God showed me his great love for me and that he was
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:12.880]   in my story, that he had chosen to be my father,
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:18.880]   it was like the rejection thing got turned off.
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:24.880]   And I was so sure of my value.
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:28.880]   And from that moment on, that became a foundation on which I
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:33.880]   could build the rest of my relationship with God and my relationship with
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:39.880]   others, that complete security that I was valued and I was known and I was
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:46.880]   loved and I was wanted.
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:51.880]   God today is inviting us all to deepen our intimacy with him and our
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:55.880]   trust and our faith in him.
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:22:00.880]   And we're going to take some time today to lean into that.
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:05.880]   I'm going to invite the musicians and singers to come.
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:12.880]   So what we're going to do as we end this service is we're going to close
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:19.880]   our eyes and we're each going to imagine those two armchairs.
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:25.880]   Now some of you may have to rearrange your armchair because maybe it's not
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.880]   quite facing God at the moment.
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:31.880]   Maybe you have to get it out of storage.
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:34.880]   But we're going to visualize those two armchairs and we're going to
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:43.880]   visualize ourselves facing God.
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:48.880]   You can have an intimate encounter with God anywhere.
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:54.880]   This week I was on the bus to school, the E41 that takes me to Taipo,
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:59.880]   and I visualized myself sitting in an armchair with God facing me sitting
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:03.880]   in his armchair.
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:07.880]   And he said to me, "Susanna, I love you."
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:12.880]   And I went to turn my head because sometimes you're embarrassed when you
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:20.880]   realize how much you're loved and how much we can let God down because we
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:25.880]   don't give him back the same level of love.
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:30.880]   But as I went to turn my head in shame, he gently drew my head back and he
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.880]   said, "Don't look away.
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:36.880]   Hold my gaze.
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:38.880]   Let's do this together."
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:43.880]   And he held my hands.
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:49.880]   Today when you visualize that armchair, don't turn your face away.
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:55.880]   Hold his gaze.
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.880]   You're not alone.
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:03.880]   He'll do it with you, together.
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:10.880]   He loves you.
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:13.880]   So we're going to take some time now.
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:18.880]   The music will just play in the background.
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:25.880]   Shut out every distraction.
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:29.880]   You are so important to God.
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:33.880]   He's waiting for you.
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:38.880]   And if you choose to sit in that armchair, know that he will be right there
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.880]   with you.
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:44.880]   And he's got something to say to you today.
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.880]   It might come as a picture.
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:51.880]   It might come as one gentle word.
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:55.880]   But he's got something for you today.
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:58.880]   So we're going to take some time to be intimate with him.
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:05.360]   him.
