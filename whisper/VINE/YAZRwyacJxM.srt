1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,080
 I'll just now say it again,

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,280
 everybody needs you, a friend like Justin Ho, seriously.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,180
 Love you, brother.

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,780
 Well, I also want to start just this morning

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,940
 by honoring my friends and colleagues

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,600
 who have shared from the pulpit over the past four months,

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,800
 especially in this series over the past five, six weeks.

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,820
 It's been amazing, it's been so refreshing

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,840
 to hear different voices unpack certain topics

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,640
 of the Bible and just the talent

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,280
 and the depth of the relationship

12
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,760
 that our pastors have in this church

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,400
 and in order to faithfully bring the word to you.

14
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,440
 I'm really honored to work with such a great

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,120
 and amazing team and we're really glad,

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,040
 of course, to have Andrew back as well.

17
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,020
 And so, so today, you know,

18
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:48,680
 we are closing out our forgiveness series

19
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,080
 and it's been a great journey,

20
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,120
 but even though today, you know,

21
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,720
 it's the end of the sermon series,

22
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,160
 it's by no means the end of our journey in forgiveness.

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,120
 And the message I'm bringing today,

24
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,680
 excuse me, it's been sitting in my heart

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,640
 for, you know, some weeks now

26
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,440
 and I've been wrestling with it,

27
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,400
 I've been fasting and praying for it,

28
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,720
 which I don't always do.

29
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,920
 Just confession, right?

30
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,260
 I don't always do, leading up to a sermon,

31
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,480
 but this one, I have been.

32
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,320
 And so before we start, I hope we can pray again, right?

33
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,440
 And you to pray for me too

34
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,880
 as we open up scripture together.

35
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,080
 So let's pray, church.

36
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,840
 Jesus, just thank you for your word, Lord,

37
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,000
 the depth and the richness

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,160
 and the conviction that comes from it.

39
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,800
 Help us to listen well,

40
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,560
 to draw in well to your word today, Jesus,

41
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,460
 as we open up scripture as a family, Lord.

42
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,360
 Be with us in Jesus' name we pray, amen.

43
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,580
 Okay, good morning.

44
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,160
 Good morning if you're joining us online

45
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,560
 and overflow as well.

46
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,860
 Let me ask you a question first.

47
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,880
 What is the worst date that you've ever been on?

48
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,700
 Okay, the worst date.

49
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,480
 Okay, maybe some of you are on a date right now

50
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,080
 and you're about to say,

51
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,520
 I was thinking I was gonna brunch today,

52
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,600
 but this person brought me to church instead, right?

53
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,020
 It's a pretty terrible date right now, okay?

54
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,400
 I hope it won't be, all right?

55
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,640
 Let me share one of my experiences with you, okay?

56
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,000
 This is like 20 plus years ago now, okay?

57
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,760
 I was a new university student in London.

58
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,940
 You know, a new uni student in a new city,

59
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,680
 I'm trying to get to know people, right?

60
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,700
 It's a part of the journey.

61
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,160
 And so I sign up for psychology classes.

62
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,280
 Now, the only reason I signed up for psychology

63
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,880
 was because the rumor was, word on the street

64
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,400
 was that lots of girls did psychology, okay?

65
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,120
 I was 18, 19 years old, okay?

66
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,960
 Don't judge me.

67
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,560
 Some of you come here 'cause there's a lot of girls here.

68
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,400
 Right, so.

69
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,120
 I'm just saying, okay?

70
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,280
 I don't remember a single thing I learned, okay?

71
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,280
 But there was this girl that sat next to me, okay?

72
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,440
 And she was nice, okay?

73
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,280
 She was nice.

74
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,800
 And so I thought to myself, okay,

75
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,480
 let me ask her out for lunch.

76
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,560
 And so we get chatting, and after a few weeks

77
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,120
 of sitting next to each other, I ask her,

78
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,360
 would you like to join me for lunch tomorrow?

79
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,600
 I said, sure.

80
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,440
 Okay, so far, so good.

81
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,520
 She said, all right, let's go to Wagamama's for lunch.

82
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,000
 Okay, and she agrees.

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,800
 Okay, now, for those of you who don't know,

84
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,720
 Wagamama's is a fusion restaurant, okay?

85
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,960
 They take Japanese food and make it terrible.

86
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,760
 Okay, that's what they do, okay?

87
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,760
 [audience laughing]

88
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,400
 Londoners do not like Wagamama's, right?

89
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,000
 I loved it, though, okay?

90
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,920
 You'll see why in a minute.

91
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,840
 Okay, so, you know, lunch date comes along.

92
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,120
 We're eating, conversing.

93
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,240
 Oh, you're from Hong Kong, you're in it?

94
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,520
 Oh, yeah, that's really cool, you know?

95
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,760
 And, you know, chatting along, you know?

96
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,280
 Weather's been a bit rubbish, right?

97
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,480
 British, typical British conversation, okay?

98
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,080
 Having a good time.

99
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,120
 Then come times to pay the bill.

100
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,380
 Now, of course, being the gentleman that I am, right,

101
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,160
 the one who initiated the date,

102
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,400
 I thought it was only appropriate

103
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,960
 that I would, you know, take the bill.

104
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,200
 But it was also because I had a secret weapon.

105
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,120
 You see, I had coupons, okay?

106
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,400
 [audience laughing]

107
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,040
 So, a few weeks before this, right,

108
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,480
 I found on a website that Wagamama's was offering

109
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,000
 buy one, get one free lunches, okay?

110
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,740
 And so I went to the library,

111
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,880
 and I must have printed out like 25 of these coupons, right?

112
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,600
 I cut them all up, okay, and I had them ready, okay?

113
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,680
 I was ready.

114
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,880
 And so, you know, the bill came,

115
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,080
 and I said, I got this, all right?

116
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,800
 And she was pretty impressed, you know,

117
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,400
 and said, I have a coupon.

118
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,440
 It's buy one, get one free, right?

119
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,120
 And I pull out my stack of coupons, you know,

120
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,560
 it's like, and her face, though, right?

121
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,580
 I thought she was thinking, oh my gosh,

122
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,840
 look at this handsome, frugal Chinese man, right?

123
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,000
 [audience laughing]

124
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,040
 Boyfriend material, okay?

125
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,360
 But the look on her face was like shock

126
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,200
 and maybe a little bit of disgust, okay?

127
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,880
 Like, she didn't say it out loud,

128
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,360
 but I knew what she was thinking.

129
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,560
 It's like, wow, this dude is cheap, okay?

130
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,160
 [audience laughing]

131
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,400
 This cheap man, he took me to Wagamama's

132
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,720
 'cause he had two for one coupons, okay?

133
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,040
 So, needless to say, there was no second date,

134
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,760
 but I did keep eating at Wagamama's,

135
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,120
 and it was so good, okay?

136
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,300
 So, I was a poor student.

137
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,920
 And I wish I could say I've changed since then,

138
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,920
 but I'm still kind of cheap, okay?

139
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,940
 For example, okay, my first wedding anniversary,

140
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,720
 my wife is sitting here right now.

141
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,000
 We're celebrating our 15th wedding anniversary,

142
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,480
 by the way, this December, okay?

143
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,320
 So.

144
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,480
 [audience applauding]

145
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,120
 Praise the Lord, okay?

146
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,480
 If you wanna know if God is real, this is proof, okay?

147
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,480
 Like, my first wedding anniversary, okay,

148
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,160
 I have been saving up coins, okay?

149
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,200
 All the loose change I get every day, I throw it in a pot,

150
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,240
 okay, so I saved up a whole bunch of coins.

151
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,200
 I was gonna use that to take my wife out for dinner

152
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,040
 on our first wedding anniversary.

153
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,480
 But, okay, I went to the bank and they said,

154
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,860
 oh, if we change this into cash or whatever,

155
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,280
 it's gonna cost you like 2% of the,

156
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,960
 so I didn't wanna do that, 2%, okay?

157
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,280
 So what I did, I took all the coins, okay,

158
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,680
 and I paid for our meal that evening in coins, okay?

159
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,080
 Like, it was like a $1,000 meal, okay?

160
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,640
 Like, in fives and twos and ones, okay?

161
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,800
 Brittany was embarrassed.

162
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,480
 Again, I thought it was great, okay?

163
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,480
 'Cause, you know, I've been saving up these coins

164
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,900
 for something, okay?

165
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,280
 So that's me, okay?

166
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,120
 Now, you'll see why in a minute

167
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,920
 why I shared these stories with you.

168
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,300
 Over the past five weeks, we've been taking a deep dive

169
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,940
 into the topic of forgiveness.

170
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,460
 And I really hope it's been useful.

171
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,620
 I really hope it's given you a good understanding

172
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,540
 of what God's heart is when it comes to forgiveness

173
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,860
 because we've really needed it.

174
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,180
 But I told you guys at the beginning

175
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,380
 that this was a heart cry from the church.

176
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,060
 I wanna show you something this morning.

177
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,860
 This mixing bowl right here, full of these prayer requests,

178
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,340
 these are the prayer requests

179
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,180
 that were taken up during Converse, right?

180
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,380
 Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds.

181
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,140
 There's even more that wouldn't fit into the bowl, okay?

182
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,260
 Hundreds of these prayer requests,

183
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,940
 all on the topic of forgiveness.

184
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,820
 Lord, help me to forgive.

185
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,900
 Lord, I need forgiveness, okay?

186
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,180
 All of them to do with forgiveness.

187
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,240
 And to say that we were wrestling with this

188
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,840
 as a church would be an understatement, right?

189
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,820
 We were deep in the idea of needing

190
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,700
 to understand what forgiveness is,

191
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,460
 writing out our struggles in this.

192
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,040
 But as we were going through the series

193
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,380
 and as we were coming to an end,

194
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,820
 I noticed some pitfalls or some dangers

195
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,640
 in focusing too much just on the topic of forgiveness.

196
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:26,120
 Because in all this talk about needing to embrace forgiveness

197
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,700
 because it's what God has done for us, right?

198
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,720
 We've began to realize that Jesus has taken away

199
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,000
 all our guilt and our shame.

200
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,980
 He holds nothing against us, which is all true.

201
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,800
 The risk there is that forgiveness

202
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,940
 becomes something we take for granted.

203
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,660
 Our mindset becomes, hey, since it's always there

204
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,080
 and it's free, we can just help ourselves to it,

205
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,020
 then why not, right?

206
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,100
 I'm just gonna live my life how I want,

207
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,500
 do whatever I want, and then just ask for forgiveness later.

208
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,560
 Right, we might even start to take the same mindset

209
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,820
 when it comes to forgiving each other, right?

210
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,060
 We hold forgiveness over each other,

211
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,780
 kind of like a weapon, right?

212
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,980
 We hurt each other, we offend each other,

213
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,300
 but instead of doing the hard work of confessing

214
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,720
 and repenting and changing who we are,

215
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,520
 we develop this mindset of, well, you have to forgive me

216
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,840
 because Pastor Ellison and all those other pastors

217
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,440
 said so in this sermon series, right?

218
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,280
 I can hear it right now.

219
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,400
 Maybe you and your spouse are having an argument.

220
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,920
 You know you've been wrong, you know you've messed up,

221
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,880
 but instead of owning up to the mistakes,

222
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,160
 out comes your mouth.

223
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,120
 You need to forgive me.

224
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,240
 Didn't you listen to the sermon series?

225
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,960
 Okay, listen, if that's what we've walked away with

226
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,120
 at the end of this series,

227
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,040
 then we've caught the wrong end of the stick.

228
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,080
 In other words, if we've come away from this sermon series

229
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,040
 thinking forgiveness, we can access cheaply,

230
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,200
 you know, just like cheap Wagamama coupons

231
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,940
 or just coins that we can bring, okay,

232
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,840
 then we've cheapened forgiveness.

233
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,400
 Forgiveness cannot be something we cheat,

234
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:57,120
 we treat cheaply because forgiveness was God's idea.

235
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,440
 It was his gift to us.

236
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,240
 Right, we even said at the beginning of the series,

237
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,060
 forgiveness is like a journey, right?

238
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,120
 We're learning how to forgive,

239
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,540
 but even that I think is not totally accurate

240
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,360
 because I've realized that actually,

241
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,320
 you can learn to forgive in a lot of different ways.

242
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,400
 What we heard about some of this throughout the series

243
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,080
 is about some of the benefits of forgiveness, right?

244
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,080
 The world of science and psychology tells us that,

245
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,480
 you know, forgiveness brings us many health benefits, right?

246
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,880
 It lowers your blood pressure,

247
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,640
 live longer lives, lowers your stress and anxiety, right?

248
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,120
 So forgiveness you can embrace

249
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,900
 as a way of looking after yourself, right?

250
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,900
 Buddhism teaches forgiveness, right?

251
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,000
 Buddhism teaches, you know,

252
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,980
 as a forgiveness as a way to reach inner peace, okay?

253
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,300
 So you can get to inner peace just by forgiving.

254
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,580
 Hinduism, right, and forgiveness have to do with karma.

255
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,060
 So the more you forgive, the better your karma is,

256
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,040
 you don't come back as something horrible in the next life,

257
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,340
 okay, eventually leads you

258
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:56,580
 to the heights of self-realization.

259
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,740
 Even the Quran teaches forgiveness, right?

260
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,180
 Forgiveness is a virtue that Allah values,

261
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,360
 so the more you forgive, the more virtues you store up

262
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,560
 with Allah for treasures in the next life.

263
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,340
 So if you want to learn just to forgive,

264
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,240
 there's lots of ways to do that.

265
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,300
 But the goal is not to become good at forgiving, okay?

266
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:22,300
 Our goal in life is to become more and more like Jesus.

267
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,200
 That's the ultimate goal.

268
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,880
 Our goal in life is to learn what it means

269
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,740
 to enter through the small and narrow gates.

270
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,540
 Our goal in life is to discover that Jesus is the way,

271
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,460
 the truth, and the life, and no one comes to the Father

272
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,460
 except through him.

273
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:43,060
 Because it's only when we learn to be like Jesus

274
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,460
 that we can truly live out and practice forgiveness

275
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,340
 as God intended for us to do it.

276
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,500
 Listen carefully again.

277
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,040
 If we've learned how to forgive

278
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,460
 without learning how to be like Jesus,

279
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,220
 then we've missed the point.

280
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:01,120
 So we're gonna open up Scripture.

281
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,240
 And the passage we're looking at today

282
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,240
 will remind us of the ultimate goal in our lives

283
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,560
 and the challenge to follow it.

284
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,560
 So Matthew chapter 16, verses 24 to 26.

285
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,720
 Familiar words maybe, but let's look at them again together.

286
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,120
 Then Jesus said to his disciples,

287
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,960
 "Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves,

288
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,460
 "take up the cross, and follow me.

289
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,480
 "For whoever wants to save their life will lose it,

290
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,360
 "but whoever loses their life for me will find it.

291
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,380
 "What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world

292
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,340
 "yet forfeit their soul?

293
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:42,900
 "Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?"

294
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:49,580
 We talk a lot about the benefits of following Jesus,

295
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:53,100
 and indeed, forgiveness is one of those great benefits.

296
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,640
 Once we accept Jesus as our Lord and Savior,

297
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:00,160
 we believe our sins are forgiven and that we're justified.

298
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,980
 The basic idea of being justified means

299
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,360
 that because of God's forgiveness over us,

300
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,080
 our sin is not on the record anymore.

301
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,060
 It's been blotted out, it's been erased.

302
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,080
 The debt of sin has been paid on us, for us.

303
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,800
 So that means when God looks at us,

304
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,160
 he doesn't see our sin.

305
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,240
 Instead, he sees one who is clean, who is pure.

306
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,480
 You can think about it this way.

307
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,060
 A justified me almost means it's just as if

308
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,880
 I had never sinned.

309
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,880
 So that's available for us, it's free.

310
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,800
 Well, free for me and you, of course,

311
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,280
 but it wasn't totally free

312
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:36,520
 because forgiveness came at the great cost of Jesus' life.

313
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,840
 And because it comes at the great cost of his life,

314
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,940
 we cannot treat it cheaply and with content.

315
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:47,920
 Like I said, if we do this, it's like treating forgiveness

316
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,760
 like things we can just, free coupons we can use

317
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,240
 all the time, okay, and just access whenever we need.

318
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,980
 Yes, forgiveness is free, but it's only free

319
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:00,240
 because Jesus paid the price we cannot pay for ourselves.

320
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,860
 And even though it is available to all,

321
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,780
 there are certain conditions that God gives us

322
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:11,360
 in order to properly receive his gifts and benefits.

323
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,900
 The point of forgiveness is not just to comfort you

324
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,340
 when you feel sad, to make you feel better

325
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,660
 when you've done something wrong, right?

326
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,580
 Forgiveness is actually meant to change you,

327
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,420
 to shape you, and mold you, to encourage you

328
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,860
 to become more like his son.

329
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:31,340
 In other words, if you want to know the full benefits

330
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:36,100
 of forgiveness, you have to become a discipleship,

331
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,380
 a disciple of Jesus.

332
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,380
 And when it comes to becoming a disciple of Jesus,

333
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,940
 when it comes to following Jesus,

334
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,980
 it comes with change in our lives, real change.

335
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,380
 It comes with a cost to our lives as well.

336
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,700
 But this only makes sense because if not,

337
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,420
 anyone could call themselves a Christian, right?

338
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,820
 Anyone could call themselves a Christian,

339
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,380
 keep living lives however they want,

340
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,380
 receive God's forgiveness, but again,

341
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,140
 that's cheapening the whole idea of God's grace

342
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,860
 and his mercy.

343
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,020
 If we want to call ourselves Christians,

344
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,860
 if we profess to follow Jesus with our lives,

345
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,300
 it's gonna cost us something.

346
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,900
 There are changes that must be made.

347
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:20,460
 There's a certain way God expects us to live

348
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,660
 as his followers.

349
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:28,380
 So the question is, what does it cost us to follow Jesus?

350
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,620
 Well, if you go back to the passage,

351
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,300
 we're gonna find out.

352
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,700
 Verse 24, Jesus starts by saying,

353
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,080
 if anyone would come after me.

354
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,340
 Anyone.

355
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,060
 Now, anyone means anyone, okay?

356
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,580
 This means you, this means me,

357
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,460
 this means anyone who's listening right now.

358
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:49,220
 This is an invitation to all people at all times.

359
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:53,980
 Anyone can choose to become a disciple of Jesus.

360
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,980
 But notice I used the word choose, right?

361
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,340
 If you want to.

362
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,020
 If also means it's a choice.

363
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,540
 If you want to become a disciple of Jesus,

364
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,060
 these are the things we're gonna have to walk in.

365
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,100
 God's not gonna drag you kicking and screaming

366
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,140
 into a relationship to follow him.

367
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:14,260
 That's not true following, that's not true discipleship.

368
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,540
 That's not true love.

369
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,540
 He's not gonna do that.

370
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,560
 We all have a choice.

371
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,640
 And Jesus is about to explain, if you want to follow me,

372
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,580
 there are requirements.

373
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:29,620
 We're about to dive in into something

374
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,220
 that might change the definition

375
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,140
 of what it means for you to follow Jesus.

376
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:34,980
 And I'm gonna tell you,

377
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,940
 it's more than just coming to Sunday services.

378
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,420
 It's more than just giving an offering, volunteering,

379
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,080
 being part of a community group,

380
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,260
 as amazing and good as those things are

381
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,700
 for the life of a Christian,

382
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,460
 it's gonna be much more than that.

383
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:52,180
 So the question, maybe the most important question

384
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:55,500
 you could ever ask yourselves in your life is this.

385
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,080
 Do you want to go after Jesus?

386
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:03,300
 Do you want to be a disciple of the Lord?

387
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,460
 Because if you say yes,

388
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,660
 it's going to drastically change your life forever.

389
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,920
 If you say yes, we're about to leave,

390
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,700
 we got to lean into some things we need to do

391
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,980
 in order to follow him.

392
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,100
 Firstly, it teaches us this.

393
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:24,220
 A disciple of Jesus must deny himself.

394
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,460
 Your first step in deciding to follow Jesus

395
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,900
 is to deny yourself.

396
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,500
 Now, what does this mean?

397
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,380
 It's not just, ooh, I better not have that chocolate.

398
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,620
 Ooh, I better not have that cake,

399
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,500
 moment on the lips, lifetime on the hips.

400
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,780
 It's not just that.

401
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,520
 It's not that kind of deny yourself.

402
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,480
 But what this is talking about, church,

403
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,560
 it's talking about the full and total surrender

404
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,760
 of your life into his hands.

405
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,820
 Okay, think about this for a second, all right?

406
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,520
 Because we live in a day and age, right,

407
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,000
 where the prevailing mindset seems to be

408
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,720
 you can and should have whatever you like

409
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,720
 whenever you like, right?

410
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,960
 The world says take control of your life, right?

411
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,460
 There's this belief out there that teaches us, right,

412
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,020
 we are so much in control that you can truly have

413
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:18,660
 whatever you want, all you need to do is manifest it, right?

414
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,500
 You heard of that term, manifesting, right?

415
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,420
 The idea, okay, is making everything you want and feel,

416
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,380
 okay, everything you, sorry, let me say it clearly.

417
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,820
 The idea of making everything you want to feel

418
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:34,380
 and experience a reality through your thoughts,

419
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,100
 your actions, and beliefs.

420
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,600
 In other words, what it's saying is deny yourself nothing,

421
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,400
 but whatever makes you feel good,

422
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,280
 that's what's good for you, so do whatever you want.

423
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,680
 Okay, listen, this sounds good, it sounds attractive,

424
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,480
 do whatever you want, manifest whatever you want,

425
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,280
 deny yourself no pleasure, right?

426
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,680
 Some preachers out there might even say

427
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,080
 this is God's will for your life, right,

428
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,040
 to live a life of constant bliss and blessings

429
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,240
 with no struggles, right?

430
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,760
 This is a lie, church.

431
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,460
 Think about it for a minute.

432
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:12,660
 If life was about making yourself happy,

433
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,860
 why would we need God?

434
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,940
 Well, if you could just manifest whatever you wanted

435
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,680
 all the time, serve your own needs,

436
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,140
 you wouldn't need God, you would be God yourself.

437
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:26,980
 So denying yourself is not really about, you know,

438
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:32,460
 it's about embracing a whole different way to live.

439
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,780
 It's about discovering, actually, your true purpose in life.

440
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:40,160
 And your purpose in life, our purpose in life, right,

441
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,640
 it's not for you to discover the pleasures of this world.

442
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,600
 Your purpose in life is not to live a happy,

443
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,600
 comfortable life, die peacefully in your sleep.

444
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,600
 Your purpose in life is not to become the best

445
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,760
 at whatever you're doing.

446
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,920
 Your purpose in life is not to find a partner,

447
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,560
 get married, and settle down.

448
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,720
 Your purpose in life is to become a follower of Jesus,

449
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,400
 because you have been made an image bearer of God.

450
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,580
 Your purpose in life is to worship Jesus

451
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,020
 with all your heart, mind, and strength,

452
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,900
 to be an example of his love to others.

453
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:18,900
 Above everything else, this is your ultimate goal in life.

454
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:23,000
 And for you to be able to do that,

455
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,500
 you're gonna have to deny yourself.

456
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,100
 You're gonna have to be willing to say,

457
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,220
 everything else is gonna take a back seat,

458
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,320
 and I'm gonna fully dedicate myself

459
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,780
 to becoming more like Jesus.

460
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,740
 And I know it sounds extreme, right?

461
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,340
 It almost sounds as though Jesus is trying

462
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,180
 to kill everybody's personality,

463
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,940
 so we all act in the same way, right?

464
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,080
 It sounds a bit like Jesus is to get rid

465
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,740
 of everything enjoyable in your lives, right,

466
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:51,180
 and force you to be grumpy and miserable all the time.

467
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,520
 It sounds a little bit like Jesus is saying,

468
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,660
 don't have fun, just follow me.

469
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,800
 But that's not true, either.

470
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,660
 That could be further from the truth.

471
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:04,220
 Remember the story of the rich young ruler.

472
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,460
 He is the person who encounters,

473
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,220
 and he's actually interested in who Jesus is

474
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,320
 and in giving his life to him.

475
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,180
 But when he is challenged to deny himself

476
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,260
 of a significant wealth and possessions,

477
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,420
 he couldn't do it.

478
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,100
 And he walked away grieved, the Bible tells us,

479
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,660
 even though he still had all the riches

480
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:29,440
 that he ever wanted, he walked away grieved.

481
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,680
 On the other hand, when Zacchaeus,

482
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,680
 another wealthy man who's interested in following Jesus,

483
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,880
 when he realizes what he has to do,

484
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,640
 he gladly gives everything up.

485
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,480
 He says, I'm gonna pay back four times

486
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,880
 what I stole from other people.

487
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,300
 He gives away all himself, denies himself all of that,

488
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:49,760
 and Jesus declares that salvation

489
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,340
 has come to his house today.

490
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,860
 The one who was willing to deny himself

491
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,420
 discovered the true meaning of life.

492
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,860
 The one who was not willing to deny himself

493
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,840
 walked away from the giver of life.

494
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,100
 Church, let me remind us today,

495
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,740
 denying yourself, fully surrendering

496
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,900
 to anything Jesus wants you to do,

497
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,300
 this has to be the first step that you must take

498
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,400
 in your life of following Jesus.

499
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,960
 Right, so how do we do it, though?

500
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,100
 How do we do this, rise up to this challenge

501
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,860
 of denying yourself, right?

502
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,980
 It's not just a matter of strong will, right?

503
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,660
 Strong will can lead you to do a lot of crazy things.

504
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:35,260
 I've done two marathons, okay, with zero training, okay,

505
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,020
 just based on willpower alone, I'm not kidding, okay?

506
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,700
 I did two trail walkers even, no training,

507
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,980
 I just got up that morning,

508
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,700
 decided to go do it with my group, okay,

509
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,260
 went and did it, finished, okay,

510
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,780
 I almost died at the end of all those events, okay?

511
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,660
 Don't recommend it, okay?

512
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:52,400
 But you know, your willpower, your grit

513
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,560
 will get you certain places,

514
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,020
 but it's not gonna be able to help you in this that much.

515
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:03,440
 There's an even more drastic step that you have to take.

516
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,920
 And Jesus tells us the next step, then,

517
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,240
 is to, if you want to, come after me,

518
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,960
 deny himself, and pick up your cross.

519
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,280
 Pick up the cross.

520
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,940
 Now, again, the idea of picking up your cross,

521
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,760
 I feel like it's sort of a concept

522
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,520
 that's been cheapened by modern day thinking, right?

523
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,720
 It's sort of a cutesy little phrase that we say sometimes,

524
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,080
 right, I'm gonna pick up my cross,

525
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,360
 and we think of it as something like

526
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,800
 an irritating burden that you need to bear, right?

527
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,920
 Oh, you know, the cross I have to bear,

528
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,960
 my cross is this gout in my big toe, you know,

529
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,060
 acts up all the time, every time I eat, you know,

530
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,480
 spicy noodles, my gout flares up, okay?

531
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,260
 Or my cross to bear is to have to work

532
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,320
 with Dave over here, right?

533
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,880
 I have to see him every day, you know,

534
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,760
 and Dave is such a burden to me, right?

535
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,680
 It's much more than that, though.

536
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:54,120
 The cross is not just an annoyance.

537
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:58,080
 The cross was an instrument of death, right?

538
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,480
 And picking up the cross means that we deny ourselves

539
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,280
 to the point where we think of all our earthly passions,

540
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,060
 our sinful desires, as crucified and put to death.

541
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:11,200
 Taking up the cross not only means to deny yourself,

542
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,340
 it actually means to die to yourself.

543
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,320
 Dietrich Bonhoeffer says it this way,

544
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,280
 when Christ calls a man or a woman,

545
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,100
 he bids him to come and die.

546
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,560
 If we just stop that denying ourselves,

547
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,280
 that stuff is still sort of there, right,

548
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,040
 lingering in the background, you know,

549
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,200
 and the danger is, you know, like a bad habit,

550
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,400
 we always run the risk of going back to it.

551
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,840
 It's familiar, it's warm, right?

552
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,080
 There is a sense of like safety in sin

553
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,480
 as messed up as that is.

554
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,160
 But scripture doesn't call us just to resist sin,

555
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,440
 no, that's just the first step.

556
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,000
 The next step scripture tells us to do

557
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 is put the sin in our old lives to death, right?

558
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,240
 Time and time again, the Bible tells us to do this.

559
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,440
 Check it out, Galatians 5:24,

560
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,440
 "Those who belong to Christ have been crucified

561
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,720
 "with the flesh and its passions and desires."

562
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,500
 Romans 6:11, "In the same way, count yourselves," what?

563
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:10,500
 "Dead to sin, but alive in God to Christ Jesus."

564
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,780
 Matthew 5, 29 to 30, Jesus talking to us,

565
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:17,000
 "If your right eye causes you to stumble,

566
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,060
 "gouge it out and throw it away.

567
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,960
 "If your right hand causes you to stumble,

568
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,100
 "cut it off and throw it away."

569
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,180
 2 Corinthians 5, 17, "So if anyone is in Christ,

570
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:33,180
 "he is a new creation, what is old has passed away.

571
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,380
 "Look, what is new has come."

572
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:42,060
 Without dying to ourselves, there will always be the risk

573
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:45,300
 of going back, doing things according to your own agenda.

574
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,960
 Without dying to ourselves, we will want to say no

575
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,700
 when God says yes.

576
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,240
 We will say stop when God says go.

577
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,600
 We'll say I'm not ready when God says go and do this for me.

578
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,920
 And the attachments we have to the things on this earth

579
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,640
 will always try to stop us

580
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,940
 from living a life full with Jesus.

581
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:08,800
 Now Jesus isn't just trying to make you

582
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,320
 a better version of yourself, right?

583
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,540
 Put some, you know, you put makeup on a pig,

584
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,840
 it's still a pig, you know what I'm saying?

585
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,640
 Okay, he's not just trying to give you

586
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,540
 a better version of yourself.

587
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:21,200
 What Jesus is offering you is a brand new life.

588
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,480
 And in order to have this brand new life,

589
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,740
 the old life must die.

590
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,720
 This is what it means to be born again.

591
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,480
 This is why we sometimes, when we come to Christ,

592
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,220
 we call us the process to be born again.

593
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:36,700
 We are buried with him by baptism into death

594
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,360
 in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead

595
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,840
 by the glory of the Father,

596
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,600
 we too might walk in the newness of life.

597
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,280
 Do you resonate with this church?

598
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:52,080
 Is your desire to know Jesus even in his death

599
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,700
 and going to the cross your number one priority in life?

600
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:00,600
 Are you willing not just to deny, but to die,

601
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,840
 to throw away your old life

602
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,880
 so that you may know and follow Jesus?

603
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,120
 I know, like I said, it sounds radical,

604
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,120
 it sounds extreme, right?

605
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,480
 Even as I was preparing this, you know,

606
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,160
 it's like, "Oh, chill, you know, it's not that serious."

607
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,420
 But it really is.

608
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:19,100
 It's not radical.

609
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,960
 This should be the norm for people who want,

610
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,680
 who say they follow Jesus.

611
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,360
 We should be able to stand here like Paul does and say,

612
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,600
 "I resolve to know nothing else

613
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,840
 "except Jesus Christ and him crucified."

614
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,620
 Without dying to our old life,

615
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:41,500
 we will never embrace the new life offered to us,

616
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:45,280
 a life where Jesus can finally give us an invitation

617
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:49,920
 by saying, "Then come and follow me."

618
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:55,600
 This becomes your only purpose in life.

619
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,760
 Not chasing whatever feels good,

620
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,120
 not satisfying your flesh,

621
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,380
 but our aim after old life has been crucified

622
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,920
 is to wholeheartedly, single-mindedly,

623
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:10,920
 with every single fiber in our body, follow Jesus.

624
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,480
 This is discipleship.

625
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,680
 This is what it means when we say

626
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,240
 we're trying to grow big people,

627
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,240
 not in ourselves, but in Christ.

628
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,640
 When people have denied their lives to the point of death

629
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,400
 so that they can follow Jesus

630
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,520
 with absolutely nothing holding them back,

631
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,720
 this is the cost.

632
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,360
 This is the people that Jesus is seeking.

633
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,400
 If you really wanna experience God's forgiveness over us,

634
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,480
 then this is what we have to do.

635
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:46,040
 Deny yourself, pick up the cross, and follow him.

636
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,160
 So let me ask us again,

637
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:53,860
 do you want to follow Jesus?

638
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:59,320
 Because if you do, a life with Jesus will mean discipline.

639
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:03,200
 A life with Jesus will mean denying yourself

640
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,020
 and putting your sin and old life to death.

641
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:10,320
 Following Jesus, it will mean suffering.

642
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,240
 It will mean the risk of persecution.

643
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,760
 It will mean being misunderstood by people around you.

644
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:20,760
 It will mean wholehearted obedience to him and him alone.

645
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,880
 It's gonna mean walking by faith and not by sight.

646
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,860
 It means loving your neighbors as you love yourself.

647
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:30,400
 It's gonna mean even loving your enemies.

648
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:34,220
 It's gonna mean standing up for justice.

649
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:37,780
 It means loving those others have deemed as sinners.

650
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:40,160
 It means sacrificial giving.

651
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,460
 It means looking after the widows and the orphans.

652
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:46,380
 It means proclaiming the gospel boldly.

653
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,980
 It will mean the world might hate you.

654
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:52,460
 It's gonna mean going down the narrow, more difficult gate.

655
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,980
 It's gonna mean dropping everything

656
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:56,860
 like the disciples did at the sound of his voice.

657
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:00,220
 It will mean putting him above all else.

658
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:03,180
 It's gonna mean spending time in his word.

659
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,660
 It's gonna mean thinking about things

660
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,580
 that are pure and noble and true.

661
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,720
 It's gonna mean committing yourself to a church,

662
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,620
 the body of Christ, serving the church.

663
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:17,420
 It will mean forgiving others as Jesus has forgiven you.

664
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:20,480
 It's gonna mean loving your wife as Christ loved the church.

665
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,320
 It's gonna mean praying for your husband.

666
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,220
 It's gonna mean teaching the children

667
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,880
 the way they should go.

668
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,020
 I could go on and on and on and on,

669
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,440
 but it also means this.

670
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,980
 It also means freedom from sin and darkness.

671
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:39,020
 It means joy.

672
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:43,020
 It means being surrounded by a community that loves you.

673
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,020
 It means living a life full of the power

674
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,240
 of the Holy Spirit that goes with you wherever you go.

675
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,400
 It means seeing miracles, signs, and wonders.

676
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,700
 It means being filled with wonder and awe and worship.

677
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,060
 Even when we look up at the sky,

678
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:59,280
 we realize there's a God who created all this.

679
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:03,460
 It means a life full of purpose and direction.

680
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:06,740
 It's gonna mean a life that is not governed by fear,

681
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,880
 but driven by love.

682
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,900
 It's gonna mean a life that's free from shame.

683
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,820
 It's gonna mean enjoying the blessings

684
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,960
 that God chooses to give you.

685
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,400
 It's gonna mean a life of fruit.

686
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,760
 It's gonna mean whole and healthy families.

687
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,260
 It's gonna mean discovering the reason

688
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:26,140
 why God put you on this earth,

689
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,660
 was to follow him and to worship him.

690
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:34,400
 It means becoming, it means Jesus becoming the one

691
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:38,320
 and only significance for your life.

692
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:43,320
 This, my friends, is the only life that is worth living.

693
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,880
 But it's a choice.

694
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,600
 Like I said in the beginning, this is a choice.

695
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,840
 It's a question of if.

696
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,860
 Which is why Jesus also gives us very clear consequences

697
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,760
 of what life will turn out like

698
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,400
 if we don't choose to follow him,

699
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,100
 if we don't put our hope with him.

700
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:07,960
 For whoever would save his life, Jesus says, will lose it.

701
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:12,620
 But whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.

702
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,180
 In other words, what he's saying is,

703
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:18,480
 the more you try to control your own life,

704
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,900
 the more you live life on your own terms,

705
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,580
 the more you refuse to deal with your sin and darkness

706
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,860
 and hold on to vengeance and retribution,

707
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:28,400
 the more you try to be your own savior,

708
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,560
 you're gonna lose your life.

709
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,940
 And I was trying to come up with a cutesy story

710
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,940
 and an example for this, but actually,

711
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,260
 at the end of the day, it's just,

712
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:41,000
 this is one of those things where you have to say,

713
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,540
 if you know, you know.

714
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,900
 And you're not gonna know

715
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,940
 until you actually make that decision to do that.

716
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,700
 Because in the wisdom of this world,

717
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,420
 it doesn't make sense.

718
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,460
 It really doesn't make sense.

719
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,340
 The world tells us to look after yourselves,

720
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,580
 prioritize your needs, make your life comfortable.

721
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,500
 And yes, these things are important.

722
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:03,580
 Don't get me wrong, this is not a call into self-abuse.

723
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,220
 That's not the point.

724
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:08,100
 Right, when Jesus calls someone

725
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,980
 to come to a life of following him,

726
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,660
 it's not a call of misery and suffering

727
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:15,340
 just for the sake of suffering.

728
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:18,020
 But he does call us to leave everything behind.

729
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:18,860
 Why?

730
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:21,660
 Because no one can serve two masters.

731
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,620
 He does say you have to love the Lord your God

732
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:28,180
 with all your heart, all your soul, and all your mind.

733
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,260
 And we're never gonna be able to do this

734
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:33,160
 by holding on to our own vision for our lives.

735
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,420
 Yeah, 'cause I know it doesn't make sense.

736
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,780
 But what doesn't make sense

737
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,940
 is actually the way it's supposed to be.

738
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:44,860
 So let us not be so foolish and be deceived

739
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,900
 to think that the world's way of doing things

740
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,120
 is the right way to do it.

741
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,300
 Right, scripture tells us that it might sound

742
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,940
 like foolishness from the world's perspective,

743
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:58,480
 but the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom.

744
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,380
 1 Corinthians 1:25.

745
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,700
 And this will only make sense

746
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,560
 when Jesus has transformed your mind,

747
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,860
 when your hearts are renewed,

748
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,020
 when we have died and received new life,

749
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,020
 when we see the freedom that comes

750
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,980
 and the fruit that comes with a life

751
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:18,160
 wholeheartedly devoted to walking with Jesus.

752
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:24,160
 It's like what the people do in Matthew 13 in this parable.

753
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,800
 The kingdom of heaven following Jesus.

754
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,920
 It's like treasure hidden in a field.

755
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:34,620
 When a man found it, he hid it again,

756
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:38,520
 then in his joy went out and sold everything he had

757
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,720
 and bought that field.

758
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,760
 Again, following Jesus is like a merchant

759
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,440
 looking for fine pearls.

760
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,760
 When he had found one of great value,

761
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:51,760
 he went away, sold everything he had and bought it.

762
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:58,180
 The only thing, the only way to find out

763
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:00,600
 what Jesus has in store for you

764
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,160
 is for you to give him everything you've got.

765
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,320
 It will cost you everything.

766
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,660
 There are no half measures in this journey.

767
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:15,880
 It's sink or swim, but when you give everything you've got

768
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:20,840
 to Jesus, he promises to give you life

769
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,900
 and life in the full in return.

770
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:28,160
 Now, how does this relate to forgiveness?

771
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:32,200
 Well, you see, this is what forgiveness is really for then.

772
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,920
 I think I alluded it at the beginning of the message.

773
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,040
 It's not the get out of jail free card

774
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,600
 that we think gives us permission to do whatever we want

775
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,960
 and God asks God to pardon us, you know,

776
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,080
 do it first, ask forgiveness later.

777
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:47,440
 Like I said, that's cheapening God's grace.

778
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,720
 But forgiveness becomes this sort of guidance

779
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,440
 and encouragement for those who have made that decision

780
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,240
 to follow Jesus with everything they have.

781
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,100
 Because Jesus knows, God knows in this journey,

782
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,680
 you're gonna mess up.

783
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,120
 Right, we are not perfect people.

784
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:05,080
 We're on the way to our citizenship in heaven,

785
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,160
 but we're not quite there yet.

786
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,120
 So you're gonna stumble, you're gonna fall,

787
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,740
 you're gonna mess up, you're gonna make mistakes

788
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,560
 along the way.

789
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,700
 But this is where forgiveness comes in.

790
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,680
 This is where God comes along and uses forgiveness

791
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,760
 as an encouragement when you fail and you fall

792
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,320
 to pick you back up when we make those bad choices

793
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,160
 to say it's okay, just keep walking this way,

794
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,500
 keep coming along with me, I have forgiven you.

795
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:34,400
 If we're dedicated to walking this way with Jesus,

796
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,200
 then forgiveness becomes like a safety net

797
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,000
 that catches us when we fall

798
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 and encourages us along to carry on.

799
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,880
 Without forgiveness, our relationship with Jesus

800
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,740
 would not be possible.

801
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:52,960
 And so you see all these prayers, church,

802
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,960
 this isn't actually a call for forgiveness, I think.

803
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,940
 All these prayers that we wrote out as a church,

804
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:02,500
 I see this as a desire, as a heart,

805
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:06,080
 as a cry to make us more like you, Jesus.

806
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,720
 We wanna be more like you.

807
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,080
 I wanna deal with this junk, I wanna deal with this stuff

808
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:14,200
 in my life so that I can embrace the true life

809
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:18,460
 that you've given me, so that I can be free to follow you.

810
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:23,480
 So let's not cheapen forgiveness, church.

811
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:29,000
 In order for Jesus to forgive us, it cost him his life.

812
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,580
 So it's only fitting that if we want forgiveness,

813
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,940
 we have to give him our lives.

814
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,920
 This is the kind of people he's looking for.

815
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,880
 So don't wait.

816
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:47,120
 This is my last encouragement to you, don't wait.

817
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:50,880
 If you have been reminded that Jesus asks of you today,

818
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,360
 or this is the first time you're making such a decision,

819
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,520
 do it now.

820
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,400
 Right, some of us, I know when we hear a message like this,

821
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,960
 okay, I know, Alison, I know,

822
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,720
 but just I need a bit more time,

823
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,680
 there's certain things I need to deal with first, okay.

824
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,220
 Do this, maybe experience this

825
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:08,940
 before I give my life to Jesus.

826
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:13,360
 There's a passage about this.

827
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,300
 Jesus warns us against this, right.

828
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,120
 Those of us who say, I'm gonna take life easy,

829
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,760
 eat, drink, and be merry, and then I'll go on

830
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,960
 and about my business with the Lord.

831
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,960
 Only for God to respond, you fool.

832
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,960
 Tonight, this very night, your life

833
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,160
 will be demanded from you.

834
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:36,320
 We don't know how much time we have, church.

835
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:41,720
 Jesus is coming back, you could be called back home today.

836
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:46,300
 Today, right now, in this moment,

837
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:50,460
 is the time to make that decision to follow Him,

838
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:55,460
 to discover the life that He has called you to live,

839
00:37:55,460 --> 00:38:00,360
 the only path that leads to true life.

840
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,760
 So I wonder if you would pray with me, church.

841
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:14,220
 Like I said, the series on forgiveness ends today,

842
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,460
 but our need for forgiveness will never end

843
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,540
 until we see Jesus face to face.

844
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:24,500
 So our prayer is that we would be a church,

845
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:28,940
 a generation that, a body of Christ

846
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,620
 that decides to take Jesus seriously

847
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:36,020
 at His word, that when we say we're living

848
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:40,360
 for Jesus and Him alone, we really mean that.

849
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:44,340
 That we are a church that values the gift

850
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:49,340
 of forgiveness so, so much, we realize

851
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,180
 what it costs Jesus, that as a church,

852
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:54,020
 we've decided we're not gonna cheat this cheaply

853
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,180
 and with contempt.

854
00:38:55,180 --> 00:39:01,240
 Instead, I'm gonna embrace it in my life,

855
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:06,240
 and use it as the way Jesus shapes us

856
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:11,260
 and molds us to be more like Him.

857
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:20,060
 And the good news is that we don't do this alone, church.

858
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:26,220
 And we have the Holy Spirit that guides us,

859
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,100
 that leads us, that walks alongside us,

860
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,380
 that helps us do impossible things,

861
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,520
 things we could never do by our own power.

862
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:36,260
 The ability to resist sin, to run from temptation,

863
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,580
 to put our old lives to death.

864
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:42,460
 That is done through the power of the Holy Spirit

865
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,900
 at work in your lives.

866
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:51,660
 And so Jesus, we come before you now as a church.

867
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:57,180
 As people making up the body of Christ,

868
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:01,680
 as your children who you've made in your image, God.

869
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:10,380
 To say, and if you really wanna say this,

870
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,720
 then I pray that this is your prayer.

871
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,980
 To say, Jesus, I give my life to you.

872
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:22,920
 I'm willing to walk away, to put to death even,

873
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,360
 everything else in my life,

874
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:29,160
 in order that I may know you and you first and foremost.

875
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:37,380
 That I might embrace your purposes and your will

876
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:41,080
 and your vision and your calling for my life.

877
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:46,400
 And whatever it costs, Jesus, I'm willing to do this

878
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,700
 because I know this is where the true purpose

879
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,100
 of my life is found.

880
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:56,100
 So Jesus, help us in this journey.

881
00:40:56,100 --> 00:41:00,720
 Holy Spirit, help us in this journey.

882
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:05,580
 And help us to encourage each other too.

883
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,120
 This is why you've binded us together.

884
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,340
 This is why the church matters.

885
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,360
 We don't do this alone.

886
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,440
 Yes, we have the Holy Spirit.

887
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,240
 We also have each other to help us along.

888
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:18,700
 To pray, to be an example, to encourage.

889
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:24,700
 So Jesus, may we be people who are wholeheartedly,

890
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:30,840
 all in, fully dedicated to following you,

891
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,420
 no matter what it costs us.

892
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:37,600
 In Jesus' name I pray, amen.

893
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:47,600
