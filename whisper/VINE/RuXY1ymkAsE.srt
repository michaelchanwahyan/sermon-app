1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
 A while back, actually it's a long time ago,

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,760
 I was in a conflict.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:11,240
 And it wasn't one of those conflicts where one time something happens,

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:16,480
 but it was a conflict that just kind of kept meandering along.

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,520
 Like, one thing happens, another thing happens,

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,200
 and another thing happens that make you upset.

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,360
 And I got to the point where I was just fed up.

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,560
 I had it. I had enough.

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,800
 So this person was so rude, so inconsiderate,

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,400
 you know, how dare they.

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,080
 And I don't know, I can't remember exactly what happened,

12
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,000
 but I was challenged, either by a friend or through a book

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,160
 or something I was doing, I was challenged

14
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:54,520
 to pray a prayer of blessing over this person.

15
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,680
 And I was like, that is the last person

16
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,080
 that I want to pray a prayer of blessing over.

17
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,320
 I didn't want to do it.

18
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,440
 But eventually I did it anyhow.

19
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,000
 So I prayed for this person, and I was having problems with

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,320
 a blessing over them.

21
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,640
 And I don't remember how many times I prayed this,

22
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,440
 but at one time, while I was praying,

23
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,280
 the Holy Spirit suddenly highlighted to me

24
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,880
 and gave me insights into a lot of pain and difficulties

25
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,880
 that this person had gone through.

26
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,360
 And that really allowed me to have a different level

27
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,720
 of compassion and care,

28
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,480
 because it provided context for how they were acting towards me.

29
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,720
 Now, don't get me wrong.

30
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,640
 I still believe that as adults, we're responsible for how we act,

31
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,400
 and we need to own our actions and everything.

32
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,160
 But it still was helpful to understand the context,

33
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,640
 and it gave me a lot of compassion and care.

34
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,000
 And eventually it really changed my outlook on the person.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,520
 I started looking at the person in a different way.

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,880
 Now, what had happened?

37
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:18,600
 Well, instead of looking at the person through my human wisdom

38
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,960
 and my human understanding,

39
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:27,960
 when I prayed, God gave me spiritual sight.

40
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,680
 He let me see this other person through his eyes

41
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,000
 instead of just seeing them through my eyes.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,120
 And that was so powerful because it allowed me to suddenly

43
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,240
 be more patient, to show more grace,

44
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,920
 to be more understanding,

45
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,520
 but then also eventually to be able to forgive

46
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,240
 and to really just move forward.

47
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,320
 You know, it's amazing, right?

48
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,080
 When God gives us spiritual sight,

49
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,960
 when he gives us a faith perspective,

50
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,440
 how we suddenly can navigate,

51
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,760
 you know, something where we only had one way of looking at it,

52
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,720
 we're suddenly able to navigate it differently,

53
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,200
 and it can make all the difference.

54
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,840
 Now, we all in our lives, in big ways and in small ways,

55
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,920
 we have situations, circumstances

56
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,200
 where we're looking right now at them

57
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,160
 from a human perspective with human wisdom.

58
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,600
 And that's okay because we're human

59
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,080
 and we should use our human perspective.

60
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,840
 We should use our human wisdom.

61
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,480
 But I really have the sense,

62
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,720
 as I was writing this sermon series and preparing this for us,

63
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:43,480
 that God wants to give us spiritual sight this year,

64
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,000
 that he wants to give us a deeper faith perspective

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,720
 of what he's doing, of what is going on,

66
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,400
 so that instead of just seeing the things

67
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,840
 through our limited lens,

68
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,000
 that we can have a fuller perspective,

69
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,640
 that we can understand what God is doing,

70
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,560
 that we can face, if it's a challenge,

71
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,560
 that we can face the challenge with hope,

72
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,680
 with courage, with perspective and trust in him,

73
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,000
 or if it's an opportunity

74
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,680
 because it can also be positive things, right?

75
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,480
 That we also know how to walk,

76
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:17,560
 how God is leading and what he wants us to do.

77
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,120
 And so I want to explore with you

78
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,640
 the following question that's this.

79
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,200
 How can I cultivate spiritual sight

80
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,800
 in approaching and understanding my life?

81
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,320
 How can I gain a greater faith perspective?

82
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,600
 How can I more consistently see things

83
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,600
 through the eyes of faith?

84
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,040
 And how in the world do you do that?

85
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,960
 What does that look like?

86
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,960
 And how might God invite you

87
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,640
 to have deeper spiritual sight this year?

88
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,440
 So I'm excited about this.

89
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,080
 We're continuing in our sermon series, Bold in Prayer.

90
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,480
 Last week, we looked at Matthew 9,

91
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,520
 where we talked about that Jesus,

92
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,760
 as he was seeing the crowds and was seeing their needs,

93
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,560
 and they were helpless and they were rest,

94
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,280
 he invited the disciples to pray

95
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,520
 for the Lord of the harvest to send out,

96
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:24,000
 to cast out, to thrust out workers into the harvest field.

97
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,120
 And I really believe that part of that is,

98
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,720
 part of that thrusting out is that actually

99
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,040
 God also gives us different spiritual sight

100
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,720
 so that we start looking at our days,

101
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,720
 at our routines, at the people around us in different ways.

102
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,800
 And we can understand where he's at work

103
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,040
 and where he's inviting us to partner with him

104
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,440
 in the work that he is doing.

105
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,400
 So that's what we looked at last week.

106
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,680
 Today, we are in 2 Kings.

107
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,240
 I want to provide a little bit of context for you.

108
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,280
 And I'm going to start by looking at a map

109
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,360
 that I stole from Pastor Ivan that he used this morning.

110
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,800
 I was like, "Oh, this makes it a lot easier

111
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,760
 to explain what I want to explain."

112
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,080
 So let me use the same map.

113
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,040
 So 2 Kings to give a little bit context

114
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,840
 since we are not consistently right now

115
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,200
 walking through the book of 2 Kings.

116
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,040
 So first there's a reign of King Solomon

117
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,160
 and also the demise of that.

118
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,400
 There's a separation of Israel being one nation

119
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,280
 to being two kingdoms, Judah and Israel.

120
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,520
 So the Southern kingdom, the Northern kingdom.

121
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,720
 We're going to pick things up

122
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,040
 around the ninth century before Christ,

123
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:36,040
 where the prophet Elisha, he is in Dothan.

124
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,880
 I want to say Gotham, but it's Dothan.

125
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,720
 You know, Germans have problems with T-H.

126
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,560
 Dothan.

127
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,480
 And we're also going to be looking at Samaria,

128
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,120
 which was the capital of the Northern kingdom.

129
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,720
 And its King Jehoram is Israel's king.

130
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,120
 He's actually not even mentioned in the passage

131
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,040
 that we're going to look at by name.

132
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,440
 Let me go to the other side.

133
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,520
 All right.

134
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,000
 And then we're going to look at King from Aram

135
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,440
 who was raiding, attacking, warring with Israel.

136
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,440
 So this is the broad context.

137
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,880
 There's a lot more going on,

138
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,160
 but I think that gives you a little bit of an idea

139
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,520
 of what's going on.

140
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,960
 So let me take you to 2 Kings 6.

141
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,120
 We're starting in verse eight.

142
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,520
 It says this.

143
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:28,240
 Now the King of Aram was at war with Israel.

144
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,720
 After conferring with his officers, he said,

145
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,320
 "I will set up my camp in such and such a place."

146
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,280
 I think it's very cool that the Bible uses the word

147
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,240
 such and such.

148
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,560
 Verse nine.

149
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,800
 The man of God sent word to the King of Israel,

150
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,640
 "Beware of passing that place

151
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,520
 "because the Arameans are going down there."

152
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,800
 So the King of Israel checked on the place

153
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,600
 indicated by the man of God.

154
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,640
 Time and time again, Elisha warned the king

155
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,520
 so that he was on his guard in such places.

156
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,960
 Now it's enraged the King of Aram.

157
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,440
 He summoned his officers and demanded of them,

158
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,320
 "Tell me which of us is on the side of the King of Israel."

159
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,000
 "None of us, my lord," said one of his officers.

160
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,120
 "But Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel,

161
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,840
 "tells the King of Israel the very words he speak

162
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,040
 "in your bedroom."

163
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,000
 "Go find out where he is," the king ordered.

164
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,040
 "So I can send men and capture him."

165
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,560
 The report came back.

166
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,280
 He is in Dothan.

167
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,280
 Then he sent horses and chariots and a strong force there

168
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,200
 and they went by night and surrounded the city.

169
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,160
 So we're told King of Aram, he's picking a fight.

170
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,760
 He's warring against Israel.

171
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,840
 He makes all these amazing plans

172
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,920
 with his officers in the war room.

173
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,840
 But for whatever reason, his plans are always thwarted.

174
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:59,480
 The King of Israel is always able to avoid him.

175
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,760
 So they're not able to catch him.

176
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,520
 They're just always able to escape.

177
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:10,000
 And so the king realizes this,

178
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,760
 I mean, this is beyond coincidence.

179
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,760
 One time, okay, two times, okay, three times, okay,

180
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,160
 four times, come on.

181
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,000
 Who's the leak?

182
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,720
 Who's the mole?

183
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,680
 And so then he's told that it's not any of his officers,

184
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,520
 but it's a prophet, Elijah,

185
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,160
 and that he knows the very words

186
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,480
 that are spoken in the bedroom of the king,

187
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,880
 which is very creepy.

188
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,880
 But what that means is if Elijah, the prophet,

189
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,280
 knows what is spoken in the bedroom,

190
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,960
 that means he knows everything.

191
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,880
 He can hear everything.

192
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,120
 He can perceive everything.

193
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,080
 God has given him supernatural sight, supernatural insight

194
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,560
 into what's going on.

195
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,600
 And so the King of Aram decides we're gonna go after him,

196
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,280
 but I just wanna highlight a contrast here.

197
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,600
 The King of Aram has no idea where Elijah is,

198
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,200
 while Elijah knows everything about the King of Aram.

199
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,000
 So he even needs to send out a spy to figure out

200
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,640
 where he is to send someone there.

201
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,560
 And so then he sends the troops, horses, chariots,

202
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,800
 that would be the equivalent

203
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,720
 of the most modern military equipment there is.

204
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,600
 I have no idea what the most modern military equipment is.

205
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,480
 I assume it's like drones and helicopters

206
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,360
 and things, but they're sending like

207
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,560
 their special forces there.

208
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,240
 And that's a bit of overkill for catching one person,

209
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,640
 but the King is so frustrated

210
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,680
 that he's like fully going for it.

211
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,040
 Let's continue in verse 15.

212
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:39,320
 "And when a servant of the man of God got up

213
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,840
 "and went out early in the morning,

214
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,800
 "an army with horses and chariots had surrounded the city.

215
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,000
 "Oh no, my Lord, what shall we do?

216
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,160
 "The servant asked, don't be afraid.

217
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,600
 "The prophet answered, those who are with us

218
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,200
 "are more than those who are with them.

219
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,000
 "And Elisha prayed, open his eyes, Lord,

220
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,840
 "so that he may see.

221
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,280
 "Then the Lord opened the servant's eyes and he looked

222
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,560
 "and he saw his hills full of horses

223
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,600
 "and chariots of fire around Elisha.

224
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,600
 "So now instead of seeing things

225
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,960
 "from the Arameans perspective,

226
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,800
 "now the narrative shifts and we get to see things

227
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,320
 "from Elisha and his servant's perspective.

228
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,960
 "We get to see things from their point of view.

229
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,840
 "And so Elisha's servant gets up, he steps outside

230
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:40,880
 "and oh my gosh, oh no.

231
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,880
 "That's what he says, oh no.

232
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,520
 "They are surrounded by enemy forces.

233
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,760
 "Like I said, it's the most modern military equipment.

234
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,680
 "So this is intimidating, this is scary.

235
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,960
 "He is freaked out.

236
00:11:54,960 --> 00:12:01,960
 "And so he calls out, oh no, my Lord, what shall we do?

237
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,400
 "So he calls out to the man of God,

238
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,360
 "who also of course indirectly represents God, Elisha.

239
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,600
 "Like, oh no, what shall we do?

240
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,600
 "Now it would be easy to just pass over this really quickly,

241
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,920
 "this oh no moment.

242
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,880
 "But when you and I go through an oh no moment,

243
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,840
 "it doesn't usually just pass quickly.

244
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,080
 "It actually really occupies us,

245
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,280
 "we're really challenged with this.

246
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,640
 "And so I don't want us just to pass over it quickly.

247
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,400
 "Because the truth is that there is something

248
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,840
 "that every one of us at one point or another,

249
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,960
 "we feel surrounded, we feel fenced in.

250
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,240
 "We are overwhelmed by the challenges

251
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,840
 "that are going on in our lives,

252
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,520
 "where we also, like the servant Elijah,

253
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,920
 "have an oh no moment.

254
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:57,560
 "Where there are things we see

255
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,680
 "and we do not know the way out.

256
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,440
 "We do not know what to do.

257
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,080
 "We have no answer, we have no way forward.

258
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,200
 "So that is what the servant Elijah is seeing.

259
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,800
 "He's seeing enemy forces on the hills,

260
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,640
 "they're surrounded and they're about to get them.

261
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,880
 "And so then he calls out to Elijah.

262
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,360
 "And Elisha responds, don't be afraid.

263
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,720
 "Those who are with us are more than those who are with them.

264
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,320
 "Now I have a question for you.

265
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,920
 "If you're overwhelmed, if you are freaked out

266
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,800
 "about the challenges in your life

267
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,160
 "and somebody just tells you, don't be afraid,

268
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,480
 "how do you feel about that?"

269
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:42,920
 Might be annoying, right?

270
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,120
 Let's be honest.

271
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,440
 And we do that a lot in church, right?

272
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,800
 We tell each other things are true,

273
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,920
 but sometimes we just don't wanna hear them.

274
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,880
 "Don't be afraid."

275
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,440
 He's like, "How can you tell me not to be afraid?

276
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,800
 "There's like horses and chariots all around us

277
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,120
 "and we're about to be in enemy's arms

278
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,680
 "and we're about to be taken captive.

279
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,880
 "Like what in the world are you talking about?

280
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,600
 "Elisha, are you crazy?

281
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,640
 "And by the way, what do you mean

282
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,960
 "that those who are with us

283
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,200
 "are more than those who are with them?

284
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,040
 "What do you mean by that?

285
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,880
 "What does it even mean?

286
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,640
 "Who are you talking about?"

287
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,680
 That's probably how I would have reacted.

288
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:25,080
 And so what Elijah's servant doesn't know

289
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,400
 is that Elisha has spiritual sight.

290
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,320
 He's able to see what is going on around him,

291
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,480
 not just from a human perspective,

292
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,440
 but from a supernatural perspective.

293
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,640
 He understands how God is at work in the moment

294
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,640
 and that makes all the difference.

295
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:52,760
 And so he prays for his servant's eyes to be open.

296
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,840
 So in verse 17, it says,

297
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,320
 "And Elisha prayed, 'Open his eyes, Lord,

298
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,720
 "so that he may see.'

299
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,560
 "Then the Lord opened the servant's eyes,

300
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,920
 "and he looked and he saw the hills full of horses

301
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,040
 "and chariots of fire all around Elisha."

302
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:14,920
 So Elisha prayed for spiritual sight for his servant,

303
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,040
 and God opened his servant's eyes,

304
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,920
 and he suddenly was able to see the circumstances,

305
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,840
 the situation that he's in, that he's facing,

306
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,120
 from a completely different perspective.

307
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,760
 While just a moment ago he's crying, "Oh, no,"

308
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,200
 and he's overwhelmed and there seems to be no way out,

309
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:40,440
 now his eyes are opened and he sees those who are with us

310
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,400
 are more than those who are with them.

311
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,000
 And he sees the chariots of fire,

312
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,840
 he sees the heavenly hosts, the heavenly army

313
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,960
 outnumbering the enemy that is there to get him.

314
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:58,800
 Wow, what a perspective, what a change in perspective.

315
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:10,200
 And you know the words, "Do not be afraid that he spoke,

316
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,400
 "that at first might seem annoying."

317
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,720
 Now that his eyes are open,

318
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,600
 ooh, I do not have to be afraid,

319
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,480
 'cause these words of do not be afraid,

320
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,280
 they're not just wishful thinking,

321
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,640
 they're actually based in the reality

322
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,920
 of who God is and what God is doing.

323
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,400
 Can I get an amen, come on?

324
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,920
 Amen, yes.

325
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:41,240
 And so, so he does not have to be afraid,

326
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,760
 and you know this is true for us as Christians,

327
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:51,160
 because what we see is not everything that is going on,

328
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,400
 there is a spiritual reality, Psalm 34 verse seven says,

329
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,280
 you know that the angel of the Lord

330
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,120
 encamps around those who fear him.

331
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,240
 So if you're walking with God,

332
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,600
 the angel of the Lord surrounds you and encamps you.

333
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:14,600
 God is with us, you know, we are not alone, he is for us.

334
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,120
 And that's another thing in a situation,

335
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,920
 it's not just that he gets to see,

336
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:22,360
 but it also means that God is with Elisha and his servant,

337
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,520
 they are not alone, and neither are you and I,

338
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,280
 we are not alone, God is with us,

339
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:35,160
 and he is for us, even more than we can imagine or think.

340
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:40,960
 So God is for you, and he's greater and more powerful

341
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,360
 than you can think or imagine.

342
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,320
 I mean, I don't know about you,

343
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,600
 when you walk around through your day,

344
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,440
 if you have in mind who God is constantly

345
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,960
 in all his fullness and all his glory and all his power

346
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,720
 and all his majesty and all his love, I don't,

347
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,360
 I want to, but truth be told, I don't.

348
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:09,600
 So God is more powerful, more loving, more caring

349
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,960
 than you and I can imagine,

350
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,560
 and he is at work in our lives,

351
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:20,440
 just as he is at work in the life of Elisha

352
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,200
 and his servant in this moment.

353
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,520
 But let's continue and see what happens.

354
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,720
 Verse 18, "As the enemy came down toward him,

355
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,400
 "Elisha prayed to the Lord,

356
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,100
 "strike this army with blindness.

357
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,980
 "So he struck them with blindness, as Elisha had asked.

358
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,120
 "Elisha told him, this is not the road,

359
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,960
 "and this is not the city, follow me,

360
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,240
 "and I will lead you to the man you are looking for.

361
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,760
 "And he led them to Samaria.

362
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,000
 "So after they entered the city,

363
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,660
 "Elisha said, Lord, open the eyes of these men

364
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,960
 "so that you can see.

365
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,440
 "And the Lord opened their eyes and they looked,

366
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,320
 "and they were inside Samaria."

367
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,800
 Now remember, Samaria was the capital

368
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,480
 of the northern kingdom.

369
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,600
 They're inside the capital of the enemy.

370
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,360
 And Elisha had led them there.

371
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,960
 So we're told that Elisha prayed a second time,

372
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,600
 so they do attack.

373
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,560
 So just because we know who God is,

374
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,440
 that he's powerful and great,

375
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,040
 doesn't mean that we still go through

376
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,000
 whatever challenge we're facing,

377
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,520
 but we can walk through it differently

378
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,760
 because we know the power of God,

379
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,280
 we know who God is, and so we can face it differently.

380
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,440
 And so as they are coming at him,

381
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,040
 he prays and God answers his prayer,

382
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,740
 and he strikes them with blindness.

383
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,180
 Now what's interesting is,

384
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:45,060
 and I didn't catch this on multiple readings,

385
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,620
 only after I read some commentaries and things,

386
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:51,100
 is that actually the blindness that is talking about here

387
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,500
 is not physical blindness.

388
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,340
 You're like, what do you mean not physical blindness?

389
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:01,340
 Well, the Hebrew word that is used here,

390
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:08,180
 sanverim, it's a very rare word.

391
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,140
 It's not the normal word that is used for blindness.

392
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,500
 It's actually only used three times,

393
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,800
 twice in this passage, once in Genesis.

394
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:19,900
 And it means blindness, dazzling, and deception.

395
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:26,540
 And so in NIV, it's translated as blindness,

396
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,180
 but if we look at the context,

397
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,940
 I think we can see that something else is going on.

398
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:37,620
 Elisha asks them to follow him,

399
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:41,260
 that he's gonna lead them to who they're looking for.

400
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,360
 How can they follow him if they can't see?

401
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,140
 And this is still, I think it's like 11 miles or something,

402
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,040
 so it's still quite a stretch.

403
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,540
 Secondly, he's telling them,

404
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:57,740
 oh, this is not the road and this is not the city.

405
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,380
 They were just looking at the city.

406
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,300
 They were just on the road.

407
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,140
 Just because you're physically blind suddenly

408
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,460
 doesn't mean that somebody can tell you

409
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,560
 this is not the road, this is not the city.

410
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:12,460
 So something has changed in the perception.

411
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,980
 They have distorted perception.

412
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,680
 God has blinded them from the reality

413
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,500
 of the situation that they're in.

414
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:22,980
 And so then Elisha is able to lead them

415
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:27,140
 into the city, into Samaria,

416
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:31,380
 which is the hub of Israel,

417
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,220
 into the enemy from the Arameans' perspective,

418
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,420
 the enemy's territory.

419
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:41,340
 And then he prays for them again and their eyes are open.

420
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:44,060
 And now they can see where they're at.

421
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,500
 And that's for them an oh no moment.

422
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:51,140
 So earlier we had the oh no moment for Elijah's servant,

423
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:55,260
 now we have the oh no moment for the Aramean soldiers.

424
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,180
 Let's continue in verse 21, see what happens.

425
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,740
 So when the king of Israel saw them,

426
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,660
 he asked Elijah, shall we kill them?

427
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,180
 My father, shall I kill them?

428
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,700
 He's like very eager.

429
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,100
 Do not kill them, he answered.

430
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,180
 Would you kill those you have captured

431
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,140
 with your own sword or bow?

432
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,060
 Set food and water before them

433
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,180
 so that they may eat and drink,

434
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:19,100
 then go back to their master.

435
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,700
 So he prayed a great feast for them,

436
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,100
 and after they had finished eating and drinking,

437
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,280
 he sent them away and they returned to their master

438
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,760
 so the bands from Aram stopped raiding Israel's territory.

439
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:35,000
 I mean I can only imagine what it must have been like

440
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,960
 as these soldiers, as their eyes are opened

441
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,480
 and they're like oh my goodness,

442
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,600
 no we're in enemy territory, we're surrounded.

443
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,440
 And there's a king who's like drooling

444
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,400
 over the opportunity to kill them.

445
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,920
 But since they were not the king's prisoners,

446
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,920
 they were Elijah's prisoners,

447
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,800
 he actually, I believe also through spiritual sight,

448
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,280
 through what God had revealed to him,

449
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,360
 he shows them mercy and grace,

450
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,920
 and that then allows them that this conflict,

451
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,080
 at least for a while, actually does continue eventually,

452
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,120
 but for a while this conflict ends between Israel and Aram.

453
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,680
 Now this whole passage is,

454
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,080
 there's two dynamics that I wanna highlight.

455
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,720
 The first one is that it's all about sight.

456
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,880
 You know Elijah sees and knows the plans

457
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,320
 and knows what's going on and what they wanna do.

458
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:36,480
 And the king of Aram, he doesn't know,

459
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,800
 he doesn't have sight.

460
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:42,800
 Then the military, they surround Elijah and a servant

461
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,840
 and the servant doesn't have sight

462
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,760
 and then God gives him sight and then they take away,

463
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,200
 so as you see it's all about vision

464
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,240
 and seeing and not seeing.

465
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,560
 And this brings me to a second point is,

466
00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:00,520
 all of this also shows that God is sovereignly

467
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,720
 over the situation.

468
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,760
 There are politics going on,

469
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,160
 there are world powers or regional powers here

470
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,640
 in this case fighting,

471
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:13,520
 but God is sovereign in the midst of this conflict

472
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,560
 and is working out his purposes and what he desires,

473
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,080
 what he wants comes to pass.

474
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,120
 And there's a third thing I actually wanna highlight to you

475
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,400
 and that is that is a relationship between Elijah and God

476
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,200
 because we see Elijah pray three times,

477
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,880
 open his eyes, blind them, open their eyes.

478
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,800
 And Elijah is walking in this relationship with God

479
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,440
 and that's why he has spiritual sight

480
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,520
 about what's going on.

481
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,720
 Now, of course, this leaves us at the point

482
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:50,120
 of asking question, what does all of this mean for us?

483
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,240
 This brings us also back to the earlier question

484
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,640
 that I asked, how can we cultivate spiritual sight

485
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,720
 in approaching and understanding our lives?

486
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:04,320
 How can we start not just looking at our circumstances,

487
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,040
 our challenges from a human perspective,

488
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:12,480
 which we again still should because God has made us

489
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,600
 and given us that, we should use our human reason

490
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,920
 and wisdom and all of those things,

491
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:21,920
 but how can we also look at things with spiritual sight?

492
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:26,360
 With eyes of faith or see things through the eyes of God?

493
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,160
 Now, how do you do that?

494
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,200
 Well, there's three things I wanna highlight.

495
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,920
 The first one is this really happens

496
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,880
 through a relationship with Jesus.

497
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,600
 Now, if you wanna have spiritual sight,

498
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,480
 if you wanna understand what God is doing,

499
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,400
 if you wanna see beyond just the physical reality,

500
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,920
 you need to know Jesus

501
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,680
 'cause when you become a Christian,

502
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,520
 actually even talks about it,

503
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,360
 it'd be move from darkness to light

504
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,840
 or from spiritual blindness to sight,

505
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,960
 it's part of how the Bible describes even conversion

506
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:06,960
 or coming to faith, you gain a different perception,

507
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,040
 a different perspective of reality

508
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:13,400
 because now you can see things through eyes of faith.

509
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,200
 You can see that Jesus really is the Savior,

510
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,640
 that he is God's son, that he did die, that he did rise,

511
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,400
 that he is powerful over death, over sin,

512
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,600
 that he is able to forgive us

513
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,160
 and you can all see this because you are a Christian.

514
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,960
 But then just because we're a Christian

515
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,200
 doesn't mean that we always have spiritual sight.

516
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,400
 I mean, earlier I was telling a story of me,

517
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,400
 I was in this conflict and I was not having spiritual sight.

518
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,720
 I was having just my human perspective of what was going on.

519
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,680
 And so we need to nurture our relationship with God

520
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,880
 to develop the sight.

521
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:00,200
 And so as our relationship and intimacy with God grows,

522
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,640
 so does your spiritual sight grow.

523
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,800
 So if you wanna have spiritual sight,

524
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,120
 we did invest time in our relationship with God,

525
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,400
 which we're doing right now through his fasting season.

526
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,280
 Now coming before God with our fasting, with prayer,

527
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,560
 with reading of scripture, with worship

528
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,080
 or whatever else you're doing.

529
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:26,280
 But then the second thing is that the way we gain more sight

530
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,760
 is through God's word,

531
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,920
 'cause God's word is God's revelation to us.

532
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:36,600
 It's how he has shown us who he is,

533
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,560
 how powerful, how mighty.

534
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,080
 He has shown us his love.

535
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,640
 He shows us his purposes that he has for us

536
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,640
 through his word.

537
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,880
 And so if we don't know his word, we have limited sight.

538
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,640
 But as we get to know God's word,

539
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,560
 he wants to give us more of a faith perspective

540
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,240
 'cause we know God's revelation more

541
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,520
 and we can see things differently.

542
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,680
 We can see things through a lens of faith.

543
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:06,080
 Now, as I was thinking this through,

544
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,280
 I was reminded of Psalm 119, 105.

545
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:13,480
 "Your word is a lamp for my feet and a light on my path."

546
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,720
 It's like we're walking around in darkness

547
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,600
 because we're not seeing everything.

548
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,480
 But as we go into God's word

549
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,440
 and the Holy Spirit illuminates God's word to us,

550
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,000
 we can start seeing who God is.

551
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,240
 He speaks to us even directly about things that are going on

552
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,920
 and gives us an understanding.

553
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,200
 And it's like light on a path.

554
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,560
 Like before you're working in darkness,

555
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,640
 now as you're gaining sight,

556
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,480
 you're working in darkness,

557
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,720
 now as you're getting to know God more through his word,

558
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,920
 it's like your path lights up,

559
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,800
 you're more clear on where to walk and what to do.

560
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,920
 And so if you wanna grow in sight,

561
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,680
 you need to spend time in God's word.

562
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,800
 And he wants to light up your path

563
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,520
 in the way that he has for you,

564
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,120
 whether it's in challenges, whether it's an opportunity,

565
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,080
 whether that's with your dreams.

566
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,720
 But he will light up your path

567
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,200
 and he will show you a way.

568
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,240
 So for some of us here,

569
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,560
 this might be one thing that God is inviting you this year

570
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,600
 is to go deeper into his word.

571
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,840
 And when we read God's word,

572
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,040
 we can ask the Holy Spirit to illuminate it,

573
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,400
 to help us understand his word,

574
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,640
 to show us what it means for us.

575
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,440
 And he does that, he loves doing that.

576
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,440
 So that is the second important thing.

577
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,680
 That's one way that we live out that relationship

578
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,840
 is through his word, as we come to his word

579
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,480
 and ask God to help us understand and spend time.

580
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:47,720
 So we gain spiritual sight by getting to know God's word

581
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,120
 and the Holy Spirit illumining God's word to us.

582
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:54,960
 And finally, we cultivate spiritual sight

583
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,720
 and approaching and understanding our life through prayer.

584
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,160
 And that's really what the passage really focuses on.

585
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,600
 Right, it's this praying relationship with Elisha

586
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,400
 and between Elisha and God.

587
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,560
 And where he's able to see things because he prays.

588
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,160
 Prayer is how God gives us spiritual eyes

589
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,800
 to see what we otherwise would not see.

590
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,440
 So if we're not praying,

591
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,520
 there's things you're not going to see.

592
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,600
 God only opens those up when we pray,

593
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,840
 when we come to him and ask him,

594
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,000
 just like Elijah asked for his servants eyes to be open

595
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,200
 so that he could perceive that he was not alone

596
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,000
 in the challenge that he was facing.

597
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,960
 But without prayer and without praying for each other,

598
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,440
 so I also love that it's Elisha praying for Elisha's servant

599
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,080
 without praying for each other and without prayer,

600
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,600
 we're not gonna have spiritual sight.

601
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,400
 We're gonna not be able to see things as clearly

602
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,840
 as they are.

603
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,080
 We're not gonna be able to perceive all of the reality,

604
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,120
 all of what God is doing in circumstance.

605
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,120
 But when we pray, God gives us a vision.

606
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,000
 He gives us sight and helps us to see things

607
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,400
 we're otherwise not seeing.

608
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,240
 And so invited to pray.

609
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,520
 Now, I wanted to share,

610
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,880
 I already shared earlier the story about praying

611
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,480
 and God giving me eyes to see this conflict differently

612
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,120
 and to in the end to be able to resolve it, right?

613
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,240
 So it was the first thing,

614
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,480
 but I wanna share something actually

615
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,720
 that's just church plant.

616
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:26,520
 Now in 2022, that's when we announced in one try

617
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,040
 and the church that sent us here, the Vine,

618
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,040
 we announced that we're gonna be planting this church.

619
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,240
 And then we started meeting as a church plant team

620
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,280
 with like 30 people twice a month.

621
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,440
 And so we're gathering together,

622
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,360
 but we're in one try,

623
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,800
 but we're talking about planting in New Long.

624
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,560
 How in the heck is that going to work?

625
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:48,560
 And so we decide that we're gonna have a one-off barbecue

626
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:53,760
 and Sunday service at EIS International Preschool,

627
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,840
 which is close to Fairview Park, I think,

628
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,400
 I can't remember the exact little town.

629
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,000
 And the day before,

630
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,280
 where we actually were running an alpha at the same school,

631
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:13,000
 I was praying and while I was praying,

632
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,840
 God gave me this overwhelming sense that the next day,

633
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,480
 God was gonna give us a foretaste

634
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,120
 of what this church will be like.

635
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,160
 That he will sort of speaks, pull away the curtain

636
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,520
 and give us a vision of what the Vine in Long will be like.

637
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,280
 And that he was giving us this vision

638
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,560
 to encourage the team, the church plant team.

639
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,080
 Now you have to imagine, we're not a church yet.

640
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,440
 We're just preparing ourselves, but nothing has happened yet.

641
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,600
 We're in one try.

642
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,720
 And I really had the sense that we needed encouragement.

643
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,840
 We needed to be able to see.

644
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,040
 And so God gave us through this service,

645
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,280
 a picture of what this church could be like.

646
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,480
 And then another thing happens.

647
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,720
 We had problems with this venue.

648
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,320
 So even though we were already paying rent for it,

649
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,520
 we couldn't do anything

650
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,680
 because we were waiting for some permits.

651
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:09,000
 And so then suddenly this one off barbecue

652
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,960
 and this one off service, suddenly we knew a way forward.

653
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,720
 'Cause God gave us a way forward.

654
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,680
 We didn't know how to walk.

655
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,560
 This was not part of our plan.

656
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,000
 But now, because God had spoken,

657
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,680
 because he had given us this picture and this experience,

658
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,800
 now we knew what to do.

659
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:32,800
 So in January, 2023, we started meeting every week at EIS

660
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:36,720
 in that preschool.

661
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,160
 And guess what?

662
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,480
 The church started looking like that barbecue

663
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,040
 when we had that Sunday barbecue.

664
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:48,480
 So it's amazing that when we pray,

665
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,840
 that God speaks to us, that reveals things to us,

666
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,840
 that he gives us guidance.

667
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,680
 Now this was not part of our plan.

668
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,960
 I did have a plan on how to plant this church,

669
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:02,120
 but you have to have a plan,

670
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,360
 but you also have to be ready for your plan

671
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,000
 to completely change.

672
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,360
 And this was not our plan and it changed.

673
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,000
 But through prayer, God gave us vision

674
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,200
 and he gave us a way forward that we did not have,

675
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,360
 that I did not have, where I did not know what to do,

676
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,680
 but God showed us what to do.

677
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:23,120
 And it's the same way that God wants to work in your

678
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,200
 and in my life.

679
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,400
 And when we pray, he will give us sight about things

680
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,440
 that we otherwise will not see.

681
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,560
 So we know how to walk, we know what to do.

682
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,760
 We gain encouragement, we gain perspective.

683
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,720
 And so God wants to meet you when you pray.

684
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:43,360
 So we pray, so when we pray, God helps us to see things

685
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,400
 that we otherwise would not see.

686
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,720
 Now I wanna invite the worship team to come up.

687
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,400
 So the prophet, Elisha, he prays over the servant

688
00:34:55,400 --> 00:35:00,600
 and then that he can see, and then he says,

689
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,160
 or before he does it, he tells him,

690
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,320
 "Those who are with us are more than those

691
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,400
 "who are with them."

692
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,660
 Elisha's servant, he could not see it.

693
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:15,000
 And I think there's many of us right now

694
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 we're in situations where we cannot see what God is doing.

695
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,520
 We cannot see how that God is mighty,

696
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,560
 that he is powerful, that he is at work.

697
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:32,960
 We cannot see that God is for us, that he's not against us.

698
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,020
 And so we need to come with prayer

699
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,480
 'cause we need a word from the Lord.

700
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,580
 We're struggling.

701
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:44,160
 We're overwhelmed, some of us.

702
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,760
 And God wants to give us a word,

703
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,620
 he wants to give us a perspective

704
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:52,680
 so that we can move forward, that we are not hopeless,

705
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,800
 that we're not living just in anxiousness and anxiety,

706
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,240
 but that we can have faith that God will move with us,

707
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,700
 that he will provide with us,

708
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,500
 that we can have faith that he's with us,

709
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,140
 that we are not alone,

710
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:10,420
 that we can have assurance that he loves you.

711
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:15,240
 He loves you, he loves you.

712
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:19,620
 He has not given up on you, he is not finished with you.

713
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,200
 There is more ahead.

714
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,740
 And he has a power and the ability to provide.

715
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:32,220
 And just like Elisha's servant,

716
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:36,600
 as I was preparing his message,

717
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:42,580
 I really believe that God wants to meet us here right now

718
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:45,100
 in our oh no moments.

719
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,660
 (soft music)

720
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:53,640
 Some of us are surrounded

721
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:59,400
 by these heavy military forces

722
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,740
 and we don't know what to do.

723
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:07,080
 And we've been carrying,

724
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,800
 some of us have been carrying these oh no moments

725
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,240
 from our 2024 into our 2025.

726
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,100
 And for some of us, these oh no moments have come in 2025.

727
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,000
 We're like, that's not how we wanted to start this year.

728
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:25,040
 But I believe that God wants to meet you right now.

729
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:30,180
 He's inviting us to come to him in prayer and to ask him,

730
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:33,960
 Lord, give me sight, give me spiritual sight.

731
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:38,060
 I'm just, I'm drowning here.

732
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,900
 I need a word from you.

733
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,580
 I need you to meet me.

734
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:45,020
 I need you to give me faith.

735
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,460
 I need you to give me a hope.

736
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:49,860
 I'm struggling to hold on.

737
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:55,500
 I do not know what to do.

738
00:37:55,500 --> 00:38:03,700
 And then as we come to him in prayer,

739
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:08,520
 he is going to release sight.

740
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,540
 He's going to give us words.

741
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,740
 He's going to give us images.

742
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:17,540
 He's gonna put people around us.

743
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:21,300
 And he's gonna show us that we are not alone,

744
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,300
 that he is with us, that we can make it through,

745
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:28,100
 whatever it is, whatever's going on, that he can lead us.

746
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:31,300
 And I also have the sense

747
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:35,660
 that he really wants us to know his power.

748
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,620
 God's power is greater

749
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:44,600
 than the impossible situation you are facing.

750
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:50,180
 He is more mighty, more powerful

751
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:52,780
 than whatever it is that you are going through.

752
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:56,340
 And he has the power and the ability

753
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,700
 to get you through it, to lead you through it.

754
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:03,260
 But not only is he powerful, he also is loving.

755
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:06,960
 He loves you, he is for you, he is not against you.

756
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,540
 (gentle music)

757
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:15,960
 The apostle Paul knew this.

758
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:21,240
 He experienced it himself in his own life.

759
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:25,320
 He didn't have an easy life if you read the New Testament.

760
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,840
 He went through many hardships, trials,

761
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:31,800
 unimaginably difficult things.

762
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:35,000
 And he encouraged the Roman Christians.

763
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,160
 In chapter eight, he says, "If God is for us,

764
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,760
 "who can be against us?"

765
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:46,760
 If God is for you, who can be against you?

766
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,700
 Come on, people.

767
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:53,560
 So part of seeing with spiritual side

768
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:57,160
 is seeing how big God is.

769
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:00,080
 God is bigger than everything.

770
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,160
 He's bigger than the things that appear.

771
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,680
 It's overwhelming to us right now.

772
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,280
 He's bigger than your worry

773
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,600
 that you hold and that you carry.

774
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,800
 He is bigger than your success.

775
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,440
 He's bigger than your failure.

776
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:18,120
 He's bigger than the temptation that you are facing.

777
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,560
 God is bigger, he is more powerful.

778
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,580
 And if he is for you, who can be against you?

779
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:29,960
 So I have a question or questions for us to reflect on.

780
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:36,140
 So what is threatening and surrounding you right now?

781
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:41,720
 What is your oh no moment that you are carrying with you?

782
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:48,380
 Where do you need spiritual side right now?

783
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:04,880
 So church, I wanna encourage you right now.

784
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,460
 If you need spiritual side,

785
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:10,880
 actually I wanna invite everyone to stand.

786
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:18,120
 If you need spiritual side,

787
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,800
 whether it's for an opportunity,

788
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,300
 whether it's for a challenge,

789
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:24,640
 wanna encourage you to stretch out your hands

790
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,720
 right now before you.

791
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:32,800
 And I wanna ask the Lord for you and pray over you.

792
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,900
 Let me pray.

793
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:40,740
 Jesus, I thank you that you are mighty and powerful.

794
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:47,220
 I thank you that you are greater than any of the challenges,

795
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:51,020
 any of the circumstances that we are facing right now.

796
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:54,620
 Lord, you see the Austrian hands.

797
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:56,540
 There is struggle, there is difficulty,

798
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,580
 there is challenge.

799
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:01,440
 But Lord, I pray right now by your Holy Spirit,

800
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,160
 will you come, Holy Spirit come.

801
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,820
 Will you move?

802
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,420
 Will you provide?

803
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:09,500
 Will you raise faith where there hasn't been faith

804
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,820
 in a long time?

805
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:13,000
 Will you pour out your love?

806
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,020
 Where we feel like you have not loved us,

807
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,220
 you have forgotten us.

808
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:19,140
 Lord, will you make your love known right now?

809
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:21,660
 Will you make that a lived reality?

810
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:24,060
 Where there's fear, will you speak the words of us?

811
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,780
 Do not be afraid,

812
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:28,280
 because I am with you, you are not alone.

813
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:32,000
 Thank you, Jesus.

814
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,740
 Thank you, Jesus.

815
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,860
 Give us eyes to see.

816
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,700
 Lord, we need you.

817
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:39,800
 Give us vision.

818
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,060
 Thank you, Jesus.

819
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,560
 Amen, amen.

820
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,100
 Let's worship church.
