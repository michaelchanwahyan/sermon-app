[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   In Jesus name.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.040]   Everyone says, amen.
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.360]   Hey, can we thank our worship team
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.900]   and these guys, grateful for them.
[00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.320]   Have a seat, have a seat.
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.200]   My name's Andrew, I'm one of the pastors here
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.800]   and it's so great to have you with us.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.840]   If this is your first Sunday of 2024,
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.880]   your first service with us this year,
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.240]   we're so glad you are here.
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.400]   Last week, I shared with us all a dream
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.680]   that I sense God had given me at the end of last year
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.440]   or towards the end of last year,
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.440]   that was really a call to intimacy.
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.440]   All the things that I've just kind of been talking about
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.600]   in that prayer moment with us, this call to intimacy.
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.400]   And I said last week that we as a senior leadership
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.760]   here at the Vine, we've been wrestling with all the things
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.280]   that God has been saying to us as a church.
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.920]   And God at the beginning of this year
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.760]   is bringing both a correction and an invitation to us.
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.160]   And we talked about this a little bit in detail last week,
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.240]   that God is bringing a correction to us
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.360]   here at the Vine around our worship.
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.720]   And it's really important that when you're a church,
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.320]   that you keep your ears open and your heart open
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.640]   to all the things that God wants to say to you.
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.200]   And whilst we worship and we honor and we walk
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.360]   with a God of love and peace and mercy and glory and grace,
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.320]   He's also a God that sometimes has things to say to us
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.280]   that aren't always easy to hear.
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.280]   And we've heard here as a leadership
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.160]   that we have to reflect a bit deeper
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.400]   around our worship experiences with God.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.800]   And one of the things that we've heard
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.800]   at the beginning of this year
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.000]   is something that needs a correction in us.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.080]   And that is so often we can come here on a Sunday
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.680]   and experience what we experience.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.800]   And we kind of exist, if you will,
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.680]   off the atmosphere of God, as great as that is,
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.800]   and what a privilege it is to have the presence of God
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.000]   here in the room with us.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.880]   But we think that that's the all,
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.320]   that's the be all and end all.
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.600]   And we don't push beyond the atmosphere of God
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.000]   to the actual person of God,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.360]   to the person of Christ with us.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.880]   And that we kind of settle, if you will,
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.080]   for a feeling of God in the room,
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.800]   rather than a personal, active, and living relation
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.920]   with Him every single day.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.560]   And so last week, we unpacked this idea
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.000]   of how so often we can find ourselves stopping short.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.600]   That the Scriptures would say that it is our praise
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.360]   that is leading us through the gates.
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.960]   We go through the gates with thanksgiving on our hearts,
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.320]   but we go into a deeper relationship with Him.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.000]   Our worship is not us camping at the gates,
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.080]   our worship leads us through the gates
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.560]   into a deeper reality with Him.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.160]   Does that make sense to you?
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.640]   And I said last week that all of us have been created
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.400]   with this innate desire for intimacy with God.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.080]   It's a wonderful, beautiful thing,
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.560]   that God has created you with a desire
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.720]   for intimacy with Him.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.360]   And the reality is, is when we don't satisfy
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.520]   that innate desire for intimacy with God, with God,
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.120]   we'll look for lesser and other forms of intimacy
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.560]   to satisfy what actually can only be satisfied in God.
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.720]   And so often, we look for that intimacy
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.560]   in broken ways with one another.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.840]   And in our brokenness and intimacy together,
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.520]   we think that will plug the intimacy desire
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.920]   that God has given in us.
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.120]   And we talked about last week how it's only in the fullness
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.000]   of that intimacy with Christ that we're then able to walk
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.800]   in healing and good intimacy with one another.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.080]   It flows in that way.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.000]   That was the word of correction last week,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.320]   but there was also a word of invitation for us last week.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.480]   And it was an invitation to orientate
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.000]   all of our lives towards God,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.560]   to recognize that church, this moment that we have together,
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.840]   this incredible 90 minutes that we share on a Sunday
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.800]   is a wonderful, beautiful God gift,
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.320]   and we're so grateful for it,
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.360]   but it's a catalyst into a deeper and greater relationship
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.040]   with Jesus outside of those 90 minutes,
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.120]   and that our relationship with God,
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.120]   our intimacy with Jesus is not dependent on the church.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.520]   The church catalyzes that relationship,
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.160]   but we're not dependent on the church
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.720]   for the fullness of that relationship.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.400]   My heart for you is that you would come in here on a Sunday
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.240]   and you would encounter incredible intimacy with Jesus,
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.080]   but my greater heart for you is that you would find yourself
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.360]   more intimate with Jesus outside of these services
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.480]   than you are even here in these services,
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.520]   that it's in your workplaces and your relationships
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.680]   and your family and you yourself
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.960]   when you wake up on a Monday morning
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.160]   and you open God's word, that in those moments
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.400]   you find the richest of intimacy with Christ,
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.000]   and that you're not coming into church
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.560]   so drained and exhausted after a crazy week
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.600]   seeking an injection of Jesus
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.120]   to get you through the week ahead,
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.800]   but instead the whole week has been a living,
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.440]   embracing faith for you,
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.880]   and you come into service on a Sunday
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.680]   with this overflow of the intimacy of Christ
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.480]   throughout the week, and you can't wait
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.560]   to be with the people of God in the church of God
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.360]   experiencing intimacy together.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.480]   It's a catalyst to your faith.
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.520]   Your faith should not be dependent on it.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.720]   Are you with me, church?
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.800]   So there's a correction, but there's an invitation.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.200]   And last week I spoke about a biblical definition
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.040]   of this kind of intimacy.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.520]   I wanna start by reading this to you once again.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.360]   An orientation of all of life
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.840]   that pushes beyond just a feeling of God
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.960]   to an actual real and deep relationship with him
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.720]   that produces in us the fruit of assurance,
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.800]   confidence, and joy.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.040]   That's what I think God is welcoming
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.360]   and inviting the vine into this year,
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.760]   inviting you personally into this year,
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.520]   an orientation of all of your life
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.280]   where you're not just existing off of some feeling of him,
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.640]   but you have a tangible, real daily relationship with him
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.320]   that creates a fruit in you of confidence and assurance
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.360]   and joy that you feel the fullness of life.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.000]   And I tell you what, Hong Kong right now,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.840]   our world right now needs churches
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.120]   filled with individual Christians
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.280]   who have assurance in their faith,
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.840]   confidence in the gifts of the Holy Spirit,
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.640]   and a joy for life so that they could go
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.480]   into the workplaces, into the marketplace,
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.720]   into the corridors of power of that city,
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.080]   and speak of that assurance and that confidence
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.280]   and that hope and bring a new narrative to this world.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.800]   Surely we need that.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:25.400]   Our intimacy with God produces an overflow in us
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:31.360]   towards this world that God so deeply loves.
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.280]   What I wanna do this week and next week
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.640]   is share two critical traps
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.600]   that I think all of us Christians fall into
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.160]   that have the power to actually restrict our ability
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.520]   to be intimate with Jesus.
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.040]   I wanna share two critical things this week, next week,
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.640]   that are traps that I think we fall into
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.040]   that restrict our ability to move
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.480]   into deeper intimacy with him.
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.280]   And I think if you can open your heart
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.040]   to these two things that we're talking about
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.080]   this week and next,
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.080]   I think it could be a wonderful way
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.320]   for you to start your new year.
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.000]   If you can deal with some of this in your own life,
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.360]   and what I'm teaching you today has come out
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.800]   of a deep wrestling myself with this very issue.
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.280]   If we can wrestle with it,
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.080]   I think you'll set yourself up for a freedom in intimacy
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.640]   with Jesus in the year ahead
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.040]   like you've never experienced before.
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.240]   Two critical traps.
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.560]   To introduce you to the first one this afternoon,
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.680]   I wanna tell you a little bit about the story
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.040]   of Ruth in the Bible.
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.280]   The book of Ruth in the Old Testament,
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.560]   one of my favorite books in the Old Testament,
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.680]   one of my favorite books in the whole Bible.
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.680]   It's the shortest book actually in the Old Testament.
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.720]   So it's an easy one to read.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.160]   I recommend it in the week ahead.
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.240]   It's a awesome story about a family.
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.840]   And I love stories about families
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.920]   because family is something that's really important to me.
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:58.600]   In this story, there is a father, his name is Elimelech,
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.720]   and he has a wife named Naomi, and they have two sons.
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.680]   They live in Bethlehem.
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:08.360]   Yes, the actual same Bethlehem as the Christmas story.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.400]   The name Bethlehem means the house of bread
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.000]   because Bethlehem was famous for the fields around it
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.840]   that were filled with corn and they made bread in that land.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.560]   But in this story, a famine happens
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.360]   right at the beginning of the story.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.840]   And the famine is so hard that Elimelech decides
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:26.560]   to actually uproot his family and move to a new nation
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.000]   where they can live and survive.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.160]   They move to a nation known as Moab.
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.280]   As they go into Moab, they settle as a family,
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.920]   and it so happens that his two sons marry Moabite women,
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.040]   Orpah and Ruth.
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:43.160]   Now, as the story goes, as they marry these women,
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.120]   and a short time after that,
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.560]   a tragedy happens to the family,
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.160]   and Elimelech and his two sons die.
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.840]   And suddenly, Naomi is left as a widow
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.440]   with two daughters-in-law, two daughters-in-law
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:01.120]   that are not from her own bloodline or from her own land.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.400]   And around about this time,
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.400]   Naomi hears that the famine has lifted in Bethlehem
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.160]   and that she can now return home.
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.120]   And she says to her daughters-in-law,
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.320]   "Look, I release you from the family bond, if you will.
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.360]   "You're better off, your futures are better off
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.160]   "to remain here in Moab than to come back with me."
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.840]   And she tries to release her daughters-in-law.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.040]   Orpah decides that for her and her journey,
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.480]   that's the best thing for her to remain in Moab.
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.160]   But Ruth replies in some of the most beautiful language
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.080]   and words that we have in the whole of the Bible.
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.440]   She says, "No."
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.280]   She's like, "Our family is more than just this bloodline.
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:39.580]   "We're connected together, and your land will be my land.
[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.360]   "Your God will be my God."
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.580]   And so Ruth makes the decision to not leave Naomi,
[00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.480]   not only a widow, but on her own,
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:50.200]   but instead come back with Naomi and settle in her land,
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.340]   in the land of Bethlehem.
[00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.460]   As they get back to Bethlehem,
[00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.640]   the harvest is about to happen,
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.040]   which is a wonderful thing in that land.
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:05.880]   But Naomi and Ruth find themselves on really hard times.
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.600]   In the patriarchal culture of that day,
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:12.760]   without a husband for Naomi or a husband for Ruth,
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:16.760]   it meant that they were under an impoverished situation.
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:17.720]   In fact, they were so poor,
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.260]   they were struggling to make ends meet and survive.
[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.640]   And Naomi, in the midst of that poverty,
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.960]   realizes that there is something that they can do.
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.820]   She says to Ruth, "I want you to go into the fields
[00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:30.040]   "during the harvest time."
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.200]   And she says, "I want you to glean in the harvest."
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:37.720]   Ruth decides to go and glean in the harvest,
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.320]   and their story changes at that point.
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.600]   But it's this idea of gleaning in the harvest
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.280]   that I actually wanna unpack and talk with you
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.840]   a little bit more about today.
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:50.340]   The concept of gleaning in that time,
[00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.720]   about a thousand years before Christ,
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.520]   it was almost like the Hebrew social welfare structure
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:56.800]   of the day, okay?
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.200]   It was something that was written in the law
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.000]   so that those who were poor or the impoverished
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.500]   or the vulnerable or the outcasts of society,
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:08.100]   they would be able to come alongside in the harvest
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:11.240]   and actually receive something from the harvest.
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.120]   You can imagine in a town like Bethlehem,
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.960]   the harvest was significant for that town,
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.560]   and the landowners were the wealthy people,
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.520]   and the harvesters were hired to come
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.200]   and harvest the crop of that land.
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.560]   Well, gleaning was something that was constructed
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:29.320]   to help the poor people also partake in the harvest.
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.220]   Let me explain how this works.
[00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:34.300]   So the harvesters would take a basket
[00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:37.320]   like this wick of basket I'm about to put on my back.
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.960]   They would put it on their back just like this.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.520]   And what they would do is they would stand
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.800]   at the beginning of a massive grain field.
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.560]   Remember, they're harvesting corn.
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.700]   And they would stand in this massive grain field.
[00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.280]   There'd be a whole line of harvesters
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:55.680]   all with baskets on their backs.
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.120]   And what they would do right at the same time,
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.320]   all of them in one go, they would step forward.
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.240]   Now, remember, there's a massive field in front of them.
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.720]   There's a lot of grain to harvest,
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.600]   and they have a short period of time in daylight to do so.
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.440]   So this was a fast thing that they would do.
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.540]   They would step forward.
[00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:11.820]   They would grab the first stalk of grain in front of them.
[00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:13.180]   They would uproot it from the ground.
[00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:15.440]   They would sheaf off all of the leaves from it.
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.800]   They would manage to get the husk of the corn from it,
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.560]   and they would throw the husk of the corn into the basket,
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.800]   drop the stalk, and step forward once again.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.000]   Pull up the next stalk, sheaf it all off,
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.480]   take that husk of corn,
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.640]   throw it into the back of the basket, move on to the next.
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.000]   Do you understand that?
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.860]   And the faster that they could do this, the better it was.
[00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:34.780]   So for those over here, they would be like,
[00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:37.360]   (imitates fast-forwarding)
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.360]   like this, right?
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.360]   They were like ninjas when it came to harvesting corn.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.360]   It was awesome.
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.600]   Now, every once in a while, though,
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.080]   a harvester would sheaf off the corn husk
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.160]   and throw the corn husk into the basket.
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.640]   But because of the speed or maybe the movement,
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:56.140]   the corn husk would miss the basket and fall on the ground.
[00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:59.480]   Now, when the corn fell on the ground,
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.760]   by law, the harvester was not allowed
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:04.780]   to pick up that grain anymore.
[00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:09.140]   When the corn husk would fall onto the ground,
[00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:12.960]   you had behind the line of harvesters another line.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.340]   This was the poor people.
[00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:15.840]   This was Ruth.
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.640]   And they were behind the harvesters,
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.200]   and they were desperately watching the harvesters
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.340]   to see which one is likely to drop some corn on the ground.
[00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:26.860]   Now, you can imagine when a harvester drops a corn
[00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:29.120]   on the ground by mistake and realizes it
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.640]   and realizes they can't pick it up,
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.580]   they move on, and suddenly,
[00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:34.480]   you can almost hear all of the gleaners go,
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.920]   (gasps)
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.840]   and there's like this fight for that one piece of corn
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:39.760]   that's fallen on the ground.
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.300]   And all the gleaners would run forward,
[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:44.960]   and somebody would grab that precious bit of corn.
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.980]   And as soon as they grabbed that corn,
[00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:48.520]   that was their property now,
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:49.840]   and they could take that home,
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.960]   and they could make some bread for themselves
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.880]   and hopefully survive for another week.
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:59.720]   Gleaning was the process of taking the tidbits,
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.800]   the crumbs of the harvest,
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.560]   and making a meal out of it so you could actually survive.
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:06.800]   Are you following this?
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.800]   So if you think about it this way,
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:13.040]   gleaning was like living off of the leftovers
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.440]   of the others who were harvesting.
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:19.940]   Now, take this back off, put it back over here.
[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:24.220]   What has this all got to do with us and intimacy?
[00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:29.820]   I wanna put it to you that I think for the majority of us,
[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:31.660]   when it comes to our intimacy with Jesus
[00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.700]   and when it comes to our spiritual life with Him,
[00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:38.060]   our posture is primarily one of gleaning
[00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:39.340]   rather than harvesting.
[00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:42.220]   And what do I mean by that?
[00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:44.740]   What I mean is that I think so often
[00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:45.660]   in the Christian life,
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:49.260]   and this is the big trap that we fall into.
[00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:54.260]   We primarily base our intimacy off of the throwaways
[00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.060]   of somebody else's intimacy.
[00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:02.620]   I think we so often construct our faith,
[00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:05.740]   our knowledge of Jesus and who Jesus is
[00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:08.860]   off of somebody else who's done the work,
[00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:12.060]   the harvesting of understanding and knowing Jesus,
[00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:15.060]   and we glean from their insight,
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:17.620]   and we take the gleaning of their insight,
[00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:19.620]   and we build our own intimacy,
[00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:22.340]   not actually off of the person of Jesus Himself,
[00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:24.140]   but off of the gleaning that's come
[00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.840]   from somebody else's relationship with Jesus.
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.900]   Anyone tracking with this?
[00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:33.220]   This process happens in the spiritual life.
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:34.860]   I think it's so easy for us
[00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:37.000]   to glean other people's information.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.980]   And we can find ourselves actually beginning to believe
[00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:44.180]   in a Jesus that other people have told us about
[00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.100]   rather than a Jesus that we personally
[00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:47.820]   encountered for ourselves.
[00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:51.820]   So in other words, our experience of Jesus
[00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:54.460]   becomes somebody else's experience of Jesus.
[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:57.660]   Our belief of Jesus is really somebody else's belief
[00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:58.700]   of Jesus.
[00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:01.260]   Our relationship with Jesus has predominantly
[00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.220]   been somebody else's relationship with Jesus,
[00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.540]   and here's what happens.
[00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:08.620]   When your primary posture in your relationship with Jesus
[00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:12.740]   is to glean from other people's information about Jesus,
[00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:13.900]   here's what you will do.
[00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.980]   You will construct a version of Jesus
[00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:20.100]   that I like to call secondhand Jesus.
[00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:24.700]   You're gonna make a secondhand Jesus.
[00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:26.060]   And here's what you need to hear.
[00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:30.100]   The single greatest danger to intimacy with God
[00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:33.160]   is the worship of a secondhand Jesus.
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:38.060]   The single greatest danger to a church
[00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:41.500]   is the worship of a secondhand Jesus.
[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.340]   The Jesus somebody else told me about
[00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:45.660]   rather than the one that I actually know.
[00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:47.580]   The Jesus of somebody else's information
[00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:49.800]   rather than the Jesus of my revelation.
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:54.300]   The Jesus that has been constructed by something else
[00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:56.620]   that I've managed to glean myself from
[00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:58.340]   and I've aligned myself to,
[00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:01.100]   and the reality is we all do this.
[00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.040]   Now, I want you to hear me really carefully.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:03.940]   Can everybody lean in?
[00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:05.540]   Hear me really carefully.
[00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.580]   Gleaning is good.
[00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:10.500]   Gleaning is actually an important part
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.740]   of your relationship with Jesus.
[00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:14.020]   In fact, I tell you what,
[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:17.220]   God has raised up some incredible men and women in the church
[00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:18.340]   through church history
[00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:23.180]   that have so much to say that you can learn from, grow from.
[00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:24.640]   There is absolutely nothing wrong
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.520]   with downloading a sermon from some preacher
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:27.540]   that you love overseas
[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:30.160]   and get some insight into God from that.
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.740]   There is absolutely nothing wrong
[00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:34.060]   with reading devotionals every day this week.
[00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:35.180]   Hopefully if you're a part of the Vine,
[00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:36.620]   you've been reading a devotional
[00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:38.020]   that somebody else has read.
[00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:39.460]   That's the process of gleaning.
[00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:40.620]   I want you to hear my heart.
[00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.660]   There is nothing inherently wrong with gleaning.
[00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:45.260]   That's not what I'm saying here.
[00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.400]   Here is what I am saying.
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:52.180]   When the posture of your relationship with God
[00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:54.580]   is built primarily
[00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:58.920]   on what other people's information is about God,
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.300]   if your approach to your relationship with God
[00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:02.860]   is primarily structured
[00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:05.620]   by what other people have told you about God,
[00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:08.780]   you are essentially worshiping a secondhand Jesus
[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:11.780]   and you have what I would call a borrowed faith.
[00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:14.960]   Does that make sense to you?
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.500]   Now again, gleaning is not bad.
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:17.460]   Here's the reality.
[00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:21.940]   I have made my whole life purpose to read the scriptures,
[00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:24.140]   learn the scriptures, to harvest
[00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.980]   so that other people in my church could receive and grow.
[00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.220]   Every single one of us in this room right now
[00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:30.820]   is gleaning right now.
[00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:32.840]   Yes, you are.
[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:34.260]   You're listening to me.
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:35.620]   And my prayer and hope is that
[00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:37.640]   you'll glean something good today.
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:40.580]   I pray that you'll hear something that'll be helpful to you.
[00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:43.740]   I pray that there's some sort of impartation
[00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:45.620]   that will happen through what I'm sharing today
[00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:46.540]   into your life.
[00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:50.860]   But hear me, I would more and much more rather have me
[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:53.220]   as a catalyst to your personal faith
[00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:55.780]   than you basing your faith out of everything I say.
[00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:58.480]   If you have structured your faith
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:59.940]   around what Andrew says at the Vine
[00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.960]   or any pastor at the Vine or any church
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.900]   or any sort of ministry,
[00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:05.420]   if that's the primary way
[00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:07.220]   that you're coming to understand your faith,
[00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:08.700]   you are worshiping a second-hand Jesus
[00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:09.620]   and you have a borrowed faith.
[00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:11.720]   And that is not intimacy.
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:17.660]   That's information that may or may not be helpful
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:21.240]   to catalyze you towards intimacy,
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.300]   but we can't make the mistake of thinking
[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.900]   that that is intimacy itself.
[00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:26.980]   Are you following this?
[00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:30.540]   There are two things that will happen, I guarantee you,
[00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:32.340]   if you focus in on gleaning
[00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:34.540]   more than harvesting in your relationship with Jesus.
[00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:35.780]   Two things guarantee what happened.
[00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:36.740]   Here's the first one.
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:40.360]   Not only will you construct a second-hand Jesus,
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:44.220]   but you will construct a second-hand Jesus of your choosing.
[00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:47.200]   'Cause the whole process of gleaning
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.500]   is picking up stuff that we like.
[00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:53.220]   When our primary posture in building an intimacy with God
[00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:54.860]   is based off of what other people have said,
[00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.620]   what we do is we align ourselves
[00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:58.740]   to the things we like that other people have said.
[00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:00.460]   Oh, that was a good quote from social media.
[00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.260]   Oh, that was a bomb message there.
[00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:03.100]   Oh, that was good.
[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:04.380]   And then we like those things
[00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:08.860]   because they sit well with our already confirmed worldview.
[00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:12.700]   They sit well with how we already think we know about Jesus.
[00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:14.860]   And when your life, your relationship,
[00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:18.580]   is primarily structured by gleaning rather than harvesting,
[00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:21.260]   what it means is that you will cherry-pick
[00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:24.860]   the things about Jesus that are comfortable for you to have.
[00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:27.340]   This is the sifting that I talked about
[00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:29.800]   in the picture I got during my worship.
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:30.780]   I want you to know this.
[00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:33.180]   If that happens, here's what's gonna happen.
[00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:35.300]   You will have a Jesus that you like,
[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.080]   but not a Jesus that saves.
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:44.340]   You will have a Jesus that you're comfortable with,
[00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:47.220]   but not a Jesus necessarily of the Scriptures.
[00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:48.860]   And when your life gets tough,
[00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:51.620]   when things are hard and challenges come,
[00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:53.900]   you'll find yourself not being able to lean
[00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:57.920]   on your constructed version of second-hand Jesus.
[00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:02.540]   Here's the second thing that will happen, guarantee you.
[00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:04.140]   The second thing that will happen is this.
[00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:07.500]   You will begin to mistake rumor of God
[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:08.920]   for revelation of God.
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:12.220]   This is really an important thing,
[00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:13.580]   and I want you to track with this.
[00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:16.320]   When our posture, again, is primarily gleaning
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.460]   rather than harvesting ourselves,
[00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:21.220]   what we're really doing is we're building our lives
[00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:23.940]   off of other people's opinions about God,
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:25.980]   other people's ideas about God,
[00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:28.660]   other people's maybe even experiences of God,
[00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:29.940]   and we're gleaning from that.
[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:31.500]   What you need to realize is that
[00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.780]   when you glean from someone,
[00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:36.340]   the chances are what you're gleaning,
[00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:38.400]   they've gleaned from someone else.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:42.140]   And the chances are that that other person
[00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:44.980]   that they gleaned from gleaned from someone else.
[00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:46.180]   And so on and so forth.
[00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:48.300]   Have you ever played that game where maybe if we started
[00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:50.480]   with a whisper here, and I whispered something in your ear
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.140]   and you pass it all the way down over here,
[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:53.940]   when it got down to here, it would not be the same.
[00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:54.780]   Are you with me?
[00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:56.220]   Do you ever play that game?
[00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:58.360]   When your posture and your intimacy with God
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.100]   and relationship with Jesus is built primarily on gleaning
[00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:03.020]   rather than harvesting, you're gleaning something
[00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:04.420]   that's been passed down, passed down,
[00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:06.260]   and suddenly you're gonna have the mistake,
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:08.020]   there's the challenge, there's the temptation,
[00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:09.760]   to believe that the rumor of God
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.340]   is actually revelation of God.
[00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:16.200]   But actually that rumor of God much more likely
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.060]   is something that's been filtered over so many things.
[00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:20.240]   And the Bible's very clear,
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.820]   the truth that God is Jesus himself.
[00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:25.380]   Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.840]   At my Bible school in seminary,
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.800]   I went to Bible school and gleaned a lot, it was great.
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:35.280]   Over the top of the door of my Bible school,
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.840]   when you walk into it, for the first time it says this,
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:41.160]   it says, "God has spoken, the rest is commentary."
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:44.800]   And the commentary is helpful and good.
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:47.540]   The commentary can catalyze and strengthen our faith,
[00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:50.960]   absolutely, but we need to know that God speaks.
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:53.020]   The truth is alive.
[00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:54.920]   And the danger we have if we're posturing,
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.720]   mostly we're gleaning rather than harvesting,
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:58.800]   is that we'll end up turning rumor of God
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.520]   into revelation of God.
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:05.400]   If you want to truly deepen your intimacy with God in 2024,
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.320]   what you need to do is trade rumor of God
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.720]   for a firsthand faith.
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:14.000]   Come on church, everybody okay?
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   You gotta start trading rumor of God for firsthand faith.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.400]   You need to be serious
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.400]   and take your own spiritual basket
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:27.640]   and realize that because of Christ's life,
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.520]   death and resurrection on the cross,
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:32.360]   there is a harvest of his relationship with you
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.020]   that is right in front of you,
[00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:36.200]   that there's a harvest of goodness and life
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.840]   and glory in him.
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.200]   And you are to step forward
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.680]   and grab a hold of the spiritual stalks
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.000]   that he places in your life and sheath them off
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.880]   and grab the kernel of the word of God for you
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.400]   that changes and transforms you
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.840]   and place it in your spiritual basket
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.800]   and then step forward to the next thing
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.960]   that God has for you and unpack that
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:58.040]   and harvest the things that God has for you
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:01.040]   rather than stand back and wait for that person
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.520]   that you think hears more from God than you do
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:07.040]   to drop a little morsel of idea that you can suck up.
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:11.040]   Instead, you are designed and created for the harvest.
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:13.440]   You're a child of God.
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:16.480]   You've been given the ability and the privilege
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:19.200]   to strap a basket of spirit on your back
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:23.640]   and harvest in intimacy with him.
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:27.520]   Now,
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:33.160]   the thing that we have to sit in,
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:35.840]   thing that we have to wrestle with
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:38.800]   is that harvesting is work.
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:42.920]   One of the people that I've followed
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.560]   that has written a lot about this,
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:47.520]   his name's Glenn Packiam, he leads a church in California.
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.440]   He's written around this idea and this topic.
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.400]   I wanna read you something that he said.
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:53.520]   He said, "God didn't want me leaning completely
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:55.680]   "on someone else's knowledge of him.
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.240]   "He didn't want me coasting,
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.360]   "finding shortcuts for knowing him.
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:02.080]   "He wanted me to do the carrying, the heavy lifting,
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:06.040]   "the hard and delightfully glorious work of knowing him."
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.640]   I love how he puts that.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:12.520]   The hard but delightfully glorious work of knowing him.
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:15.400]   In other words, there's work to be done.
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.920]   Hear it this way, gleaning is easy.
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.800]   Gleaning is simple.
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:24.400]   You don't need any special gifts to glean in God.
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:26.160]   You can just pick up what other people
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:29.440]   have done the hard work of uncovering for themselves.
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:32.720]   It's much easier for you to go on a run
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:36.000]   and listen to a spiritual podcast than it is to pray.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.680]   It's much easier for you to listen to Nicki Gumbel
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:42.120]   with a Bible in a year
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:44.840]   than for you to actually open the Bible and read it.
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:45.800]   I love Nicki, by the way.
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.160]   Don't think I'm criticizing Nicki.
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.680]   I love my man, Nicki, okay?
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:50.680]   But I'm making a point.
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:52.120]   You get the point?
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:53.760]   See, here's the issue.
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.000]   We live in Hong Kong,
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.160]   and Hong Kong is one of the busiest places
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.320]   and cultures to live in.
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:01.560]   In other words, your time is the biggest resource
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.360]   that you have, the most important thing in your hand.
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:07.480]   And if your approach to intimacy with Jesus this year
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.760]   is gonna be based on whether you're busy or not,
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:11.960]   let me just tell you, you're gonna be busy this year.
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:15.160]   And when you're busy, you will naturally default
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:18.200]   to what is easiest in your spiritual life.
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.200]   And what is easiest in your spiritual life
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.800]   is gleaning rather than harvesting,
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:25.240]   'cause harvesting's gonna take some work.
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:27.480]   Harvesting's gonna require you to put some time aside
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.320]   and open the Bible.
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.320]   Harvesting's gonna require you to pray.
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.160]   Harvesting's gonna require you
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.080]   to roll up your sleeves a little bit
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:35.200]   and prioritize what it is
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.960]   to take the spiritual things in your life
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.360]   and wrestle with them and pray with them with God,
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.440]   share them with others, get their input and help.
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.640]   That's the gleaning part that can help within it.
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.640]   But the harvesting is work.
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.720]   If you don't wanna work, then just glean.
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:50.200]   But if you're gonna glean predominantly,
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.480]   you're gonna struggle in intimacy with Jesus.
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:59.880]   When we harvest, what we're doing
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:04.520]   is we're posturing ourselves for His revelation.
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:09.760]   And gleaning, although it's so easy,
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:12.400]   only ever leads us to a place
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.360]   where we'll fall shallow and empty.
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:18.000]   You were designed for the harvest.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.400]   Jesus died for that for you.
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:24.080]   Don't let the enemy get you so busy
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:27.280]   that you find yourself constantly defaulting
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:30.240]   to somebody else's revelation rather than getting your own.
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:36.040]   Don't allow yourself to be so lazy
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:39.560]   that you're just surviving off the throwaways
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:43.040]   of your pastor rather than actually investing
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.480]   in the scriptures for yourself.
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:52.080]   You need to move from rumors of God to a firsthand faith.
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:55.920]   Here's something you need to know about rumors.
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.880]   In the absence of revelation, rumors grow.
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:03.920]   In the absence of revelation and truth, rumors grow.
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.840]   And when we keep God at an arm's length,
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:08.120]   when we keep Him at a distance to us,
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.440]   when we hold Him away from us
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:12.520]   and we just consume what other people
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:13.600]   are experiencing with Him
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:16.400]   and not walking into that for ourselves,
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:19.680]   we're much more vulnerable to rumors of God,
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.440]   much more vulnerable as people
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.640]   to what everybody else seems to have a perspective
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:26.840]   and opinion, and we end up shaping and making life decisions
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:30.480]   on somebody else's opinion of God.
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.680]   This was really important to Jesus.
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.400]   Jesus, throughout the Gospels,
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.400]   wrestled with this with His disciples.
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:41.680]   And there's this beautiful moment in Mark chapter eight.
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:43.120]   Is this helping someone?
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.640]   You guys okay?
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:45.840]   In Mark chapter eight,
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:49.480]   Jesus begins to shift the focus to His disciples
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:52.320]   because He wants them to move from rumor of God
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:55.400]   to revelation of who He is.
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:57.520]   And so let me pick this up from verse 27.
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:00.440]   Jesus and His disciples went on to the villages
[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:02.480]   around Caesarea Philippi.
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:05.480]   On the way, He asked them, "Who do people say I am?"
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:07.480]   What a great question.
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:10.320]   He says to the disciples, "What are the rumors about me?
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:13.320]   "What does everybody else think?
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:15.640]   "What does everybody else think about me?
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:17.080]   "Those that are not like you,
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:19.680]   "who are walking day in, day out with me,
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:22.480]   "those that are in the crowds at a distance,
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:26.360]   "what do they think that I am?"
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:28.360]   And the disciples knew, they said this,
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:30.840]   "Well, some say you're John the Baptist.
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:33.960]   "Others say Elijah, and still others, one of the prophets.
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:35.720]   "They say, 'Here's what the rumors are about you.
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:38.240]   "'Here's what people are convinced that you are.
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.840]   "'I mean, they've heard things about you.'
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:40.680]   "And so they've just said,
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:42.280]   "'Well, that must be John the Baptist.'
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.840]   "Or they think you're Elijah,
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:46.120]   "or they just think you're one of the great prophets
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.840]   "because they've heard of what you did
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:49.520]   "and the healing that happened over here.
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:50.480]   "They just heard about it."
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:51.480]   They didn't witness it, by the way.
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:52.440]   "They just heard about it.
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:54.840]   "And so they defined you based on the rumor
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:55.720]   "of what they've heard.
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:59.000]   "So they say to Jesus, 'Here are all the rumors.'"
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:29:59.840]   And guess what?
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:00.840]   All the rumors were wrong.
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:04.160]   And so then Jesus says what I think
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.600]   is one of the most critical things.
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.720]   He says, "But what about you?
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:11.520]   "Who do you say I am?"
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:15.000]   For some of you at the beginning of 2024,
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.760]   that is the most critical question
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.480]   that Jesus is asking you this year.
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:21.440]   In a year of intimacy,
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:25.200]   he's starting with saying, "Who do you think I am?"
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.820]   Forget what Andrew thinks.
[00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:28.160]   I mean, don't fully forget what I think.
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:31.440]   I hope you come here and learn some things, okay?
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:33.280]   But yeah, forget what Andrew thinks.
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:34.640]   Forget what the vine says.
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:37.320]   I'm more interested, Jesus says,
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:38.760]   about you and your heart.
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:40.840]   Who do you think I am?
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:46.320]   And here's Peter's response,
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:48.120]   perhaps one of the most profound things
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:48.960]   in the New Testament.
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:51.480]   Peter answered, "You are the Messiah.
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.840]   "You're not John the Baptist.
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:54.760]   "You're not some Elijah.
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.320]   "You're not just simply a prophet.
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:57.280]   "You're the son of God.
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:58.120]   "You're the Messiah.
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:30:59.880]   "You're the one that Israel has been longing for.
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.920]   "We have been with you day in and day out.
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:06.040]   "We're not existing off the fumes of some rumors
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:08.200]   "and trying to make some meal of faith
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.840]   "off of the tidbits and throwaways
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:11.520]   "and the leftovers of somebody else.
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:12.720]   "We've walked with you.
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:13.800]   "We've been with you.
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:15.080]   "We've seen the miracles.
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:16.280]   "We've heard your teaching.
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:17.940]   "We've not always been comfortable with it.
[00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:18.780]   "We've struggled with it.
[00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:20.040]   "We've been confused at times,
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:21.360]   "if I'm honest with you, Jesus.
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:24.320]   "But I cannot say, I cannot deny
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.560]   "that after all of that relationship with you,
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.000]   "you are not Elijah.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.080]   "You're not John the Baptist.
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:30.280]   "You are the Messiah.
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:31.120]   "You're Jesus.
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:31.960]   "That's who I know.
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:32.820]   "And that doesn't come to me
[00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:34.780]   "because someone else has told me," Peter is saying,
[00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:38.440]   "that is my revelation from my intimacy with you.
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:41.160]   "You are the Messiah."
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:46.760]   Peter profoundly moves from rumor of God
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:50.400]   to firsthand revelation and declaration.
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.320]   And on the back of that revelation,
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:55.040]   Jesus changes everything in his ministry.
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:56.760]   He starts heading towards Jerusalem
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:58.280]   until the death on the cross
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:00.520]   because somebody now has got it.
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:02.240]   Somebody has connected with him.
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:05.320]   And you need to understand that when we exist on gleaning
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:06.720]   rather than harvesting,
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:10.040]   when we make our diet predominantly rumor
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:12.040]   rather than actually revelation with him,
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:13.400]   here's what rumor will do.
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:16.040]   Rumor will tell you the what of God,
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:18.680]   but it can never tell you the who of God.
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:21.360]   It'll tell you what about God,
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.040]   but it can't tell you the who of God.
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:25.840]   And here's the thing I really want you to understand.
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:29.800]   If you really base your relationship with God
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:33.800]   only on rumor of him, you will find yourself,
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:34.640]   this is really key,
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:38.720]   you will find yourself knowing what God is,
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:40.320]   but not who God is.
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:44.960]   You will find yourself with other people's information,
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:47.280]   but not your own revelation.
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:51.660]   You will find yourself with knowledge, but not intimacy.
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:56.080]   You will find yourself with knowledge,
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:59.640]   but not necessarily intimacy.
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:05.440]   The work of intimacy is moving from the what of God
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.440]   to the who of God.
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:11.440]   It's moving away from rumor of him and information of him
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:16.440]   to firsthand faith, firsthand encounter.
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:18.680]   And I wanna just say
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.560]   that one of the greatest fallacies in the church,
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:22.240]   and I think we struggle with this here in Hong Kong
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:25.720]   quite a bit, is that we have this misperception
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:28.440]   that those who are really knowledgeable of God
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:30.380]   are also really intimate with God.
[00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:33.820]   Let me preach on this one for a moment.
[00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:37.240]   We have this misperception, it's a fallacy actually,
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:40.120]   that those who appear really knowledgeable of God
[00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:42.720]   are therefore very intimate with God.
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:46.540]   And trust me, that is not always the case.
[00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:47.960]   But the problem that we have
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:51.000]   is that we see somebody who's super knowledgeable of God,
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.880]   and we know that they're knowledgeable,
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:54.640]   and we've seen them speak things
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:57.520]   that have really changed our lives.
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:00.360]   And we look at this person and we put them on a pedestal
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:02.440]   and we say, "This person really knows God.
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.840]   And if I can just follow this person,
[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:06.320]   if I could just follow this pastor
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:08.400]   or this church or this ministry,
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:09.960]   if I could align myself to that,
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:12.040]   and if I could just pick up the scraps
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:14.580]   of their revelation with God, I tell you what,
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:16.560]   my gleaning of that person
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:17.760]   because of their knowledge of God
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:20.280]   is way better than the harvesting that I could ever have.
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:23.080]   So I would rather align myself to glean from them
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:24.080]   than harvest myself."
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:26.120]   We think this way in the church.
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.540]   And Jesus said, "Follow me."
[00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:32.080]   He didn't say, "Follow that pastor, follow that church."
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:34.120]   Now again, okay, it's good to follow churches,
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.720]   good to follow pastors, okay?
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:37.040]   Everybody with me?
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:39.600]   It's a preaching technique called taking you to the extreme
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:41.800]   to help bring you back to the middle, okay?
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:44.640]   (congregation laughing)
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:46.120]   Don't misinterpret what I'm saying,
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:48.480]   but I hope you hear what I'm saying, right?
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:50.760]   That Jesus says, "Follow me."
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:55.280]   And we follow Christ because we are in the harvest field
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:58.320]   as a harvester, not a gleaner.
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:59.400]   And some of you here,
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:02.360]   if you really want to move in intimacy with Jesus this year,
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:05.120]   it's gonna have to be a shift for you
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:08.520]   from a life that is predominantly building
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:09.480]   a relationship with Jesus
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:12.960]   off of somebody else's relationship with Jesus
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:16.440]   to a firsthand faith.
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:18.920]   We have this thing where we think this,
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:21.840]   we think the one with the most knowledge
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:23.560]   has the most access.
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:27.960]   But you need to understand that all of us have equal access
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:29.920]   when it comes to the person of Jesus.
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:34.000]   We think that the one with knowledge has more access.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.400]   Well, that must be how they got all their knowledge
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:37.360]   because they got this great access to Jesus.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:38.960]   And if only I had that access,
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:42.560]   the reality is every single one of us,
[00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:44.560]   whether you're a day old Christian
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:46.360]   or you've been a Christian for 50 years,
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:50.520]   has the same access to the person of Jesus Christ.
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:53.400]   There is this beautiful part in the book of Hebrews.
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.720]   Let me just read this to you quickly.
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:57.560]   In the book of Hebrews, it says this, the writer,
[00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:59.520]   he says, "Therefore, brothers and sisters,
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:01.960]   "since we have confidence to enter the most holy place
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:03.720]   "by the blood of Jesus," notice this,
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:06.300]   "by the blood of Jesus," not by how much you know,
[00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:08.960]   "but simply by the blood of Jesus,
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:12.400]   "by a new and living way open to us through the curtain,"
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.840]   that is his body,
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:16.920]   "and since we have a great priest over the house of God,
[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:20.400]   "let us draw near to God with a sincere heart
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.560]   "in full assurance of faith."
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:25.800]   Let every single one of us draw near to God
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:28.240]   out of full assurance of faith.
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:30.080]   Why? Because you're smart? No.
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:32.080]   Why? Because you know more than someone else? No.
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:33.920]   Why? Because you've got a better experience of God
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.040]   than someone else? No.
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:37.000]   Simply because the blood of Jesus
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.400]   has been shed on the cross,
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:40.080]   and you now, because of the life, death,
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:42.920]   and resurrection of Jesus, have your sins forgiven,
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:45.280]   which means you're redeemed and you're renewed,
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:48.040]   you now have Jesus standing at the right hand of the Father
[00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:52.560]   interceding on your behalf, you have access.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:55.620]   You're not a gleaner.
[00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:58.200]   You haven't been, put it this way,
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:00.120]   Jesus did not go to the cross
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:02.520]   so that you would glean somebody else's intimacy.
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:07.960]   Jesus went to the cross to pay a very high price
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:10.480]   so that you would have the joy and the wonder
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.280]   of a relationship with him.
[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:17.280]   Never forfeit the privilege of your relationship with God
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:20.600]   by outsourcing it to someone else.
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:26.040]   Never forfeit the privilege of your relationship with Jesus
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.760]   by outsourcing it to someone else.
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:31.600]   Can you learn from others? Absolutely.
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:34.680]   Is it good to glean? 100%.
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:36.440]   Are there amazing people in church history
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.040]   that have a lot to teach us?
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:40.760]   Yes, yes, yes.
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:44.880]   But intimacy comes from trading rumors of God
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:47.240]   to firsthand faith.
[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:49.000]   There's a book in the Old Testament
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.320]   that preaches what I'm telling you today
[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:53.620]   over the whole book, it's the book of Job.
[00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:56.160]   Job also, like Ruth, a story of a family,
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:59.840]   a story of a family that begins and ends,
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:02.760]   or begins and they go into immediate,
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:04.600]   complete travesty as a family.
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:06.760]   Job is left on his own.
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:09.240]   And interestingly, from chapters two
[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:12.400]   all the way through to chapter 37,
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:14.120]   Job is surrounded by three friends
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:16.440]   that have a lot of rumors of God.
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:18.040]   Three friends that show up and say,
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:19.760]   "Maybe this is why this is happening.
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:21.040]   "Have you thought about this?
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:22.320]   "Did you know this about God?
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.540]   "Have you repented of this?
[00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:24.680]   "Has this happened to you?"
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:26.880]   Three really well-meaning friends
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:30.040]   with lots of ideas and opinions and thoughts of God.
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:32.200]   And every single step of the way through the chapters,
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:35.920]   Job is more and more confused about who God is,
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:39.120]   why this has happened, and the rumors are not helping him.
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:43.960]   He's starving despite an influx of rumors of God.
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:48.800]   But in chapter 38, God breaks through it all and speaks
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:51.380]   and pushes the three friends to one side
[00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:53.360]   and he speaks to Job.
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:55.580]   And he takes four chapters and he says,
[00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:56.420]   "You wanna know who I am?
[00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:57.680]   "This is who I am.
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:59.160]   "This is really who I am.
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:00.420]   "And this is how I operate.
[00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:01.920]   "And these are the things that I do.
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:03.080]   "And this is my glory.
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:05.000]   "And this is who you are in relation to me."
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.120]   And he lays it all out for four chapters.
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:12.120]   And in chapter 42, finally, Job now responds to God.
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:14.320]   I wanna read you how Job responds.
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:16.560]   I'm gonna read from Eugene Peterson's version
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:17.520]   of the message.
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:21.720]   It says this, "I admit I once lived by rumors of you,
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:24.320]   "but now I have it all firsthand
[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:26.140]   "from my own eyes and ears.
[00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:27.580]   "I'm sorry, forgive me.
[00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:28.980]   "I'll never do that again.
[00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:32.900]   "I promise I'll never again live on crusts or hearsay,
[00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:34.640]   "crumbs or rumors."
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:37.540]   The NIV writes it this way in verse five.
[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:42.540]   "My ears had heard of you, but now my eyes have seen you.
[00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:45.880]   "I had the rumor I could hear things about you,
[00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:48.200]   "but now I've encountered you for myself.
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:51.240]   "I am not a gleaner, I'm a harvester.
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:54.180]   "And that has changed everything in me."
[00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:59.320]   Intimacy is found when we shift from rumor to revelation.
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:03.560]   Intimacy is found when we use the gleaning in our life
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:08.100]   to catalyze a deeper, more effective harvesting of Him.
[00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:10.880]   That's what He's opened up for us.
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:12.880]   It's what He's opened up for you.
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:16.760]   And as you start this year with a call on you
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:18.160]   to intimacy with Him,
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:21.720]   it has to start with an honest reflection.
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:25.200]   Am I worshiping a secondhand Jesus?
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:29.420]   Do I have a borrowed faith?
[00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:33.080]   And while I'm not gonna get rid of all of that stuff,
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:34.760]   'cause it is all helpful,
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:39.640]   am I predominantly primarily building my relationship
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:44.080]   with Jesus off of my relationship with Jesus?
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:49.640]   Am I a harvester or am I a gleaner?
[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:52.840]   My prayer for you is that you would hear Jesus say,
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:56.820]   "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few."
[00:40:56.820 --> 00:41:01.080]   And I wonder whether we would grab a hold
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:04.100]   of the harvest this year in our intimacy with Him.
[00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:06.480]   Amen?
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:08.120]   Can I pray for you?
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:08.960]   Can we stand together?
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:09.780]   Let's pray.
[00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:13.480]   And as you stand, I want you just to
[00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:15.160]   quieten down your heart.
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:18.600]   Maybe let's just open our hands
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:20.760]   if you're comfortable to do that.
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:22.640]   Let's come into a posture of
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:25.800]   preparing ourselves to hear from Him.
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:27.840]   I've done a lot of talking.
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:29.300]   I'm gonna shut up in a moment
[00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:35.260]   because really I don't want any more gleaning here.
[00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:36.640]   I want some harvesting.
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:41.160]   And if this message has been helpful to you,
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:42.960]   there's been some good gleaning for you
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:45.720]   out of our time together this afternoon.
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:49.040]   Now's the time for you to move towards harvest with Him.
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:52.240]   And I wanna create some space for you to pray with Him,
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:53.620]   to spend time with Him,
[00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:57.080]   to listen to Him, to His voice for you.
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:00.780]   And some of you, it might be this idea
[00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:02.820]   of a secondhand Jesus,
[00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:06.300]   and realizing that it's been a while
[00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:11.300]   since you've actually spent just time with Him yourself.
[00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:14.400]   Put away the helpful things,
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:18.080]   but come just rawly in prayer.
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:21.980]   Open the scriptures for yourself to read
[00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:24.780]   and ask the Holy Spirit to give you revelation and word.
[00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:30.320]   For some of you, it might be that you've
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.100]   taken room for revelation.
[00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:36.460]   For some of you, it might be
[00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:40.980]   that you found yourself worshiping knowledge over intimacy,
[00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:47.220]   that you've been quite proud of what you know of God,
[00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:52.380]   and that maybe you've held onto that pride,
[00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:55.840]   but you realize that you actually,
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:56.860]   if you're honest with yourself,
[00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:58.820]   you don't really know Him personally.
[00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:02.660]   Maybe you've got some great theology,
[00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:07.380]   but you don't know Jesus truly.
[00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:11.500]   It'll be different for all of us.
[00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:18.580]   Take a time, take some time to listen to His voice for you.
[00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:20.400]   He loves you so much.
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:24.540]   He draws near to you.
