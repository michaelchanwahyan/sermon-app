[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Sandlin Feilok, Happy New Year!
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   So good to see you all.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   So, as we start the beginning of this year,
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   I thought it was important for us to actually take a look back
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   at what God has done in this past year.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   And I think that will help us actually step into what God has for us in 2024.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   And so what I want to do is highlight some milestones
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   in our church's life.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   So let me share some with you.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   First, in January last year, we set out from Wan Chai.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   We moved from Wan Chai. We were meeting there as a launch team.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Here to Yuen Long at EIS International Preschool.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   And we started our English service.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   It was incredible.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   After that, or while we were at EIS,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   God did some significant things in us.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   He helped us to shift from being acquaintances.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   We actually didn't know each other that well.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   To being a spiritual community, a spiritual family that loves each other.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   That knows what's going on in each other's lives.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   That was a significant shift.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   We also went from being a launch team
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   to actually being a local church.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Now during that time, we also had some amazing celebrations.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   We had our first child dedication.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   We prayed and blessed one of our children.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   We had our baptisms, our first baptisms.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Had an amazing celebration at the beach.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   And we also started live preaching.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   On August 20th, we were able to launch our Cantonese service.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Now if you don't know, right from the beginning,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   we set out that we want to plant a church
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   that has an English and a Cantonese service.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   And August 20th, we were able to get that started.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   And I really, God's work is amazing.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Because I always say to Pastor Ivan,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   it's not easy to start a Cantonese speaking service
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   coming out of an English speaking church.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   But God has worked in incredible ways.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   And so this morning, we had our Cantonese service.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   It was amazing.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Then in September, we relocated here to this venue.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Now there is also a lot of stories behind that.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   It was such a struggle to get this thing ready and approved.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   And there was a point I prepared a speech to the whole church
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   to say that we are not able to move forward with this venue.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   But then God came through and he provided for us.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   And so now we were able to move in here in September.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Yes, praise God.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Michael Angelo Anu.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   We also had our public launch.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Before we were kind of in hiding, soft launch.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   But then we publicly announced that we have planted a church here
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   and we are here.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   And then since coming into this place,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   we've facilitated Alpha in Cantonese and in English.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   We've had some collaborations or started to in some ways
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   a farm with YWAM Shanty, with YWAM Harbor City,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   with Branches of Hope, with Oasis, with EIS.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   And so those are some of the partnerships
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   and some of the work outside of this church that we started doing.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   And then one thing that amazes me,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   and if anyone would have told me that at the beginning of the year,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   is we went from 35 people who were called from God
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   to step out and launch this church,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   to being on average 166 people every Sunday and 31 children.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   And so to me that's amazing.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   And then finally we were able to start eight community groups,
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   both in English and in Cantonese, places of connection,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   places where we can belong, places where we can grow in our faith.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   And so God has been amazing.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   He has done incredible work in 2023.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   He has laid a foundation for us.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   And so now we stand at the beginning of 2024.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   And how are we going to step into this new year?
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   And I believe that there's a lot of things on God's heart for us for this year.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   But how are we going to do it?
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Part of our vision has always been
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   that we're going to plant this church,
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   that we love and serve Yulong, Hong Kong, our community,
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   and that we would serve our neighbors in practical and impactful ways.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   We see ourselves especially serving ethnic minority and majority families.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   So we feel that God is giving us a family focus
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   of serving people in the community.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   And this year, 2024, is really about fleshing that out,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   working that out.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   We really want to see this happen.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   We want to see parents' lives touched,
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   children's lives touched, single parents' lives touched
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   by the love of God, cared for in practical ways.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   But here's the thing.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   We know that we cannot do this out of our own strength.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   We cannot do this by our own wisdom.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   We need God to work in our hearts, in our lives.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   And so we desperately need the Holy Spirit to move,
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   to bring unity to us as a body of Christ,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   to prepare us, to equip us, to mobilize us.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   You know, I as a pastor, I can try to encourage you to go,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   and maybe we go a little,
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   but it's really the Holy Spirit's work in our hearts
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   that sends us, that mobilizes us.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   It's God's calling us into this work in 2024.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   I cannot do that for myself.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   I cannot do it for you.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   It's the Holy Spirit's work.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   And so as we begin the year with a 21-day fast,
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   we're calling out to God to meet us, to speak to us.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   We're asking God for a move of His Holy Spirit
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   to bring us in alignment with each other
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   as we go out and serve and love the people around us in 2024.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   And this really is a cry of our hearts.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   God, we need you to work.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   We desperately need you.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   We cannot do it on our own strength.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   You know, it's you who changes lives.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   We don't change people's lives.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   God changes people's lives.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   If we rely on our own strength, you know,
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   we're going to do some stuff,
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   but I don't want to just do stuff in 2024.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   I want to see God move.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   I want to stand at the end of 2024 and say,
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   "Wow, praise Jesus for what He has done."
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Where it's so clear that it was not us,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   but it was by the Spirit, by God's power
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   that He was working through His people.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   That's what I want to see.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   And so as we're entering into this fast,
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   we're expressing this longing.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   God, we need you.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   We need you for our own life,
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   because there's stuff going on in our own lives,
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   and we need you for what you are calling us to.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   We don't want to move on our own strength.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   We want to move in the strength of the power of the Holy Spirit
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   as we go out.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   So that's why we're beginning the year with a 21-day fast.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Now, this is part of the Vine Church tradition.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   You want to see God.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   You want to say, "We need you."
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   We want to commune with God.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   And so we're going to enter into this year
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   and step into this year having heard from God,
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   having come into His presence,
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   having possibly sorted out some stuff in our own lives
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   that needs some sorting
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   so that we can move ahead for what He has for us.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   You know, that's our heart for this year.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   That's my heart as your pastor for this year.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   I want to see God move.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   So I'm excited about this.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   I hope you're excited.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   I'm really excited about it.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   And I can't wait to see what God does.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   Now, today we're beginning a new sermon series,
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   new year, new sermon series, right?
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   Seems like that's what we should do.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   And we've entitled the sermon series "Fresh Encounter."
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   We want to encounter Jesus in fresh and new ways.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   As a church, and this is one Chai and also Hyunhee Long,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   there was a sense, you know,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   that Jesus was calling us to commune with Him in a deeper way,
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   to draw close to Him,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   to really just sit in His presence.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   And so the series, we're going to have five practical ways,
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   five spiritual practices
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   that are going to help us to draw into Jesus' presence,
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   to commune with Him.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   And so let me share the five things that we're planning on doing.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   So today we're going to talk about fasting.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   You know what that is.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   Next week, prayer.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Then we'll talk about personal worship,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   confession and repentance.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   Don't skip that one, that Sunday, right?
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   It's an important one.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   And God's Word.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   Now earlier before the service,
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   we were talking about -- or somewhere, I actually don't remember where,
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   but today is some time.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   We talk about, you know, it's easy in our Christian life
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   to talk about past experience of what God has done,
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   He did 20 years ago.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   But we want a fresh encounter this year.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   We don't want to tell stories from a few years ago or several years ago.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   We want to experience Jesus in new ways this year.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   So this sermon is going to challenge us to deepen our walk with Jesus.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   And even if we've been Christians for a long time,
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   it's time for something fresh.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   It's time for Jesus, for us to ask Jesus to do something new in our lives
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   and hear from Him anew.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   So I'm excited about this.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   This is going to be good.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   Now today our topic is fasting, and we're doing a corporate fast,
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   which means we're doing it together as a church.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   But we also want to invite you to personally ask the Holy Spirit,
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   what is it that you want me to fast about?
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   What is in your life that you need God to meet you for?
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Is there a relationship?
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   Is there a sin that we're stuck in that for whatever reason
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   we just can't break free from?
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   Is there a decision that we have to make?
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   Is there a favor in the workplace or something that we need?
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   So I want to encourage you to ask the Holy Spirit,
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   what is it that you want me to fast for?
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   So what we're going to explore today through this message is three questions.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   What is fasting?
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Why do people fast?
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   And how do I do it?
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   So let me start off with what is fasting?
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Now, I don't know about you, but for me, for the longest time,
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   fasting played no role in my life.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   I didn't do it for a long time.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   I actually can't remember when I fasted for the first time.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   It might have been my 30s.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   I was already a pastor at that time.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   But I never fasted.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   And I just didn't see the connection between me and fasting,
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   between my spiritual life and fasting.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   And so I was surprised when I found out and was reading God's word
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   that Jesus actually assumes that his followers will fast.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   So in the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus teaches a little bit about fasting.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   And he starts off that teaching section with, "When you fast."
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   So Jesus is assuming that fasting will be part of Christians' lives.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Now, it's not a command.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   He doesn't say, "You need to fast."
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   He doesn't say how often you need to fast.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   But it is assumed that Christians will engage in a spiritual practice of fasting.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   Now, besides seeing that Jesus--that is something that he assumes
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   that we're going to be doing, I want to take you to the Bible passage
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   that I believe in the New Testament is the most important teaching on fasting.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   So we're going to go to Matthew 9, verses 14 and 15.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   It says this, "Then John's disciples came and asked him,
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   'How is it that we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?'
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   Jesus answered, 'How can the guests of the bright room mourn while he's with them?
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   The time will come when the bright room will be taken from them.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   Then they will fast.'"
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   So John the Baptist's disciples, they're observing, they're watching Jesus
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   and Jesus' disciples, and something just does not seem right.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   And they're like, "Why are they feasting?"
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   They're like eating a lot.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   They're having all these social engagements.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   But why are they not fasting?
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   Because fasting--see, it's like the longing for God to move and do something.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   And actually, the Pharisees, John's disciples, they fasted for the Messiah to come.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   They were longing for change.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   And so John's disciples are like, "You guys don't seem serious.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   You don't seem serious about God."
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   And so they're asking Jesus because he's the teacher,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   and the teacher is responsible for their students.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   And I always love how Jesus responds.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   He responds with a question.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   He says, "How can the guests of the bright room mourn while he's with them?"
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   Now what does that mean?
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   Why is Jesus talking about bright rooms and mourning and guests and all that?
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   Well, during the days of Jesus, wedding feasts, they were seven days long.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   And if you were invited to a wedding feast, you were not allowed to do very heavy work,
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   but you were also not allowed to mourn during that time.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   You were not allowed to fast during that time.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   It was a time of celebration.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   It was a joyous occasion.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   So you're not allowed to be the downer from the party.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   And Jesus is saying about himself, "I am the bright room."
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   And the disciples, they're my guests.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   And it doesn't make sense for them to fast while I'm with them.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   But there's another important piece of information that we need to know to understand this
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   whole bright room, guests, wedding feast thing.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   In the Old Testament, the prophets, for example, Isaiah,
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   he talks about a time when there will be a banquet,
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   when God will host a banquet.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   And it's when God's kingdom is fully realized.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   When his kingdom has come, his will has been done, and he fully reigns.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   His reign has been fully established on earth.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   And it's known as a messianic banquet.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   And Jesus, he's making a claim about himself, about his identity.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   He's making a claim that he is God with us.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   He's the bright room of that banquet.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   And he's here now.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   In the person of Jesus, the kingdom of God has broken into the present moment.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   And so it doesn't make sense for those who are with him to be fasting.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   This is a joyous occasion.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   This is actually what John the Baptist's disciples had been fasting for,
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   that the Messiah would come.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   And so he's saying it doesn't make any sense for the disciples to fast.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   But then Jesus continues to respond to the question that was asked.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   He says, the second part of verse 15 says this,
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   "The time will come when the bright room will be taken from them.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   Then they will fast."
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   So Jesus is predicting his own death.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   He's predicting that he will go to the cross, that he will die,
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   that he will rise, and that he will ascend to heaven.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   And then the disciples will fast during that time period.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   Again, it assumes that we will be fasting.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   But it changes a little bit the meaning of fasting,
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   because now the disciples are fasting in anticipation of Jesus' second coming,
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   when this messianic banquet will be held.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   They're longing for God's work, his kingdom work, to be manifested in the present now.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   It's a cry for the kingdom when they're fasting.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   They're crying out for God to come and to move and for him to reign
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   and for his will to be established, for his wholeness to come, for his peace to come.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   That's the character of the fasting.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   By fasting, they're expressing through the hunger of their bodies
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   the longing for moral, spiritual, social, political change in this world,
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   for the manifestation of the kingdom of God to break into their present moment,
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   because in their present moment, there are things that are just not right.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   And there is a deep longing in the heart for them to change in their own lives,
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   but also in the lives of the people around us.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   Now, this type of fasting is nothing else than the second and the third petition of the Lord's Prayer.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   "Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven."
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   It's a cry for the kingdom.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   So what is fasting?
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   Christian fasting and prayer is the passionate pursuit of the not yet of the kingdom,
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   the areas where God's will is not realized yet,
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   a longing for the establishment of God's reign in our present moment.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   That's what fasting is.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   And when we fast, we make ourselves available.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   Like we sang earlier, I will make room for you to do whatever you want to.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   We're humbling ourselves.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   We're coming before God empty-handed.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   We say, "We need you.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   We desperately need you.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Our city desperately needs you."
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   And we ask for you to come and to meet us, to move,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   to bring change, to transform, for redemption.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   Fasting is also a prophetic declaration of hope
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   that whatever might be going on, whatever our circumstances are,
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   whatever seems like a lost cause, it is not the final word.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   So when we fast, we make that prophetic declaration.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   Whatever is going on, whatever the circumstances are,
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   this is not God's final word on the circumstances.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   Because we have hope, because we know Jesus is coming again.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   And Jesus is not finished with us yet.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   He's not finished with you yet.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   He's not finished with Hong Kong yet.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   He is at work.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   And he's longing and waiting for people to make themselves available to him,
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   to just long for him, to long for his things.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   It's like longing for the kingdom.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   It's like longing for the works of Jesus,
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   that we see Jesus doing the Bible to unfold in people's lives.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   That's my longing.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   That's my heart's cry.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   That's what I want to see happen.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   But I can't do it out of my own strength.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   You cannot do it out of your own strength.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   We cannot do it by our own wisdom.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   We cannot do it by our own power.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   But we can do it by the spirit of the living God moving and working through us,
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   his people.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   So that is what fasting is.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   It's a cry for the kingdom to come.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   And it's us humbling ourselves and making us available to the king of kings,
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   saying, "Here I am.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   Use me."
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   God loves working when we come to him and fasting.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   He loves us.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   He loves working through his people.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   He loves when we humble ourselves and say, "We need you.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   We want the things of you."
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   So that is what fasting is.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   Now, why do people fast?
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   I'm going to give five reasons.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   There's more, but I'll just share five.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   The first one is to release the Holy Spirit's empowering presence in their lives.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   Now, you see, Jesus, he was baptized.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   The Holy Spirit came upon him.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   And then in Luke 4, verse 1, we read, "Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit,
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   left the Jordan and was led by the spirit into the wilderness."
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   So that in the wilderness, he fasted.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   He only drank water, apparently.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   And then in the end, he was tempted and overcame Satan's temptation.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   Now, I want you to note, you know, that it says he was full of the Holy Spirit.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   But then in verse 14, so just right coming out of the fast,
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   we read, "Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit."
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   So there is a shift that Jesus is operating not out of his human strength,
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   but in the power of the Holy Spirit because he relied on the Holy Spirit.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   And so if we want to move in the power of the Holy Spirit
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   and not out of our own strength, you know, that's one of the reasons why we fast
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   because we want and we desire to move in the Spirit
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   and not in the flesh, not in our own strength, by his power
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   because he's the one that really can change things.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   You know, he's the one that knows what's best.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   And we don't. We have selfishness and things in our heart.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   But if we move by the power of the Spirit, it's amazing.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   So we fast to release the Holy Spirit's empowering presence in our lives.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   Second, we fast to become untangled from sin and experience victory over our lives.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   I'm not going to--I have a lot of passages. I'm not going to read every passage.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   If you want to keep track of this later on, really, you can take a photo.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   But in the Old Testament, there's many times where Israel--
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   it's always like they are living right, righteously right, then they sin,
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   and they're stuck in their sin of worshipping idols.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   And then they are confronted with their sin. They realize their sin.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   Sometimes a prophet even calls them out on it.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   And then they come before God with repentance and fasting.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   And God entangles them from their sin and allows them to move forward as a nation,
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   allows them to move forward as individuals, and that the power of sin is broken in their lives.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   And so when we--so fasting and repentance is also linked in Scripture.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   And so perhaps there's a sin that keeps resurfacing.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   You know, even when we're Christian, there's sins that just don't seem to be going away.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   They keep popping back up in our lives.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   And so when we fast, we can also ask God to entangle us and give us victory from sin, over sin.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   The third reason we fast is to become more alert and receptive to the Holy Spirit's leadership.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   And so in Acts that--we're going to read this passage in a second--
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   the church is gathering in Antioch.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   So the Christian movement, it's brand new.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   You know, it hasn't existed for very long, and it says this.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   "While they were worshipping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said,
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   'Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.'
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   So after they had fasted and prayed, they placed their hands on them, and they sent them off.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   And Paul and Barnabas went on to their missionary journeys to plant churches."
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   But we fast to be more alert and receptive to the Holy Spirit's leadership in our lives.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   You see, a lot of times we have so much noise in our lives--
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   work, family stuff, Instagram, TV, whatever, music, whatever you do.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   We do all sorts of stuff, but a lot of times we're not very tuned in to God.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   But when we fast and worship and we carve out the space,
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   we're actually open to what God is doing, and we can receive that.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   We can receive words from God and direction from God.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   And so we fast because we need direction from God.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   This is why we're fasting as a church,
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   because we want to be alert and open to the Holy Spirit's leadership.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   We want to hear.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   We don't want to move out of our own wisdom.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   The fourth reason people fast is to seek God's guidance.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   A lot of times we find ourselves at crossroads, or we need direction,
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   or there's something difficult to navigate.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   Here in this case, Israel had to navigate--
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   had a dangerous journey that they needed to navigate.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   So they fast and they pray and they ask God for wisdom.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   And God answers their prayer and gets them safely to where they need to go.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   So you pray and fast for God's guidance.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   And then finally, we pray and fast to commune with God.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   That is actually the most important thing,
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   is to draw deeper in our relationship with God when we fast,
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   and just commune with Him, spend time with Him.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   Here in this example, it's the prophetess Anna.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   You know, that's been waiting for the Messiah.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   And it says in Luke 2, verse 37,
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   "She never left the temple, but worshipped night and day, fasting and praying."
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   So she was communing with God.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   She was worshipping and drawing near to God.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   And so our fasting is also a drawing near to God.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   Just spend time with God.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   Just sit to listen.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   It's not us just talking all the time.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   It's about a relationship.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   You're like, "All of that sounds great.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   I want all of that in my life.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   How do I do it?
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   Like, how do we do this?"
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   And I want to say one thing to you.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   I don't want to give the impression that this is like fasting makes your wish list magically happen.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   You know, it really is a surrendering and coming before God,
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   and then He acts and moves how He wants to act and move.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   But He loves us, and He's good, and He loves giving us good gifts.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   Now, I just want to make that clear.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   But how do we do it?
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   So I'm going to have five steps, just simple steps, for how you can enter into this fast.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   Later on, after this, we're going to also share a QR code
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   where you can sign up for our WhatsApp communication.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   Through that, you'll get actually a guide that captures a little bit of what's on here
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   that you can use to prepare for the fast.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   But let me go through this.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   First step is determine your spiritual purpose for the fast.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   You know, ask the Holy Spirit, "What do you want me to fast for?"
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   Actually spend some time praying and asking Him.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   Where do you need God to change?
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   Where are things not right?
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   We need God to act and move in your life.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   Is there an important decision that needs to be made?
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   Is there a need for healing, a problem that requires a resolution,
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   or a pattern of sin that needs to be broken?
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   What is the Holy Spirit inviting you to personally fast for?
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   And it's helpful to do that because then our praying,
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   while we're fasting, can be more strategic.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   We actually know what we're focusing on.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   So that's for the personal fast.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   For the corporate fast, our focus is to ask the Holy Spirit to prepare us,
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   to equip us, to unite us.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   We really sense it's important for the Holy Spirit to unite us
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   between the counties, the English service, and us as a community,
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   for us here so we can move forward into what He has for us together.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   To lead us, empower us for the ministry and work that He calls us to do in 2024,
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   of just loving and serving the people around us.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   So that is the first step, is determine your spiritual purpose for the fast.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   The second one is choose how long you will fast for.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   Well, we've chosen it's 21 days.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   But if you fast another time, just set a time, start small, build up from there.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   The third step, decide on what you will fast.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   What are you going to abstain from?
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   Now, biblically, it is always food in the Bible, as an example.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   And there are different types of fasts, and I'm not going to get into all of them.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   The two most common are the normal fast, which is you fast food and you just drink water.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   The other one is the Daniel fast, where you eat vegetables, you drink water,
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   but you don't have wine, you don't have steak, you don't have your candy,
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   your dessert, whatever it is that you like.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   So it's very simple.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   So we encourage you, if you want to fast food, to keep it real simple.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   So whether the Daniel fast or skipping a meal a day.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   Like we don't recommend, especially if you've never fasted before, doing a 21-day fast of no food.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   If you want to do that, talk to your doctor first.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   Now, for some of us, maybe there's actually some issues around food.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   And that would actually be distracting while we're fasting.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   Or maybe the Holy Spirit is leading you to fast something else.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   And so I have some questions for you to help you discern what other things you can fast for.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   You know, what activities are crowding out your time with prayer and with God?
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   What activities are becoming more important to you than God?
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   And what's taking up your time?
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   And if we're honest, we do all sorts of things a lot of times, but don't spend very much time with God.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   We spend so much time on Instagram, it's like the doom scrolling, it's like endless.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   We have different things as different people.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   But it's like, what is crowding out your time for God?
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   And fast from that.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   And this brings me to the fourth step.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   So it might be Instagram, Netflix, sports news, whatever it is for you.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   So the fourth step is plan how you will spend your time with God.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   Because fasting is not just abstaining from something, it's actually making space for God.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   And this is where I see fasting go wrong.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   Like where a lot of people, for some reason, we love like abstaining from something.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   But then we don't actually spend time with God.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   But if you want to do a Christian fast, it actually involves carving our time with God.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   You can, for example, if you skip a meal, maybe during that time you spend some time with God.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   Reading His Word, worshipping Him, going for a prayer walk, just being still and listening.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   Whatever it is that you're meditating on a scripture.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   But have a plan for how you will spend time with God.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   And I also want to just keep it simple.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   You don't need to break a world record of how long you do this.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   Do something that you can do.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   But have a plan.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   And then the final one is be expectant of God.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   You know, God loves you.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   He is your loving Father.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   And He loves when His children come to Him.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   He loves it.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   He loves meeting us.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   He loves speaking to us.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   He loves providing for us.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   And so we can come to Him in faith.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   We don't have to beg.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   We just ask Him like a child asks a father.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   We just pour the things that are in our hearts out to Him in that way.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   And we ask God to move and to provide.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   So those are the five steps of fasting.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   And as I shared, there's a QR code where you can sign up for WhatsApp.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   And can we have the QR code, please?
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   So you can sign up to our WhatsApp community,
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   and there you will receive those five steps that I just shared about.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   It's also where you get your 21-day devotional that we've created as a church.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   Every day we're going to be sending out one.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   Some of your community members have written one.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   You might use that for that time that you're going to spend with God.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   Now I want us to take a step back.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   I actually want to invite the worship team to come up at this time.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   And I was thinking what would happen if we actually all would fast,
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   if we all would humble ourselves and seek God at the beginning of this year through worship and prayer?
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   What would God do?
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   What would He do in our hearts?
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   How would He move?
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   How would He prepare us?
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   And then that picture is at the end of 2024.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   That picture of standing there, looking back, and just falling on our knees in worship.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   Because it's so clear that what happened was not something that happened out of our own strength.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   It was God's work.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   That God has worked this year in our lives and in our community's lives.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   Because we have come to Him.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   We said, "Lord, we desire for You to move."
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   Because we cried out for the kingdom, for a manifestation of the kingdom to break into our here and now.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   We said, "Lord, we long for that.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   We long for the things that are not right to be said right.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   We long for people to experience healing, physical healing, emotional healing.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   We long for people to be brought into the kingdom that they can experience Your love and Your goodness."
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   And so I just picture us at the end of the year, looking back and knowing that this time fasting,
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   this time coming before God, God met us and He worked.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   And I want to invite you all to stand.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   And I want to challenge you.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   I want to invite you.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   You know, like I said, we come from different backgrounds.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   Maybe you're like, "Eh, I don't want to fast."
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   But I really believe God wants to meet us.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   He wants to work through this time together.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   We get to be encouraged because we get to do it together.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   You're not doing it on your own.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   And I believe that through this fasting, we're going to be able to step in a different way into this year.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   We're not going to be operating out of our own power, but through the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   So I would love to pray for you.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   And I want to invite you to stretch out your hands before you just to symbolize just wanting to receive from God.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   So Jesus, we thank You so much that You love us.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   We thank You that we can come to You in prayer and in fasting.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   That You love when we commune with You.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   And I ask that You would take us deeper into our relationship with You.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   That we would experience this year You in a new way that we have not experienced You before.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   I pray that we -- that it would be a move of the Spirit among us.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   We do something special, something beautiful, something fresh.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   I pray for personal breakthroughs, Lord.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   There's stuff where we need You to act now in our own lives.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   I pray that You would move in people's lives, that it would experience You like they have not experienced You before.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   Most of all, Lord, we just want to honor You.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   We just want to do this as I worship to You and say, "We love You."
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   And we long for the things that You long for.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   So will You work and move as we come to You in our fasting and prayer.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   I pray all of a sudden, in Your name, Jesus, amen.
