[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   focused on building up God's kingdom one life at a time.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   It is a church that has at the heart of its DNA
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   the grand narrative of the redemptive story of Jesus Christ
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   and that celebrates in the freedom and grace that such a story brings.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   This church is not constricted by the walls of a building
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   but actively engaged in the community it is planted in
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   desiring for God's kingdom to take root and bear fruit in local soil.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   A church that sees salvation as holistic
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   transforming God's people for God's work
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   and equipping a generation to represent God's heart
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   to the poor, the weak, the oppressed and the persecuted.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Imagine this church committed to seeing the family as integral
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   to all that it's called to be and do
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   involving intentional, committed and authentic relationships across all levels.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   It is the sort of place where both the young and the old feel cared for
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   supported and equipped.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   A church where people of all backgrounds and traditions
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   come to feel at home.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   A cultural mosaic that honors and embraces a richness in diversity
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   that marks us as the body of Christ.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   It is a church that is willing to innovate and express faith creatively
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   reflecting the boundless limits of God's creativity as glory to Him.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   A place where people gather hungry for the presence of God
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   and passionate to see this invade all aspects of their lives.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Where they seek to develop an intelligent spiritual faith
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   rooted in God's word and driven with prayer.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   A church that does not make its Sunday services
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   the exclamation mark of its existence
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   but instead the comma in its ongoing sentence.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   A time of service, love and engagement
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   that inspires and emboldens all equally for the conversation that lies ahead.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   A church that cares, disciples, rebuilds, renews.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   This is our city.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   This is our church.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   This is our home.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Yay! Happy New Year! Good morning everyone!
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Good morning everyone!
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Happy New Year again!
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   We have a group of people there waiting to go and waiting to sit.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   So, but today is the first week, first Sunday of 2024.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Praise the Lord! Lead us to the new year.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   You know, this morning we finished a live 30th Kennedy service.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   That's the new, new spirit came to us.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   I believe that that new will come to us in the English service as well.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   We have a strong sense that God would like to let us to have his new spirit.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   This is very fresh.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   He want to refresh us.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   He want to remind us how beautiful and powerful he is.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   How the spirit can come upon us and lead us to a new page and new life.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   This is very meaningful for the start of the year today.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   So I would like to invite all of you to stand
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   and then we can have a prayer.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   This prayer to really to lift up ourselves, our heart to God, to worship him, to praise him today.

[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Now we open our hearts.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   We open our hearts to connect with you through worship, through our singing
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   and through your presence with us all together.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   We pray in Jesus name.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Amen.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Who's ready to worship God in 2024?
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Anybody?

[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Every chain will break as broken hearts declare his praise.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Who can stop the Lord almighty?

[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   In every beam, Jesus, it is you.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Who turns the day to night and watches me as I begin to dream.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   Jesus, it is you.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Who brings me food for my table.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   Who cares for all of my needs.

[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Here and beyond.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   Oh, to the one thing true.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   Jesus, it is you.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Who brings the light.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   I want to do this again.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   Who sees my brokenness and carries me when I am frail and weak.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Jesus, it is you.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   Who tells the storm to rest when I am overwhelmed and cannot speak.

[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   Who wears my guilt on his shoulder.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   Who holds my heart in his hands.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   Who takes my thoughts and fears and hangs them on the arms of Calvary.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   Jesus, it is you.

[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   I lift my hands.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   And I bring my soul.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   All of my days, all of my rights, all of my wrongs.

[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   I lift my hands.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   And I bring my soul.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   All of my days, all of my rights, all of my wrongs.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   I offer my life.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   Here and beyond.

[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   Jesus, it is you.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   To the one thing true.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   Jesus.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   To the one thing true.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   Jesus.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   To the one thing true.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   Jesus.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   To the one thing true.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   Jesus.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   To the one thing true.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   We praise you.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   To the one thing true.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   Jesus, it is you.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   I lift my hands.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   And I lift my hands.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   I bring my soul.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   All of my days, all of my rights, all of my wrongs.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   I offer my life.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   Here and beyond.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   To the one thing true.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   Jesus, it is you.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   I offer my life.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   I offer my life.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   Here and beyond.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   To the one thing true.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   Jesus, it is you.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   When we lift up our hands, when we sing, we offer our life.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   Because Jesus is the one himself to offer his life for us first.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   For the first Sunday of the year, first week of the month, this is the best time.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   We all together as a church to take the communion.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   This is a time for us to remember, remember the grace, remember how Jesus sacrificed himself for us.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   So now I invite, welcome him to pass around the bread and the cup all together.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   If you are a follower of Christ, I invite you to take the communion together.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   When you take the bread and the cup, this is a time for us to reflect.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   To reflect how Jesus worked on us in the past, but also at this moment.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   We can take some time, we can pray, we can reflect, we can ask the Holy Spirit to talk to us.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   To see how much grace God gave to us.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   In the Bible, Jesus asked his disciples in the Last Supper, he asked them to do this to remember him.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   He took the bread, broke it, passed it, and he said this is the body he gives us.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   And also the cup, he took it up, he passed it, and he said this is his blood for us to make the new covenant.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   When we remember Jesus to do this, Holy Spirit reminds us, we are not only remembering.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   That action we need to remember, that action behind is how Jesus sacrificed himself for us.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   This morning when we are having a prayer, and the scripture comes to us in Revelation the first chapter.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   It says Jesus is the firstborn of the dead and the ruler of kings of the earth.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   And then following the first scripture is, to him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   And he has made us to be a kingdom and priest to serve his God and Father.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   To him be glory and power forever and ever.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   This is how Jesus through this, through his death and his restoration.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   For us to be part of his kingdom.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   But not only this, not only asking for us to be the people of his kingdom.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   He also asked us, empowered us to be the priest.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   To be the priest on the earth.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   So we took it, we take it, the communion today is a remembrance of Jesus.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   And also what he did for his world, for the world that he bring to us.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   How he through his ministry, he bring the heaven to the earth.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   So now, let us take a breath together.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   (Breath)
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   Jesus, thank you for how you sacrifice yourself.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   So that we can be part of your kingdom.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   Thank you for broke your body.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   So that we can through this to go into your kingdom.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   Now we are going to take this cup to be thanks ourselves.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   We commit ourselves to you because you set us free through your blood.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   When we take this, we have the heart of humbling and repentance and confess that.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   What we have done hurts you.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   But now, you forgive us and save us.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   Let us take a cup together.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   (Breath)
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   Let's pray.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   Father, thank you for this communion.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   We understand how you love us.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   And that covenant, that new covenant that you made for us.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   For this year, this time.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   You giving a new hope, new spirit.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   When the world feeling hopeless.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   But your new covenant giving new hope to this city, to this earth, to this world.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   Thank you for first give us this redemption.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   May you renew us through this.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   May you renew us, our spirit to be connected with you.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   May your Holy Spirit fill us.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   We thank you for all this.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   May you also lift up us voice to worship you and praise you for this song coming.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   So that your spirit can flow here.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   Your Holy Spirit flow here.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   We hold our heart all together.

[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   He's longing like a father.

[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   >> Hello again.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   I'm Ivan, by the way.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   I'm one of the pastors of the Vine Church, Yuen Long.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   I think it's so good to see all of you.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   I know that some of you have just had a very good trip,
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   had a very good celebration time for Christmas and also Chinese New Year.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   What now, first thing we would like to bring to you guys is
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   you need to fast.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   It seems like, wow, I have been having a party all the time,
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   but now I need to go to a very spiritual.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   But actually, I know that even though we are having fun,
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   we are also very spiritual if the spirit is with us.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   But in the first month of the year, we have a tradition of the Vine.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   We will have fasting period.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   We have 21-day fasting every year.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   So when we plan a church in Yuen Long, we also have this tradition.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   When we sing, we break the tradition.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   We are not breaking this because this really helps us
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   to have the direction for the whole year.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   It really helps us to open our hearts, to receive God's Word,
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   to have a good connection, intimacy with God.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   Pastor Tim will share more about how we fast in the message today.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   But now I would like to remind everyone,
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   since tomorrow we will have 21-day fasting at the whole church together.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   When we talk about the whole church fasting,
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   in the middle of this fasting period, that means next week,
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   we will have some prayer time.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   We have some prayer time altogether.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   Monday, we will have a prayer room.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   So this room, this church venue, we will have a little setup
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   to help everyone anytime you come during that evening.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   You can have a space to pray personally yourself.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   Of course, there are ones who have other brothers and sisters.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   But this is really a time we make room for God.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   We make room to pray.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   So we invite you, feel free to come.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   And Tuesday, the day after, we will have our prayer meeting.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   We will focus on prayer and also pray for the coming year.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   We listen to God, how God needs us altogether as a church.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   This is a corporate prayer.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   And then after our personal prayer, and then we have a corporate prayer,
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   that is the time we go out to pray.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   We at our church would love to serve.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   So Wednesday will be the time we gather together first,
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   and then we will go out to have a prayer walk.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   And then we come together to share what we receive from God.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   So this is super meaningful.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   So we invite you, set aside your time.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   Any night or all night, you would like to join us.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   Feel free, no pressure, but super encouraged.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   You guys, we can pray together.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   When we talk about prayer, fasting seems like your face is getting,
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   "Oh, no, we have something to celebrate."
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   Actually, fasting is also a celebration,
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   because we are getting connected with God very closely.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   And then, on the 28th, actually this is the day we have our monthly lunch time,
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   gathering together, bring your own lunch.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   We can have our time right there to have our community time.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   And this is also the time, the day we are going to break our fasting.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   So this is super meaningful.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   If you want to connect us more,
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   if you want to build a relationship during the lunch,
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   please join us, set the time.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   We can come together to have some celebration with what God brings to us.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   Is it okay? Is it good?
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   Great. So now is the time we have our offering.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   Yeah, I invite, welcome team can pass around the basket.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   Yeah, when we worship, we can very sense that the joyful heart
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   and also the God is moving us in our heart.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   He always wants us to be renewed.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   And this offering also God gives us,
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   and then we can contribute to His kingdom by this offering with a new heart.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   So I would like to have a prayer after the basket passed around.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   I would like to pray for this with a new mind,
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   a new mind that this is not like an obligation,
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   like a tradition, religion things.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   This is really what, how can we worship God with our heart
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   to contribute to His kingdom.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   Is it good? So yeah, let's pray.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   Father, we thank you for your provision.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   You not only provide for our living needs,
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   you provide to our spirit as well.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   When we do this, we know that this is part of worship
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   because we do it with our heart.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   And we know that you will use this to best your kingdom, best your people.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   We thank you so much. You include us in your good planning.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   This new covenant leads us to this serving.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   So we thank you so much. May you use this in your purpose.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   And thank you again for Jesus to lead us to have this kind of opportunity
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   to serve all together. We pray that in your name. Amen. Amen.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   So now today I would like to invite Pastor Tim.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   Yeah, come to us to have our, like a sermon.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   I think Pastor Tim, he spent really lots of time
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   and his heart to really prepare for this message.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   I would like to invite everyone, really prepare our hearts as well.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   For this message, I believe that God is really saying something to everyone of us.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   For the first day, first week of the year,
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   this is moving us in a direction that God wants us all together to go.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   So I would like to invite all of you, stretch out your hand to pray for Pastor Tim.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   Father, we thank you for how you lead us and how you work on us.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   We thank you for you build this church and you brought us to a new year.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   We have that expectation.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   You asked us to expect that you will work on our life.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   So now we open our hearts to receive your message through Pastor Tim.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   Lord, may you best, may you best, Pastor Tim.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   May you best him to speak your words, to be the visual,
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   to pass through this amazing work to us and that we can receive and that we can apply in our life.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   We pray that in Jesus name. Amen.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   Amen. Thank you, Pastor Ivan.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   Hey, Sanin Philok, Happy New Year.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   So good to see you all.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   So, as we start the beginning of this year,
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   I thought it was important for us to actually take a look back at what God has done in this past year.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   And I think that will help us actually step into what God has for us in 2024.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   And so what I want to do is highlight some milestones, you know, in our churches life.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   So let me share some with you.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   First, in January last year, we set out from Wan Chai.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   We moved from Wan Chai. We were meeting there as a launch team.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   Here to Yuen Long at EIS International Preschool.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   And we started our English service.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   It was incredible.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   After that, or while we were at EIS, God did some significant things in us.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   He helped us to shift from being acquaintances.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   We actually didn't know each other well.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   To being a spiritual community, a spiritual family that loves each other.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   That knows what's going on in each other's lives.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   That was a significant shift.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   We also went from being a launch team to actually being a local church.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   Now during that time, we also had some amazing celebrations.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   We had our first child dedication, where we prayed and blessed one of our children.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   We had our baptisms, our first baptisms, had an amazing celebration at the beach.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   And we also started live preaching.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   On August 20th, we were able to launch our Cantonese service.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   Now if you don't know, right from the beginning, we set out that we want to plant a church that has an English and a Cantonese service.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   And August 20th, we were able to get that started.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   God's work is amazing.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   I always say to Pastor Ivan, it's not easy to start a Cantonese speaking service coming out of an English speaking church.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   But God has worked in incredible ways.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   So this morning, we had our Cantonese service, it was amazing.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   Then in September, we relocated here to this venue.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   Now there is also a lot of stories behind that.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   It was such a struggle to get this thing ready and approved.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   And there was a point I prepared a speech to the whole church to say that we are not able to move forward with this venue.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   But then God came through and he provided for us.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   And so now we were able to move in here in September.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   Yes, praise God.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   Michael Angelo Anu.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   We also had our public launch before we were kind of in hiding, soft launch.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   But then we publicly announced that we have planted a church here and we are here.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   And then since coming into this place, we've facilitated Alpha in Cantonese and in English.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   We've had some collaborations or started to in some ways a farm with YWAM Shanty, with YWAM Harbor City, with Branches of Hope, with Oasis, with EIS.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   And so those are some of the partnerships and some of the work outside of this church that we started doing.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   And then one thing that amazes me, and if anyone would have told me that at the beginning of the year,
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   we went from 35 people who were called from God to step out and launch this church,
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   to being on average 166 people every Sunday and 31 children.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   And so to me that's amazing.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   And then finally we were able to start eight community groups, both in English and Cantonese.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   Places of connection, places where we can belong, places where we can grow in our faith.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   And so God has been amazing.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   He has done incredible work in 2023.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   He has laid a foundation for us.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   And so now we stand at the beginning of 2024.
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   And how are we going to step into this new year?
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   And I believe that there's a lot of things on God's heart for us for this year.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   But how are we going to do it?
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   Part of our vision has always been that we're going to plant this church,
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   that we love and serve Yilong, Hong Kong, our community,
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   and that we would serve our neighbors in practical and impactful ways.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   We see ourselves especially serving ethnic minority and majority families.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   So we feel that God is giving us a family focus of serving people in the community.
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   And this year, 2024, is really about fleshing that out, working that out.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   We really want to see this happen.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   We want to see parents' lives touched, children's lives touched, single parents' lives touched
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   by the love of God, cared for in practical ways.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   But here's the thing.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   We know that we cannot do this out of our own strength.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   We cannot do this by our own wisdom.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   We need God to work in our hearts, in our lives.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   And so we desperately need the Holy Spirit to move, to bring unity to us as a body of Christ,
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   to prepare us, to equip us, to mobilize us.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   You know, I as a pastor, I can try to encourage you to go and maybe we go a little.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   But it's really the Holy Spirit's work in our hearts that sends us, that mobilizes us.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   It's God's calling us into this work in 2024.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   I cannot do that for myself.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   I cannot do it for you.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   It's the Holy Spirit's work.
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   And so as we begin the year with a 21-day fast, we're calling out to God to meet us, to speak to us.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   We're asking God for a move of His Holy Spirit to bring us in alignment with each other
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   as we go out and serve and love the people around us in 2024.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   And this really is a cry of our hearts.
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   God, we need you to work.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   We desperately need you.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   We cannot do it on our own strength.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   You know, it's you who changes lives.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   We don't change people's lives.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   God changes people's lives.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   If we rely on our own strength, you know, we're going to do some stuff.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   But I don't want to just do stuff in 2024.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   I want to see God move.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   I want to stand at the end of 2024 and say, "Wow, praise Jesus for what He has done."
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   Where it's so clear that it was not us, but it was by the Spirit, by God's power that He was working through His people.
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   That's what I want to see.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   And so as we're entering into this fast, we're expressing this longing.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   God, we need you.
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   We need you for our own life because there's stuff going on in our own lives.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   And we need you for what you are calling us to.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   We don't want to move on our own strength.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   We want to move in the strength of the power of the Holy Spirit as we go out.
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   So that's why we're beginning the year with a 21-day fast.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   Now this is part of the Vine Church tradition.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   You want to see God.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   You want to say, "We need you."
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   We want to commune with God.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   And so we're going to enter into this year and step into this year having heard from God, having come into His presence,
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   having possibly sorted out some stuff in our own lives that needs some sorting so that we can move ahead for what He has for us.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   You know, that's our heart for this year.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   That's my heart as a pastor for this year.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   I want to see God move.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   So I'm excited about this.
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   I hope you're excited.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   I'm really excited about it.
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   And I can't wait to see what God does.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   Now today we're beginning a new sermon series, new year, new sermon series, right?
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   Seems like that's what we should do.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   And we've entitled the sermon series "Fresh Encounter."
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   We want to encounter Jesus in fresh and new ways.
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   As a church, and this is one Chai and also here in Yulong, there was a sense, you know, that Jesus was calling us to commune with Him in a deeper way.
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   To draw close to Him.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   To really just sit in His presence.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   And so the series, we're going to have five practical ways, five spiritual practices that are going to help us to draw into Jesus' presence, to commune with Him.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   And so let me share the five things that we're planning on doing.
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   So today we're going to talk about fasting.
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   You know what that is.
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   Next week, prayer.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   Then we'll talk about personal worship.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   Confession and repentance.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   Don't skip that one, that's Sunday, right?
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   It's an important one.
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   And God's Word.
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   Now earlier before the service we were talking about, or somewhere, I actually don't remember where, but today is some time.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   We talk about, you know, it's easy in our Christian life to talk about past experience of what God has done.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.000]   He did 20 years ago.
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   But we want a fresh encounter this year.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   We don't want to tell stories from a few years ago or several years ago.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   We want to experience Jesus in new ways this year.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   So this sermon is going to challenge us to deepen our walk with Jesus.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   And even if we've been Christians for a long time, it's time for something fresh.
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:35.000]   It's time for Jesus, for us to ask Jesus to do something new in our lives and to hear from Him anew.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   So I'm excited about this.
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   This is going to be good.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   Now today our topic is fasting.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   And we're doing a corporate fast, which means we're doing it together as a church.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   But we also want to invite you to personally ask the Holy Spirit, what is it that you want me to fast about?
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   What is in your life that you need God to meet you for?
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   Is there a relationship?
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   Is there a sin that we're stuck in that for whatever reason we just can't break free from?
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   Is there a decision that we have to make?
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   Is there a favor in the workplace or something that we need?
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   So I want to encourage you to ask the Holy Spirit, what is it that you want me to fast for?
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   So what we're going to explore today through this message is three questions.
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   What is fasting?
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   Why do people fast?
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   So let me start off with what is fasting?
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   Now I don't know about you, but for me for the longest time fasting played no role in my life.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:46.000]   I didn't do it for a long time.
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   I actually can't remember when I fasted for the first time.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   It might have been my 30s.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   I was already a pastor at that time.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   But I never fasted.
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:06.000]   And I just didn't see the connection between me and fasting, between my spiritual life and fasting.
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   And so I was surprised when I found out and was reading God's Word
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:15.000]   that Jesus actually assumes that his followers will fast.
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   So in the Sermon on the Mount Jesus teaches a little bit about fasting.
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   And he starts off that teaching section with when you fast.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   So Jesus is assuming that fasting will be part of Christians' lives.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   Now it's not a command.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   He doesn't say you need to fast.
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   He doesn't say how often you need to fast.
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:46.000]   But it is assumed that Christians will engage in a spiritual practice of fasting.
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   Now besides seeing that Jesus, that is something that he assumes that we're going to be doing,
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   I want to take you to the Bible passage.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   And I believe in the New Testament it's the most important teaching on fasting.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   So we're going to go to Matthew 9 verses 14 and 15.
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   It says this,
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   "Then John's disciples came and asked him,
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:17.000]   'How is it that we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?'
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   Jesus answered, 'How can the guests of the bright room mourn while he's with them?
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   The time will come when the bright room will be taken from them.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   Then they will fast.'"
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   So John the Baptist's disciples, they're observing, they're watching Jesus and Jesus' disciples
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   and something just does not seem right.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:47.000]   And they're like, why are they feasting?
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   They're like eating a lot.
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   They're having all these social engagements.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   But why are they not fasting?
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   Because fasting, it's like the longing for God to move and do something.
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   And actually the Pharisees, John's disciples, they fasted for the Messiah to come.
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.000]   They were longing for change.
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   And so John's disciples are like, you guys don't seem serious.
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   You don't seem serious about God.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:26.000]   And so they're asking Jesus because he's a teacher and a teacher is responsible for their students.
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:30.000]   And I love, I always love how Jesus responds.
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   He responds with a question.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   He says, "How can the guests of the bright room mourn while he's with them?"
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000]   Now what does that mean?
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   Why is Jesus talking about bright rooms and mourning and guests and all that?
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   Well, during the days of Jesus, wedding feasts, they were seven days long.
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   And if you were invited to a wedding feast, you were not allowed to do very heavy work.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   But you were also not allowed to mourn during that time.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   You're not allowed to fast during that time.
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.000]   It was a time of celebration.
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.000]   It was a joyous occasion.
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   So you're not allowed to be the downer from the party.
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   And Jesus is saying about himself, I am the bright room and the disciples, they're my guests.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   And it doesn't make sense for them to fast while I'm with them.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   But there's another important piece of information that we need to know to understand this whole bright room, guests, wedding feast thing.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:36.000]   In the Old Testament, the prophets, for example, Isaiah,
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   he talks about a time when there will be a banquet, when God will host a banquet.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:46.000]   And it's when God's kingdom is fully realized.
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   When his kingdom has come, his will has been done, and he fully reigns.
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:55.000]   His reign has been fully established on earth.
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:58.000]   And it's known as a messianic banquet.
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:03.000]   And Jesus, he's making a claim about himself, about his identity.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000]   He's making a claim that he is God with us.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.000]   He's the bright room of that banquet.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   And he's here now.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:21.000]   In the person of Jesus, the kingdom of God has broken into the present moment.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   And so it doesn't make sense for those who are with him to be fasting.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000]   This is a joyous occasion.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   This is actually what John the Baptist's disciples had been fasting for.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   That the Messiah would come.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:39.000]   And so he's saying it doesn't make any sense for the disciples to fast.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:50.000]   But then Jesus continues to respond to the question that was asked.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   He says, the second part of verse 15 says this,
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:02.000]   "The time will come when the bright room will be taken from them, then they will fast."
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   So Jesus is predicting his own death.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   He's predicting that he will go to the cross, that he will die, that he will rise, and that he will ascend to heaven.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:20.000]   And then the disciples will fast during that time period.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000]   Again, it assumes that we will be fasting.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000]   But it changes a little bit the meaning of fasting.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   Because now the disciples are fasting in anticipation of Jesus' second coming.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.000]   When this messianic banquet will be held.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:46.000]   They're longing for God's work, his kingdom work, to be manifested in the present now.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000]   It's a cry for the kingdom when they're fasting.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   They're crying out for God to come and to move and for him to reign and for his will to be established.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000]   For his wholeness to come, for his peace to come.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000]   That's the character of the fasting.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   By fasting they're expressing through the hunger of their bodies,
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   they're longing for moral, spiritual, social, political change in this world.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   For the manifestation of the kingdom of God to break into their present moment.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:30.000]   Because in their present moment there are things that are just not right.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:35.000]   And there is a deep longing in the heart for them to change in their own lives,
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   but also in the lives of the people around us.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:46.000]   Now this type of fasting is nothing else than the second and the third petition of the Lord's Prayer.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000]   It's a cry for the kingdom.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:00.000]   So what is fasting?
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:06.000]   Christian fasting and prayer is the passionate pursuit of the not yet of the kingdom.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.000]   The areas where God's will is not realized yet.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.000]   A longing for the establishment of God's reign in our present moment.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   That's what fasting is.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:23.000]   And when we fast we make ourselves available.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   Like we sang earlier, I will make room for you to do whatever you want to.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.000]   We're humbling ourselves, we're coming before God empty handed.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000]   We say we need you, we desperately need you.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.000]   Our city desperately needs you.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:49.000]   And we ask for you to come and to meet us, to move, to bring change, to transform for redemption.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:58.000]   Fasting is also a prophetic declaration of hope.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:03.000]   That whatever might be going on, whatever our circumstances are,
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   whatever seems like a lost cause, it is not the final word.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   So when we fast we make that prophetic declaration.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   Whatever is going on, whatever the circumstances are, this is not God's final word on the circumstances.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   Because we have hope, because we know Jesus is coming again.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000]   And Jesus is not finished with us yet.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000]   He's not finished with you yet.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000]   He's not finished with Hong Kong yet.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.000]   He is at work.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:46.000]   And he's longing and waiting for people to make themselves available to him.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.000]   To just long for him, to long for his things.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.000]   It's like longing for the kingdom, it's like longing for the works of Jesus.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   That we see Jesus doing the Bible to unfold in people's lives.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000]   That's my longing, that's my heart's cry.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000]   That's what I want to see happen.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000]   But I can't do it out of my own strength.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000]   You cannot do it out of your own strength.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.000]   We cannot do it by our own wisdom, we cannot do it by our own power.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:18.000]   But we can do it by the spirit of the living God moving and working through us, his people.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:23.000]   So that is what fasting is.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:28.000]   It's a cry for the kingdom to come.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:32.000]   And it's us humbling ourselves and making us available to the king of kings.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000]   Saying here I am, use me.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:40.000]   God loves working when we come to him and fasting.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.000]   He loves us, he loves working through his people.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:50.000]   He loves when we humble ourselves and say we need you, we want the things of you.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:54.000]   So that is what fasting is.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000]   Now why do people fast?
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:01.000]   I'm going to give five reasons, there's more but I'll just share five.
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:06.000]   The first one is to release the Holy Spirit's empowering presence in their lives.
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:14.000]   Now you see Jesus, he was baptized, the Holy Spirit came upon him.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:24.000]   And then in Luke chapter 4 verse 1 read, "Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, left the Jordan and was led by the spirit into the wilderness."
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:31.000]   So that in the wilderness he fasted, he only drank water apparently.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:36.000]   And then in the end he was tempted and overcame Satan's temptation.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:42.000]   Now I want you to note that it says he was full of the Holy Spirit.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:52.000]   But then in verse 14, so just right coming out of the fast, read, "Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the spirit."
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:07:08.000]   So there is a shift that Jesus is operating not out of his human strength but in the power of the Holy Spirit because he relied on the Holy Spirit.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:16.000]   And so if we want to move in the power of the Holy Spirit and not out of our own strength, that's one of the reasons why we fast.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:30.000]   Because we want and we desire to move in the spirit and not in the flesh, not in our own strength, by his power.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:35.000]   Because he's the one that really can change things.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:39.000]   He's the one that knows what's best.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:45.000]   And we don't, we have selfishness and things in our heart.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.000]   But if we move by the power of the Spirit, it's amazing.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:55.000]   So we fast to release the Holy Spirit's empowering presence in our lives.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:01.000]   Second, we fast to become untangled from sin and experience victory over our lives.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:05.000]   I'm not going to, I have a lot of passages, I'm not going to read every passage.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.000]   If you want to keep track of this later on, really you can take a photo.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:18.000]   In the Old Testament, there's many times where Israel, it's always like they are living right, righteously right.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:22.000]   Then they sin and they're stuck in their sin of worshipping idols.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:29.000]   And then they are confronted with their sin, they realize their sin.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000]   Sometimes a prophet even calls them, calls them out on it.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.000]   And then they come before God with repentance and fasting.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:42.000]   And God entangles them from their sin and allows them to move forward as a nation,
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000]   allows them to move forward as individuals.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.000]   And that the power of sin is broken in their lives.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:53.000]   And so when we, so fasting and repentance is also linked in Scripture.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:58.000]   So perhaps there's a sin that keeps resurfacing.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.000]   You know, even when we're Christian, there's sins that just don't seem to be going away.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.000]   They keep popping back up in our lives.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:14.000]   And so when we fast, we can also ask God to entangle us and give us victory from sin, over sin.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:23.000]   The third reason we fast is to become more alert and receptive to the Holy Spirit's leadership.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:31.000]   And so an act that we're going to read this passage in a second, the church is gathering in Antioch.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000]   The Christian movement, it's brand new.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.000]   You know, it hasn't existed for very long and it says this.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.000]   While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said,
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.000]   "Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them."
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:51.000]   So after they had fasted and prayed, they placed their hands on them and they sent them off.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:56.000]   And Paul and Barnabas went on to their missionary journeys to plant churches.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:03.000]   But we fast to be more alert and receptive to the Holy Spirit's leadership in our lives.
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:07.000]   You see, a lot of times we have so much noise in our lives.
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:15.000]   Work, family stuff, Instagram, TV, whatever, music, whatever you do.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:20.000]   We do all sorts of stuff, but a lot of times we're not very tuned in to God.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.000]   But when we fast and worship and we carve out the space,
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.000]   we're actually open to what God is doing and we can receive that.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.000]   We can receive words from God and direction from God.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.000]   And so we fast because we need direction from God.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000]   This is why we're fasting as a church.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:42.000]   Because we want to be alert and open to the Holy Spirit's leadership.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000]   We want to hear.
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.000]   We don't want to move out of our own wisdom.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:58.000]   The fourth reason people fast is to seek God's guidance.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:04.000]   A lot of times we find ourselves at crossroads or we need direction
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000]   or there's something difficult to navigate.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:12.000]   Here in this case, Israel had to navigate, had a dangerous journey that they needed to navigate.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:16.000]   So they fast and they pray and they ask God for wisdom.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:21.000]   And God answers their prayer and gets them safely to where they need to go.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.000]   So you pray and fast for God's guidance.
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:31.000]   And then finally, we pray and fast to commune with God.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:35.000]   That is actually the most important thing.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:40.000]   It's to draw deeper in our relationship with God when we fast.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.000]   And just commune with Him, spend time with Him.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.000]   Here in this example, the prophet is Anna.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:53.000]   You know, that's been waiting for the Messiah and it says in Luke 2, verse 37,
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:58.000]   "She never left the temple but worshipped night and day, fasting and praying."
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:03.000]   So she was communing with God.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.000]   She was worshipping and drawing near to God.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.000]   And so our fasting is also a drawing near to God.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000]   Just spend time with God.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000]   Just sit to listen.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000]   It's not us just talking all the time.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000]   It's about a relationship.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:23.000]   You're like, "All of that sounds great. I want all of that in my life.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.000]   How do I do it? How do we do this?"
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000]   And I want to say one thing too.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:35.000]   I don't want to give the impression that this is like fasting makes your wish list magically happen.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.000]   You know, it really is a surrendering and coming before God
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000]   and then He acts and moves how He wants to act and move.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.000]   But He loves us and He's good and He loves giving us good gifts.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000]   Now I just want to make that clear.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000]   But how do we do it?
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:56.000]   So I'm going to have five steps, just simple steps for how you can enter into this fast.
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:00.000]   Later on, after this, we're going to also share a QR code
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.000]   where you can sign up for our WhatsApp communication.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:09.000]   Through that, you'll get actually a guide that captures a little bit of what's on here
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.000]   that you can use to prepare for the fast.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.000]   But let me go through this.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000]   First step is determine your spiritual purpose for the fast.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.000]   You know, ask the Holy Spirit, "What do you want me to fast for?"
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.000]   Actually spend some time praying and asking Him.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.000]   Where do you need God to change? Where are things not right?
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.000]   You need God to act and move in your life.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.000]   Is there an important decision that needs to be made?
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000]   Is there a need for healing?
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:43.000]   Is there a problem that requires a resolution or pattern of sin that needs to be broken?
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:47.000]   What is the Holy Spirit inviting you to personally fast for?
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:52.000]   And it's helpful to do that because then our praying,
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000]   while we're fasting, can be more strategic.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000]   We actually know what we're focusing on.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.000]   So that's for the personal fast.
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:06.000]   For the corporate fast, our focus is to ask the Holy Spirit to prepare us,
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.000]   to equip us, to unite us.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.000]   We really sense it's important for the Holy Spirit to unite us
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:15.000]   between the counties, the English service, and us as a community
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.000]   for us to see if we can move forward into what He has for us together.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:25.000]   To lead us, empower us for the ministry and work that He calls us to do in 2024.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:30.000]   Of just loving and serving the people around us.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.000]   So that is the first step.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000]   First, determine your spiritual purpose for the fast.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:40.000]   The second one is, choose how long you will fast for.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000]   Well, we've chosen it's 21 days.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:47.000]   But if you fast another time, just set a time, start small, build up from there.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.000]   The third step, decide on what you will fast.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000]   What are you going to abstain from?
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:58.000]   Now, biblically, it is always food in the Bible as an example.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000]   And there are different types of fasts.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000]   I'm not going to get into all of them.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.000]   The normal fast, which is you fast food and you just drink water.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.000]   The other one is the Daniel fast, where you eat vegetables, you drink water,
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:14.000]   but you don't have wine, you don't have steak, you don't have your candy,
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000]   your dessert, whatever it is that you like.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000]   So it's very simple.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:26.000]   So we encourage you, if you want to fast food, to keep it real simple.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:31.000]   So whether the Daniel fast or skipping a meal a day.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.000]   Like we don't recommend, especially if you've never fasted before,
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000]   doing a 21 day fast of no food.
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000]   If you want to do that, talk to your doctor first.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:47.000]   Now, for some of us, maybe there's actually some issues around food.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.000]   And that would actually be distracting while we're fasting.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:54.000]   Or maybe the Holy Spirit is leading you to fast something else.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.000]   And so, I have some questions for you to help you discern
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000]   what other things you can fast for.
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.000]   What activities are crowding out your time with prayer and with God?
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:08.000]   What activities are becoming more important to you than God?
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.000]   And what's taking up your time?
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:18.000]   And if we're honest, we do all sorts of things a lot of times,
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000]   but don't spend very much time with God.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.000]   We spend so much time on Instagram, it's like the doom scrolling,
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000]   it's like endless, right?
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:29.000]   Maybe we have different things as different people.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000]   But it's like, what is crowding out your time for God?
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000]   And fast from that.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.000]   And this brings me to the fourth step.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:43.000]   So it might be Instagram, Netflix, sports news, whatever it is for you.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:47.000]   So the fourth step is plan how you will spend your time with God.
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:50.000]   Because fasting is not just abstaining from something,
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000]   it's actually making space for God.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.000]   And this is where I see fasting go wrong.
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:58.000]   Like where a lot of people, for some reason,
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000]   we love like abstaining from something,
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.000]   but then we don't actually spend time with God.
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000]   But if you want to do a Christian fast,
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.000]   it actually involves carving out time with God.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000]   For example, if you skip a meal,
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000]   maybe during that time you spend some time with God,
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:17.000]   reading His Word, worshipping Him, going for a prayer walk,
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000]   just being still and listening,
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000]   whatever it is that you're meditating on a scripture.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:25.000]   But have a plan for how you will spend time with God.
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000]   And I also want to just keep it simple.
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:31.000]   You don't need to break a world record of how long you do this.
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000]   Do something that you can do.
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000]   But have a plan.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:38.000]   And then the final one is be expectant of God.
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.000]   God loves you.
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000]   He is your loving Father.
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:48.000]   And He loves when His children come to Him.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000]   He loves it.
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000]   He loves meeting us.
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000]   He loves speaking to us.
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000]   He loves providing for us.
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000]   And so we can come to Him in faith.
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.000]   We don't have to beg.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.000]   We just ask Him like a child asks a father.
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.000]   We just pour the things that are in our hearts out to Him in that way.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000]   We ask God to move and to provide.
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.000]   So those are the five steps of fasting.
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:17.000]   And as I shared, there's a QR code
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:22.000]   where you can sign up for WhatsApp.
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:26.000]   And can we have the QR code, please?
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.000]   So you can sign up to our WhatsApp community
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:34.000]   and there you will receive those five steps that I just shared about.
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.000]   It's also where you get your 21-day devotional
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000]   that we've created as a church.
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000]   Every day we're going to be sending out one.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:44.000]   Some of your community members have written one.
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:49.000]   You might use that for that time that you're going to spend with God.
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:55.000]   Now I want us to take a step back.
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.000]   I actually want to invite the worship team to come up at this time.
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:05.000]   And I was thinking, what would happen?
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:10.000]   What would happen if we actually all would fast?
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.000]   If we all would humble ourselves
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:19.000]   and seek God at the beginning of this year through worship and prayer?
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000]   What would God do?
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000]   What would He do in our hearts?
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000]   How would He move?
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000]   How would He prepare us?
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:31.000]   And then that picture is at the end of 2024.
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:35.000]   That picture of standing there, looking back,
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.000]   and just falling on our knees in worship.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:43.000]   Because it's so clear that what happened
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.000]   was not something that happened out of our own strength.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000]   It was God's work.
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.000]   That God has worked this year in our lives,
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000]   in our community's lives.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.000]   Because we have come to Him.
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:59.000]   We said, Lord, we desire for You to move.
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000]   Because we cried out for the kingdom,
[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:06.000]   for a manifestation of the kingdom to break into our here and now.
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000]   We said, Lord, we long for that.
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:12.000]   We long for the things that are not right to be said right.
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:16.000]   We long for people to experience healing,
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000]   physical healing, emotional healing.
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:22.000]   We long for people to be brought into the kingdom.
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:25.000]   That they can experience Your love and Your goodness.
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:30.000]   And so I just picture us at the end of the year,
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:34.000]   looking back and knowing that this time fasting,
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000]   this time coming before God,
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000]   God met us and He worked.
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000]   And I want to invite you all to stand.
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:45.000]   And I want to challenge you.
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000]   I want to invite you.
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:51.000]   Like I said, we come from different backgrounds.
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000]   Maybe like, eh, I don't want to fast.
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:56.000]   But I really believe God wants to meet us.
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.000]   He wants to work through this time together.
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.000]   We get to be encouraged because we get to do it together.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000]   You're not doing it on your own.
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000]   And I believe that through this fasting,
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:10.000]   we're going to be able to step in a different way into this year.
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:13.000]   We're not going to be operating out of our own power,
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000]   but through the power of the Holy Spirit.
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000]   So I would love to pray for you.
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:20.000]   And I want to invite you to stretch out your hands before you,
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:23.000]   just to symbolize just wanting to receive from God.
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:29.000]   So Jesus, we thank you so much that you love us.
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:33.000]   We thank you that we can come to you in prayer and in fasting.
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:37.000]   That you love when we commune with you.
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:41.000]   And I ask that you would take us deeper into our relationship with you.
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000]   That we would experience this year you in a new way
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000]   that we have not experienced you before.
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:51.000]   I pray that we, there would be a move of the spirit among us.
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:56.000]   We do something special, something beautiful, something fresh.
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:00.000]   I pray for personal breakthroughs, Lord.
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.000]   There's stuff where we need you to act now in our own lives.
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.000]   I pray that you would move in people's lives,
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.000]   that you would experience you like they have not experienced you before.
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:14.000]   Most of all, Lord, we just want to honor you.
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.000]   We just want to do this as I worship to you and say,
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:22.000]   we love you and we long for the things that you long for.
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:27.000]   So will you work and move as we come to you in our fasting and prayer.
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:30.000]   I pray all of us in your name, Jesus. Amen.
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000]   I pray all of us in your name, Jesus. Amen.
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:50.000]   [Music]
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000]   Let's sing this.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:23:22.000]   [Music]
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000]   Once again, here's where I lay it down.
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:54.000]   [Music]
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000]   I surrender.
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:05.000]   And I will make room for you.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:10.000]   To do whatever you want to.
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:14.000]   To do whatever you want to.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:21.000]   And I will make room for you.
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:26.000]   To do whatever you want to.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:30.000]   To do whatever you want to.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:37.000]   And I will make room for you.
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:41.000]   To do whatever you want to.
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.000]   To do whatever you want to.
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:52.000]   And I will make room for you.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:56.000]   To do whatever you want to.
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:02.000]   To do whatever you want to.
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:06.000]   So here is where I laid it down.
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:10.000]   Every burden, every crown.
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.000]   This is my surrender.
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:17.000]   This is my surrender.
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:21.000]   Here is where I lay it down.
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:25.000]   Every lie and every doubt.
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:30.000]   This is my surrender.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:36.000]   And I will make room for you.
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:41.000]   To do whatever you want to.
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:45.000]   To do whatever you want to.

[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:17.000]   In some pattern that we were stuck in.
