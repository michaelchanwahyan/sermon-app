1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,220
 Father speak to us we pray amen amen thank you Justin and good morning if

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:10,140
 you're joining a line good morning to you too on it as always to be here and

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,560
 like Justin said we are wrapping up our Ephesians series today it's been a great

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:20,420
 journey through this book and I'm glad to be finishing off today so something I

5
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:24,040
 mean my my colleagues at the vine here know this very well people who know me

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,840
 know this quite well I'm in general I'm not a very serious person okay I mean

7
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,440
 like I'm serious about God's Word but my general demeanor is why you people are

8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,600
 it's like Justin's you're not surprised okay like I like you know I like to play

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,840
 jokes I like to play pranks around the office you know there's a little bit of

10
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,920
 a reputation about the guy who like plays the practical jokes and people and

11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,920
 all that kind of stuff the most often victim of these sort of sneak attacks

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,040
 with these practical jokes of course my wife okay so sometimes these strokes

13
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,240
 work well sometimes not so well okay this was one that works well okay take

14
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:04,840
 notes okay so um you turn on the shower okay you draw the curtain and so you

15
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,600
 know she thinks I'm in the shower okay the shower is going shh and then I call

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,120
 out but I actually I'm not in the shower I'm hiding under the sink okay so hey

17
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,200
 honey could you pass my toothbrush okay so she goes into the shower you know

18
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,480
 she's hey okay here's your toothbrush here you go here you go but no one's

19
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,440
 responding because there's no one behind there right so um she opens curtain no

20
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,080
 one says like what's happening and then right at that moment under the sink I

21
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:33,840
 grab her by the ankle ah okay and she screams okay that's a good one okay

22
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,840
 often it works okay sometimes however these jokes don't work so well okay I

23
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,920
 can was taking notes okay one time I saw my way we were out separately and we

24
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,400
 just happened my wife and I Brittany and I were coming home at the same time and

25
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,840
 so I thought a perfect opportunity I'm gonna play a prank on her and so you

26
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,520
 know with stealth like movements I went ahead of her and I hid behind you know

27
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,720
 sometimes you get one of those electrical boxes that sit on the side of

28
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,100
 the street so I hid behind one of those electrical boxes hoping that when she

29
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,120
 would walk past I would jump out and scare her and you'd be you know really

30
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,960
 funny okay problem was I was just focusing on like watching where she was

31
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,280
 going and not anything else around me right what I didn't notice was this

32
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,560
 light box was next to the bike path okay and so I was hiding behind she was

33
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,240
 walking past but as she was walking past and I jumped I was like boo and try to

34
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:33,320
 scare her a biker on his bike was coming full speed down and he hit me okay and

35
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:38,280
 so I go flying back onto the path my shoes fly off you know everything's

36
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,960
 crazy this guy is so understandably so angry he's like what are you doing you

37
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,480
 know starts asking about my mother all this kind of stuff okay I'm just like oh

38
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,920
 sorry I don't even know okay meanwhile okay Britney is there she's seen the

39
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,720
 whole thing apparently she saw me hide behind the light box like what's this

40
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,400
 person doing okay and then she saw me jump out get scared okay in the end I

41
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,360
 ended up with a fracture wrist and a trip to the ER right so yeah moral the

42
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,560
 story right do better when you're trying to scare your wife all right now I know

43
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,160
 that this is just a silly story but I want to illustrate something maybe you

44
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:20,400
 can think about this way as you go about life does it ever feel like you're under

45
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,480
 attack as you go about life does you ever feel like like there's something or

46
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:31,720
 someone out there who's trying to get you I mean what if I told you right now

47
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,200
 in this very moment we're actually in the middle of a battle that's being

48
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,640
 fought right it's just that you can't see what's happening all the time it's

49
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,520
 not something you can always see with your eyes or feel with your senses I'm

50
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,000
 not talking about tinfoil conspiracy theories or anything like that okay what

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,680
 we're talking about today is spiritual warfare let me lay a little bit of a

52
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,640
 definition before we go any further right throughout the Bible and throughout

53
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,680
 history right there is this belief and it's a biblical teaching as well that

54
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,280
 there is a spiritual realm right scholars sometimes call this an unseen

55
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,360
 realm right it exists side by side by this physical world this realm that

56
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,320
 we're living in right now and so the Bible teaches us they are spiritual

57
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,440
 beings right these beings were created by God just like human beings were

58
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,480
 they've been there since the beginning of this world and God created this these

59
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:36,640
 spiritual beings in order to help him rule the world that you know not it's a

60
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,040
 sort of an illustration of this could be you can picture God as like a CEO it's

61
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,960
 not the best example but you know he is a CEO he's the big boss okay and he has

62
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:50,800
 his staff team okay a council of these divine beings that were created to help

63
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:58,920
 him in his rule of the world however just like human beings rebelled his

64
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:04,040
 children wanted to be God instead of be God's children in the same way these

65
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,280
 spiritual beings also rebelled against God some of these beings also rebelled

66
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:13,760
 against God and instead of them enticing and turning and encouraging people to

67
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:20,800
 worship God they started to get people to worship them instead right and they

68
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,640
 crossed many boundaries get Genesis 6 - tells us it's the sons of God referring

69
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,480
 to these spiritual beings so that the daughters of humankind were beautiful

70
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:35,360
 thus they took wise for themselves from any they chose right this is the Bible

71
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,400
 teaching us how rebellious these beings have become they came down to earth right

72
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,680
 and had relations with humans all right it's kind of weird but it's in the Bible

73
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,880
 it's there right another example in the book of Job Job gives a really clear

74
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:55,400
 story a really clear picture about these rebellious spiritual beings having some

75
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,040
 sort of influence and power and authority on this earth right now the day

76
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,800
 came Job 1 when the sons of God again okay came to present themselves before

77
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,480
 the Lord and Satan also arrived among them the Lord said to Satan where have

78
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:15,040
 you come from and Satan answered the Lord from roving about on the earth and

79
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:20,360
 walking back and forth across it and as you know in the book of Job in the story

80
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:25,200
 of Job there's a season in Job's life right chaos and ruin permitted by God

81
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:30,920
 but all orchestrated by the enemy we could talk about this stuff forever if

82
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,760
 you want to talk more of it I love talking about this stuff okay take me out

83
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,000
 for a coffee and then we can talk more about it okay but the point I'm trying

84
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:45,080
 to make is this is that yes there really are dark and evil forces in this world

85
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:51,600
 and they are trying to do everything they can to sabotage to distract and to

86
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:57,760
 destroy your relationship with Jesus the enemy out there is out there and he is

87
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:04,440
 not a friend and I think this is especially relevant for the people in

88
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,080
 Ephesians of course but like the Ephesian city Hong Kong right is the

89
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:15,320
 city full of opportunity to turn to other spiritual sources for guidance

90
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:20,940
 right from things like Feng Shui to fortune tellers to the da si and the

91
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,520
 hitting small people down the road okay visiting temples to spin the wheel

92
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,840
 playing with Ouija boards all these are examples of how the enemy tries to

93
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:35,480
 capture our attention and so as followers of Jesus in this culture in

94
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:40,640
 this city we have to be very very careful because when we see these things

95
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,240
 it's not just a little bit of harmless fun like it's not harmless just to go to

96
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,800
 a fortune teller and so oh I'm interested in my love life can you tell

97
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,920
 me a little bit about that okay it's not okay it's not okay just to invite a

98
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,840
 Feng Shui master to come to your office and you know give you some tips on where

99
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,560
 you should put the fish tank and the tank and you should do this with the

100
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,720
 windows all that kind of stuff okay it's not okay because these practices are

101
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:12,600
 clearly not from God which means that the source of power is from a dark and

102
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:21,200
 evil place therefore as Christians as followers of Jesus right we should have

103
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,320
 nothing to do with these practices because like I said just now there's a

104
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:30,160
 fight happening between the forces of good and evil in these unseen realms

105
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,800
 unseen to us but definitely can have effect on our lives and even our souls

106
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:41,800
 and so this is why what we're talking about today is important in fact the

107
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:47,560
 whole letter of Ephesians Paul has been preparing his readers for this moment

108
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,520
 throughout the letter Paul has called them has encouraged them to challenge

109
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,600
 them in the way they live their lives right to be countercultural to live in a

110
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:02,160
 way that reflects the fact that we are followers of Jesus to live in a way that

111
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:08,520
 puts the power of God at work in display right a power so strong Paul says it's

112
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:13,800
 able to do more than we can ever ask or imagine right this is the power that we

113
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:19,360
 carry as followers of Jesus and as followers of Jesus everybody is invited

114
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,640
 into this community so another thing Paul reminds us off we've been called to

115
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:30,360
 live in radical unity doesn't matter who you are slave free Greek Jew doesn't

116
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,440
 matter man male female everyone has been called into this community to live in

117
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,400
 radical unity serving each other submitting to each other working with

118
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:46,240
 each other for the glory of God Paul also reminds us that we have been brought

119
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,760
 out of the darkness into the light that we were once dead but now we are alive

120
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:57,760
 in the love of Christ and because of this everything we do should be done in

121
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:04,680
 the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and so what here is what Paul's saying here's

122
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,840
 what scripture is saying if we're really gonna live like this if we take these

123
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,320
 words seriously if we're going to take this series I've been walking through

124
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,960
 and apply it to our lives then you best believe we're going to expect some

125
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:24,960
 opposition from the enemy because the enemy will attack and when he does if

126
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,660
 we're not ready if we're not equipped to take a stand and to fight back in some

127
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:36,000
 way we'll be in trouble but here's the other thing and this is the encouraging

128
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,940
 part we don't need to freak out and be super scared about this because as we're

129
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:46,720
 about to find out God has given us everything we need not only to withstand

130
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,400
 against enemy but to fight back against his schemes listen to these ending words

131
00:10:52,400 --> 00:11:00,060
 of this letter Ephesians 6 10 finally be strong in the Lord and in his mighty

132
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:05,500
 power put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the

133
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:10,580
 devil schemes for our struggle is not against flesh and blood but against the

134
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:14,260
 rulers against the authorities against the powers of this dark world and

135
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:19,980
 against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms therefore put on the

136
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,620
 full armor of God so that when the day of evil comes you may be able to stand

137
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:29,940
 your ground and after you have done everything to stand stand firm then with

138
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,100
 the belt of truth buckled around your waist with a breastplate of breastplate

139
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,740
 of righteousness in place and with your feet fitted with the readiness that

140
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:42,540
 comes from the gospel of peace in addition to all this take up the shield

141
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:47,640
 of faith with you with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the

142
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:52,100
 evil one take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit which is the

143
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:57,380
 Word of God and pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers

144
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:02,820
 and requests with this in mind be alert and always keep on praying for all the

145
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:07,900
 Lord's people pray also for me that whenever I speak words may be given to

146
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:12,260
 me so that I will fiercely fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel for

147
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:17,700
 which I am an ambassador in chains pray that I might declare it fiercely as I

148
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:24,220
 should it's a beautiful passage it's well known it's descriptive but it's

149
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,820
 also super practical so we're going to walk through this together hand in hand

150
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:35,500
 okay and see how it quips us for this battle we have ahead well Paul starts

151
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:41,780
 with this it starts with telling us to be strengthened it starts with strength

152
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:49,020
 whatever battle you're fighting in it's always going to require strength but

153
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:53,500
 notice here the strength the source of this strength where's the strength coming

154
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:58,620
 from this is not a strength we must up in ourselves right Paul is calling us to

155
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:06,820
 be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power our own efforts will only ever get

156
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:12,140
 us so far in this battle if we want to prevail if we want to stand firm we have

157
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:19,020
 to know what it means to be strong and live in his power in God's power right

158
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,340
 this the Psalmist refers to this all the time as you read to the Psalm time and

159
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:28,780
 time again right my refuge is the Lord God is the strength of my heart Jesus

160
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:33,220
 reminds his followers of this before he dies he told us disciples without me you

161
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:40,540
 can do nothing so church let us ask ourselves this morning what is the

162
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:46,420
 source of your strength it's easy to rely on all sorts of other kind of

163
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:51,020
 things right some of us are pretty physically fit and strong that's great

164
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:55,340
 right some of us are super smart you know we have we have the brains and

165
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,860
 that's really good some of us have resources and money and all that kind of

166
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:03,380
 stuff that's a source of strength but all of these earthly sources will never

167
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:08,820
 be enough in this battle because that it says our battle is not against flesh and

168
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:15,500
 blood so the first step of today the first thing we need to do is as we fight

169
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:21,420
 this battle together is to find your strength in the Lord and his mighty

170
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:29,700
 power and how do we do that what the strength in the Lord look like well

171
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:35,300
 actually I think that answer is quite simple strength in the Lord is total

172
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:44,740
 surrender to him to do what he says to be obedient to God strengthen the Lord

173
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:50,300
 is what Paul reminds us of early in chapter 3 to live as Christ is dwelling

174
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:57,300
 in our hearts through faith surrendering to the Lord walking in obedience with

175
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:04,380
 him that's where we find our strength so after we've been strengthened we are

176
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:09,380
 empowered by the Lord's strength then we're instructed to put on the full

177
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:14,500
 armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's evil schemes

178
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,500
 for our struggle is not against flesh and blood but against the rulers and

179
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,620
 authorities the dark powers of this world and against the spiritual forces

180
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:29,100
 of evil in the heavenly realms put on so this is actually action we have to take

181
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,260
 now to put on right it's not just a display piece in the museum for you to

182
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:37,460
 admire and to look at you actually have to put this on again time and time

183
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:41,300
 throughout the book of Ephesians Paul is encouraging us to put things on right to

184
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,460
 take off the old self to put on the new self now we're being encouraged to put

185
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:52,460
 on the armor of God and in a battle you're going to need armor but notice

186
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:56,860
 again the source of this armor it's the armor of God not your own armor not your

187
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:03,780
 own ideas we put on these things because the source of them is from God and we

188
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:13,500
 put it on so we can take a stand against the devil schemes just as Jesus has good

189
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:19,380
 plans for your life for you to have life and life in the full to live a life free

190
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:26,100
 from the chains of sin the enemy also has schemes for your life too and when

191
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,580
 it comes to talking about the enemy schemes I think it can go a few ways

192
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:38,140
 right one idea one perspective of this is that we refuse to believe that these

193
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:42,100
 things are actually happening right we find it too weird maybe even sitting

194
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,460
 here right now say this is weird Ellison I brought a friend today you're talking

195
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:49,980
 about this woo-woo stuff okay like focus on something else okay so we just ignore

196
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:56,060
 it right we don't want to talk about it it's weird and we ignore it sometimes

197
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:01,300
 though we might trivialize it right this is sort of picturing the devil as you

198
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:05,500
 know a man in a red spandex suit with a dodgy mustache holding a pitchfork you

199
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,820
 know it's like kind of looks kind of comical and yeah you know the mentality

200
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,180
 is that yeah it might be some weird stuff like that out there but you know

201
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:18,020
 it's no one takes it that seriously it's just a bit of fun you know in fact you

202
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:23,140
 know it might even be interesting to see what happens there sometimes right so

203
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:29,060
 there's that perspective maybe some of us though live in constant fear of the

204
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:34,780
 enemy's attack right and so everything we do we interpret it through the lens

205
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:38,340
 of it's a spiritual attack on me everything that happens anything bad

206
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:42,020
 that happens it's a spiritual attack on me like I said that I would talk about

207
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:48,740
 this a bit more in a minute right and so um you know we ends up being trapped in

208
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:53,100
 fear about the enemy's attack around every corner is a devil waiting to

209
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:59,380
 attack me and then maybe there's some of us who have really crossed that line who

210
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:03,580
 have shown too much of an interest and actually been drawn into the powers of

211
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:08,780
 this dark and evil world and we found ourself in some really really dark and

212
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:17,060
 scary and evil places all these though have one thing in common what the scheme

213
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:22,940
 of the enemy is trying to do is to keep your eyes off of Jesus to keep you in

214
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:28,660
 the dark to feed you lies to stop your worry and your anxiety in your life and

215
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:35,500
 I think one of the most popular thing he does is that the enemy loves to make

216
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:42,540
 evil look attractive the enemy loves to think that sin and living outside of

217
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:47,100
 God's will disobedience is something that we can just control for ourselves

218
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,980
 right sin is like this a little pet like a little thing we can play with when we

219
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:54,100
 get bored of it we can put it away but you know it's it's harmless I'm just

220
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:59,500
 gonna you know hang out with this thing for a little bit but this is always how

221
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:04,940
 it starts and this quote I got in my research for this message you know

222
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:10,940
 illustrates it so well it says this evil rarely looks evil until it accomplishes

223
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:16,860
 its goal it gains entrance by appearing attractive desirable and perfectly

224
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:24,500
 legitimate but it is a baited and camouflage trap let's be wise Church

225
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:29,940
 let's not be fools one Peter 5 8 tells us the enemy the devil prowls around

226
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:37,380
 like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour and sin and disobedience will

227
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:45,140
 absolutely destroy your lives now and even for all eternity but this is why we

228
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:50,700
 call it a battle right life as a Christian is a struggle because even

229
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,100
 though when we're aware these things that there's evil out there there is a

230
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:59,260
 draw to it right this is the port the word Paul uses for struggle here it's

231
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:02,820
 actually the word the same word for like a physical wrestling match right

232
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,940
 wrestling was one of the popular sports in the back in the day right like a

233
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,500
 jujitsu thing they're doing you know it feels like that sometimes right when

234
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,100
 you're wrestling against sin someone's trying to get your back trying to twist

235
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:17,780
 your arm trying to choke you out maybe it's a bit like this in more practical

236
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:22,740
 ways when temptation comes up lots of different examples of this but for

237
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,620
 example one thing that I find myself wrestling sometimes right late at night

238
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:31,900
 you're tired everyone's asleep and it's finally time for yourself you're trying

239
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:36,700
 to settle down what are things some things that pop up to mind in that

240
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:43,060
 moment oh you feel tired you know you've you've had a long day turn to this

241
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:50,580
 go on to that website have that extra drink that you don't need maybe it's

242
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:56,140
 drugs maybe it's gambling maybe it's an out-of-control shopping habit something

243
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:02,700
 like that and in those moments if you do not have on the armor of God if you are

244
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:09,980
 not strong in the Lord the enemy will get the better of you which is why Paul

245
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:17,580
 says and put on the full armor of God so that when that day of evil comes when

246
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:22,740
 those moments come you may be able to stand your ground and after you've done

247
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:29,420
 everything to stand it's like me trying to play a prank on Brittany right always

248
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,860
 trying to figure her out always trying to trick her scare her in the same way

249
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:37,940
 the enemy is trying to do the same thing to us which is why we've been encouraged

250
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:44,860
 to stand our ground stand firm wearing the full armor of God this is how we

251
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:50,700
 fight back against the enemy and his schemes the enemy is strong he has

252
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:57,980
 influence he has power but it's limited it's limited and with this arm of God we

253
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:03,940
 can stand firm against his schemes so which is why again he says stand firm

254
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:08,620
 with a belt of truth buckled around your waist the breastplate of righteousness

255
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:12,740
 is in place feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel the

256
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:16,580
 shield of faith to extinguish the flaming arrows of the evil one the

257
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:22,020
 helmet of salvation and a sword of the Spirit which is the Word of God so

258
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:25,340
 there's a number of components right it's different things that we have been

259
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:30,280
 called to put on that help us in this battle against the enemy so let's see

260
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:35,620
 how all these parts fit together. First it says this the belt of

261
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:41,060
 truth buckled around your waist now as you're talking about this imagine

262
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:44,060
 like a Roman soldier standing there right in terms in the context of a

263
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:48,340
 soldier right the belt would have been the thing that keeps all the rest of the

264
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:52,140
 pieces together right holds everything down so the soldier can be ready for

265
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:58,140
 action the belt of truth around the waist now maybe some of us don't want us

266
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:02,100
 to see the truth around our waist okay hips don't lie you know what I mean all

267
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:10,940
 right but okay as believers of Jesus as believers of Jesus we know the truth now

268
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:16,540
 the enemy his schemes right he hates the truth John 844 tells us that the enemy

269
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:24,020
 is a liar and the father of lies the enemy hates the truth but this is why we

270
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:29,260
 have to say it even more clearly so let me remind us Church of the truth the

271
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:34,660
 truth is that Jesus loves you and he died for your sins the truth is he is

272
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:39,740
 alive and resurrected the truth that he has called you to live a life that

273
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:45,460
 reflects and shows his love to those around us the truth is even though

274
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:50,620
 there are these other spiritual beings there is only one true all-powerful

275
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:59,860
 almighty God and the truth is the war has already been won Jesus over on this

276
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:03,660
 earth is progressing and advancing against these unseen powers of darkness

277
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:08,660
 and the kingdom of God has a very clear goal and it will reach this goal the

278
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:12,620
 reclamation of all peoples and all nations the full restoration of God's

279
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:19,220
 creation to how he originally created it to be this day is coming that is the

280
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:24,660
 truth Church and the truth doesn't change so Church do you have this belt

281
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:29,940
 of truth buckled around you does the truth of who Jesus is and what he has

282
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:36,260
 done for you and all humanity hold your life together wrap this truth around

283
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:43,620
 yourself tightly buckle up because without it everything will fall apart

284
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:49,620
 then it talks about the breastplate of righteousness now the breastplate is the

285
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:55,860
 largest piece of the Roman soldiers armor right protects the vital organs

286
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:59,340
 the heart the lungs all that kind of stuff right but because the breastplate

287
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:03,420
 is the biggest it's the most obvious part right it's the part that everyone

288
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:09,020
 can see it's the most prominent thing and so in in our context and what we're

289
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:14,940
 talking about here for us this means God has called us to proudly display the

290
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:22,420
 fact that we are followers of Jesus that we are children of the light that we

291
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:29,700
 walk in righteousness now the opposite of righteousness is wickedness and the

292
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:34,580
 enemy that's what he delights in in wickedness scripture tells us that the

293
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:41,260
 enemy is an oppressor the enemy is the orchestrator of injustice the enemy

294
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:46,860
 would like to see us do unrighteous things unholy things to each other then

295
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:52,660
 the enemy wants us to abuse and to take advantage of each other that's wickedness

296
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:57,100
 that's how the enemy's schemes work but when we put on the breastplate of

297
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:02,980
 righteousness it means that we are in right standing with God which also means

298
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:11,180
 we are living out God's justice in his battle against evil so church put on

299
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:16,300
 this breastplate of righteousness we are called to live a life that reflects God's

300
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:21,940
 heart for the weak and the oppressed we are called to speak out and do something

301
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:27,500
 when a situation doesn't fit in to what God's heart is we are called to act

302
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:36,060
 justly just as God is just and righteous so we put on this breastplate so we can

303
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:41,660
 be the people of God that he has called us to be people who walk alongside the

304
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:46,860
 weak and the oppressed who look after the widows and the orphans a voice of

305
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:52,940
 justice in a world that's unjust a people who are unashamedly living for

306
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:57,900
 the gospel proudly declaring who they are put on this breastplate of

307
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:05,460
 righteousness and wear it proudly church then it tells us the feet fitted with

308
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:11,420
 the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace so much of a soldier's life

309
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:15,380
 right you would can imagine is either spent spent standing firm standing in

310
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:20,620
 one place keeping God or requiring them to march forward and move to a different

311
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:26,420
 place both require strong steady shoes and time and time again you have heard

312
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:33,620
 it repeated the call has been to stand firm stand firm to be unmoved you see

313
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:39,980
 the enemy doesn't want us to stand firm the enemy must make us change our minds

314
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:43,300
 that's another one of his schemes especially in his relate in our

315
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:49,540
 relationship with Jesus the enemy knows that a double-minded person is unstable

316
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:57,060
 in all that they do James 1 8 tells us that and so what he wants to do he likes

317
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:02,500
 nothing more than to make a second guess Jesus love for us his plans for us to

318
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:07,980
 get us to doubt what God has already told us in other words to disrupt the

319
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:13,780
 peace that you feel when you have the Word of God when you have Jesus living

320
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:20,220
 with you and in you that comes from following the Lord you feel like you can

321
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:25,620
 relate to this have you ever felt yourself doubting the goodness of God

322
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:29,100
 right at the beginning that was his scheme right he said to Eve did God

323
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:34,940
 really say this trying to get her to change her mind do you ever find

324
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:38,740
 yourself living one way in certain situations or living another life in

325
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:44,260
 another situation big part of my testimony growing up that I struggled

326
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:48,300
 that so much I felt like you know with my school friends and in one context I

327
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:52,220
 was this person but in another context I was the good church boy and you know it

328
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:56,740
 was so hard trying to navigate my life between the two identities that I seem

329
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:04,500
 to carry at that time do you ever hear the enemy make you doubt if God really

330
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:12,020
 has given you the peace he has promised you we need to fit our feet in the

331
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:17,340
 gospel because the gospel is the only thing that gives us a firm foundation to

332
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:23,100
 stand on to build our lives upon Jesus said this before he left earth peace I

333
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:28,100
 leave with you my peace I give to you not as the world gives do I give to you

334
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:36,140
 let not your hearts be troubled neither let them be afraid so we fit our feet

335
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:39,620
 with the gospel so that we can have a firm place to stand and to build our

336
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:45,620
 life but here's the other thing at the same time knowing the gospel also allows

337
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:51,780
 us to bring this peace to areas that of conflict to areas that need it we have

338
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:56,620
 been called to stand firm yes but sometimes offense is the best version of

339
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:01,780
 defense and when we see there's a place that needs the gospel when we see our

340
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:07,660
 family and our friends when we see areas of this society that needs peace then we

341
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:12,580
 are called to carry it there and when that moment comes for you to carry the

342
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:17,540
 gospel to live out the Gospels to speak the gospel we also need to be ready for

343
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:22,300
 those moments whenever it put opportunity presents itself whenever

344
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:27,420
 God calls you will you be able to respond like Isaiah and say Lord here I

345
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:35,900
 am send me so we put on the gospel we fit our feet with the gospel of peace so

346
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:41,260
 that we cannot just stand firm but also bring the gospel to those places that

347
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:47,740
 need it then it says we need to take up the shield of faith with you with which

348
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:52,780
 you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one so the shields

349
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:56,380
 were Roman soldier were probably about like four feet high about as wide as a

350
00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:00,580
 body a cover-up most of the upper body they were important because one of the

351
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:05,300
 most common methods of attack back then was to dip arrows in tar and light it

352
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,780
 you know you've probably seen it in the movies right these flaming arrows

353
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:12,300
 literally flaming arrows that come and so like with the sword you can with the

354
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:19,020
 shield you can block the enemy's attacks the shields will have a special covering

355
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:23,620
 on the top like a leather so the shield itself wouldn't sort of burn up as well

356
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:30,140
 Google it I don't know for us so this is what's important okay the shield of

357
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:39,060
 faith talks about our faith and our loyalty to Jesus no matter what the

358
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:43,740
 enemy is a master archer and like we said he fires he all things kind of

359
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:50,220
 schemes his arrows he fires at us are things like doubt things like fear

360
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:57,180
 selfishness impurity lust greed adverse circumstances pride self-confidence

361
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:02,860
 persecution false teaching all these things the list could go on these arrows

362
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:07,620
 are there to make us doubt what we believe in his arrows are designed to

363
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:16,460
 try and burn down our faith but the shield reminds us that we walk by faith

364
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:22,660
 and not by sight so even as the enemy fires these arrows we put up our faith

365
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:28,780
 we put up our loyalty to Jesus and they will be extinguished even when we do not

366
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:33,180
 fully see or understand what is happening faith is acknowledging that

367
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:38,340
 God's ways are higher than our ways and in this battle we cannot defer we

368
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:45,260
 cannot jump ship we have to stay loyal to Jesus one of the most amazing

369
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:49,140
 displays of faith and loyalty I think in scripture is through the story of

370
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:55,060
 Daniel's friends Shadrach Meshach and Abednego in the book of Daniel here they

371
00:32:55,060 --> 00:33:00,660
 are facing the fiery furnace and these are their words if we are thrown into

372
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:06,100
 the blazing furnace the God we serve is able to deliver us from it and he will

373
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:13,380
 deliver us that's the faith but even if he does not we want you to know your

374
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:17,180
 majesty that we will not serve your God's or worship the image of gold you

375
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:25,140
 have set up that's the loyalty so church we have been called to hold on tight to

376
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:33,140
 the shield of faith and to loyally follow Jesus into battle extinguishing

377
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:41,100
 all the flaming arrows of the enemy then it tells us about the helmet of salvation

378
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:45,020
 right for the soldier the helmet covers another important part of the body the

379
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:49,580
 head and the helmet was also sometimes a way of determining the position and the

380
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:56,460
 rank of the soldier these plumes on the top of the helmet and so for us this

381
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:04,740
 helmet speaks to our identity it's knowing who you belong to as you battle

382
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:11,620
 as you take your stand know that you are fighting for King Jesus that as brothers

383
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:17,280
 and sisters as people of Christ we are part of the Lord's army and with the

384
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,860
 helmet of salvation on what that does it's that reminds us that we have

385
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:27,100
 already been saved this is one of the most important things to hold on to all

386
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:31,060
 these things that the enemy is trying to do ultimately they're not going to

387
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:35,260
 change the outcome right we said this just now Jesus is already victorious

388
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:41,260
 he's doing everything he can to try and to try and distract us from this fact

389
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:46,900
 but through his death and resurrection Jesus has already won he has already

390
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:52,660
 overcome sin and death and the enemy is not attacking from a place of strength

391
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:59,460
 but from a place of already having been defeated where we have to write realize

392
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:05,500
 this the enemy is a desperate loser in this time he might have some influence

393
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:11,380
 on earth but his fate has already been sealed and when Jesus returns when the

394
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:15,700
 new heaven and the new earth comes hit enemy and all his deeds and all these

395
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:20,660
 all these other spiritual forces these evil spiritual forces will be destroyed

396
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:27,260
 once and for all and the helmet reply reminds us that salvation and victory

397
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:35,900
 belongs to our God we are on the winning side and so yes we might get wounded we

398
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:40,820
 might get hurt like following Jesus and doing spiritual battle against the enemy

399
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:47,180
 is not going to be a breeze it's not going to be smooth sailing let's not

400
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:50,940
 forget there are people out there other Christians in parts of the world who are

401
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:56,220
 literally being persecuted literally risking their lives for the sake of the

402
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:03,740
 gospel but even in that situation the helmet of salvation reminds us even if

403
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:10,700
 we were to lose everything on this earth everything we are still victorious

404
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:20,300
 because God has already won the ultimate battle so church we put on our helmet be

405
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:25,980
 brave be strong and courageous as scripture has called us to take risks

406
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:34,580
 for Jesus go all out and live for him because he has already saved you and

407
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:41,420
 finally we get the sword of the Spirit which is the Word of God the sword is

408
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:45,820
 the one weapon of offense the soldier carries right a short little dagger like

409
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:52,220
 thing used for close-handed combat for us though when it speaks of the sword

410
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:58,260
 this speaks to the power of God's Word and we remind ourselves scriptures

411
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:04,860
 reminding us that the Word of God is alive and active throughout scripture

412
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:09,460
 again you see right whenever the Word of God is heard whenever God speaks there

413
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:17,780
 is power in it things happen when God speaks situations change therefore

414
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:22,420
 knowing God's Word is one of the key ways we not only stand firm against the

415
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:27,780
 enemy but what the only weapon you have in this battle against the enemy is the

416
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:34,140
 sword of his word the sword of the Spirit Jesus himself is a great example

417
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:38,420
 of this when Jesus is tested in the wilderness when the enemy tempts him

418
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:42,540
 with lies when the enemy fires his darts at him right he he stays loyal he does

419
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:48,820
 all that stuff but then he also fights back with scripture with God's Word in

420
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:54,060
 the same way then church we today need to have a relationship and a good

421
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:59,140
 understanding of the Word of God to withstand the enemy and to fight back

422
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:06,860
 against his schemes so let's cherish God's Word Church read it meditate on it

423
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:13,460
 cherish it memorize it study it together listen to it because this is our only

424
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:21,620
 weapon in this fight against the enemy but be encouraged also that God still

425
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:25,740
 speaks today yes through his word but though one of the key ways God speaks

426
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:31,540
 today is through the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit therefore also fights back

427
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:35,660
 against the enemy when we're attacked since this battle is not against flesh

428
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:40,820
 and blood our weapon is also not against flesh and our weapons also not physical

429
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:49,660
 weapons we too now then we study God's Word and we follow the Holy Spirit and

430
00:38:49,660 --> 00:39:00,780
 allow him to move in power whenever he speaks now finally it's this you see

431
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:04,740
 we're not just individual soldiers fighting these battle these little

432
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:11,980
 squirmishes on our own Paul brings everything together in the central idea

433
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:20,180
 of prayer prayers the final thing that completes the armor of God this is why

434
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:25,300
 Paul signs up this letter by saying and pray in the spirit in all occasions with

435
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:29,940
 all kinds of prayers and regret and requests with this in mind be alert and

436
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:36,100
 always keep on praying for all the Lord's people pray also for me that

437
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:40,120
 whenever I speak words may be given me so that I will fiercely make known the

438
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:43,900
 mystery of the gospel for which I am ambassador in chains pray that I might

439
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:49,460
 declare it fears fearlessly as I should

440
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:55,500
 pause writing to a community to a group of people and he's asking them to pray

441
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,980
 together always pray don't stop praying he says this in other parts of his

442
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:04,100
 letter pray in all occasions keep on praying for God's people keep on praying

443
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:10,940
 for each other and pray also for me see it's a sobering end to this letter

444
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:14,900
 because we're reminded as Paul is writing this letter he's not actually

445
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:19,580
 writing from a from a place of confidence he is in prison he is

446
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:25,020
 actually being held captive and in chains in some commentaries you read as

447
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:28,740
 he's writing this there was probably a literal Roman soldier standing there

448
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:34,100
 keeping a guard of him but notice what he says he doesn't pray or pray for my

449
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:39,020
 release pray for pray for justice to be done pray that I would walk free that's

450
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:44,100
 the probably kind of stuff I would be asking people to pray for but he gets it

451
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:49,140
 in this battle he doesn't say pray that I would be released he says pray for my

452
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:55,100
 wisdom pray for my courage pray that I would know what to say in every single

453
00:40:55,100 --> 00:41:01,380
 situation for the sake of Jesus you see this is what it looks like then to stand

454
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:06,100
 firm and to fight back against the schemes on the enemy this is what it

455
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:10,740
 looks like when no weapons formed against you prosper because no matter

456
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:18,660
 what situation you're in you are strong in the Lord so we pray together as a

457
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:24,340
 community when things come up we join together in prayer and walk alongside

458
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:30,140
 each other as a community fight as a community of believers not just on your

459
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:38,700
 own and so since Paul encourages us to do this this is how I want to end our

460
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:50,500
 time together this morning so we're gonna still our hearts for a moment and

461
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:56,260
 maybe if you came with someone today you know Paul's asking us to pray together

462
00:41:56,260 --> 00:42:02,380
 maybe turn to the person you came with right now and we can ask each other for

463
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:08,540
 you have a quick conversation you know how can I pray for you where have you

464
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:16,060
 been feeling attacked lately where do you need courage where do you need the

465
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:22,260
 Spirit of God to empower you to strengthen you to walk alongside you

466
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:31,340
 how can I be a brother and a sister to you this morning prayer is one of those

467
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:34,380
 things it's one of those beautiful things that help us to acknowledge that

468
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:41,740
 again this is not by our own power it's a mysterious thing that when we pray and

469
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:49,220
 when God speaks and when he works we see him move in power even though we can't

470
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:55,460
 really explain how it works at the same time we know that without prayer we are

471
00:42:55,460 --> 00:43:03,060
 nothing and so church just take a couple of minutes right now if you came alone I

472
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:07,300
 encourage you you can if you if you use a bit of courage pray with the Pope ask

473
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:13,540
 for prayer for the person next to you in the areas of struggle that you have in

474
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:17,580
 the areas that you feel like the enemy is attacking you we pray with each other

475
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:23,300
 to stand firm in this battle so many of us give us a few minutes to do that and

476
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:27,060
 then I'm going to close with a prayer

477

492
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:44,700
 so Jesus we thank you for giving us this armor we thank you that you do not

493
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:49,260
 leave us alone and defenseless and helpless but you equip us and empower us

494
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:55,900
 to live in this on this earth in a victorious way in a way that doesn't

495
00:44:55,900 --> 00:45:03,980
 live in carrying fear of what the enemy might do to us but in the confidence

496
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:10,540
 that no matter what the enemy does to us we can stand firm that we have this

497
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:17,620
 faith that can quench every single lie and doubt and and attack that the enemy

498
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:25,980
 might try to harm us with and still stand firm and say I am a child of God I

499
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:30,380
 am in the Lord's army and with my brothers and sisters around me in

500
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:39,660
 community praying with me praying for me the enemy will not be successful in the

501
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:45,260
 schemes that he has planned for us but the plan of God his will is what is

502
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:51,500
 going to be done and accomplished in this world so Jesus we give ourselves

503
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:57,860
 over to you father I pray for those of us out there who may have strayed in

504
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:06,140
 this area perhaps we have switched allegiances and in a moment of weakness

505
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:13,580
 in a season of doubt we've turned to other spiritual sources for advice for

506
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:19,180
 direction and how to live our life father I pray that if any of us

507
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:22,820
 listening online or those of us who are in this room right now or family members

508
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:30,060
 are in that place father I pray that the Holy Spirit would come out right now the

509
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:34,300
 power would come right now and just cut off all schemes and all lies and all

510
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:42,020
 attachments that the enemy has made in that space that the enemy has no hold on

511
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:51,780
 anybody in this room and with the full armor of God we are standing firm

512
00:46:51,780 --> 00:47:03,780
 and that from this day onwards and in every moment we trust and rely in you we

513
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:10,620
 build our lives we put our feet solidly on the solid ground on the gospel we

514
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:18,940
