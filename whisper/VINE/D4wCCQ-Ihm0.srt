1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,340
 And we pray this in Jesus' name.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,040
 Everyone say, "Hey, can we thank our worship team

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,840
 who so humbly lead us each week?

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:08,680
 Have a seat."

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,880
 My name is Andrew, I'm one of the pastors here.

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,840
 We're glad that you're with us.

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,960
 If this is relatively a new thing for you

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,800
 to come to church,

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,760
 or if this is a new thing to come to the Vine,

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,520
 we're so glad that you're with us.

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,320
 We have three services on Sunday, 9, 15, 11, and 2.

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,280
 And it's a real privilege for us to have you

13
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,080
 a part of the two o'clock service here this afternoon.

14
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,840
 I've been saying this for a little while

15
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,000
 since I returned from my Camino de Santiago,

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,840
 my big pilgrimage hike through Spain,

17
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,320
 an 800 kilometer journey from the south of France

18
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,560
 to the northwest of Spain.

19
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,880
 But I've been sharing with you

20
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,560
 that one of the great highlights of the Camino

21
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,840
 is getting to visit some of the cathedrals and churches

22
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,160
 along the pilgrimage, along the way.

23
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,440
 The walk takes about 30 to 40 days,

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,200
 depending on how you do it.

25
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,040
 But along the way, you come to some of these crazy cities,

26
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,520
 big, beautiful cities, Pamplona, Burgos, Leon,

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,720
 and of course, Santiago de Compostela

28
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,640
 when you get to the end.

29
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,680
 And each one of these huge cities

30
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,860
 has these beautiful cathedrals.

31
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,060
 Some of the most amazing cathedrals

32
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,360
 that you'll ever likely see.

33
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,360
 Just beautiful places, massive expanses of sacred space

34
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,160
 where people for hundreds, if not thousands of years

35
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,280
 have been gathering in that place

36
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,760
 to worship Jesus and walking into some of these

37
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,340
 majestic cathedrals really takes your breath away.

38
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,640
 It's really a profoundly powerful thing.

39
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,640
 But the great thing about the Camino

40
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,380
 is that it's not just in the major cities

41
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,800
 that you get to experience that.

42
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,120
 There are churches throughout the whole of the walk.

43
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,160
 Every day you're going through maybe two or three

44
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,000
 different villages during the walk.

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,940
 And each of those villages will have a church

46
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,320
 and those churches will be of a pretty decent size.

47
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,160
 And you'll go inside of them, they're usually always open.

48
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,320
 Most of these town or village churches

49
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,960
 would have beautiful wooden pews,

50
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,880
 beautiful paintings around the walls,

51
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,120
 some iconography, crosses, lots of candles burning.

52
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,800
 Maybe they seat anywhere from say 70 to 80 to 100 people.

53
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,080
 And these were beautiful places as well.

54
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,160
 But also in the more rural parts of the Camino,

55
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,980
 in places where you're kind of not anywhere near a town

56
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,120
 or a village or a big urban center,

57
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,920
 where you've been walking perhaps for hours

58
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,360
 in a very quiet rural place,

59
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,260
 you might stumble across what I guess you would say

60
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,960
 would be an old rural church.

61
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,000
 Probably one that's not been used for a while.

62
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,140
 Maybe it's been derelict for a number of years.

63
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,680
 You can kind of tell because it's a building

64
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,880
 that's literally practically falling apart.

65
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,360
 Maybe the church roof might have holes in it

66
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,840
 and maybe there's lots of growth around it

67
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,720
 in terms of weeds and the plants and trees around it.

68
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,660
 And these things look run down.

69
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,600
 But these were the churches that I liked the most.

70
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,160
 Because these were churches that were rarely visited,

71
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,880
 not many people would go in them.

72
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,920
 And I would find these rural churches,

73
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,000
 I would go inside and I would be the only person in there.

74
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,320
 And I'd probably be the only person in there

75
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,160
 for 20, 30 minutes.

76
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,760
 And I would sit there and just read and pray

77
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,840
 and think and reflect.

78
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,480
 And I found like in the busyness of the Camino,

79
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,700
 which is a very social and busy thing,

80
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,800
 it was so nice to have these kind of run down,

81
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,320
 derelict, abandoned, if you will, churches

82
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,880
 to go and spend time in, in prayer and solitude.

83
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,240
 Well, on this one particular day,

84
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,720
 maybe about seven or so days before the end of my walk,

85
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,640
 I was cresting up a hill in a very rural area.

86
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,800
 I'd just come through some farmland

87
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,440
 and I crested up this hill.

88
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,960
 And as I did so, to the right of me

89
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,520
 was one of these run down, derelict church buildings.

90
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,960
 It was just a small little building

91
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,440
 that was behind a stone wall and tucked into these trees.

92
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,480
 And it looked quite dramatic.

93
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,760
 So I took a photo of it.

94
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,600
 It's this little kind of stone hut type thing right here.

95
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,120
 And I looked at it and it didn't look particularly

96
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,080
 like anyone had been in there for a long time.

97
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,440
 It was behind this stone wall.

98
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,040
 But I decided I was gonna go in and pray.

99
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,360
 So I took off my backpack and put it down.

100
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,440
 And I climbed, kind of scrambled over the stone wall.

101
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,980
 And I walked into this derelict building.

102
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,340
 Inside, I didn't know what I was expecting to see,

103
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,320
 but I was expecting to see a lot more than I did.

104
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,600
 Inside, it was pretty much abandoned and kind of run down.

105
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,680
 And there was really nothing there.

106
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,120
 In fact, I took a photo of it.

107
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,800
 So here's what it looked like on the inside.

108
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,840
 It was just this kind of concrete, cold building.

109
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,160
 There were no pews.

110
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,880
 There was just this concrete altar at the front.

111
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,920
 There was this old wooden cross on the wall.

112
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,080
 You could tell that the rain and the wind had seeped in a lot

113
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,880
 and there was like dew and mold all over the place.

114
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,760
 And it was kind of a bit smelly

115
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,280
 and it just wasn't a very nice particular place.

116
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,400
 And after about five minutes in there,

117
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,980
 I was feeling kind of creepy

118
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,040
 and like I didn't wanna be in there.

119
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,960
 So I just prayed a really quick prayer,

120
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,440
 maybe like a couple of minutes.

121
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,520
 And then I moved on, got my backpack

122
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,400
 and kept on walking along the path.

123
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,280
 I walked about another five kilometers.

124
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,680
 And by then I was like, I think I'm done for the day.

125
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,520
 I'm pretty comfortable.

126
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,020
 I've walked quite a long way today.

127
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,240
 And I came to this village with this big church.

128
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,860
 And the church was actually quite well known

129
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,680
 for welcoming pilgrims in.

130
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,000
 And you could sleep on the floor of the church

131
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,340
 for a very small donation.

132
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,860
 So for around about like three or four euros,

133
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,000
 you could do a little donation

134
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,240
 and you could sleep on a mat on the floor,

135
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,600
 the cold floor of the church.

136
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,480
 But the reason why people would go and do it

137
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,640
 is because there were these monks that ran that church.

138
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,840
 And the monks were famous for their cooking.

139
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,400
 And every night they would cook a communal meal.

140
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,600
 And if you're a pilgrim,

141
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,280
 you're starving by the end of the day.

142
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,660
 And this idea of these monks cooking you a meal

143
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,020
 is like super cool.

144
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,360
 So I went in, I paid my three or four euro donation.

145
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,600
 I had my little mats on the stone floor of the church.

146
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,960
 And then that evening, of course,

147
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,280
 they cooked this incredible meal and we sat down.

148
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,400
 I sat down next to this man and I got chatting with him

149
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,360
 and his English was pretty good.

150
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,880
 And we got chatting together.

151
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,500
 And it turned out that he was the local priest

152
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,760
 of the local parish of that area.

153
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,600
 Now, I didn't tell him I was a pastor or anything like that,

154
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,520
 but it was fascinating to talk to this guy

155
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,440
 who was this priest of this area.

156
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,280
 And as we were talking and stuff, I was like,

157
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,540
 oh, you never guess what, earlier today,

158
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,680
 as I was walking here, I came across this rundown,

159
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,240
 abandoned, derelict church.

160
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,200
 And I got my phone out and I showed him these two photos.

161
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,120
 And as I did, his eyes lit up.

162
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,760
 He's like, that's my church.

163
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,640
 I'm like, what?

164
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,440
 He's like, yeah, that's my church.

165
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,320
 I said, you mean this one is your church?

166
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,680
 I said, you look after this church?

167
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,380
 You are not doing a good job

168
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,240
 of looking after your church, okay?

169
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,320
 This thing smells, it's rundown, it's damp.

170
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,600
 Don't worry, I didn't say that to him.

171
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,080
 But that was what I was thinking on the inside.

172
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,480
 That was my inside voice

173
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,360
 that luckily I kept inside in that moment.

174
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,800
 But I'm thinking like, that's crazy.

175
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,800
 And I said, well, tell me about this church.

176
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,640
 He's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

177
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,960
 Well, so each Sunday, he's like, I prepare a sermon.

178
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,000
 And then me and my dog,

179
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,280
 we walk the five kilometers to this church.

180
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,440
 And he says, we go in there.

181
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,360
 And he says, look, on some Sundays,

182
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,280
 there is a revival and maybe five people come.

183
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,760
 I'm like, five people?

184
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,680
 He's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

185
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,600
 Some Sundays we get five people.

186
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,480
 He's like, so excited.

187
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,280
 And he's like, but often what would happen is,

188
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,280
 on most Sundays, it's just me and my dog.

189
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,280
 And then he says, on half of those Sundays,

190
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,280
 my dog doesn't even bother to come with me, it's just me.

191
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,720
 And he says, I prepare a sermon every Sunday

192
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,880
 and I show up there.

193
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,760
 And if somebody comes, then I share my sermon with them.

194
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,360
 And we do the pastor or the priestly rites.

195
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,000
 But if no one comes, then I just sit there and pray.

196
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,920
 I'm like, you do this every Sunday?

197
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,680
 He's like, yeah, every Sunday, I prepare a message,

198
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,080
 go there, if someone shows up, great.

199
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,480
 If not, I just sit and pray.

200
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,920
 I said, how long have you been serving in this church?

201
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,840
 He said, and this is literally what he said.

202
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,960
 He said, oh, not too long.

203
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,400
 He said, about 38 years.

204
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,120
 I said, what?

205
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,960
 I said, what do you mean?

206
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,720
 He's like, yeah, about 38 years, he said.

207
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,400
 I said, you've been serving this church for 38 years

208
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,920
 and you prepare a sermon every Sunday.

209
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:17,040
 And on the majorities of Sundays, no one shows up?

210
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,440
 Well, we got talking about other things

211
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,960
 and kind of the evening went away.

212
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,680
 But I remember like that night as I'm lying

213
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,560
 on the cold stone floor in my little mat,

214
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,240
 I remember thinking to myself this, man, what a waste.

215
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,360
 Like I'm sure this guy is like a really nice guy.

216
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,400
 He was nice, he was funny, he was a good communicator.

217
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,920
 I was like, I'm sure he preaches great sermons.

218
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,760
 Like what a waste of his gifts

219
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,920
 and what a waste of his talents.

220
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,520
 It must be so frustrating for him

221
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,000
 to feel like such a failure.

222
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,800
 I remember lying there thinking like,

223
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,920
 I need to pray for this guy, you know?

224
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,600
 I need to pray that real revival comes

225
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,680
 and that his church becomes a success, right?

226
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,080
 And so I committed myself that night,

227
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,120
 I'm gonna pray for this guy.

228
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,680
 I'm gonna pray every, the rest of my days of walking,

229
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,000
 I'm gonna remember him and pray for him.

230
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,560
 The next morning we woke up and we rolled our mats up

231
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,280
 and the priest gave us hugs and wished us all the best

232
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,120
 and we started walking on the path of the Camino

233
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,960
 for the next day.

234
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,040
 And as I did, I fell into prayer at some point

235
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,520
 and as I fell into prayer,

236
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,720
 I thought of this man straightaway, this priest,

237
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,720
 and I was about to start my prayer.

238
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,320
 You know, Lord, just bless this man.

239
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,040
 He must be so over things.

240
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,760
 He must be like feeling like such a failure,

241
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,640
 Lord, fill him with your love, you know?

242
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,720
 Like I had the best prayer ever for this guy, right?

243
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,840
 As I'm beginning to pray for him,

244
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,440
 you know like those times when you're praying

245
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,160
 and like God shows up, right?

246
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,640
 Anyone ever experienced that?

247
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,480
 No?

248
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,520
 You know like when you pray, God comes and shows up

249
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,560
 and it's like part of your prayer, anyway.

250
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,800
 So I'm praying and God shows up and he shows up

251
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,840
 and he's like typical like, like he slaps me,

252
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:49,080
 like metaphorically slaps me, okay, across my face.

253
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,760
 Like and immediately I knew it was like

254
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,120
 one of those moments where the Lord was not happy with me

255
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,920
 and where I realized that there was something going on

256
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,640
 in my attitude or my thinking that wasn't quite right.

257
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,000
 And so he began to speak to me and I took out my phone

258
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,760
 and I started to write down as I often do

259
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,800
 and I feel like God's speaking to me,

260
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,600
 writing down kind of things he was saying

261
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,600
 and it wasn't easy what he said.

262
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,440
 Let me read it to you.

263
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,600
 He said this.

264
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,480
 He said, "Andrew, you need to redefine

265
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,960
 "what you think is successful in ministry and what is not.

266
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,360
 "Your attitude is wrong and your thinking flawed.

267
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,360
 "I have not called you to be successful,

268
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,680
 "I have called you to be faithful.

269
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,680
 "And last night I put beside you one of my favorite examples

270
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,800
 "of this kind of success in my kingdom.

271
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,560
 "You were fortunate to be in his presence."

272
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,760
 Which was deeply challenging to me

273
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,520
 because I thought he was fortunate to be in my presence.

274
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:41,800
 'Cause I'm a great pastor of a big church in Hong Kong

275
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,960
 and we have lots of people come on a Sunday.

276
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,920
 And I thought this guy needs to learn a few tips and tricks,

277
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,360
 how to get the people back with great stories.

278
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:57,120
 But I was the one fortunate to be in his presence.

279
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,120
 And it was almost like I was in his presence.

280
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,120
 And it was almost like God was saying,

281
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,600
 "I'm looking down, Andrew, on you and this guy.

282
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,360
 "And if you were to judge success in the kingdom

283
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,760
 "in worldly perspectives, then yeah,

284
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,040
 "you're doing a great job.

285
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,200
 "But if you actually wanna judge your ministry

286
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,240
 "by the successful standards of the kingdom,

287
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,560
 "this man is the one you need to be spending time with.

288
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,760
 "Because I don't look at things the way that the world does.

289
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,440
 "And this one is faithful."

290
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,240
 As we continue to think about what it is for us

291
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,720
 as a church community in this season

292
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,920
 to move into uncharted territory and uncharted waters.

293
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,080
 We've been saying in this series

294
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,120
 that we've been doing here at the Vine

295
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,480
 that this whole series on Acts is about

296
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,360
 how do we posture our hearts

297
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,800
 for the season that's ahead of us.

298
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,960
 And if God is taking us into uncharted waters,

299
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,760
 we have to realize that right at the start,

300
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,280
 we need to redefine for ourselves

301
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,320
 what success is gonna mean for us in this season.

302
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,000
 And if we don't redefine for us what success means,

303
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,840
 then we're gonna head into an uncharted season

304
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,600
 and into uncharted waters,

305
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,640
 thinking that we know what we want God to do

306
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,800
 or what we think will define for us what success is.

307
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,680
 And when that may not happen,

308
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,080
 we'll walk out of this season feeling deflated and upset.

309
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,880
 And actually there is so much here

310
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,240
 that I think we have to realize

311
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,440
 is that we so often hold on to a worldly perspective

312
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,040
 of what success is,

313
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,040
 whether that's for the church communally,

314
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,000
 whether that's for you individually,

315
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,680
 and particularly here in Hong Kong,

316
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,560
 we so drive ourselves by that thinking

317
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,200
 of what we think success should look like

318
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,500
 when actually when it comes to the kingdom of God,

319
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,640
 it's anything but.

320
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,240
 It's like a procession of death

321
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,480
 getting actually met with the true procession of life.

322
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,320
 If I was to put it as simply as I could,

323
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,940
 I would say it this way.

324
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:58,600
 I would say that if we really wanna be the people in Hong Kong

325
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,280
 who are ready to move when the Holy Spirit speaks,

326
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,880
 we will have to release the pressure to succeed

327
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,880
 with the priority to be faithful.

328
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,320
 Come on, church.

329
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,920
 We will need to release the pressure

330
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,840
 that we feel all the time in this city

331
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,120
 to be successful, defined by however that might be,

332
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,480
 and we will need to embrace the priority

333
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,680
 to put in our lives a priority to be faithful

334
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,040
 to whatever it is that God has called us to do

335
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,880
 over and above looking successful

336
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,500
 in how the world might deem that and look at that and say.

337
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,320
 Not that there's nothing wrong with achieving things.

338
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,480
 Not that there's nothing wrong with doing well

339
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,100
 and getting promoted and having a good life

340
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,240
 and having a great job.

341
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,000
 There's nothing at all wrong with that stuff.

342
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,080
 The problem is though,

343
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,960
 in the terms of how we often think of what success looks like

344
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,180
 in the corporate world or just the world that's out there,

345
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,320
 when we take that and apply that to God's kingdom,

346
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,200
 it's like trying to put a square peg in a round hole.

347
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,480
 And while there's nothing wrong

348
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,400
 with a sense of worldly success in our lives,

349
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,000
 where we want to be found is faithful.

350
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,920
 And what we have to understand

351
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,960
 is that sometimes a commitment to faithfulness

352
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,160
 will actually look very different

353
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,760
 to what worldly success looks like.

354
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,360
 In fact, I would define it like this.

355
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,960
 I would say success in God's kingdom

356
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,200
 is not found in the abundance of achievement,

357
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,880
 it's found in the faithfulness of obedience.

358
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,160
 It's not found in the abundance

359
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,340
 of the things that we achieve in life.

360
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,240
 It's actually found in just being faithful

361
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,560
 to the small thing perhaps

362
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,060
 that God has asked us to be obedient to.

363
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:41,440
 During Vision Sunday, back at the beginning of March,

364
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,200
 as I kicked off this season of Unchartedness with us,

365
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,480
 I shared about that picture of an early pioneer boat.

366
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,160
 Remember this, the pioneers, the early settlers

367
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,480
 that would get on a boat and they would push off

368
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,160
 and they'd be going out in search of new lands,

369
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,060
 lands that have never been discovered before,

370
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,540
 where there were no maps or anything for the waters

371
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,320
 in which they were sailing into.

372
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,520
 And they would go with that mixture

373
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,040
 of excitement and nervousness.

374
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,920
 And I shared on that Sunday the picture

375
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,440
 of like the captain who's leaning forward

376
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,740
 in the bow with the telescope,

377
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,540
 looking out towards where the new lands might be.

378
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,980
 But then all these other sailors on the ship

379
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,000
 who are each doing their own little part on the ship

380
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,240
 so in order the boat to go in the direction

381
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,480
 that the captain actually wants the boat to go in.

382
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,440
 One of the things I didn't share that Sunday though

383
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,800
 is in the days of the early settlers

384
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,600
 when they were sending out these boats,

385
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,920
 the majority of the boats would go out

386
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,160
 and come back having discovered nothing.

387
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,440
 Maybe they had two months of supplies on the boat

388
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,280
 when they set out from port.

389
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,980
 And at the critical time,

390
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,660
 they realized that if they kept going,

391
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,460
 they would all die 'cause their stuff would run out.

392
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,600
 So they have to turn around and go back to harbor

393
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,700
 before anybody else would starve.

394
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,780
 So they had to make these judgment calls all the time.

395
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,520
 And the majority of the boats that went out

396
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,560
 would return having discovered nothing.

397
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,880
 Can you imagine if you were in the boat,

398
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,240
 if you were one of those sailors

399
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,640
 who had gone out for two months and had found nothing

400
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,840
 and came back to the harbor empty handed,

401
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,320
 you'd be feeling upset, you'd be feeling frustrated.

402
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,920
 You didn't achieve the thing

403
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,740
 that you were hoping to achieve.

404
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,100
 We gotta be very careful

405
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,580
 and we have to think about this really importantly.

406
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:18,020
 For us at the Vine is we're launching out

407
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,580
 into uncharted waters.

408
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,020
 The temptation for us is going to be

409
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,300
 always to discover the land.

410
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,580
 As if like the whole purpose of setting out

411
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,740
 is to discover this thing out there.

412
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,140
 I want you to know this,

413
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,700
 when God calls a church into uncharted seasons,

414
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,380
 He is not promising the spectacular.

415
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,160
 He's not promising that there's gonna be

416
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,520
 suddenly something amazing up ahead.

417
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,660
 There may be, there may not be,

418
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,640
 the promise, the focus for us

419
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,860
 is not on what we might achieve.

420
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,560
 The focus is if we're being faithful

421
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,480
 in what He's asked us to do.

422
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,660
 We saw this beautifully last week

423
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,920
 when promise preached on Ananias and Paul.

424
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,920
 And when we saw Ananias, right?

425
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,160
 Who God calls him to go to Paul,

426
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,060
 but God doesn't give him how it's all gonna turn out.

427
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,680
 He doesn't say, "Hey, this is all gonna go well for you.

428
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,960
 "Everything's gonna be great.

429
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,880
 "You're gonna be fine.

430
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,820
 "I know he's scary and he's been killing people like you,

431
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:12,720
 "but don't worry."

432
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,680
 God didn't reassure him of any of that

433
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,560
 like promise said last week.

434
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:20,960
 But what Ananias was called to do was to go.

435
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,840
 And Ananias was faithful to go.

436
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:28,060
 And if we, as we start this season as a church,

437
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:28,900
 are kind of saying,

438
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,340
 well, we're only gonna go if it's worth it.

439
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,360
 We're only gonna go if we're gonna discover

440
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,100
 the thing that God has for us.

441
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,240
 We're only gonna go out there

442
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,080
 if that's the way.

443
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,140
 In other words, if we become outcome focused,

444
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,100
 what we've done is we've put ourselves

445
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,880
 like the captain in the bow

446
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,360
 rather than putting ourselves in the heart of the ship.

447
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,080
 Our role is not the captain.

448
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,040
 That is Jesus.

449
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,760
 Jesus is the one who, as we head out into the unknown,

450
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,520
 he's the one steering the ship

451
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,080
 by the power of the Holy Spirit,

452
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,440
 telling us where to go.

453
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,040
 And we, our concern is not the eventual outcome of that.

454
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,840
 Our concern is are we doing and steering the ship

455
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,240
 in the direction he wants us to?

456
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,000
 Is this making sense to you?

457
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,440
 As soon as we start over focusing

458
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,800
 and over emphasizing on what's out there,

459
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,320
 we'll end up standing on the deck of the boat,

460
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,040
 staring out into the horizon

461
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,880
 and not steering the ship at all.

462
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:30,320
 Success and failure are words reserved for the captain.

463
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:36,080
 The words reserved for us is faithfulness.

464
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,360
 Faithfulness is what the servants do.

465
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,600
 When Jesus says, "Come and follow me,"

466
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:48,720
 he's inviting us into a journey of being found faithful.

467
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,800
 And while there may be for some of us in this room

468
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,520
 in the season ahead, amazing, spectacular, incredible things

469
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,240
 and of course we believe and hope and pray

470
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,600
 that that will be the case for some of us,

471
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,260
 the reality is for many of us in this season of Uncharted,

472
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,980
 there may not be the dramatic around the corner.

473
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,220
 But whether there is or there isn't,

474
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,260
 God looks and he turns to you and says,

475
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,500
 "Here's what I call of you.

476
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,860
 "Here's what I require of you.

477
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,060
 "Here's what I'm asking of you.

478
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,420
 "That the very small thing

479
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,820
 "that I've already placed in your hands,

480
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,420
 "the very thing that to everybody else

481
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,980
 "might seem everyday, might seem ordinary,

482
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,140
 "might even seem mundane, that's the thing.

483
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:29,060
 "That through hundreds and thousands of people

484
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:32,140
 "who commit to the daily following of Jesus,

485
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,780
 "the faithfulness in the small things,

486
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,140
 "God then does the big thing."

487
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:43,380
 And this invitation to us is so important and so profound

488
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,420
 because it's an invitation to life,

489
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,620
 which seems so counterintuitive

490
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,700
 to what the world might try to tell us.

491
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,980
 Life is found in the abundance of bigger and better.

492
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,260
 The kingdom says life is found

493
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:00,620
 in the simple small sacrifices of being found faithful.

494
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:05,420
 Like a priest who prepares a sermon every Sunday

495
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,700
 even though he has no people in his church.

496
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,660
 Or like a parent who has faithfully prayed

497
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,020
 for their adult child to come to Jesus,

498
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,620
 but year after year it seems like that child

499
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,700
 is just getting further and further away.

500
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:23,100
 Like the small business owner

501
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,820
 who's faithfully making sacrificial decisions

502
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,620
 that no one will ever know

503
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,580
 in order to ensure that the business

504
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,620
 would be able to stay afloat in a tough market.

505
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:37,380
 The day by day faithful decisions

506
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,420
 of what God has put in our hands.

507
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:43,300
 When we live like that,

508
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:47,500
 God says you are lucky to be in that person's presence.

509
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,700
 What I love about the book of Acts,

510
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,740
 which we've been studying in this series,

511
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,780
 is that the book of Acts

512
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:00,420
 is not actually how it appears when you read it.

513
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,100
 The book of Acts as Luke presents it

514
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,020
 of course is presenting this story

515
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,420
 of these incredible men

516
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:09,300
 who are almost like super apostles, right?

517
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,700
 The ones that do amazing things.

518
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,980
 People like Peter and Paul and Barnabas and Silas and James.

519
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:19,140
 These great early leaders of the church.

520
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,980
 And Luke as he's presenting the work of the early church,

521
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,700
 he's highlighting the amazing things

522
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,980
 that these great people do in the faith.

523
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,060
 And when we read the book of Acts,

524
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,260
 it's tempting for us to kind of think

525
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,460
 that the reason why the church in Acts,

526
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,220
 the early church, grew to such power and prominence

527
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:39,460
 is because only of these amazing few

528
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,740
 that do such great things.

529
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,460
 But actually dig a little bit below the surface

530
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,900
 in the book of Acts and you'll realize

531
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:48,300
 that the thing that actually grew and sustained the church

532
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,780
 wasn't the big amazing super apostles,

533
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:54,100
 it was those in the towns and the villages

534
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,660
 who were a part of the church

535
00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:00,500
 who day in, day out built God's church.

536
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,580
 The unknown, the unmentioned.

537
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,940
 Did you know that one of the most prominent churches

538
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,560
 in the whole of the time period that Acts covers

539
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,160
 is the church in Antioch?

540
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,380
 It's the church where people were called Christians

541
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,020
 for the very first time

542
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,920
 because of the way that they were living their lives.

543
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,340
 That church was not founded by any of the apostles.

544
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,100
 We don't even know the names of the people

545
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,380
 that founded the church,

546
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:26,140
 but that church was the most prominent church

547
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,380
 in all of the book of Acts,

548
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,500
 founded by a bunch of people

549
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,940
 who will never know their names,

550
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,380
 but they were found faithful.

551
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:39,220
 Every once in a while, as Luke is presenting

552
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,460
 the story of these amazing apostles and what they did,

553
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,300
 he drops into the narrative a glimpse

554
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,940
 of some of these kind of not known,

555
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:52,860
 not really celebrated, kind of know nothing type people

556
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,180
 who because of their faithfulness

557
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:57,260
 do something truly profound.

558
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,060
 And I wanna share one of those stories with you.

559
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,860
 It's an apostle by the name of Jason.

560
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,900
 So he's not an apostle.

561
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,860
 It's a person by the name of Jason.

562
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:09,540
 And Jason lives in a town called Thessalonica.

563
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,780
 And Thessalonica was one of the towns

564
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,940
 that Paul and Silas came to

565
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,460
 in the middle of their second missionary journey.

566
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,900
 And during this journey,

567
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,300
 they visited a whole bunch of places

568
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,500
 and they come to the city of Thessalonica.

569
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,140
 And in Thessalonica, Paul and Silas do

570
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,260
 what they would always do in their missionary journey,

571
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,900
 and that is go to the synagogue

572
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,540
 and start to share Jesus with the Jews living

573
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:33,260
 or are a part of the synagogue there.

574
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,780
 And as they do that, things begin to happen in the city.

575
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,380
 And I wanna pick up the story from that point.

576
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,020
 So this is Acts 17, starting in verse four.

577
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:45,020
 Some of the Jews were persuaded by Paul and Silas

578
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,260
 in their presentation of the gospel

579
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,980
 and joined Paul and Silas,

580
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,020
 as did a large number of God-fearing Greeks

581
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:53,020
 and not a few prominent women.

582
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,820
 But the Jews were jealous.

583
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:57,780
 So they rounded up some bad characters from the marketplace,

584
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:01,260
 formed a mob and started a riot in the city.

585
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:05,140
 They rushed to Jason's house in search of Paul and Silas

586
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,780
 in order to bring them out to the crowd.

587
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,140
 This is the first time we hear of this person, Jason.

588
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,580
 And here's what takes place.

589
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:15,740
 We don't get any backstory about Jason whatsoever.

590
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,140
 Luke doesn't give us any details.

591
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,540
 But because we understand a little bit

592
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,020
 about how the churches were formed

593
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,900
 and how the church was run at that time,

594
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,620
 we can make some pretty good guesses

595
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,260
 about the sort of person Jason was.

596
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:29,860
 First of all, he had obviously had enough wealth

597
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,940
 whereby he had a home that was large enough

598
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,020
 to have people like Paul and Silas and others

599
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,220
 come and stay and live with him.

600
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,420
 That wasn't a given.

601
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:39,660
 So he's a man of relative successful career background

602
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,300
 and a bit of finance.

603
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,860
 We also know of course, that he's a believer in Jesus.

604
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,980
 And it's very likely that he was already a believer

605
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,600
 before Paul and Silas showed up.

606
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,980
 Paul and Silas did not found the church in Thessalonica.

607
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,980
 The church was already active and going.

608
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,500
 It's possible, we don't know,

609
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,300
 but it's possible that Jason was one of the people

610
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,980
 on the church in Jerusalem.

611
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,500
 And that when persecution came to Jerusalem in 70 AD

612
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,700
 and the church spread out into the Greek Roman Empire,

613
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,260
 a number of the believers ended up settling in Thessalonica.

614
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,780
 So whether that was Jason or not,

615
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,620
 we know that he settled in this village, in this town, sorry.

616
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,980
 And as he settled in this town,

617
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:20,660
 he starts what we can assume is a church in his home.

618
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,140
 We can assume this because when the mob

619
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,060
 are searching for Paul and Silas,

620
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:28,580
 they choose to go to Jason's house and looking for him.

621
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,940
 In other words, they must have known that Jason

622
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:34,060
 was holding or hosting some sort of Christian community

623
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,980
 in his home in Thessalonica.

624
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,820
 So peel back the curtain for a sec.

625
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:42,360
 Here's Jason and he's kind of like a nobody.

626
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,180
 He's done well in business, he's made some money.

627
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,900
 He's come to faith at some point in his life

628
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,140
 through some way and he started running a church

629
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:49,980
 in his home.

630
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,980
 Now that church is gonna be small.

631
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:55,020
 I mean, Thessalonica was hostile to the gospel.

632
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,660
 It was a hard place for people who believed in Jesus.

633
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,260
 So maybe there were five people at the church,

634
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,380
 maybe there were 10 people, 15,

635
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,440
 we don't know the numbers at all.

636
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,460
 But it's a little bit like my priest in the Camino.

637
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:10,500
 Jason faithfully preparing a message every week

638
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,300
 to sit with the people that were coming to his house

639
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,700
 to hold onto the hope that this Jesus

640
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,700
 was actually the Messiah in the middle

641
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,260
 of the Greco-Roman Empire.

642
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,540
 But then one day something amazing happens.

643
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,540
 One day all of Jason and the church's prayers were answered

644
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,540
 'cause they had been praying that God would send them

645
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,820
 some success.

646
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,620
 They had been praying that God would do something special

647
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:34,900
 in their city and now Paul and Silas has shown up.

648
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,060
 Paul, the apostle Paul, the one that everybody

649
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,300
 had heard stories about who was persecuting the church

650
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,660
 and then came into this dramatic encounter with Jesus

651
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:45,780
 and was now powerfully doing miracles for God

652
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,020
 in the Greco-Roman Empire.

653
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,060
 He's now shown up in Thessalonica.

654
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,740
 And you can imagine for Jason and his little house church,

655
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,220
 they're like so excited.

656
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,460
 Finally, success is gonna come for our ministry.

657
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:59,160
 Finally, people are gonna come to faith.

658
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,740
 And Luke says to us that actually some success does come.

659
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,940
 Some of the Jews come to faith in the synagogue,

660
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:07,540
 some prominent women come to faith, which is great.

661
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,420
 A large number of Greek people begin to believe in Jesus.

662
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,860
 And so there's this mini sort of revival taking place

663
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,820
 and Jason must be so excited about this

664
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:19,460
 and then something happens.

665
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:22,180
 Notice in verse six, it says this,

666
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,580
 "But when they did not find them,"

667
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,540
 this is the crowd looking for Paul and Silas,

668
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,580
 "they dragged Jason and some other brothers

669
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,100
 "before the city officials and shouted,

670
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,020
 "'These men have caused trouble all over the world

671
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,460
 "'and have now come here,'

672
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:39,460
 "and Jason has welcomed them into his house.

673
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:42,080
 "They are all defying Caesar's decrees,

674
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,540
 "saying that there is another king, one called Jesus."

675
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:52,060
 Jason's life has just become a nightmare.

676
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,080
 What he thought was revival,

677
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,120
 what he thought was a definition

678
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,940
 of what success would look like,

679
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:01,380
 suddenly, because they can't find Paul and Silas,

680
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,700
 he's dragged before the courts.

681
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,500
 He's dragged before the very people

682
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,180
 had the power to sentence him to death.

683
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,580
 And when he's dragged in front of them,

684
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,860
 notice what happens.

685
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,460
 They begin to accuse Jason

686
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:15,420
 of what they were accusing Paul and Silas of.

687
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,780
 They can't find Paul and Silas,

688
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,860
 so they have to find somebody to take the heat,

689
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,580
 somebody to take the punishment

690
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,620
 for the crime that they had for Paul and Silas.

691
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,860
 And so Jason and the brothers in his church

692
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:28,260
 are the ones who begin to take the punishment,

693
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,620
 who are the ones accused of doing the things

694
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,140
 that Paul and Silas were doing,

695
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,140
 even though they hadn't done them.

696
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,140
 And they're accused and they're brought before the court

697
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,700
 and the punishment is being given to them

698
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,740
 rather than Paul and Silas.

699
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:45,140
 It's like Jason is now having to stand in the gap

700
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,740
 on behalf of Paul and Silas,

701
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,260
 and he's the one being slandered.

702
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,220
 He's the one being told he's a criminal.

703
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,340
 He's the one who's being punished

704
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,980
 for what's happening in the city.

705
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:58,780
 Not only that, but notice what happens next in verse eight.

706
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,860
 It says this.

707
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:00,940
 It says, "When they heard this,

708
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,620
 "the crowd and the whole city officials

709
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,200
 "were thrown into turmoil.

710
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,720
 "Then they made Jason and the others post bond

711
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,380
 "and let them go."

712
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,180
 This phrase, post bond.

713
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,400
 This is a really interesting thing

714
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,900
 that happened in those days.

715
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,460
 What would happen is that you get dragged before the court,

716
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,260
 you get accused of all these crimes.

717
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,860
 You're supposed to have the punishment for those crimes,

718
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:24,660
 but you could pay a extortionately high price,

719
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:28,980
 spend money to buy yourself out of that punishment.

720
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,980
 To basically buy, to pay the price

721
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,520
 so that that punishment no longer applies

722
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,220
 to Paul and Silas.

723
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,580
 So this is quite profound because now Jason

724
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,680
 is not only suffering on their behalf,

725
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,440
 being accused for what they should have been accused for,

726
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,560
 he's now paying the price so that they can go free.

727
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:50,060
 And that price was a high price.

728
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:53,080
 It was a very extortionate amount of money.

729
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,320
 And most people didn't pay it

730
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,400
 'cause it was so stupidly expensive,

731
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,480
 and therefore you'd have to suffer under punishment.

732
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,280
 But somehow Jason and his brothers get this money together.

733
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,800
 They pay the bond price so that Paul and Silas

734
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,600
 could go free.

735
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,680
 Think about this.

736
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,640
 I wonder if that reminds you of anyone.

737
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:16,080
 I wonder if that reminds you of someone called Jesus

738
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,920
 in Jerusalem who's himself arrested

739
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:23,320
 and put on trial for crimes that he didn't commit.

740
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,120
 Who is put before trial before all the people,

741
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,400
 slandered for things that he had not done,

742
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,480
 silent before those that were accusing him.

743
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,960
 And one who eventually is taken to the cross

744
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,840
 and nailed to that cross,

745
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,180
 having to pay the high bond price

746
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:43,960
 so that those, you and me, who should have been punished

747
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,380
 are now set free.

748
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,960
 Interesting, isn't it?

749
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,300
 That in the Christian faith,

750
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:54,680
 the greatest symbol of hope and life, the cross of Jesus,

751
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,260
 is actually by its very definition,

752
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:00,220
 the antithesis of success in the world's eyes.

753
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:04,700
 In fact, the cross looks like failure.

754
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:08,020
 It looks like everything didn't work out.

755
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,320
 In fact, it looks so much that way

756
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,360
 that the people in the world were mocking and laughing.

757
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,040
 Call yourself the king of the Jews.

758
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,040
 You can't even save yourself.

759
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:20,800
 But actually, when God looks at the cross of Jesus,

760
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:25,000
 God looks at it with a different definition of success.

761
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,720
 And he looks down on his son Jesus

762
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,780
 and he says, "This one has remained faithful.

763
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:32,420
 "This one has been faithful

764
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,000
 "to the things that I had called him to do."

765
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,640
 Oh, there was that time in the Mount of Olives

766
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,200
 when he wrestled.

767
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,800
 Oh Lord, if you could take this cup from me, please take it.

768
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:45,440
 "But your will be done," Jesus says.

769
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,880
 And when God looks at the cross of Jesus,

770
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,060
 he sees the most successful thing

771
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:52,240
 that has ever happened in the kingdom.

772
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,420
 Somebody who was so faithful

773
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:57,740
 that he was willing to forgive all of the world's sin,

774
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:00,800
 that the bond price was paid by his blood

775
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,500
 so that everybody else would go free.

776
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,240
 The cross is this beautiful picture, powerful picture,

777
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,480
 of what success looks like in God's kingdom.

778
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,240
 One man who is found faithful.

779
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,220
 So now here's Jason.

780
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:19,580
 Jason, who was thinking success was gonna look like this,

781
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,800
 and there was a little bit of that

782
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,620
 looking like it was happening.

783
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:26,660
 But then is suddenly brought to his own moment of the cross

784
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,780
 and Jason having to walk the very same path

785
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,540
 that Jesus walked on behalf of Paul and Silas.

786
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,880
 I don't know about you, but if I was Jason,

787
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,460
 I would have been very tempted

788
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,660
 to be a little bit like Judas,

789
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,500
 to say to the magistrate,

790
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,420
 "Hey guys, okay, you couldn't find him in my home.

791
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,400
 "That's 'cause I know where he is.

792
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,800
 "In fact, if you let me go,

793
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,960
 "if you follow me, we'll go to the marketplace.

794
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,940
 "The man that I go up to and kiss, that man's Paul."

795
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,500
 He could have taken the Judas route.

796
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,140
 I think Jason could have also taken the Peter route.

797
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,460
 He could have gone, "I don't know Paul and Silas.

798
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,300
 "I don't know who they are.

799
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,460
 "Pfft, who, Paul and Silas?

800
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,300
 "I don't know Paul and Silas.

801
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,280
 "Do you know Paul and Silas?

802
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,340
 "Oh, we don't know Paul and Silas."

803
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:07,740
 Right, he could have denied even knowing Paul and Silas.

804
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:10,460
 I think Jason had a lot of outs.

805
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,940
 He had a lot of ways that he could handle this.

806
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,280
 He didn't have to spend all his money

807
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,420
 to pay the bond price so that they could go free.

808
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:18,000
 But here's Jason, a nobody,

809
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:22,780
 running a small church in the city of Thessalonica,

810
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,620
 a city hostile to the faith.

811
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,700
 He decides, "Even if it's gonna cost me,

812
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,260
 "I'm gonna be found faithful."

813
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:33,420
 And so he makes small decisions

814
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,400
 that have big ramifications.

815
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,140
 Now, here's the other interesting thing.

816
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,180
 The narrative, Luke writing the story,

817
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,300
 suddenly that night, Paul and Silas,

818
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,380
 they flee Thessalonica,

819
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:47,820
 and Luke follows now Paul and Silas' story again.

820
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:51,340
 And the spotlight shifts away from Jason and Thessalonica

821
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,260
 to Paul and Silas, and the next thing they do,

822
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,540
 the next great place they go to,

823
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,060
 and the next great miracle they do,

824
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,100
 here's the thing, though.

825
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,660
 Jason remained behind.

826
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,660
 Oh, we don't hear this story.

827
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,820
 This story's not told us in the book of Acts,

828
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:06,060
 but if you dig a little bit below and have a think about it,

829
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,900
 Jason remained in Thessalonica.

830
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,620
 I mean, he remained there.

831
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,160
 He had nowhere else to go.

832
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,300
 He wasn't off on some great crusade.

833
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,020
 He was the one who just spent all his money

834
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,220
 to enable Paul and Silas to go.

835
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,900
 He was the one whose reputation has now been slandered,

836
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,700
 and he's the one who's got to now live in the very town

837
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:26,320
 where he's become famous for all the wrong reasons.

838
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,460
 He's the one who's gonna have to now suffer

839
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:33,300
 day in, day out for the faithfulness

840
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,200
 that he's shown to the kingdom of God.

841
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,500
 Now, we don't know because Luke doesn't tell us,

842
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:44,720
 but a number of years later when Paul is in prison,

843
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,760
 and he's thinking, how do I leave a legacy?

844
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,780
 What are the churches I need to reach out to and encourage?

845
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:54,260
 He writes two letters to the church of Thessalonica,

846
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:57,180
 one and two Thessalonians that we have in our scriptures.

847
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:01,960
 So something happened through the faithfulness of Jason

848
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,560
 that would grow to such an extent

849
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,560
 that Paul eventually would write these letters

850
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,880
 to the church to encourage them and inspire them.

851
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,640
 The church didn't die out.

852
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:14,640
 The church thrived because one man was faithful.

853
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:20,600
 The vine itself has been built over some 30 years now

854
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,160
 by men and women that have been incredibly faithful.

855
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,000
 This church has not grown just because

856
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,540
 there's been a few people with a gift

857
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:29,560
 who have stood on a stage or a platform in the spotlight

858
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,200
 and done something.

859
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,680
 This church has grown and has done what it's done

860
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,600
 in our city in the humble ways that we have

861
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:40,520
 off the back of hundreds of Jasons over the years.

862
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,640
 Paul and Silas needed Jasons in their ministry.

863
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,480
 The vines needed them in ours.

864
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,480
 Let me introduce you just briefly

865
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,720
 to two of those Jasons in our midst.

866
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,060
 This is Auntie Hing and Auntie Heng.

867
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:54,320
 Auntie Hing and Auntie Heng may not be familiar to you,

868
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,360
 particularly here at the two o'clock

869
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,520
 when we don't have children's ministry available,

870
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,080
 but Auntie Hing and Auntie Heng have run the creche

871
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:06,080
 at our church pretty much every Sunday for 30 years

872
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,520
 here at the vine.

873
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,640
 For almost 30 years, these two ladies

874
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,400
 have served our creche ministry at the vine.

875
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,600
 They have sat and looked after the youngest

876
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:24,160
 of the children of our church for almost 30 years.

877
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,520
 If you've been coming to the vine for any period of time

878
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:30,080
 and you've had a young child, a toddler or below,

879
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:34,640
 here at the vine, these ladies have looked after your child.

880
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,000
 These were the ladies that spoke faith into your children

881
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,520
 before anyone else did.

882
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,680
 These were the ones who never did it for spotlight,

883
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,000
 fame, never did it so that we'd put their photo

884
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,840
 up in front of everybody.

885
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,080
 In fact, when we told them we were doing this,

886
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,040
 they ran away.

887
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:53,640
 But for 30 years, Jesus would say to us at the vine,

888
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,900
 we were fortunate to be in their presence.

889
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:00,160
 These two lovely ladies have just resigned.

890
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,920
 They've come off of our staff now.

891
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,720
 We took this photo just a few weeks ago

892
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,320
 as we were celebrating them for their years of service.

893
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,820
 They've both resigned and they're retiring

894
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,720
 and they're wanting to spend more time with their families

895
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,540
 and do a bit of traveling to visit their families overseas.

896
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,660
 We honor them, we bless them.

897
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:18,480
 I think when the Lord looks at these two women,

898
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,160
 he says like he did at the end of the parable

899
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,560
 of the talents, well done, my good and faithful servants.

900
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,880
 You are faithful in the small things.

901
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,040
 Now come and share in your master's happiness.

902
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,360
 And how about for you?

903
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:34,620
 How is it that you are being called to be faithful?

904
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,880
 What is it that God has put into your hands?

905
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,320
 What are some of the small things that he has blessed

906
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,680
 and given to you and challenged you with?

907
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,160
 We often say here at the vine

908
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,000
 that large doors swing on small hinges.

909
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,360
 And this church is filled with these incredibly small hinges

910
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,140
 like me and you.

911
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,920
 People who have been tasked by God to do one thing,

912
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:03,580
 something, and maybe it's a small thing in our eyes,

913
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,280
 but you need to understand this,

914
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,440
 that the small things for us are not small for God.

915
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,880
 In his eyes, it's actually those things

916
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,840
 that become the moment by which our souls are shaped

917
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:19,560
 and we're able to see the value of the kingdom of God

918
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,040
 and the treasures that are within it.

919
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,620
 That's the beauty of the small things,

920
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,780
 our faithful commitment to that.

921
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:28,220
 And perhaps as we start this season,

922
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:31,000
 we need to resist a little bit of that desire we have

923
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,640
 for the bigger and the greater and the better

924
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,800
 and actually realize that the one small thing

925
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,640
 that everybody else might think is nothing much at all.

926
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,480
 As we remain faithful to that,

927
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,480
 God can lead us where he wants to lead us.

928
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,560
 It was of course Mother Teresa

929
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,120
 who said that famous thing, didn't she?

930
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,560
 "Not all of us get to do great things,

931
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,500
 "but all of us can do small things with great love."

932
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,680
 And I think that in many ways is the heart

933
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,280
 of what this passage around Jason is all about.

934
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,600
 A man who did small things but with great love.

935
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,080
 Love for his city, love for Paul and Silas,

936
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,240
 love for the gospel.

937
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:10,400
 And as we think about us beginning this journey

938
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,600
 that's ahead of us,

939
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,480
 what are some of these small things that we can do?

940
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,360
 In that evening when I was having dinner with the priest,

941
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,680
 I asked him at one point, I said,

942
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,800
 "Have you ever felt like giving up?"

943
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,040
 Which seemed like a reasonable question

944
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,680
 to ask a man who was pastoring a church

945
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,920
 without any people in it.

946
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,920
 And I asked him the question,

947
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,840
 he stood there or sat there

948
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,040
 and just kind of thought about it for a bit

949
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,160
 and he said these beautiful words.

950
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,840
 He said, "Let me be honest with you."

951
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,960
 He said, "There have been many times

952
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,560
 "when I've asked the Father why.

953
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,780
 "Why does it appear that there's not a lot of fruit

954
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,780
 "in my ministry?

955
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:47,020
 "But I've come to tell over the years

956
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:51,040
 "that God very rarely answers the whys of life."

957
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,340
 He said, "In fact, the why is his concern, but not mine."

958
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,980
 He said, "My concern is the thing he's asked me to do

959
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:59,120
 "and that I will not give up on."

960
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:02,600
 There's a moment in the Old Testament

961
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,200
 where God calls Nehemiah to rebuild the walls

962
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,240
 around Jerusalem.

963
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,600
 It's this beautiful thing that God asks Nehemiah to do.

964
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,080
 And as a leader of Israel at the time,

965
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,120
 it was an incredibly hard project.

966
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,360
 And you can look through his story

967
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,700
 to see how many times he wanted to let it go,

968
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,280
 how many times he faced opposition,

969
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,920
 how many times it cost him dearly

970
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,840
 to see through that project.

971
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,960
 And there's this one point where Nehemiah is so worn down

972
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,100
 by the challenges and the opposition

973
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,560
 that he actually turns to God and he says this,

974
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,720
 "Lord, I cannot do this on my own."

975
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,640
 So he says, "Strengthen my hands."

976
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,840
 In other words, I wanna be found faithful,

977
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,040
 but I know that this is such a challenging time.

978
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,320
 There's so much criticism, so much attack.

979
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,000
 I feel so worn down.

980
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,760
 I don't think I can do it on my own strength.

981
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,000
 So he turns to God and he says, "Strengthen my hands

982
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,760
 "'cause you put something in these hands.

983
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,860
 "And you put something in these hands

984
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,400
 "that you're calling me to be faithful to

985
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,320
 "and I need your help.

986
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:59,080
 "So would you strengthen my hands?"

987
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,260
 Every single person in this room,

988
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,200
 God has placed something in your hands.

989
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,480
 Sometimes when you compare it with others,

990
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,720
 you think what you've got in your hand is nothing.

991
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,760
 God doesn't look at that.

992
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,920
 He doesn't compare things like that.

993
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,800
 He looks at you and says, "I've placed that in your hand.

994
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,000
 "I've placed that in your hand.

995
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,220
 "I've placed that in your hand.

996
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,040
 "I've placed that in your hand."

997
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,200
 And here's the mere definition of success.

998
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,720
 Here's when God will look over you and say,

999
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,360
 "Well done, my good and faithful servant."

1000
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,600
 He'll just say, "Have you been faithful?

1001
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,080
 "Have you just been faithful

1002
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,760
 "with that little thing I put in your hand?"

1003
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,260
 And if you're feeling like you're about to give up,

1004
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:34,460
 simple prayer, "Strengthen my hands."

1005
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,980
 Can I pray for you for that?

1006
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,260
 I wonder whether you would stand with me

1007
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:40,680
 and let's just come before the Lord together as a community.

1008
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:50,460
 Maybe as you just quieten your heart before him.

1009
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:59,240
 Perhaps you are like me many times in my ministry,

1010
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,280
 in my life,

1011
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:05,440
 where you felt like turning around, giving up.

1012
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,360
 For some of you, maybe it's a relationship.

1013
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,320
 Maybe there's been a really challenging relationship

1014
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:15,240
 in your life and maybe for some of you, it's your marriage.

1015
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,840
 Maybe it's a relationship with a boss

1016
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,640
 or maybe it's a family member

1017
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,760
 and you're so tempted to give up on it.

1018
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,980
 Some of you have been praying for your children

1019
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:27,900
 to come to faith and you're so, so close to giving up.

1020
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:32,200
 Some of you have been trying really hard in something

1021
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,960
 and you felt like you'd been faithful and you have been.

1022
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,800
 And it feels like that there's no fruit,

1023
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,640
 just like that priest on the Camino.

1024
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,240
 He must have many times said, "Why do I even bother?"

1025
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,120
 It's easy for us, I think at times,

1026
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,800
 because faithfulness is a counter-cultural call.

1027
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,740
 We're living in a day and age now

1028
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,640
 where faithfulness is not cool.

1029
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,100
 Actually, the cool thing is,

1030
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,660
 is to change your job every three seconds.

1031
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:00,220
 The cool thing is not to actually put roots down.

1032
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,700
 The cool thing is to be fancy free,

1033
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:04,340
 just to travel and do whatever you want.

1034
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:06,100
 The cool thing is to give up.

1035
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,340
 The cool thing is to just let go.

1036
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:11,160
 The cool thing is to not be tied down.

1037
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:15,740
 But the Bible says is that the kingdom of God

1038
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:19,000
 is against the pressures and the spirits of this age.

1039
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,200
 Perhaps for some of us in this room,

1040
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,700
 there's a fear of commitment.

1041
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:28,580
 There's a fear of staying the course.

1042
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:33,140
 And I wanna speak over you

1043
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:36,660
 that the Lord is calling for His church

1044
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:39,580
 and He's saying, "Will I find it faithful?"

1045
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:45,340
 And so I wanna pray over you here this afternoon.

1046
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:46,940
 If this is resonating for you,

1047
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:49,820
 if you realize that there are some challenges

1048
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:50,700
 in this space for you,

1049
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:53,060
 if you feel like you're exhausted and worn out,

1050
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:53,900
 you wanna give up,

1051
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,860
 if you feel like running in the other direction,

1052
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:57,720
 totally understandably I know,

1053
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,920
 'cause I feel like that many times too.

1054
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,100
 I wonder whether you just open your hands before you,

1055
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,640
 just in the quietness of this moment

1056
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,460
 and whilst all our eyes are closed.

1057
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:06,940
 And by opening your hands in front of you,

1058
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:08,500
 you're just opening your hands

1059
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:12,100
 and you're gonna say that prayer that Nehemiah prayed.

1060
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,980
 Lord, would you strengthen these hands?

1061
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,300
 I feel like giving up.

1062
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,700
 I feel like turning away.

1063
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:19,580
 I feel like not sticking the course.

1064
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:20,660
 It's been difficult.

1065
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:21,540
 It's been hard.

1066
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:24,740
 The Lord knows the pain that you've been through.

1067
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:27,380
 The Lord sees that pain and He loves you

1068
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:28,460
 and He knows it's not easy.

1069
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:31,900
 There's Jason before the people, paying the bond price.

1070
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:34,940
 Christ on the cross, the ultimate price paid

1071
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:38,940
 for the glory of our forgiveness and freedom.

1072
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,660
 And I believe in this time,

1073
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:43,820
 He's looking for a church that's faithful,

1074
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:46,020
 not a church that's successful,

1075
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:48,460
 not at least in terms of how the world defines it.

1076
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:51,420
 So Lord, I wanna pray for the men and women

1077
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:53,900
 in this room right now whose hands are open before you.

1078
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,620
 I wanna pray by the power of the Spirit

1079
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:59,360
 and the hope that there is and the procession of life

1080
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,940
 that comes against every procession of death.

1081
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:05,520
 And Lord, anyone in this room who's worn out, tired,

1082
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,940
 who's struggled to stay the course,

1083
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:11,340
 Lord, we wanna pray right now, strengthen their hands.

1084
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:15,060
 In the name of Jesus, we pray, strengthen their hands.

1085
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:16,540
 Lord, whether that's for work,

1086
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:17,980
 whether that's for marriages,

1087
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:19,700
 whether it's for relationships,

1088
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:21,820
 whether it's for their relationship with you,

1089
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:24,860
 whatever part of their life that resonates with,

1090
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:26,720
 but Lord, I wanna pray that you would strengthen them

1091
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,220
 for the course that you have set them, Lord.

1092
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:32,260
 I wanna pray that whether they see breakthrough or not,

1093
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:35,500
 they would say, the Lord has asked of me this one thing,

1094
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,540
 and I will be found faithful,

1095
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:41,020
 that I have a heart and a desire and a hunger,

1096
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:42,420
 no matter what it might cost,

1097
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,540
 no matter how challenging it might be,

1098
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:47,380
 I wanna be successful in the eyes of the kingdom,

1099
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:50,360
 even if that means failure in the eyes of the world,

1100
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,120
 strengthen our hands, Lord.

1101
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:57,420
 Strengthen your hands of your church, Lord.

1102
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:00,180
 And I wanna pray that joy would be released,

1103
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:03,220
 that Lord, it might not be easy,

1104
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:04,700
 the path that might be ahead,

1105
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:08,700
 uncharted waters don't guarantee us an easy time,

1106
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:11,460
 but I wanna pray for joy in the journey, Lord.

1107
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:15,540
 Just like that priest who was so,

1108
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:18,780
 his eyes lit up when he saw an empty church,

1109
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:21,220
 I pray these people's eyes would light up

1110
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:26,860
 as they stay faithful to what you've placed in their hands.

1111
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:29,420
 And we pray this in Jesus' name, amen.

1112
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:30,900
 Amen.

1113
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,480
 (gentle music)

1114
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:36,060
 (gentle music)

1115
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:46,060
