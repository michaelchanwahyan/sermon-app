[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   our hearts be in tune with your spirit.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.760]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.800]   - Amen, thank you, Carla.
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.420]   Good morning, everybody.
[00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.160]   How are you guys doing?
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.480]   Good, well, we are starting a brand new series
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.520]   and I wanna kick this off by telling you a story
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.200]   of, I think, when was it?
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.960]   July 3rd, 2018.
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.000]   I had this experience, this really big,
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   life-changing, life-altering, hit-me-at-my-core
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.020]   kind of experience, an experience, an encounter, actually,
[00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.200]   that has stayed with me every day,
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.660]   literally every day since.
[00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.440]   It has shaped who I am in so many ways.
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.560]   It has given me things to think about.
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.420]   It was unexpected, things didn't go according to plan,
[00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.360]   but it stuck with me.
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.520]   I wanna share with you about the time I had dinner
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.740]   with Pastor Jethro.
[00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.200]   Who's sitting over there?
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.440]   So let me tell you about Jethro.
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.040]   Back in 2018, I was new to the Vine.
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.160]   I had been here for a few months, maybe,
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.640]   and I was a worship pastor, and I was learning the ropes
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.160]   and trying to get to know everyone here.
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.040]   So Jethro was a core team member.
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.600]   He was the best keyboard player on the team,
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.000]   and I'm like, "I'm gonna get to know Jethro.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.320]   "I'm gonna learn some things about this team."
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.960]   So I asked him to dinner, and we're texting back and forth,
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.180]   like us young people do, and I'm like,
[00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.880]   "Yo, Jeth, let's have dinner."
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.080]   He's like, "All right, cool.
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.720]   "Where do you wanna go?"
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.200]   So this is my version of the story.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.480]   You can fact-check me later if Jethro says otherwise,
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.200]   but what happened was I texted him.
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.320]   I'm like, "LCK, okay?"
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.720]   Now, if you spend all your time on Hong Kong Island,
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.000]   you don't know what LCK is, but if you ever go to Kowloon,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.360]   LCK stands for Lai Chi Kok, right?
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.400]   That's where I used to live.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.240]   That was my hood.
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.640]   All the CIS teachers are clapping
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.640]   'cause that's their hood as well.
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.400]   So I say, "LCK, okay?"
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.600]   And that was the last of kind of
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.480]   what I thought the conversation was.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.040]   I don't know, about 30, 45 minutes, an hour later,
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.760]   I get a message from Jethro and it says,
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.120]   "I'm in Wan Chai."
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.400]   I'm like, "What's wrong with Jethro?"
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.240]   I'm just getting to know him.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.640]   I'm like, "What's his issue?"
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.640]   So I look at my phone and I'm like,
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.560]   "Why are you in Wan Chai?"
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.380]   He goes, "Dinner, dot, dot, dot, question mark,"
[00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.160]   with a little creepy eye emoji.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.520]   So then I go back and I'm like,
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.180]   "Why is he thinking we're supposed to be in?"
[00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.100]   So I go back to my messages.
[00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.800]   I'm about to call him out and be like,
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.760]   "Buddy, learn how to read."
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.640]   So I'm scrolling through and I'm like,
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.800]   "Oh no."
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.520]   I realized that I had been a victim of autocorrect.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.600]   See, I had typed L-C-K, okay, right?
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.740]   So L-C-K, okay.
[00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.280]   What came out was, "Pick," P-I-C-K.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.200]   So Jethro did that.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.040]   He picked.
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.520]   And he picked Wan Chai.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.440]   And I was in, and apparently I actually agreed to this.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.600]   So he went back and read the messages
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.560]   and apparently I'm not thinking when I'm responding.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.440]   He's like, "Yeah, yeah, sure, sure, sure, whatever."
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.160]   So I'd actually agreed to the thumbs up
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.320]   to coming to Wan Chai.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.040]   And I'm standing in Lychee Cog, MTR, waiting for Jethro.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.400]   He's in Wan Chai waiting for me.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.800]   And Jethro being the saint that he is,
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.360]   leaves Wan Chai and goes all the way to Lychee Cog.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.200]   Let me explain.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.400]   He was in Science Park up in Taipo,
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.240]   came all the way down to,
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.080]   yes, feel bad for him.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.040]   I'm a terrible friend.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.280]   That's the moral of the story.
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.360]   But regardless, this has never left me
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.340]   because Jethro to this day still judges me for my typos,
[00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.440]   regularly coming at me about the typos that I have,
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.440]   whether it's in the WhatsApp message or in like an email,
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.160]   anything, he's always looking at my typos.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.160]   It's the one thing he focuses on.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.120]   To the point where my birthday was this past Thursday.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.600]   I turned 34 and I'm excited
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.680]   and I get my first happy birthday
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.240]   and it's from my friend Jethro, which is great.
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.640]   But then online, so that everyone can see it,
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.600]   he posts this beautiful post.
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.360]   Thanks for coming into my life and staying into my life.
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.940]   But in that same post, he's like,
[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.860]   "I love you, typos and all."
[00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.060]   The shade, y'all.
[00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.440]   Like he just has not left me alone.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.640]   This was not just an experience.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.040]   It was an encounter with Jethro and with proofreading
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.480]   and with autocorrect.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.640]   And let me just say, I have learned my lesson,
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.600]   or I try at least,
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.340]   I think I still have some typos here and there.
[00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.360]   But it stayed with me.
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.880]   I share this because it was more than an experience.
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:05.720]   It was an encounter.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.680]   It's something that has actually shaped me.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.980]   I really do think about what I text and I do go back
[00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.620]   and if I'm meeting someone somewhere,
[00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.480]   I double check where it's at, right?
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.720]   It has stayed with me, it has shaped me in a certain way.
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.920]   And encounters do this to us all.
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.480]   When we have a big, meaningful encounter, it shapes us.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.420]   It redirects us.
[00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.280]   It changes our perspective to some extent.
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.980]   And when we have encounters with God,
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.040]   well, that changes us even more.
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.160]   It seems like the impacts that come from an encounter
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.800]   with God somehow are more magnified.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.360]   They are multiplied to a higher degree.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.720]   When we have an encounter with God,
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.040]   it shapes our intimacy with him.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.560]   It helps us to get to know him better.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.800]   When we have an encounter with God,
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.200]   we get shaped and molded more into his likeness.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.680]   We become more like him when we encounter him.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.160]   These encounters help us see God more clearly.
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.960]   These encounters help us shake lies
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.240]   that we once believed about ourselves.
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.720]   It helps us shake delusions and stand on truth.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.080]   Encounters with God is important.
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.480]   It's very important 'cause the effects of an encounter
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.760]   with God can last with us for the rest of our lives.
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.800]   The effects of our encounters with God show us
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.840]   that we don't have to solely rely on ourselves to get by.
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.520]   It's not just us looking out for us.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.860]   In an encounter with God, God encounters us
[00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.740]   to show us that we are not alone in this and all that we do.
[00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.960]   So with this in mind,
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.720]   we've designed this five-week sermon series
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.720]   to look at five very familiar passages in the Old Testament,
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.720]   some key biblical figures that you might have heard of,
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.120]   might have read before,
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.680]   and their encounters,
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.960]   hoping that as we look and see the moments
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.700]   where God showed up,
[00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.280]   it would encourage us to allow God to show up
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.400]   in unexpected ways at unexpected times in our lives
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.100]   'cause it seems like when we allow those things to happen,
[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.380]   we get changed at our core.
[00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.380]   I pray that it allows you to posture yourself
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.320]   as we study these encounters
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.580]   to become open to a holy disruption
[00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.920]   that will shake who you are to the core of who you are.
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.040]   Does that sound okay?
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.840]   So that's where we're gonna be going.
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.360]   So let me just bring this up to us
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.920]   and kind of give us a good working definition
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.760]   of an encounter.
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.480]   Encounters with God are these impactful moments,
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.640]   oftentimes unexpected, unprepared for, unanticipated,
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.600]   yet they end up changing us,
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.400]   helping us see God more truly for who he is
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.560]   and who we are, giving us strength,
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.560]   giving us confidence and resolve.
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.160]   This is what an encounter of God can do.
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.520]   But it's good to know that encounters
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.920]   don't all look the same.
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.360]   They don't all happen the same way.
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.120]   Encounters aren't just limited to certain kinds of people.
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.580]   I think by nature we might think an encounter with God
[00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.760]   must mean that we are living rightfully
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.760]   and we are the most holy of people.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.040]   But encounters of God we'll see range from men to women
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:06.120]   to priests to sinners to liars to anybody.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.240]   So many people can encounter God.
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.680]   And I say that because I want you to know
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.600]   that you don't have to have all your stuff together
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.160]   to have an encounter with God.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.880]   You don't have to be a certain level of Christian
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.800]   to encounter God.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.160]   Like I said, encounters don't all take place
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.000]   in the same way.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.160]   Some encounters take place in a cave.
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.000]   Some encounters take place on mountaintops.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.100]   Some encounters take place in the flames
[00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.360]   of Nebuchadnezzar's furnace.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.320]   Some encounters take place in the temple.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.920]   Some encounters take place in the room.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.920]   Some encounters take place at the Ford of Jabbok.
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:44.760]   Crossing over and exist with the wrestling of God.
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.440]   So today our first encounter we're gonna look at
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.480]   is a man who is a liar, who's a thief,
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.960]   who swindles, who doesn't have it all right,
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.160]   who cheats to get ahead.
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.880]   We're gonna look at the man called Jacob today.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.240]   Jacob's, well, there's a Jacob here.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.120]   I'm sorry, bro.
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.960]   Jacob has a wild story.
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.080]   He's a twin.
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.700]   He's a younger brother, right?
[00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:13.660]   And God would tell his mother that the youngest son
[00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:14.680]   would lead the oldest.
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.440]   I think the verbatim is the oldest will bow down
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.260]   and submit to the younger one.
[00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.520]   This was Jacob's prophecy.
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.600]   This was counter-cultural.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.560]   This wasn't normal.
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.240]   Normally the inheritance and the blessing
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.760]   goes to the oldest son, but Jacob as a twin
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.120]   ends up being the second son, and there's a promise
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.080]   that he would be the one to carry it forward.
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.580]   And it's important that we understand Jacob's name
[00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.480]   'cause names mean something.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.120]   Names are not just, you know, what's popular,
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.040]   top 100 girl names or guy names this year.
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.800]   Names were super significant.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.680]   You named someone something because you wanted
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:49.120]   to see something in them or in a response to a promise
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.700]   or because God had done something.
[00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.400]   So your name was a sense of your identity.
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:58.080]   A name was a sense of foreshadowing or reputation.
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.320]   And Jacob's name would mean the supplanter
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.360]   or the heel grabber because, silly enough,
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.600]   when he came out of the womb,
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.280]   he was holding on to his brother's heel.
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.400]   So his parents saw that and they're like,
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:10.840]   "Oh, this guy's ambitious.
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.840]   "We're gonna call him Jacob."
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:13.760]   And that would be his name.
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:17.600]   In Genesis 26, God would tell Rebecca
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.520]   that the children wrestle and struggle inside of you.
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:27.600]   Jacob would earn the full aspect of his name later on,
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.440]   which I think some of us who are familiar
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.500]   would think Jacob means deceiver.
[00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.680]   So for those of us familiar with the story,
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:36.680]   Jacob tricks his older brother Esau.
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:41.360]   He deceives him into selling his birthright for some stew,
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.760]   for some stew.
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.760]   I mean, talk about a low bar.
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.840]   So his brother sells his birthright.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.000]   Jacob ends up taking it.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.360]   Jacob ends up lying in the inheritance swap
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:54.440]   and he takes what was, I guess, meant for his brother.
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.200]   And Esau would say this in his complaint.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.100]   "Is he not rightly named Jacob?
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:00.180]   "For he has cheated me these two times.
[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:02.600]   "He took away my birthright and behold,
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.840]   "he has taken away my blessing."
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.320]   Jacob is a deceiver.
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.080]   He's the one who steals to get ahead.
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.200]   He's the one who cheats to get to first place.
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.840]   He supplants or trips up his brother.
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.760]   He wrestles him in the womb, wrestles him in birth,
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.960]   and wrestles him in their relationship.
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.080]   But don't worry, it gets better.
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.960]   Jacob is holistic in his wrestling.
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.000]   He doesn't just leave it to his brother.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.240]   He continues wrestling in other aspects of his life.
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.700]   His brother wants to kill him
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:30.160]   because he has taken what belonged to him.
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.520]   So Jacob runs and flees and he meets this woman
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.680]   named Rachel, beautiful woman, I guess,
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.320]   because he's willing to enter into a contract
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:42.540]   to work seven years so that he can marry her.
[00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.200]   The story goes he works seven years
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.520]   and he thinks he's gonna get Rachel.
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:52.200]   On the wedding day, he actually doesn't get Rachel.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.560]   The dad tricked him.
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.840]   The dad deceived him.
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.200]   The dad wrestled with him.
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.480]   And actually he gives him the other daughter, Leah.
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.680]   And Jacob's annoyed because, Bible says this,
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.980]   Rachel was the beautiful one, Leah was not so much.
[00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:11.800]   So he couldn't get Rachel because he had just gotten Leah.
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.800]   So the father's like, well, if you want Rachel,
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.920]   I'm not gonna give you both of my daughters for one price.
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.920]   You have to work another seven more years.
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.680]   So Jacob's been working for 14 years
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.940]   just to get the thing he thought he deserved.
[00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.840]   Wrestling.
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:26.680]   And it continues.
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:31.680]   His land and his property, his sheep and his cattle end up,
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.040]   him and Laban live in the same area.
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.260]   They've decided to separate into two parts of the space
[00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.100]   so that there would be no mixing
[00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:38.800]   and all of Laban's things would be Laban's,
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.480]   all of Jacob's things would be Jacob's.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:44.340]   But all of Jacob's cattle are bigger and stronger
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:47.060]   and look better and look healthier than Laban's,
[00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:50.680]   which creates conflict between him and his father-in-law.
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:51.520]   Wrestling.
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.520]   This theme of wrestling just continues
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.380]   and continues for Jacob.
[00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.500]   He wrestles with Esau.
[00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.460]   He wrestles with Laban.
[00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:03.340]   He uses strategy to try and figure out
[00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.580]   how do I get myself out of these situations?
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:07.260]   How do I get what I deserve?
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.180]   He fights, he wrestles.
[00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:11.260]   This is just his life at this point.
[00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:16.460]   But it would appear that God wanted more
[00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:18.660]   from him and of him.
[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.340]   And so when we take a look here at Genesis 32
[00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:24.820]   where we have that famous encounter,
[00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.300]   starting at verse 22 it says this.
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:29.340]   The same night he, speaking of Jacob, arose,
[00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:32.460]   took his two wives, his two female servants,
[00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:36.940]   and his 11 children, crossed the ford at Jabbok.
[00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:39.300]   He took them and sent them across the stream
[00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.300]   and everything else that he had.
[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:43.280]   And Jacob was left alone.
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:47.940]   And a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the day.
[00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:50.340]   When the man saw that he did not prevail against Jacob,
[00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:53.740]   he touched his hip socket and Jacob's hip
[00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.740]   was put out of joint as he wrestled with him.
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:59.100]   Then he said, "Let me go, for the day is broken."
[00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.100]   But Jacob said, "I will not let you go
[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:02.980]   "unless you bless me."
[00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.180]   And he said, "What is your name?"
[00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:05.220]   He said, "Jacob."
[00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.720]   Then he said, "You shall no longer be called Jacob,
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.340]   "but Israel, for you have striven with God
[00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:12.800]   "and with men and have prevailed."
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:17.220]   Then Jacob asked him, "Please tell me your name."
[00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.780]   But he said, "Why is it that you ask my name?"
[00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:22.020]   And there he blessed him.
[00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:25.740]   So Jacob called the name of this place Peniel,
[00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:28.100]   saying, "I have seen God face to face,
[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:31.180]   "and yet my life has been delivered."
[00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.980]   What has happened in this moment?
[00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.060]   Just a little bit of more context
[00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:37.120]   so that we really get this wrestle,
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.940]   because this is a massive encounter with God.
[00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:42.100]   This is an orthodox encounter with God,
[00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:43.300]   and we have to understand.
[00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:45.080]   So Jacob is getting ready to go back home.
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.900]   He's been away from home for all these years,
[00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:50.980]   and he's carrying his family and all the things he has,
[00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.540]   and he gets word that his brother,
[00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:56.700]   who hated him, who wanted to kill him, was ahead of him.
[00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.460]   So naturally, that scares him.
[00:13:58.460 --> 00:13:59.500]   Then the word gets worse.
[00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:04.500]   His brother is with 400 men ahead of him.
[00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.940]   Naturally, Jacob gets a little nervous,
[00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:08.300]   slows down a little bit, and thinks,
[00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:09.180]   okay, well, what do I do?
[00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:11.380]   I have a wife, I have two wives, I have kids,
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:13.220]   I have 11 children, I have all this stuff.
[00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:15.540]   How are we gonna make it if my brother
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.380]   wants revenge for what I've done?
[00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:20.420]   He is in a desperate, broken moment.
[00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:21.620]   So he gets clever.
[00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:25.380]   He sends some of his best stuff ahead.
[00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:26.900]   He goes, take this to Esau.
[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:30.580]   When you see Esau say, these are gifts from Jacob.
[00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:33.320]   So he tries to use a little bit of cleverness, strategy,
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:36.260]   maybe not trickery, but a little bit of deceit.
[00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:37.420]   He doesn't really wanna give him gifts,
[00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:39.340]   he just doesn't wanna get killed, right?
[00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:40.160]   Makes sense.
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.100]   He's doing the best that he can.
[00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.220]   He's doing what he thinks he needs to do,
[00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:44.040]   but he's worried.
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.460]   He's at his lowest point here.
[00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:50.140]   He has all this stuff, yet he still is at this moment of,
[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.180]   what do I do?
[00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:56.180]   In tension, in brokenness, the unexpected then happens.
[00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:59.580]   He's unprepared, and unexpectedly,
[00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:02.740]   he has this encounter with God in the form of a fight.
[00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:03.820]   I'm just gonna be honest.
[00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:06.780]   When I encounter God, I hope he's not trying to fight me.
[00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:09.680]   That must have been a moment.
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.200]   But how poetically beautiful is it
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.300]   that most of Jacob's life has been marked symbolically
[00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:16.980]   with this aspect of wrestling.
[00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:18.940]   And when he encounters God,
[00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:23.220]   his encounter with him is through what?
[00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:25.380]   Through a wrestle, through a struggle.
[00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:30.380]   God meets him in a language that he is overly familiar with.
[00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:32.580]   And the first thing we have to note here
[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:36.060]   is how God meets him on these challenging terms.
[00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:39.020]   The context of his situation were not ideal.
[00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:43.820]   God meets him here in his mess, in his brokenness.
[00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:47.540]   When we need him the most, that's when God meets us.
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.660]   And I think it's something that we have to keep in mind
[00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:52.580]   because a lot of us subconsciously live in a way
[00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.580]   that seeks out pleasure and avoids pain.
[00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.540]   But what if it's in the pain
[00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.380]   that God plans to speak the loudest?
[00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:01.020]   What if it's in the pain
[00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:03.300]   that God plans on encountering you?
[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:08.400]   If our life is constantly avoiding the difficult,
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:13.700]   do we potentially avoid these encounters with God?
[00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:16.660]   So if you're struggling,
[00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:18.860]   if you're in a place of brokenness,
[00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:21.620]   if your life is going less than expected,
[00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:24.220]   if you've run into unexpected conflict and trouble
[00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:27.020]   and things just don't seem right,
[00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:28.640]   if you're in your darkest place,
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.980]   if you're in a moment of tension and pain,
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.580]   if your circumstances leave you desperate,
[00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:36.420]   that's an open door for an encounter.
[00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:39.680]   That's what we see here in Jacob.
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:43.300]   God has a funny way of showing up most clear
[00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:45.820]   in our darkest hours.
[00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:47.140]   And so I wonder what would happen
[00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:49.460]   if in those moments of darkness,
[00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:52.340]   we sought him instead of running away.
[00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:58.260]   It leads me to the second thing that I noticed in this story
[00:16:58.260 --> 00:16:59.820]   and that's around prayer,
[00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:03.540]   how prayer is essential to an encounter with God.
[00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:05.060]   So that's exactly what Jacob does.
[00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:06.780]   In verse nine, he prays.
[00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:08.020]   It's gonna come up on here.
[00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:10.620]   I'm just gonna read a couple of points from his prayer.
[00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:11.500]   He prays to God.
[00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.180]   He says, "You told me to return to my country
[00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:15.500]   "that you would do good.
[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.560]   "I'm not worthy of the least of the deeds
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.380]   "of your steadfast love and all your faithfulness
[00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:21.020]   "that you've shown me.
[00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:23.160]   "For even though when I crossed,
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.720]   "when I only had my staff, I crossed the Jordan,
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.460]   "and now I have become two camps.
[00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:30.420]   "Please deliver me from the hand of my brother,
[00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:32.180]   "from the hand of Esau," listen to this,
[00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:34.060]   "for I fear him."
[00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:38.740]   I love that Jacob, when he prays in this moment,
[00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:40.740]   before he does anything,
[00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:42.220]   he doesn't have the best words.
[00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:45.380]   This isn't like super sophisticated big man prayer, right?
[00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:48.180]   He's not using anything fancy.
[00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:51.460]   He's just positioning himself authentically
[00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:52.780]   in front of God.
[00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:54.500]   He doesn't have to have a seminary degree.
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.300]   He doesn't have to have been in church for all his life.
[00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:59.240]   He's just exposing his heart to God.
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:00.900]   We can do this, right?
[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:05.480]   We can just share where we are with God.
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:07.540]   I mean, what would happen if we did this?
[00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:10.300]   If there's something that's found
[00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:15.060]   when we turn our dependence on God into a prayer to God?
[00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:18.220]   What if that's what prayer really is about,
[00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:22.740]   being honest with him and being honest with yourself,
[00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.540]   that perhaps you've not been worthy,
[00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:25.860]   but actually God's been good.
[00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:26.940]   God has done things.
[00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:29.740]   It's fascinating.
[00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:33.020]   Jacob is at this point where he might get killed
[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:35.300]   and everything he has might be destroyed,
[00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:37.380]   and he recounts the blessings of God.
[00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.360]   He goes, "When I first got here, God,
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.400]   "I just had my staff.
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:41.240]   "I had nothing."
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.340]   It's the same concept of,
[00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:45.340]   I just had the clothes on my back and that's it.
[00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:47.500]   But now I'm here with two camps.
[00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:50.300]   He's speaking of the wealth that he's accumulated,
[00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:51.840]   of family, children.
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.160]   He has been blessed.
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:57.740]   And he's thanking God, first and foremost,
[00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:59.800]   I don't know how it's happened.
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.380]   I don't even think I deserve it.
[00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:04.520]   I've been unworthy of this, but you have been good.
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:09.060]   He recalls the faithfulness of God.
[00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:12.140]   His desperation does not blind him
[00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:14.440]   from the reality that God has been there
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.940]   and God has been blessing him.
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:19.200]   And then his prayer changes a bit.
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.980]   He pours out his heart to God.
[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:24.240]   My favorite thing that I learned in this entire passage
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.780]   when I was studying it was just,
[00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:28.280]   I didn't even learn it, I just read it and it hit me hard.
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.940]   He says, "I fear him.
[00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:32.300]   "I fear Esau."
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:34.840]   That is as clear, that is as honest,
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.920]   probably as vulnerable as it gets.
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.240]   He's raw.
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.980]   He's not trying to come up with anything strategic.
[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:44.340]   He's not trying to over-spiritualize
[00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:45.840]   or say it's this or say it's that
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.320]   or use some big fancy words.
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:51.000]   He is just being bare in front of God.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.380]   That level of authenticity,
[00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:56.800]   that level of purely exposing where your heart is,
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.700]   no pretentiousness, no big words,
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.360]   just showing God your heart.
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:05.020]   What if that's an element to prayer?
[00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:07.680]   What if that's a powerful part of prayer?
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:08.660]   What if that's the gateway?
[00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:11.420]   What if that's what kickstarts things in our life?
[00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:16.100]   Just truly coming before him and being properly honest
[00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:19.280]   about what it is we feel, about where it is we are.
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:25.520]   See, Jacob, he prays,
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:28.120]   but he doesn't have his big encounter when he prays.
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.920]   Think about that.
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:32.900]   He says his prayer and no big moment happens.
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:38.360]   No, the big, the encounter comes
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.000]   because he opens himself up.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.400]   He prays, nothing happens.
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.600]   In the moment of praying,
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.800]   there's no big miracle or anything,
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:49.180]   but praying seemed to open the door.
[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:55.040]   Prayer, therefore, is essential to an encounter with God.
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:57.200]   See, after his prayer, I love this as well.
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.540]   The Bible doesn't sugarcoat things.
[00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:00.720]   Genesis is for us broken people.
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.800]   Jacob has this prayer.
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.100]   He's thanked God.
[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:04.680]   He's been honest with God,
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:05.960]   and I think for lots of us,
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.720]   we think that if we just do it like that,
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.120]   then we'll become a better Christian right away.
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.160]   Let's look at this one more time.
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.360]   He does all these things.
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.040]   He does all the right things in his prayer,
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.640]   and then he goes back to strategizing.
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.160]   He goes back to leaning on his own strength.
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:19.720]   He goes back to being human.
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.320]   Like, he didn't all of a sudden become not human
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.320]   all of a sudden 'cause he prayed.
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:26.240]   I think some of us get discouraged 'cause we pray
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.200]   and we expect everything to change.
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.800]   We just all of a sudden are floating on clouds
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:30.960]   and we're more holy.
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.960]   We no longer deal with temptation anymore.
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.660]   That's actually not how it works.
[00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:37.440]   We've got to have the right picture of prayer.
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:38.800]   Sometimes you're gonna pray
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.400]   and you're still gonna struggle.
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.080]   That's the reality of our life,
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:44.880]   and I'm so glad that's clear in here.
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.680]   He leans back on his human tendency
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:50.040]   to control his next steps,
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:54.000]   but he's opened up a door.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.840]   By praying, he's started something.
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:01.440]   He's allowed something to happen,
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:02.280]   and then it does.
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:03.120]   It happens.
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:04.360]   He prayed in the beginning of the night.
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:07.800]   Later in the night, he has his encounter with God,
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.720]   and his encounter comes with a wrestle,
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:10.840]   which I think is weird.
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.800]   Like, of all the crazy things God can do
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:13.720]   when he encounters you,
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:15.160]   like, I guess for me, sign me up.
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:17.480]   I don't wanna wrestle God.
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:20.000]   I would much rather just have him talk to me
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.380]   and tell me who I am, all these things,
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:23.240]   but Jacob ends up wrestling him,
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.200]   and I'm pretty convinced Jacob had no idea
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.380]   it was God at first.
[00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:27.500]   It's the dark of night.
[00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:30.620]   He probably thinks maybe Esau sent somebody
[00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:33.200]   knowing I was coming to take me out.
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.960]   Maybe there's thieves and robbers around
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.060]   trying to take my stuff.
[00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:37.400]   I mean, I'm carrying all this stuff.
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.680]   I'm a well-off guy.
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:41.280]   He wrestles this guy, probably in self-defense,
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:43.800]   but at some point, something clicks in his head.
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:44.880]   This isn't human.
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:48.040]   I'm wrestling divinity.
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:52.400]   I am pushing against the creator of the universe.
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:55.120]   He becomes aware that he's wrestling with God,
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.120]   and what does he do?
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.180]   He doesn't let go.
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.400]   He holds on.
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:05.520]   He digs his heels, and he wholly commits himself
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.400]   to the fight.
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.240]   He holds on more.
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:13.340]   He struggles, he fights, he even gets his hip displaced.
[00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:16.400]   Fun fact, don't fight God, he'll break your hip.
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:17.640]   That's my takeaway today.
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:23.320]   But even in that space, it seems like that's when
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:26.120]   the change actually starts to begin.
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:30.840]   See, the old Jacob, his strategy, his way,
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:34.960]   his preference in doing things was through deception.
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.160]   The old Jacob would have tried to,
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.560]   when he realized this was God,
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:39.480]   he would have tried to deceive him.
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.040]   He would have tried to supplant.
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.320]   He would have tried to trick or try to get ahead
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:44.560]   or get something out of him.
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:46.840]   He would have tried to get his own way,
[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:50.560]   but instead, he wrestles him,
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.520]   which means he just holds on to him.
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.840]   Like, it doesn't say that he beats up God, right,
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:55.760]   or God beats him up.
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:56.720]   He fights with him.
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:01.400]   He's against, he's holding on with all that he has.
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:02.840]   It feels like it's in that moment, he's like,
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:05.560]   "God, if this is you, I have you.
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.440]   "I have your attention, you have mine,
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:09.500]   "and I'm not gonna let you go."
[00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:11.940]   That is his wrestle.
[00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:14.700]   It's a clinging on to God.
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:19.140]   With his one chance, he stays, he wrestles,
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:24.140]   he's got everything to lose, but Jacob clings to God.
[00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:29.100]   A clear indicator of his transformation
[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:34.100]   in the middle of all of this is that Jacob then asks,
[00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:35.700]   what do I mean by this?
[00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:38.980]   Well, so far, Jacob has been really good at taking, right?
[00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:40.540]   He's been really good at being clever,
[00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:42.440]   and whatever he thought was his,
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:45.020]   he would reach for it, he would take it.
[00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:47.820]   Think specifically to the birthright situation.
[00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:50.700]   There was a whole prophecy around how he would be the one
[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:52.820]   who would get the inheritance,
[00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:54.920]   but when things didn't go the way he thought,
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:56.180]   when it looked challenging,
[00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:58.120]   when it seemed like it was out of reach
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:24:59.500]   and God wasn't gonna do anything,
[00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:02.420]   he took it upon himself to get
[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:04.020]   what he thought belonged to him.
[00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:06.480]   So that would be the natural way
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:09.700]   that Jacob would engage in this space, but he asks.
[00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:12.180]   He asks.
[00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:14.460]   I think this is a big thing for a lot of us,
[00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:16.340]   because a lot of us live lives
[00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:20.180]   where we've got to take to get what we need.
[00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:21.380]   No one's really looking out for us.
[00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:23.860]   If I don't look out for me, who's gonna look out for me?
[00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:26.860]   And so we strive and we push and we take
[00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:28.620]   and we reach and we grab.
[00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:30.540]   If there's an obstacle in front of me and what I need,
[00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:32.080]   I've got to figure out a way to get it.
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:35.020]   We reach for whatever is around us.
[00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:38.220]   This is the natural way that our city operates.
[00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:41.500]   And this is the reality.
[00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.820]   Getting the right things the wrong way
[00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:46.560]   will never actually satisfy you.
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.780]   I mean, think about it.
[00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:50.100]   Jacob already got the blessing.
[00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:51.940]   Isaac actually blessed him.
[00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:53.580]   Esau actually gave away his birthright.
[00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:54.980]   He's already received the blessing.
[00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:56.380]   What is he fighting for?
[00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:59.660]   He's received the blessing, but he's in a moment
[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:01.480]   where he's terrified to go forward,
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:02.700]   where his whole world could be lost.
[00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:04.000]   He's received the blessing,
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.620]   but he's petrified to move forward.
[00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:07.860]   He has a wife and kids.
[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:09.460]   He has all the material things.
[00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:13.340]   He's been blessed, but yet he's in the darkest,
[00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:15.980]   most tense moment of his life.
[00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:19.700]   He's taken rather than received.
[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:21.540]   And this is actually something that we can trace back
[00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:23.920]   to the beginning of scripture in Genesis.
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:26.020]   We know that Adam and Eve, that the tree,
[00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:28.220]   the fruit on the tree looked desirable,
[00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:29.260]   looked good for eating.
[00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:31.380]   And when they are deceived, what do they do?
[00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:35.700]   Rather than going to the maker and asking him for it,
[00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:39.900]   they reach, they take for themselves.
[00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:43.300]   They become their own gods.
[00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:46.660]   And in doing that, they end up wrecking a relationship,
[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:49.420]   absolutely breaking the relationship with them
[00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:50.320]   and God.
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:53.320]   So here's a crazy thought then.
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:57.780]   Maybe the real blessing isn't the things we receive,
[00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:01.500]   but maybe it's the relationship we open up
[00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:04.380]   with the one who gives the thing in the first place.
[00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:08.380]   What if that's the whole thing?
[00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:11.700]   What if the true blessing is that relationship
[00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:13.660]   with the one who created it all,
[00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:16.960]   with the giver of the gift, not just the gift?
[00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:20.860]   And I think what happens is when we reach,
[00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:23.940]   we bypass the giver and we get the stuff,
[00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:27.980]   or at least the best that we can reach for.
[00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:30.140]   And I wonder how many times in our life
[00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:33.580]   God is planning to intervene, to meet us where we are,
[00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:36.560]   to show up, to give us what we need,
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:39.940]   but we end up taking matters into our own hands.
[00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:43.020]   We end up filling our hands with the things
[00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:46.660]   that we can reach for, giving us absolutely no space
[00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:49.420]   to receive the thing he has for us.
[00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:54.740]   We end up filling ourselves with these lesser store brand
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:57.980]   blessings that really don't fulfill us in the first place.
[00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:00.460]   We end up becoming our own heroes, our own God.
[00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:03.140]   We settle for the beta version, not the true thing.
[00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:06.660]   And Jacob in this moment has had enough of what he can do.
[00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:10.980]   He's seen what his striving and what his reaching
[00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:12.040]   has done for him.
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:15.620]   And it's not enough.
[00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:19.140]   So he reaches this point and in this encounter,
[00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:21.780]   he asks for the blessing.
[00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:23.020]   Slight difference.
[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:26.900]   He asks for the blessing versus taking the blessing.
[00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:28.940]   And that changes everything.
[00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:31.980]   I wonder what it would take for us
[00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:33.500]   to reach that point as well,
[00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:38.820]   where we recognize that actually,
[00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:40.980]   he says, "Knock, the door will be opened.
[00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:42.660]   "Ask and you will receive."
[00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:45.380]   The father withholds no good gift from his children.
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:48.380]   He actually says in scripture that if you wicked people
[00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:51.380]   can give your kids food and good gifts,
[00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:55.180]   how much more am I gonna give you things?
[00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:56.020]   Later in the New Testament,
[00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:58.220]   it says that every good and perfect thing
[00:28:58.220 --> 00:28:59.860]   comes from the father above.
[00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:02.660]   He is good and a giver of good stuff,
[00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:04.500]   but we're not gonna be able to see that.
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:06.180]   We're not gonna be able to receive that
[00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:09.940]   if we've taken for ourselves the best of what we can grab,
[00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:11.340]   the best of what we can do.
[00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:15.860]   This was Jacob.
[00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:18.620]   This was his dark moment, his lonely moment.
[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:21.340]   His encounter was so unorthodox,
[00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:24.540]   yet his healing was in his wrestle.
[00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:28.180]   And like he should, like we should,
[00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:33.180]   he wrestles through the night till dawn and he prevails.
[00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:34.540]   And what does it mean for him to prevail?
[00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:36.660]   It means that the old him has gone
[00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:38.620]   and a new version of him has come.
[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:41.260]   He is no longer Jacob the deceiver.
[00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:44.140]   He is now Jacob the requester.
[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:45.340]   He's truly prevailed.
[00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:48.380]   He has asked and God has blessed him.
[00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:52.180]   This encounter has been successful.
[00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:55.020]   God has met with him and he gets blessed,
[00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:56.620]   but I think there's a couple of details
[00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:59.780]   we need to really sit on before we continue.
[00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:01.300]   His situation hasn't changed.
[00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:03.060]   Has anyone noticed that yet?
[00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:05.700]   He meets with God as this awesome encounter,
[00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:08.060]   wrestles God, sees him face to face,
[00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:10.060]   but he still has a brother that might wanna kill him
[00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:11.780]   with 400 men.
[00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:13.220]   And his encounter with God didn't come
[00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:18.220]   with 400 mercenary angels ready to fight on his behalf.
[00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:21.660]   It didn't come with extra strength to be able to fight.
[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:24.020]   Actually, let's see, what does this encounter actually
[00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:26.420]   produce that says, "Your name shall no longer be called
[00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:29.000]   "Jacob, but Israel, for you have striven with God
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.540]   "and with men and you've prevailed."
[00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:34.660]   So in his asking of God, in his big encounter moment,
[00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:36.020]   he's finally done it all right.
[00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:37.100]   And what does he get?
[00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:39.380]   A limp and a new name.
[00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:41.260]   Take that to the battle.
[00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:42.460]   How does that even work?
[00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:43.340]   Think about this.
[00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:44.780]   It wasn't until Jethro pointed it out
[00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:46.260]   in our conversation about it.
[00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:48.180]   This is his point, not mine.
[00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:51.220]   Jacob is now more vulnerable because he met with God.
[00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:53.020]   He actually can't defend himself.
[00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:56.180]   See, sometimes we think if we just pray,
[00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:57.940]   we're gonna have all the strength to do everything
[00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:00.300]   and we're just gonna have these results happen overnight.
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:01.940]   What happens when you pray
[00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:04.220]   and somehow you're more vulnerable afterwards?
[00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:05.620]   Have you ever felt that way?
[00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:08.020]   Where you poured out your heart to God
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:11.220]   and your situation hasn't changed immediately?
[00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:13.580]   Maybe you've walked away with a spiritual limp.
[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:17.760]   God gives him a limp and a new name.
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:20.060]   But here's the thing.
[00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:21.900]   The blessing from his encounter with God
[00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:24.000]   is gonna be for who Jacob is at the core.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.500]   God blesses him by changing not just his name,
[00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:29.420]   but now his identity.
[00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:31.740]   If you remember what I said earlier in this sermon,
[00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:33.700]   the name is so important.
[00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:35.540]   The name speaks to who you are.
[00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:36.780]   It speaks to what you're gonna do.
[00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:38.260]   It speaks to what you have done.
[00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:40.480]   It is, in essence, your identity.
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:43.100]   The whole of you can be wrapped up in your name.
[00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:45.980]   And so now after experiencing and encountering God
[00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:48.300]   in this way, he's no longer Jacob the trickster,
[00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:50.620]   no longer Jacob the supplanter, the heel grabber,
[00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:52.660]   the one who tries to cheat to get ahead.
[00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:56.540]   He is now Israel, the one who fought and wrestled with God
[00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:58.340]   and has been changed and prevailed.
[00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:03.160]   God, in essence, has changed the entirety of who Jacob is.
[00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:07.960]   God renames him something from their encounter,
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:09.900]   but something for his future.
[00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:13.620]   Jacob is able to enter this same challenging
[00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:16.980]   and hard and tense and broken situation,
[00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:19.180]   all the same that it was,
[00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:20.700]   but as a completely different person
[00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:22.300]   with a completely new identity,
[00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:24.820]   having seen the face of God, put it this way,
[00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:28.100]   the situation didn't change, but the person did.
[00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:33.660]   The situation didn't change, but the person did.
[00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:38.820]   And this had to have an effect on his perspective.
[00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:41.020]   He had to look at his moment a bit differently now.
[00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:43.980]   He's walking with this limp yes, but with this swagger,
[00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:47.100]   'cause he's just seen God, he's just wrestled with God,
[00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:50.460]   he's just had the source of all good things with him.
[00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:52.500]   He has struggled with him.
[00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:55.580]   And all of a sudden, yes, Esau's still there with 400 men,
[00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:59.580]   but perhaps he's not longer gripped in fear of his brother.
[00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:01.540]   Perhaps there's a slight easing,
[00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:05.260]   a confidence that has come because you were with God,
[00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:07.140]   because you were in his presence,
[00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:09.660]   because you spent time with him,
[00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:11.580]   wrestling and contending him.
[00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:14.000]   Looking now at the situation completely different,
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.020]   Jacob can no longer lean on his own strength.
[00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:20.180]   He literally has to lean on God's ability.
[00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:24.260]   He literally has to lean on God's strength.
[00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:25.740]   And the story goes well,
[00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:27.860]   Jacob ends up going, seeing his brother,
[00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:29.820]   and his brother's happy to see him.
[00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:31.100]   That's great.
[00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:31.940]   That's awesome.
[00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:33.980]   That's a great, happy conclusion to our story.
[00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:36.340]   But before we got there,
[00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:38.380]   before we reached a happy conclusion,
[00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:42.060]   Jacob is changed and now has a new approach
[00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:42.980]   with no promises,
[00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:46.060]   simply based off of his encounter with God.
[00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:50.900]   This encounter exists to show us something
[00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:55.300]   of what an encounter of God can do in us and for us.
[00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:57.820]   How it can change us at our core.
[00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:00.500]   How it can bring about a divine confidence,
[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:02.700]   reposition who we are,
[00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:05.060]   helping us learn how to lean on his strength
[00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:06.100]   in times of trouble.
[00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:08.540]   What we find,
[00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:12.700]   we find that we must be a people who do two things,
[00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:15.140]   who pray and a people who wait.
[00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:17.660]   I'm gonna boil everything down to those two things.
[00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:19.940]   The people who pray and the people who wait.
[00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:22.140]   These two things are essential.
[00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:25.940]   Jacob's encounter only comes after he prays.
[00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:28.460]   Prayer opened the door.
[00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:30.060]   I love that he prays early in the night,
[00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:32.460]   but the encounter doesn't come till later in the night.
[00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:34.140]   Prayer was his pregame.
[00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:35.980]   It was his way of opening the channel,
[00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:38.060]   posturing and positioning himself
[00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:39.940]   to be able to have that encounter,
[00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:42.180]   that unexpected meeting with God
[00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:45.620]   that produced unexpected results.
[00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:48.140]   Honest prayer is where you thank God, yes,
[00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:49.900]   but you also pour out your heart to God
[00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:51.740]   and you don't try to over-spiritualize it.
[00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:53.340]   You don't try to use the big words.
[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:54.580]   You don't try to use Greek and Hebrew.
[00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:56.740]   You just tell him where you are.
[00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:00.740]   That kind of prayer is essential.
[00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:04.140]   This kind of prayer is what God wants for us,
[00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:07.940]   not from us, because in that it fuels,
[00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:11.420]   it gives depth to our intimacy with him.
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:14.500]   We spend time with him, we get to know him.
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:18.700]   And it requires that we trust that God hears us
[00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:21.940]   and that God will never leave us alone.
[00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:24.900]   It's not our battle to fight on our own.
[00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:29.100]   And the second thing, Jacob prays, nothing happens,
[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:31.700]   but Jacob waits and something begins.
[00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:34.620]   This is probably the thing you gotta write down
[00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:36.900]   and keep for this week, all right?
[00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:39.380]   I think we've got to learn how to do this
[00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:42.180]   because we live in a society, in a generation,
[00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:45.580]   in a world of instant gratification.
[00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:47.460]   We don't have to wait for anything, right?
[00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:48.700]   Like everything is kind of quick.
[00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:50.340]   Everything, whatever we need, it's there.
[00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:53.100]   Life is like instant noodles, just really, really quick.
[00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:55.020]   Get what you need, get it really quick.
[00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:58.460]   And if we live this way in every aspect of our lives,
[00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:01.700]   we potentially take this way of thinking
[00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:03.020]   into our spiritual life.
[00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:05.740]   So when we go to God, when we actually dare
[00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:08.620]   to have the courage to pray and be honest,
[00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:11.580]   we don't have the discipline to wait for his response.
[00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:15.420]   We potentially don't have the discipline to wait
[00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:17.980]   for his rescue, for his encounter.
[00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:23.740]   Oftentimes that waiting is a wrestling through the feelings
[00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:25.620]   or wrestling through the silence
[00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:27.020]   or wrestling with your doubts
[00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:29.420]   or a wrestling through the whole night,
[00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:32.140]   as we see here in Jacob's story,
[00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:34.860]   to stay and to contend with God.
[00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:38.080]   Jacob's desperation is what fuels his wrestling.
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:41.540]   My question is, are we desperate enough
[00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:46.420]   to where if we get in that moment, we will not let him go?
[00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:52.860]   I think we've got this weird concept as a society,
[00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:57.860]   as a Christian society, that everything is formulaic.
[00:36:57.860 --> 00:36:59.620]   And what I mean by that is a lot of times
[00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:01.380]   we have these specific things that we do.
[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:03.100]   You wake up and have a five-minute prayer
[00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:04.620]   and then you go about your day.
[00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:07.380]   Or every January, we do a 21-day fast.
[00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:09.580]   Nothing against fasting for 21 days, that's great.
[00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:10.420]   I do it too.
[00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:13.940]   But we have our 21-day fast and then we go on.
[00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:15.100]   But here's my question.
[00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:18.940]   What happens if it's not the formula?
[00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:21.700]   What happens if God is planning on meeting you
[00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:22.860]   on the 22nd day?
[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:28.700]   What happens if God plans on meeting you
[00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:30.460]   minute six of your devotion?
[00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:34.060]   Sorry, God, only five minutes today.
[00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:36.700]   See, we've gotten this whole idea of quick, easy,
[00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:38.740]   and formula mixed together.
[00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:41.020]   And that's what's happening is that we put forth the effort,
[00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:42.380]   but we don't wait.
[00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:45.540]   We don't slow down enough to wait for him.
[00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:47.020]   So then we end up missing him.
[00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:47.940]   And not just missing him,
[00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:50.340]   we end up going and figuring it out ourselves.
[00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:52.020]   We end up, okay, well, God hasn't shown up,
[00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:53.580]   so let me figure out how I can do.
[00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:54.740]   Jacob does the same thing.
[00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:56.620]   God hasn't shown up, what can I do?
[00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:58.380]   I'll send these gifts, I'll send my kids ahead,
[00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:00.220]   I'll send this, doing all these things.
[00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:03.300]   We end up filling our hands with what we can grab
[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:06.420]   with our strategies, with our own way of doing things,
[00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:09.700]   and we end up missing what it is that God has for us.
[00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:12.660]   What if we fasted for 22 days?
[00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:14.420]   What if, actually, I have time.
[00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:17.340]   Emma told me this when we were studying this passage.
[00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:19.660]   The 21-day fast, the Daniel fast,
[00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:23.340]   is something that we set up looking back on it.
[00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:24.540]   Daniel didn't set out saying,
[00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:26.900]   I'm only gonna fast for 21 days.
[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:28.020]   Think about that.
[00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:31.340]   His fast was until something happens.
[00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:34.860]   So we look back on it, and we're like, all right, 21 days.
[00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:37.060]   But actually, this is not about the fast,
[00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:38.960]   this is about us in general.
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:40.540]   It's not the formula.
[00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:42.260]   You've got to wait.
[00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:44.180]   We've got to wait.
[00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:48.420]   We've got to wrestle and wait on the Lord.
[00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:50.380]   That's where we will renew our strength.
[00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:51.860]   That's where we will find our hope.
[00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:54.260]   That's when we'll rise on wings like eagles and soar,
[00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:57.060]   when we wait on the Lord.
[00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:02.940]   The temptation of not waiting on the Lord
[00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:04.980]   means that we enter into this headspace
[00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:07.040]   that we have to take care of ourselves.
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:07.980]   I was touched on it earlier,
[00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:10.180]   but it's something we have to remind ourselves.
[00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:12.800]   It's not just up to you to get you through.
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:17.380]   Hear this, you're not the only one that cares about you.
[00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:19.220]   It's good to know, right?
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:22.140]   There's someone who cares about you significantly more
[00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:24.740]   in every possible way, to the fullest extent,
[00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:27.820]   holistically cares about you.
[00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:30.020]   Our world and our lives are not solely dependent
[00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:32.540]   on what we can do and what we make of it.
[00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:34.400]   The Christian story is this,
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:37.620]   that we have abdicated the rights to be our own gods,
[00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:39.820]   and we've given that responsibility
[00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:41.600]   to the only true God in Jesus.
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:44.600]   And hear this, he cares for you.
[00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:49.820]   So could we live like that?
[00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:51.980]   Could we wait on him?
[00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:53.020]   Could we wait on God?
[00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:55.300]   Could we wait on the Lord through the night,
[00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:57.860]   through the tension, through the anxiety,
[00:39:57.860 --> 00:39:58.700]   through the stress?
[00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:00.340]   Could we wait on the Lord?
[00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:01.820]   Could we wait for those moments
[00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:03.180]   where we finally have his attention?
[00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:05.660]   When we have his attention, could we hold onto him?
[00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:06.620]   Could we grab him?
[00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:09.620]   Could we say, I'm not letting you go until you bless me?
[00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:13.100]   Could we posture ourselves to ask and not reach and grab?
[00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:15.580]   Could we hold on to him?
[00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:21.580]   Could we choose to not avoid or hide?
[00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:24.960]   Could we wrestle for more than just a feeling?
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:29.020]   Could we wrestle for all that he has for us?
[00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:32.060]   Can we put our future back in his hands
[00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:34.980]   where everything is possible,
[00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:38.900]   versus our hands where only so much can be achieved?
[00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:43.460]   Can we put it in the hands of him who has no limits?
[00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:45.620]   He operates in the impossible.
[00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:48.340]   That's the guy I want in the driver's seat of my life.
[00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:53.580]   So don't take for yourself what you find.
[00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:56.000]   Leave it to God to give you what he has.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.100]   I grew up hearing this song,
[00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:02.940]   I think I was around maybe between the ages of seven and 10.
[00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:04.140]   My mom used to sing in the choir,
[00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:06.300]   which is where I get my ability to sing from.
[00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:08.820]   And I remember going to choir practices on Monday,
[00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:10.500]   and there's this one song they would sing.
[00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:13.540]   It was, ♪ You're an on-time God, yes he is ♪
[00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:15.540]   ♪ He's an on-time God, yes he is ♪
[00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:18.660]   And the words are, he may not come when you want him,
[00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:20.740]   but he'll be there right on time.
[00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:24.140]   He's an on-time God, yes he is.
[00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:28.500]   Church, this is my appeal, that we've gotta wait.
[00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:33.220]   It may feel like, God, you should have come five minutes ago,
[00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:34.620]   you should have been here three weeks ago,
[00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:37.020]   you should have been here before this challenge happens,
[00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:39.380]   but he is an on-time God.
[00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:41.900]   And he may not come when you think he should be there.
[00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:44.820]   He may not do it the way that you want him to do it,
[00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:46.460]   but that's the whole point of these encounters,
[00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:49.460]   it's unexpected, it happens in unexpected ways,
[00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:51.020]   but if we will position ourselves,
[00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:53.140]   if we will posture ourselves to receive it
[00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:55.020]   through praying and through waiting,
[00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:57.040]   he does not disappoint.
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:00.920]   He will not leave you alone.
[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:03.700]   He will not leave you to only your strength.
[00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:05.780]   Wait on the Lord, wait through the night,
[00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:08.760]   wait through the silence, hold on to him.
[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:12.260]   [congregation murmuring]
[00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:15.760]   Waiting is hard.
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:20.260]   Not gonna pretend like it's something you can theorize.
[00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:21.960]   If it wasn't hard, we'd all do it.
[00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:26.840]   But I pray that by understanding this encounter,
[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:29.840]   that it would produce something in you.
[00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:34.960]   That your desperation to encounter, to know,
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:38.020]   to experience that same God,
[00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:42.020]   would fuel your discipline to wait.
[00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:42.980]   I pray that the Holy Spirit
[00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:45.420]   will give you the strength you need.
[00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:47.300]   I pray that he will help and guide you,
[00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:50.380]   that he will light your path and lead you forward,
[00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:51.740]   that he will clear your mind,
[00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:54.620]   that he will remind you of what is in front of you,
[00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:57.660]   and that is a God who cares, a God who loves,
[00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:00.380]   a God who desires the absolute best for you,
[00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:02.980]   a God who loves you more than you can love yourself,
[00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:07.700]   and a God who's more capable than what we're capable of.
[00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:12.700]   And so Jesus, we come before you this morning asking,
[00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:18.580]   asking, not reaching, but asking for your help.
[00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:21.100]   God, would you teach us how to pray?
[00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:23.860]   Would you teach us how to be honest in front of you?
[00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:25.940]   How to bear our souls in front of you?
[00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:30.660]   Would you give us the confidence and the trust to know
[00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:32.900]   that you hear us when we pray,
[00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:35.540]   and that you care about the dialogue,
[00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:38.540]   about the channel of communication that it opens?
[00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:41.100]   Would you remind us that by just being in your presence,
[00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:41.940]   we are changed?
[00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:46.740]   Would you remind us that by just being around you,
[00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:49.380]   we are shaped and molded differently?
[00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:52.140]   That these encounters are not limited to the holy
[00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:54.980]   and to the saints, but it's also to the sinners like us.
[00:43:54.980 --> 00:44:00.140]   Would you make us the people who pray?
[00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:04.980]   And Holy Spirit, would you also be what sustains us?
[00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:09.220]   Because starting can be easy, but staying can be hard.
[00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:14.500]   So God, would you, through the power of the Holy Spirit,
[00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:19.180]   sustain us in waiting for you, waiting on the Lord,
[00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:21.180]   waiting and renewing our mind,
[00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:22.900]   and that you would renew our strength,
[00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:25.660]   that you would be what we need if we wait on you.
[00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:30.100]   That we will find joy again if we wait on you.
[00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:37.300]   That surely we will see you and your goodness
[00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:40.180]   if we were to wait on you.
[00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:42.940]   So Holy Spirit, sustain us,
[00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:46.540]   give us the strength that we need to stay,
[00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:51.100]   give us the discipline, the reminders that we need to stay,
[00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:54.620]   to rely and to wait,
[00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:57.220]   knowing that you're not gonna let us down.
[00:44:57.220 --> 00:45:01.100]   You've never let us down before.
[00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:03.780]   You've been faithful 100% of the time,
[00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:06.620]   and so we lean on that faithful God this morning.
[00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:08.140]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:09.260]   Amen.
[00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:12.220]   (gentle music)
[00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:14.800]   (gentle music)
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:17.380]   (gentle music)
