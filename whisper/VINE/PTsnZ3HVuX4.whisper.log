[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800]   We're gonna be doing something a little bit different today,
[00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.640]   which is really exciting.
[00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.960]   We wanna help you to hear from different voices
[00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.920]   in our church, rather than just those
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.720]   that are often the ones that are preaching.
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.080]   We wanna make sure that we make space for different voices
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.720]   and different insight and different wisdom.
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.880]   And I'm super excited about this.
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.140]   Pastor Promise is gonna come and lead this time.
[00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.840]   Can we put our hands together for Promise
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.020]   and for everybody else that's gonna be joining him on stage?
[00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.760]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.340]   - Thank you, thank you.
[00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.460]   Come on, you guys, come on up.
[00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.360]   It's all right, don't be afraid.
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.400]   Can't back out now, it's too late.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.720]   This is being recorded.
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.280]   All right.
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.840]   What's for it?
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.760]   We'll let the married couple share a mic, it'll be good.
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.720]   All right, well, everyone, I wanna introduce myself
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.440]   'cause you know who I am.
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.000]   But I just wanna go ahead and introduce
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.520]   some of the people that we have with us.
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.680]   And then we're gonna jump right in.
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.240]   So to my left, we have Pastor Emma,
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.580]   which you are used to seeing her here.
[00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.460]   She's been on our team for a while, leading worship.
[00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.960]   She is one of our worship pastors.
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.680]   To my right, we have Juju, who leads worship in the PM.
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.560]   So normally, if you're here at the two o'clock service,
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.200]   you would see her right here about this tall.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.500]   It's quite nice.
[00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.440]   We love her dearly.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.960]   To her right, we have Mr. Smith.
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.080]   These two are married, by the way,
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.280]   so give it up for marriage, everyone.
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.320]   We love that in God's house, amen, amen.
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.080]   Mr. Smith, Akin, is also joining us today to share.
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.340]   And then to his right, my favorite Indonesian man
[00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.580]   in the whole wide world.
[00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.820]   This is Pastor Jethro, and he's taken, just for the record.
[00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.520]   But Pastor Jethro, everyone, let's give it up for him.
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.300]   (audience applauding)
[00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.180]   Engaged man, man to be married, ah, all right.
[00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.740]   Well, let me just tell you guys
[00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:42.580]   what we're hoping to do today.
[00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.580]   We would love to just have some conversations
[00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.380]   around what it means to worship in spirit and in truth,
[00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.660]   and just kind of sit in that space,
[00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.100]   understanding that in lots of our lives
[00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.060]   we can be pulled towards these dichotomous concepts.
[00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.260]   And actually, we serve a God who is whole and complete.
[00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.180]   And so as we go through this, we're gonna see
[00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.100]   just how he pulls us into this completion that he has.
[00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.200]   So as Pastor Andrew has shared,
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.100]   we started this series on the Holy Spirit.
[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.100]   This week, we're looking at John 4,
[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.460]   looking at Jesus and the Samaritan woman,
[00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.380]   and the concept and the big idea
[00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.740]   that we're gonna be talking around is around worship.
[00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.260]   So in order for us to actually, I guess,
[00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.940]   have a common vocabulary and understanding
[00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.940]   of what worship is, I'm gonna pass it
[00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.060]   to our worship pastor, Emanuela,
[00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.260]   one of our worship pastors, who will be giving us
[00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.980]   a definition on what worship is for this community.
[00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:33.980]   So go ahead, Emma.
[00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.500]   - Yes, so hi, hi, everyone.
[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.980]   So I will caveat this by saying this is obviously
[00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.960]   not an exhaustive definition of what worship is,
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.040]   but for the purposes of this conversation
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.940]   and as a community, when we talk about worship,
[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.260]   how we define it is an adequate and appropriate
[00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.580]   responding to and revealing of God the Father,
[00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.960]   Christ Jesus the Son, and the Spirit that lives within us.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.980]   And so in short, we say revelation and response
[00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.260]   when we're talking, what is worship,
[00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.220]   revelation and response?
[00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.100]   So the adequate and appropriate revealing of
[00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.660]   and responding to God the Father, Christ Jesus the Son,
[00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.700]   and the Spirit that remains with us.
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.420]   - So that means worship takes place when God is revealed
[00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.740]   through the way that we live,
[00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.220]   and when we also respond to that revelation of who God is.
[00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.380]   That means it can take place here in this room,
[00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.180]   just like we just all experienced,
[00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.580]   but also means that it's not simply limited
[00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.680]   to the worship service and the gathering, right?
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.140]   So today we're gonna look at John chapter four.
[00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.500]   Let me just give us a little bit of what's happening
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.340]   in John chapter four.
[00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.300]   Jesus is in Samaria, and he's at this well,
[00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.740]   and this lady is there, and he's thirsty,
[00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.380]   he wants something to drink, and he asks her for a drink,
[00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.180]   and they have this discourse around water
[00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.620]   and how he's like, you know, Jesus always does this
[00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.460]   when someone asks him a simple question,
[00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.460]   he always gives some profound answer
[00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.900]   that doesn't really answer the question, right?
[00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.900]   And so she's like, he wants water,
[00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.820]   and then all of a sudden he's the well that never runs dry,
[00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.100]   but he's the one asking for water,
[00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.860]   and she should be asking him for a drink.
[00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.460]   So it feels a little bit confusing,
[00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.180]   and then it goes into this whole idea
[00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.700]   of Jesus kind of calling out, oh, well, you know,
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.300]   you have five husbands, which seems a little bit weird,
[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.580]   just kind of out of the blue,
[00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.180]   Jesus calls her out on her life.
[00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.420]   And then it transitions into this idea of, you know,
[00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.860]   Jews worship on one mountain,
[00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.180]   but Samaritans worship on a different mountain,
[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.780]   and it's in this space that we get the crux
[00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.820]   of today's talk around what worship truly looks like.
[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.660]   So if you could turn your attention to the screen,
[00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.820]   I'm gonna read this for us,
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.060]   starting at verse 19 of John chapter four.
[00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.300]   It says this, "Sir," the woman said,
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.820]   "I can see that you're a prophet,"
[00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.300]   which is a good response,
[00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.100]   given that he's just told her all this stuff about her life.
[00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.340]   "Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain,
[00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.800]   "but you Jews claim that the place
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.180]   "where we must worship is in Jerusalem."
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.820]   "Woman," Jesus replied, "believe me,
[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.280]   "a time is coming when you will worship the Father,
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.580]   "neither on this mountain or in Jerusalem.
[00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.980]   "You Samaritans worship what you do not know.
[00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.700]   "We worship what we do know,
[00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.660]   "for salvation is from the Jews.
[00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.400]   "Yet a time is coming, and has now come,
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.140]   "when true worshipers will worship the Father
[00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.900]   "in spirit and in truth,
[00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.500]   "for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks."
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.880]   Jesus, we thank you this morning for your word,
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.880]   and we just ask, Holy Spirit, that you would be with us
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.840]   as we converse around it, as we pull it apart,
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.520]   and as we see the insight that you have
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.040]   for us to live our lives.
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.600]   We know that your word is living and active,
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.160]   so would you speak to us now, in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.560]   Also, I'll just toss a question out.
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.000]   The idea of worshiping in spirit and in truth,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.720]   you can't just do one over the other.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.020]   It's a false dichotomy,
[00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.800]   but what makes it a false dichotomy in you guys' take?
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.540]   Why can you not worship in spirit or in truth?
[00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.540]   You have to do both.
[00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.940]   - Because I think both reveals God, right?
[00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.820]   So if you understand that, talk about this truth,
[00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.140]   truth as we know it is the word of God.
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.540]   The word of God came in flesh into Jesus,
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.620]   and the spirit, meaning the Holy Spirit that he has given us,
[00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.860]   the Holy Spirit will bring us to revelation
[00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.220]   of who Jesus is, and Jesus already said himself
[00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.360]   that he does not do anything
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.200]   that he doesn't see the Father do.
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.560]   So in short, Jesus reveals the Father,
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.440]   so the Holy Spirit reveals the Jesus,
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.420]   which is the word and the truth,
[00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:21.880]   and Jesus reveals the Father.
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.600]   So three in one.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.440]   - Trinity thing, right?
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.280]   It's a trinity.
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:31.440]   - So if we go back to that description or definition,
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.520]   if worship is revealing and responding,
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.280]   and we're worshiping God, then who we're revealing,
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.560]   our revelation of him has to be accurate.
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.420]   And because to the Christian faith,
[00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.680]   our God is three in one, our worship of that God,
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.320]   and so the revelation of his nature
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.200]   must align with who he actually is.
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.400]   And so in spirit and in truth encompasses,
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.240]   like in that passage, it's very interesting,
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.000]   it kind of highlights the trinity
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.440]   without using the word trinity, right?
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.080]   So it says, "The Father seeks worshipers
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.960]   "that worship in the spirit and in truth."
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.140]   And we know from John 14, six later on
[00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.760]   that Jesus says, "I am the way, the truth, and the life."
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.020]   So you see clearly in that kind of outline
[00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.080]   of how worship is to take place,
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:19.120]   the picture of the full trinity.
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.040]   And so to separate and choose between spirit or truth
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.520]   would be to separate the Godhead,
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.080]   which would then change, I don't know if it constitute,
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.440]   it wouldn't constitute worship
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.200]   to the God we worship as believers.
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.920]   So I think it's impossible to break them up.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.760]   It's impossible, but it's also dangerous, right?
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.000]   I think none of us go into it saying,
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.860]   "Okay, I'm gonna just worship in spirit.
[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.160]   "I'm gonna just worship in truth and ignore the others."
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.080]   But I think as humans, we are drawn to extremes sometimes.
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.440]   And if we're not careful, we can find ourselves
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.700]   over-saturated on the other side of the line.
[00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.160]   And so let's talk about the Old Testament.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.660]   We see in the scriptures, not Old Testament, the Pharisees.
[00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.280]   I think someone mentioned the Pharisees.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.160]   Akin, this is your point, go ahead and talk about it.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.040]   Tell us what happened.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.120]   - Yeah, it's something we discussed
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.720]   in the 9am, 9.15 service.
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.600]   So yes, it's impossible to honestly worship God
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.880]   without doing so in spirit and in truth.
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.480]   But my promise is there is the danger
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.080]   of trying to sort of gravitate towards one.
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.920]   And if we think of the Pharisees,
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.960]   this is very likely a very good example
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.640]   of a body of people who likely gravitated
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.680]   more towards the word and almost forgot entirely
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.480]   about the spirit aspect of it.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.200]   So they spent so much time reading the word,
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.560]   they could actually memorize, they had memorized it,
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:38.680]   they could recite it, verbatim.
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.560]   But Jesus was walking amongst them
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:43.320]   and they couldn't actually recognize him
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.240]   because they were so much focused on the word.
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.000]   And I think that is a danger.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.280]   That's something that we definitely want to do our best
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.800]   to actually ensure that does not happen with our lives.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.200]   'Cause I promise that it can be a slippery slope.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.800]   We can very easily sort of just gravitate towards one.
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.000]   And I mean, I don't think anyone of us here
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.680]   wants to emulate the Pharisees.
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.400]   All of them mistakes that they made.
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:07.360]   So good thing to keep in mind and keep them as an example.
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.560]   - And Jesus is actually kind of a little harsh to them
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.400]   in some extent.
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.480]   It's like when you see the Pharisees living their lives,
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.600]   right, like they know all the laws, like I can said,
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.800]   they could pray the best, they were fasting,
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.040]   they were doing all the things, they looked the part.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.520]   But the way that Jesus would respond to them,
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.920]   he would call them whitewashed tombs, empty on the inside.
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.000]   Their spirits were not actually connecting with him.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.440]   He would also say that these people worship me
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.440]   with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.880]   It really does seem that if we omit the spirit,
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.920]   we actually miss on what it looks like
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.200]   to biblically worship God.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.680]   - Yeah, I think Jethro made a really good point earlier,
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:48.200]   and you can expand on this, but about how if we lean,
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.240]   if we decide to lean, so this is on the dangers
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.760]   of leaning more truth, like I'm gonna worship in truth.
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.040]   And that's a fair response to seeing people worship God
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.920]   in however way they want, which we'll get to.
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:03.140]   But one of the dangers of that becomes self-righteousness,
[00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.620]   'cause you start to believe that your worship is acceptable
[00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:09.320]   because you have dotted all of the I's
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.480]   and crossed all the T's, which we know is not true, right?
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.440]   Scripture is like your righteousness,
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.840]   at most righteous, is filthy rags before me.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.880]   So like the way that your worship is accepted
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:24.400]   is never because of how great you've done.
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.680]   The Pharisees, again, like where people,
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.520]   I had a friend who used to say the Pharisees knew the word
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:33.520]   and the truth so well that if you rolled up a scroll
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.760]   and you shot through it and they unrolled it,
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.000]   they could tell you what letter had been,
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.720]   like literally, it was that a G that was removed.
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.340]   Like it's an analogy for how well they knew the scripture
[00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:48.680]   that they could really recite every iota of it.
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:52.780]   But then that kinda leads to that difficult place
[00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:55.160]   where you're leaning on yourself, which is kinda hard,
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.480]   'cause we're not the most consistent people.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:02.200]   So then if our hope for an acceptable worship
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.120]   is our goodness and our ability to maintain
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.800]   God's level of standards,
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.000]   then we wouldn't have an acceptable worship
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.080]   for very long, if ever.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.920]   I know I wouldn't, I don't know about you guys.
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:18.240]   Maybe you guys are like deeper, but like as for me,
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.080]   I already know I'm grateful for the Holy Spirit,
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:23.360]   'cause I'm like otherwise, there's no way, there's no way.
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.760]   - The truth is a person, and I think one of the things
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.280]   that we didn't talk on earlier,
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.200]   but I think is interesting in this state is
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.440]   if Jesus is the truth and truth is a person,
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.720]   then you kinda have to get to know the truth, right?
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.200]   Can you maybe, Jet, what does that,
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.040]   when you think about the idea
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.640]   of we have to get to know Jesus, what does that mean?
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.600]   What does that look like?
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.640]   - Well, Jesus, this is the next point,
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.400]   but Jesus comes to, he says, comes to fulfill the law.
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.080]   He's not come to abolish the law.
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:53.360]   And he's given the word is, the word of God is Jesus.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.680]   So getting to know Jesus is also getting to know
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.200]   what he's spoken through the Bible.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.360]   And knowing what he has said,
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:05.000]   and we can understand his character more,
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.120]   and so that we know the person, right?
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.880]   If you want to know a person,
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.880]   you don't just observe them from afar.
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.400]   You get to know them, you ask questions and all that.
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:17.280]   - Now, just to jump in on that in terms of
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:22.040]   what you just said, I think it's very possible to
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:25.600]   miss out on exactly what Jesus was looking to do,
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:29.040]   because there were times when what Jesus did
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.720]   seemed to contradict the law,
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:32.880]   even though, like you said,
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.680]   he did not come to abolish the law,
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.840]   so laws of like Sabbath and the like.
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.160]   You could sort of mistake that
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.800]   and think that Jesus came to do something otherwise,
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.880]   but he makes it clear that that is not the case.
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:46.360]   So it's more about the actual relationship
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.800]   and the actual spirit of the law,
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.920]   which is why it's important to take both the word
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.640]   and the spirit and not individually.
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.520]   - And I don't think the Pharisees recognized it,
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.520]   but I think if they were to zoom out and realize,
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:01.440]   I think the example of the man who was healed on the Sabbath,
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.720]   like they want to persecute Jesus
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.080]   'cause he healed someone on the Sabbath
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.760]   because they were so, they knew the truth,
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.160]   but they missed the spirit of who God was
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.680]   and God's heart for people,
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.080]   that they would then try and kill someone
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:15.600]   who helped somebody because they did it on the wrong day.
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.600]   Like, can we talk about missing the big picture altogether?
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.760]   I think that says something to us,
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:23.040]   that God isn't just calling you to like do all the rules
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.040]   and make sure you're living exactly perfectly right.
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.360]   There is a relationship
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:29.080]   and that's why the spirit matters so much in this worship.
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:33.240]   - Yeah, so that's on what are some of the dangers
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.480]   of leaning too much, right?
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.600]   When we say spirit and truth and leaning on truth.
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.720]   Jules, what do you think are some of the pitfalls
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:44.200]   of leaning, swinging into the other end of the pendulum
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.600]   and like just by the spirit, no need for truth?
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:51.480]   - Well, I grew up in a Pentecostal church.
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.960]   - All the spirit.
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.800]   - Yeah, it's all spirit, right?
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:00.800]   So like it's very concentrated on like,
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.520]   someone can be rolling on the floor,
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:04.960]   but then if there's really no truth to it,
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:08.000]   'cause truth is also the whole being, right?
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.320]   Like your heart, is it really showing the heart of God?
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.160]   Then is it really worship that you're rolling on the floor
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.120]   or you're like being slain?
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.960]   Yeah, sorry, to surprise everyone.
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.280]   I didn't wanna scare anyone,
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:25.640]   but that's what I grew up with.
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:28.920]   Yeah, so that can be the danger of that.
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.880]   - And in this age, I think specifically 2025,
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:34.400]   like if worship is only in the spirit,
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:37.360]   I mean, we've heard the phrase my truth so many times,
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.680]   not everybody has their own truth,
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.600]   but there's only one real truth, right?
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:41.520]   There's only Jesus is the truth.
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.520]   So your truth and their truth and his truth and her truth,
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.520]   I think really having the concept of marrying the spirit
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:48.880]   with the truth, right?
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:52.360]   The truth being Jesus is super important.
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:56.880]   - Yeah, I think something that can be hard to grasp
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:03.880]   in this day and age is that God is king,
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.760]   like of all things, right?
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.040]   He is God.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:10.480]   So like he answers to no one, okay?
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:12.960]   And because he is God,
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.640]   and he's also a father and all those things,
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:18.120]   but he is God, our father is God, right?
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:21.240]   So like there is that duality to like who he is
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.920]   and completeness, that means he,
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.720]   the recipient of our worship,
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:29.240]   gets to dictate the method of our worship, right?
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.200]   The way in any loving relationship,
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.440]   you know, for those who are married
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.160]   or like you have siblings or friends,
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.440]   you know their preferences and what they don't like, right?
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.800]   If your spouse's love language is quality time,
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.240]   buying them the latest, like, I don't know,
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.040]   Gucci, whatever, is not gonna matter
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:49.440]   if what they require of you is time, right?
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.440]   So the same goes with God.
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:55.480]   In this relationship with him, he dictates how we worship.
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:59.080]   And we learn what he dictates through his word,
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.480]   through the truth, right?
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:04.360]   So the spirit gives us that affection for God,
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.240]   the desire to worship him,
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.200]   but even with good intentions,
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.960]   unless we learn what he wants,
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.520]   it becomes, the intentions become wasted, right?
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.240]   All the money a husband could spend
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.800]   on like the latest whatever,
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:21.320]   and the wife is like, but I asked you to take out the trash,
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:23.200]   and it was a lot cheaper,
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.760]   would have been a lot cheaper to do that.
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:27.840]   Like, it's the same with God.
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:31.000]   I'm reminded of, and this is gonna sound very intense,
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.960]   but there's a story of Uzzah in scripture.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.040]   Uzzah is this man where,
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.080]   it's way back in the Old Testament,
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.960]   and there's like, the children of Israel
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.680]   are at war with the Philistines.
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:46.000]   So the Philistines take the Ark of the Lord.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.920]   At the time, the Ark of God was symbolic
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.000]   of the presence of God,
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.960]   and they thought the presence of God was,
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.600]   like Pastor Andrew talked about in the introduction,
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:54.800]   that it was an energy.
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.200]   So like, whoever has the energy has the wind.
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.440]   That's not how it works.
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:59.840]   So they stole the Ark,
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:01.840]   thinking the energy was gonna be in their favor,
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:03.440]   and then God started smiting them,
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.440]   and they all started dying.
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.480]   So they kept playing,
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.480]   they started playing hot potato with the Ark,
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.720]   and they're like, "Ah, send it to the next town,"
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:11.320]   and like, "Whatever city you don't like,
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:13.280]   "we're shipping it to Singapore, whatever."
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.400]   - Shots at Singapore.
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.160]   Shots at Singapore.
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.000]   We love you, Singapore.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.520]   - Easy target, we do love you.
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.280]   But yeah, so.
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:23.360]   (laughing)
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.560]   Sorry.
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:28.880]   So, they're playing hot potato with the Ark of God, okay?
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.600]   And eventually, it lands in the house of an Israelite.
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:32.440]   They finally get it.
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.480]   They send it to one of the people of God,
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.920]   and their people stop dying, right?
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:37.880]   The thing is, though,
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.560]   the Philistines are not the people of God,
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.200]   so they don't have a relationship with God.
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.760]   They don't know how God dictates to be worshipped.
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:46.240]   So they put God, they carry the Ark
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:48.560]   the way that they would carry their God.
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.960]   They carry it in an Ark on top of oxen
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.800]   with like, golden idols and stuff,
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.400]   and they bring it to the Israelite's house.
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.640]   Because that Israelite wasn't a priest,
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:01.040]   and they didn't really bother to like, find out.
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.440]   The Ark of God just stayed that way in their house, right?
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.960]   So, fast forward, I don't know how many years later,
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.760]   when King David becomes king,
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.000]   one of the first thing he wants to do
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   is restore the presence of God, symbolically,
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.960]   the Ark of God, to the center of worship in Israel.
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.040]   So he goes, he inquires, they tell him,
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:19.400]   "Oh, it's at that guy's house."
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.960]   They go to that guy's house to pick up the Ark, right?
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.760]   But remember, they're carrying the Ark
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:27.800]   the way the Philistines carry their God.
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.280]   God, in Deuteronomy and other parts,
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:33.560]   had been specific about how his presence
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:34.840]   was supposed to be carried.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.720]   It had to be carried on people,
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.120]   which is a precursor to the fact
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.120]   that we would become his temple, right?
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.400]   So people had to carry his presence.
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.280]   It couldn't be animals, it couldn't be whatever else.
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.480]   Like, you couldn't decide how you wanted
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:50.420]   to carry his presence, you had to carry it his way.
[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:51.640]   But they didn't know that.
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.140]   So they pick up the Ark, and they're just excited,
[00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:55.160]   'cause they're like, "Oh, yeah,
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:56.440]   "the presence of God is back."
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:59.840]   Which is spirit, like, good intentions, excited, right?
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.200]   And I'm sure the spirit of God led that decision,
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.680]   that if we're gonna be a kingdom after God,
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.960]   we ought to centralize his presence.
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.040]   But they didn't do the work of finding out,
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:13.580]   okay, but truthfully, how does God want to be worshipped?
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:15.000]   So they're carrying this Ark
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.880]   the way the Philistines would carry the Ark.
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.300]   They're going, they're going, they're going,
[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.480]   and then they find there's a hole in the ground.
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.800]   The oxen, the animals who are carrying the Ark, trip.
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.120]   And the Ark of God, which was on these animals,
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.880]   start to tip over, right?
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.440]   And so you can imagine, like, panic.
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.840]   "Oh my God, this is the presence of God,
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:32.920]   "we can't let it fall."
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:35.520]   This guy, Uzzah, is like, "No!"
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:40.400]   And he touches the Ark to try to, like, lean it right,
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.200]   and drops dead.
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.760]   Go find it, it's in your Bibles.
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:44.900]   (laughing)
[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:46.640]   I can give you the coordinates later.
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:48.160]   He touches it, and it drops dead.
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:51.960]   And King David is so distraught, right?
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:53.160]   So he stops the whole,
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.000]   "We're gonna bring the presence of God,"
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.800]   'cause like, "Shoo, what is this?
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.240]   "Like, I don't wanna die."
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.680]   And the scripture says he's actually angry at God.
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.100]   He's like, "Why would you do that?
[00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.440]   "Like, we're bringing your presence back.
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.080]   "What, shouldn't you be happy?"
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:09.400]   But remember, God is king, right?
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.380]   So we can't carry his presence,
[00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:14.160]   even when it's his idea for us to centralize it.
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.840]   We can't do it our way.
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:16.880]   We have to do it his way.
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:19.560]   I think this is where the strength
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.480]   of the truth comes in, right?
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.680]   So in spirit, like, with the right intentions,
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.360]   with the right passion in the movement,
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.080]   but we have to do the work of discovering
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.120]   through his word,
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:31.600]   how do you actually want us to worship you?
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:34.040]   And the spirit, like, highlights, you know,
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.980]   what to focus on in every instance,
[00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:37.700]   but that's where the danger could come in.
[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.440]   Like, good intentions,
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.080]   going straight into the presence of God,
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.480]   not being aware, "Oh, I'm walking into
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.560]   "the presence of someone who's holy,
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.680]   "who wants us to be in his presence."
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.280]   So, you know, it ends happily,
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.180]   where, I mean, us are still dead, but.
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:55.920]   It ends, they go away, David's upset.
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.920]   He goes and finds out.
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.880]   And then they're like, "Oh, we're not supposed
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.760]   "to carry the presence of God on animals."
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.680]   Right, and they don't know that it's because
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.640]   in the future, God's presence will live on people,
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:08.760]   so we need to know that,
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.720]   and it needs to be consistent, right?
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:13.360]   They learn that, and they carry the presence of God
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.120]   properly, and it's a proper party, right?
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:17.640]   His presence comes in and dwells,
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.680]   like, he wants to, but it's just,
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.440]   we can't do it our way.
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:23.920]   - Deuteronomy gives a good definition of it.
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.200]   Deuteronomy 12, four, he goes,
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:29.200]   "You must not worship the Lord your God in their way,
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.000]   "but you are to seek the place that the Lord
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.400]   "will choose from among your tribes."
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.920]   God is going to define what worship looks like,
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.280]   and that's what we get here in the New Testament passage,
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.360]   in John four, that true worshipers,
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.720]   like, what does God require for worship to look like?
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.040]   It's this combination of our worship being
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.000]   in spirit and in truth.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.960]   There's a quote from a theologian I wanna read to us,
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:50.400]   'cause I think it really helps us frame it well.
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.040]   It says this, "Truth without emotion
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:55.160]   "produces dead orthodoxy,
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:58.460]   "and a church full of artificial admirers.
[00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:00.480]   "On the other hand, emotion without truth
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.660]   "produces empty frenzy, and cultivates shallow people
[00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:06.800]   "who refuse the discipline of rigorous thought.
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.320]   "But true worship comes from people
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:09.720]   "who are deeply emotional,
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.940]   "who love deep and sound doctrine.
[00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:16.080]   "Strong affections for God rooted in truth
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:18.960]   "are the bone and marrow of biblical worship."
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:22.100]   Our worship must be this coming together,
[00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:25.200]   this combination led by his spirit
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:28.200]   to reveal the truth of who Jesus is,
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.880]   and it's a consistent cycle that we then get a chance
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:34.340]   to reveal and respond to as well.
[00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:38.160]   I heard earlier that Juju and Emma were hanging out
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:41.400]   without me and talking about Bible things without me.
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.760]   Emma snitched on you, by the way,
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:44.600]   and she said that you guys came up
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:45.880]   with a really cool definition,
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.640]   kind of like summarizing the whole idea of truth
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:52.260]   and worship and spirit and Jesus
[00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:53.300]   and all those things together.
[00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:54.820]   So maybe you can read it for us
[00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:56.140]   so we can all kind of sit with it.
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:57.220]   You want my phone?
[00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:58.500]   There you go.
[00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:03.060]   - True worship of God must be led by the spirit
[00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:07.180]   and must arrive at a revelation of the person of Christ.
[00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:09.960]   Just this morning, I was kind of,
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.020]   like I was praying for today,
[00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:13.660]   and I was like, oh God, I really,
[00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:15.460]   I don't want to do it.
[00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:17.140]   I don't want to do it anymore.
[00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:20.500]   Like, English is not my first language.
[00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:25.940]   I don't speak as eloquently as my husband,
[00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:27.200]   but then the Lord said,
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:30.500]   this is how I want to be worshipped, right?
[00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:32.180]   Like today it looks different.
[00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:34.960]   Like, yeah, last Sunday, yeah,
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.780]   you're worshiping here on the stage
[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:40.260]   with music and with sound,
[00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:42.760]   but today I want to be worshipped this way.
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:45.620]   And the spirit, you know,
[00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:48.260]   the spirit allows us and helps us
[00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:50.080]   to things that we can't even do.
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:53.460]   Like true worship, you can never really worship God
[00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:55.700]   because it's impossible.
[00:23:55.700 --> 00:24:00.700]   Because God, like the only way is for the spirit
[00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:04.980]   to reveal to you.
[00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:07.940]   Without the spirit, you cannot.
[00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:09.420]   Yeah?
[00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:10.260]   - Yeah.
[00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:11.980]   - I think, no, no, you're completely right.
[00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:13.300]   Like I think it is that combination.
[00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:14.840]   Like we are dependent on the spirit
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:16.980]   to lead us and guide us into that space.
[00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:18.060]   There was something really interesting
[00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:19.500]   when we kind of discussed this earlier
[00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:21.060]   around the biblical response.
[00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:22.820]   Emma calls it step zero.
[00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:24.740]   But Akin, you were actually pulling together
[00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:27.100]   just the overall narrative of John 4,
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:29.940]   looking at how, you know, it's not disconnected.
[00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:31.460]   We don't just randomly hear about the spirit,
[00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:33.520]   but actually what Jesus does with this woman
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:37.260]   kind of sets up this idea of sacrifice and repentance, right?
[00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:39.040]   So how would you kind of explain that
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.180]   for us all to understand?
[00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:42.980]   - Yeah, I don't think we read through the entire passage,
[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:46.740]   but at least prior to the bits that we read,
[00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:50.200]   we see Jesus call out this lady's sin.
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:53.340]   So he mentioned how she has had five husbands,
[00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:58.200]   and the person she's with now is actually not her husband.
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:00.660]   So Jesus does something very interesting
[00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:02.640]   where I guess it's easy for us as people
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.560]   to sort of gloss over sin
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.320]   and maybe not really call it out,
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.720]   not really speak to it.
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:12.900]   But sin can be seen as sort of the offshoot
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:15.040]   of something that's wrong within us
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.360]   that could very easily be another idol,
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:20.480]   another thing that we end up worshiping other than God,
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:24.460]   which then leads us to express it in different sins.
[00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:26.440]   So, I mean, I won't claim to know exactly
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.360]   what was on the lady's mind,
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:31.400]   but it's very likely that she had bought into this lie,
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:34.440]   this idea that, you know, relationships, partners
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:36.800]   would be the way that she can, you know, feel whole
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.440]   and, you know, be what, you know,
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:42.160]   whatever she thinks she's meant to be.
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.300]   But then that just makes it hard for her
[00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:46.080]   to actually worship God,
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:47.920]   because she's actually worshiping something else
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.640]   within her heart that she may or may not know.
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:53.920]   So it's really cool how Jesus actually calls this out
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:56.500]   and sets, and actually flashes this out
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.400]   before the discussion of worship begins,
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:02.160]   because it's hard to worship if you don't actually,
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.720]   you know, you're not worshiping him.
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:05.560]   You don't wanna worship something else within your heart.
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:07.080]   You're gonna say something, Emma?
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:07.920]   (laughing)
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.600]   - No, I was agreeing.
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:13.600]   No, I was reminded of what it was in Ezra
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.640]   when they came back from Babylon,
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:19.320]   and they were trying to rebuild the temple,
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:21.440]   and then the first thing that they built,
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:24.120]   they didn't build the outside of the temple.
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:27.480]   What they first built was the altar itself,
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:32.200]   because in the altar, that's where the sacrifice is made,
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:35.880]   and the slaughter of all the nasty things
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:38.880]   that, like, avoids us from connecting to God
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:41.440]   is taken away, right?
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.320]   Why do we not have the spirit?
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:48.320]   It's because the sin lives within us, well, in the past.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:49.800]   (laughing)
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:50.640]   - But now we have it.
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.560]   - Yeah, but now we have the Holy Spirit, right?
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:58.560]   And the spirit, and our spirit, matches together, right?
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:01.560]   And then we get to worship the Lord, yeah.
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:04.040]   - I think it's neat that when you look at
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:07.320]   what your husband was saying around approaching Jesus,
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.600]   and it seems like there's a clarity that happens,
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:13.160]   and in that clarity of coming close to Jesus,
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:15.520]   the woman sees herself for who she truly is,
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:17.720]   and it's not like Jesus is dismissing her.
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.680]   I think it's good to make clear
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:21.200]   that even though he calls out the sin,
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.760]   he doesn't dismiss her, right?
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:24.280]   She's overjoyed, he calls out her sin,
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:25.800]   and she's like, "I see clearly.
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:27.440]   "Clearly, sir, you are a prophet."
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.480]   All of a sudden, everything kind of makes sense.
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.680]   Emma, you had a whole thing on, was it Isaiah,
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.520]   and what happens when you enter the presence?
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:34.560]   - Yeah, I was gonna say, so,
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.960]   the reason when we were discussing,
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.880]   I called repentance step zero,
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.480]   is 'cause I feel like it's a thing
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.040]   that often we're scared of.
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:44.520]   It sounds really like, oh no,
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:47.360]   all the bad things I've ever done are gonna be revealed.
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:49.720]   But actually, it's the first step,
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:52.120]   it's Jesus coming close, right?
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:55.040]   So conviction, the conviction of the spirit
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.920]   is equivalent to lighting.
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:00.720]   When you turn on a light to a room that's been dark,
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.400]   obviously you're gonna start to notice
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.240]   things in the room that are out of place.
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:06.880]   You're better than you would if it was dark, right?
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:10.440]   So if as people, we started to be a little bit less afraid
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:12.880]   of the concept of repentance and conviction,
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.460]   but noticing that God's nearness,
[00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:18.840]   because he is light, and in him no darkness dwells,
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:22.680]   his nearness will expose in us things that aren't
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.080]   to set them right.
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.600]   That's his intention, right?
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:29.000]   So we see it in Isaiah six, we see it in Luke five,
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.760]   where Isaiah sees the Lord.
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.840]   It says like, "On the day King Uzziah died,
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:33.960]   "I saw the Lord."
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.960]   And his first response after he sees the Lord,
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:38.080]   he sees God clearly, then he sees himself,
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.920]   and he's like, "Whoa, I'm a man of unclean lips,
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.120]   "and I'm gonna die."
[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:45.580]   And then the next verse is God sending an angel
[00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:46.960]   to actually purify him.
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:49.660]   And then he can hear, and then there's prophecy,
[00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:51.840]   and then there's the rest of the 60 chapters
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.200]   of the book of Isaiah, right?
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:56.680]   Same, when Luke talks about how Peter meets Jesus,
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:00.600]   he meets Jesus, and once he notices and recognizes,
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:03.320]   "Oh, this is God," then he sees himself,
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:04.880]   and he's like, "Oh, get away from me.
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:06.000]   "I'm not clean," right?
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.880]   Our tendencies, it's to go,
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:09.980]   "If I realize I'm not actually as good as I was,
[00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:12.640]   "like I thought I was, oh no."
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:15.480]   And God is saying, "No, no, I'm coming near.
[00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:18.420]   "That's why you noticed this, but I want you closer.
[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:22.020]   "So I'm revealing this so that you can have freedom.
[00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:24.200]   "Now you know that I know, I know that you know
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:27.400]   "that I know, and now you can worship me
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.600]   "without the baggage in between us."
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.960]   'Cause often a hindrance to worship is this idea
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:35.800]   that like, "Oh, if only he finds out what I had done,"
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:37.560]   or like, "Surely I can't be good enough."
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:40.160]   And it's like, it's okay, he sees you fully.
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:43.200]   And so allowing him as he convicts us,
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.600]   as we talked about a few weeks ago,
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:48.840]   that leads to his comfort, that leads to his nearness,
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.860]   that allows us freedom to actually know,
[00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:52.360]   "Oh yeah, he knows me."
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.240]   That's what the woman ends up telling them at the end,
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:55.880]   right, "Let me tell you about a man
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:58.600]   "who knows everything I've done," right?
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.440]   And there's still no distance.
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:02.420]   There is still no rejection.
[00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:05.860]   And this turns into an element of worship, right?
[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:07.940]   And so the definition that we gave of worship
[00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:09.060]   being revelation and response,
[00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:11.060]   we're gonna do it backwards this time.
[00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:13.300]   That concept takes place again,
[00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:15.620]   not just in the Sunday gathering,
[00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:17.740]   but also outside of a Sunday.
[00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:20.980]   And so let's start with what happens outside of a Sunday.
[00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:22.920]   One of the reasons I had Akin join this panel
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:26.260]   was because he's the one person who, of the five of us,
[00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:28.740]   is not on the worship team, doesn't play any instruments
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.900]   to best my, is he a good singer?
[00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:32.180]   Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:34.500]   So worship for him might look,
[00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.180]   it'll look like how it is for us, right?
[00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:37.700]   Like not all of us are on the stage,
[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:39.620]   but we know Monday to Saturday
[00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:41.540]   are still opportunities for us to worship.
[00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:44.540]   So what does worship in a Monday to Saturday
[00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:46.220]   kind of situation look like for you?
[00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:48.780]   - No, I really appreciate the definition that Emma gave
[00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:50.260]   in terms of what worship is,
[00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:52.340]   because that is a pre-course of that,
[00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:55.160]   helps us understand that it's not just what we do
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:56.880]   on Sundays here, you know?
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:00.740]   We can respond to God, we can get revelations from God
[00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:02.540]   throughout the entire week.
[00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:05.380]   So yeah, like Kwame said, I'm not on the worship team.
[00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:08.600]   You probably don't want me to be on the worship team.
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:11.620]   I've been in sales and business development
[00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:14.660]   for the past 10 or so years of my life.
[00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:17.300]   And so yeah, most of what,
[00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:20.140]   most of the opportunities that I get to actually worship,
[00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:21.900]   they fall outside of this,
[00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:25.360]   unlike the rest of them who work with the church.
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:28.120]   I think one of the things that we hinted at earlier on
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:29.780]   is one of the things that's very important
[00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:31.820]   if you want to worship God the right way,
[00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:33.780]   even outside of here.
[00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:36.580]   So being able to just look at ourselves,
[00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:40.060]   like Emma said, that call to repentance,
[00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:43.840]   trying to, you know, there's no one who is perfect.
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:46.740]   Everyone has one or two things that they are going through,
[00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:48.540]   that they are struggling with.
[00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:51.020]   And we don't want this to hinder us
[00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:52.460]   from being able to worship God.
[00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:54.500]   So I think that's, it could be challenging,
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:57.660]   it could be difficult to look at the not so good looking
[00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:58.700]   parts within ourselves,
[00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:00.860]   but I think that's a very crucial part.
[00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:03.240]   That's a very crucial aspect of it.
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:07.180]   So that yes, we're able to see ourselves in relation,
[00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:08.000]   in relation to God.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.700]   So we have a better idea of how we should actually respond
[00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:12.040]   to God.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.020]   Being able to check your heart,
[00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:16.180]   for me to be able to check my heart,
[00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:20.100]   it helps me sort of figure out why I'm doing what I am doing
[00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:22.100]   because two people can do the same things
[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:22.940]   for different reasons
[00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:24.620]   and God will judge them very differently
[00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:26.580]   'cause he looks at the heart.
[00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:29.340]   So like I mentioned, I'm in sales.
[00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:32.280]   One of the things that you would hear said
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:36.300]   if you're in sales is that the value ascribed to you
[00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:39.180]   is the money that you're able to make.
[00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:41.620]   That can be very pervasive, not only in sales,
[00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:43.660]   but in Hong Kong in general.
[00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:46.180]   There's this idea that we are judged
[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:47.980]   based on our financial value
[00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:52.100]   and it's very real in my industry because that is my job.
[00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:53.020]   (laughing)
[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:54.780]   That's exactly what I'm there to do.
[00:32:55.820 --> 00:33:00.540]   So me waking up in the morning, me going off to work,
[00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:03.740]   am I doing that because I've fallen into this lie
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:07.260]   where the only value that I have
[00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:10.380]   is because of the money that I'm able to make?
[00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:13.300]   Because in that case, I am not worshiping God.
[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:14.900]   There is no truth to that.
[00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:17.420]   The Holy Spirit will not lead me to that.
[00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:19.640]   I can do the exact same thing,
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:21.540]   but understand that I'm doing it
[00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:24.480]   because it's an opportunity for me to worship God.
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:26.980]   It's an opportunity for me to use the talents
[00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:29.060]   and the skills that he has given me
[00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:32.660]   in a way that he actually wants me to.
[00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:35.060]   It is a blessing from God that,
[00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:39.780]   yes, he has helped me speak once in a while,
[00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:43.500]   but there's a story, there's a parable of the talents
[00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:47.420]   where God gives, the master gives talents to different people
[00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:48.820]   and he wants them to use it.
[00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:51.140]   He doesn't want them to just bury it within the sand.
[00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:53.160]   So yeah, being able to do that,
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:54.940]   that's a much better, yeah,
[00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:56.180]   going at it from that perspective
[00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:57.660]   is what I'm trying to say,
[00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:59.540]   much more easier to worship God
[00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:01.660]   as opposed to coming from a fearful
[00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:04.220]   or false value perspective.
[00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:05.820]   - Or you're gonna lose your job kind of perspective.
[00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:06.660]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:07.500]   - So I think really holding that place
[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:10.140]   of the response in that situation
[00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:12.180]   is I'm responding to the call of God.
[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:14.780]   I'm stewarding the resources that God has given me
[00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:15.980]   in a way that would make him proud.
[00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:19.380]   I'm maximizing my talents, I maximize my potential,
[00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:21.820]   not just for me, not because I'm afraid to get laid off,
[00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:23.520]   but because this is what God has given me
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.700]   and it's a call of excellence in that.
[00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:28.120]   It was really fun, like for me,
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:30.160]   a lot of times my worship is,
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:32.240]   if I'm leading worship, which is like once every six months,
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:34.860]   or if I'm on stage preaching,
[00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:36.040]   that could be a part of my worship.
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.200]   But we had an interesting encounter recently.
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:40.680]   Allison and I have been working with this guy
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:44.420]   who is dealing with, he's moved here,
[00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:47.120]   kind of gonna be a refugee and asylum seeker
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:49.760]   kind of seeking status from kind of
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:52.940]   some type of bad situation where he came from.
[00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:56.060]   And we're sitting with him and we don't have the answers.
[00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:58.700]   Like this is way above, like we're pastors, we can pray,
[00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:00.900]   but we don't know how to solve all these issues, right?
[00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:03.820]   And I just remember finding my heart,
[00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:06.300]   like at first I was a bit cold, if I'm being honest.
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:08.340]   I repented afterwards, but I was a bit cold
[00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:10.220]   'cause it was like, how do I know if your story's real?
[00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:12.300]   And how do I, we don't have all this money to give away,
[00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:13.220]   da da da da da.
[00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:14.600]   But as I sat there and I listened
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:16.860]   and I let God start to soften my heart,
[00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:18.300]   my heart changed a bit.
[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:21.040]   And I recognized that by just spending time
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:23.080]   in the conversation, by engaging with him,
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:25.040]   even though I don't know him from anywhere,
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:26.800]   by listening, by finding ways,
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.640]   by finding unorthodox ways that we could help
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:29.700]   work with this guy.
[00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:31.200]   It was funny, I was telling one of you,
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.820]   I was like, I got the same chill bumps
[00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:34.660]   that you get in worship.
[00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:37.580]   Like I realized it was my worship for that day.
[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:41.340]   Like that encounter, responding and bringing God's truth
[00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:44.260]   to that person and making time like Jesus would for them
[00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:45.440]   was my act of worship.
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.240]   And so worship does take place outside
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:50.060]   of the auditorium, outside of Sundays.
[00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:52.020]   But on Sundays, Jethro and Emma,
[00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:54.480]   I'd love to hear from you guys on how do you kind of
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:57.220]   balance this spirit and truth thing.
[00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:59.420]   If we're congregation members sitting here,
[00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:00.900]   getting ready to worship and sing songs,
[00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:03.060]   how do you kind of take spirit and truth
[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:06.340]   into a worship setting, musically?
[00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:09.680]   - Well, one of the thoughts I had of reading this passage
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:12.580]   initially was when Jesus said, in truth,
[00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:17.580]   was also that in honesty and in integrity.
[00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:20.700]   And that's what God always speaks to me about,
[00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:23.360]   where if I come to worship,
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.640]   am I pretending to be someone else?
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:28.680]   Am I pretending to be perfect so that God accepts me?
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:31.120]   Or am I coming with all my pain and my struggle
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:34.340]   and my questions and I still come to worship on a Sunday
[00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:36.480]   because that's what God asked me to do.
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:39.220]   And I still lift my hands because that's what the Bible
[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:41.180]   asked me to do, not because I'm feeling like it
[00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:42.780]   or I wanna be cool and whatever.
[00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:43.900]   - That's good.
[00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:47.280]   - So yeah, one worship leader said,
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.820]   when we're suffering on earth,
[00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:52.180]   that is an opportunity for us to give a sacrifice of praise
[00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:54.940]   because when we're in heaven, we don't have suffering.
[00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:57.780]   So in your suffering, in our suffering,
[00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:01.660]   when we come to worship him, do it out of a place of faith
[00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:04.220]   and not out of a place of feeling like it.
[00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:07.340]   - What about for you?
[00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:08.460]   When you come into this space,
[00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:10.620]   I mean, you lead worship like every single week.
[00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:11.820]   Like literally every week.
[00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:12.660]   You weren't supposed to lead worship,
[00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:14.060]   but I was supposed to lead worship.
[00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:15.860]   Okay, her birthday's next week,
[00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:17.720]   so she's taking some time off.
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:20.220]   But yeah, when you come into this space for worship,
[00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:21.620]   how do you wrestle with spirit and truth?
[00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:23.740]   Is it always easy to do both?
[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:25.360]   Is there ever a tension?
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.500]   - It's definitely not easy.
[00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:31.620]   I think unless you were like, if this were a performance,
[00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:33.860]   then you could kind of shut off real life.
[00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:36.180]   But I'm reminded of the Psalm that says,
[00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:39.740]   "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me."
[00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:43.420]   And so that's how I come, with all that is within me.
[00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:44.820]   And I bring it before him,
[00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:49.160]   and I don't leave the crappy parts at the door.
[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:50.000]   I bring it in.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.420]   I said, "God, here are my questions, here are my doubts,
[00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:54.560]   "and here are the struggles I have with health,
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:56.680]   "here are the struggles I have with family."
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:59.340]   But you are faithful, that's true.
[00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:02.400]   Even if the facts of my life right now
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.700]   are rising against the knowledge of that,
[00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:07.520]   what will stand the test of time and eternity
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:08.880]   is who you say you are.
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:11.320]   So then it's like, I mean, I don't always feel like it.
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:13.520]   So sometimes I'm telling myself.
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:15.060]   I repeat things a lot, and you might think,
[00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:16.260]   like, oh, she's deep.
[00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:20.480]   I'm telling myself, he is good, he is faithful.
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:23.780]   And until my feelings catch up.
[00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:25.260]   Sometimes it takes a minute.
[00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:27.120]   Sometimes, if you've had a good week,
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:30.360]   your feelings are way ahead, and you gotta like, oh, okay.
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:32.760]   But a lot of, more often than not,
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:36.480]   it's just like being obedient to the call
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.360]   to praise the Lord.
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:39.480]   And I think it's one of the reasons I love
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:41.280]   the gathering of God's people,
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.940]   because when I don't have the strength,
[00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:45.560]   I come into the community of faith,
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:48.360]   and I'm honest with the community of faith.
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:52.680]   I'm like, I'm not, I'm not doing well, I haven't slept.
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:53.920]   And there have been so many Sundays
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:57.700]   where we're really held by the grace of God
[00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:00.680]   and the presence of people in the community
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:02.840]   that will check in, and we'll all just literally
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:04.080]   be interceding for one another.
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:05.640]   Everybody's like falling apart.
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:07.360]   But God is faithful.
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:08.240]   God is faithful.
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:10.760]   And I think that's real, that's real life, right?
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:14.840]   You're not always like, woohoo, I feel it.
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:19.200]   But reminding, training myself to recite truth
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:22.080]   so that when I don't, which is a lot,
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:24.800]   my confession is still truth.
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:27.380]   Until I remember, like, oh, right.
[00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:29.560]   So even when I don't feel it, you are good.
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:30.960]   - I mean, that's a good line.
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:32.360]   I think we wrote that one time.
[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:34.680]   That's the perfect place to land, guys.
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:36.640]   Thank you for being a part of this.
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:39.120]   As the worship team gets back up on stage,
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:41.240]   I'm just gonna pray for us, but thank you, Jew,
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:44.400]   and thank you, Akin, for joining us in this space.
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:51.000]   Well, Church, if you'll go ahead and stand with me,
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.800]   we're gonna spend some time stepping back
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:56.400]   into this space of revelation and response.
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:59.500]   And I don't know where you are today,
[00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:00.340]   where you are this morning.
[00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:01.720]   Maybe it is hard for you.
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:04.160]   Maybe, like Emma said, maybe the facts of life
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.960]   are telling a different story,
[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:08.880]   but when we worship in truth and we worship the truth,
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:11.920]   we know that he is good, that he is faithful.
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:15.100]   And even if we don't see it yet, he remains true.
[00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:18.040]   And we worship not just with our words,
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:19.200]   not just with what we know,
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:22.800]   but we allow the spirit that dwells within us
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:26.120]   to speak to our spirits, to encourage our spirits,
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:27.880]   to speak truth to our spirits.
[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:31.800]   There's been so many times that a certain lyric in a song
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:35.280]   helps me actually get to the place of worshiping God
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.280]   with my whole heart.
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:39.240]   And so, Father, we come before you this morning
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:41.800]   and we thank you that you've given us both,
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.960]   that you've given us the truth in Jesus,
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:48.200]   we've given us the truth in your word revealed.
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:51.920]   You've also given us your spirit, a guide, a comfort,
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:53.200]   someone that goes ahead of us,
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:55.880]   someone that leads us to truth,
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:57.680]   that brings things back to memory.
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:00.160]   So as we sit in this moment, Holy Spirit,
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:03.440]   would you begin to lead us to your truth?
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:06.160]   Would you begin to push against the lies,
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:09.800]   push against the false identities that are around,
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.760]   against anything that would separate us
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:14.000]   from being able to see you clearly
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   and know that your love and that your mercies are abounding,
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.320]   that you are good and that you are faithful and you are kind.
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:26.240]   So we respond to you now in spirit to your truth.
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:28.400]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:31.000]   (gentle music)
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.600]   (gentle music)
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:36.200]   (gentle music)
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:38.700]   (music fades)
[00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:48.700]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
