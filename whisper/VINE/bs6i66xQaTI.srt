1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
 So a couple of years ago,

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,720
 I felt God challenged me deeply to fast food for 21 days.

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,000
 I felt like God was saying,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,560
 "Okay, Andrew, I want you to physically sacrifice,

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,680
 to physically suffer in order to

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,100
 press into obedience with me."

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,920
 And so for 21 days,

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,560
 I allowed nothing in my body other than water,

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,720
 no food at all.

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,920
 And I have to say, I struggled and wrestled

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,080
 and went back and forth as to whether I should actually

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,400
 share this story with you today,

13
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,320
 because I'm concerned, first of all,

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,800
 that you might think that in sharing this,

15
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,540
 that I'm kind of putting myself up there

16
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,920
 as some super holy person,

17
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,000
 but I trust if you're part of the Vine Church,

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,520
 you know that I'm not the super holy person.

19
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,280
 Okay, so that's good.

20
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,040
 But the second thing that I was concerned about

21
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,760
 is that you might hear me tell this story,

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,440
 and then you might think that this is what you should do,

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,200
 that you should copy me and try to do something like that.

24
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,660
 And I just wanna say that actually,

25
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,160
 when you do something like this,

26
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,360
 it has to be a very specific call from God.

27
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,040
 It is incredibly difficult.

28
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,600
 It is actually physically quite dangerous.

29
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,060
 And what God calls us to in those moments

30
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,600
 is quite a radical thing.

31
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,680
 And so when I did it,

32
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,560
 I made sure I had a community of support around me.

33
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,520
 I made sure I was accountable to people.

34
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,560
 I wasn't just doing it on my own.

35
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,460
 And I knew that I had the calling and the grace of God

36
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,620
 to step into that moment.

37
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,920
 So make sure that that's for you,

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,340
 if that's what God ever calls you into.

39
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,600
 Most of the time, I tell people not to do it.

40
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,440
 But I share with you today about that experience

41
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,360
 because of what it birthed in me,

42
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,780
 what it actually forged in me that I think is central

43
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,200
 to what God wants to say to us today in his scriptures.

44
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,500
 Fasting for 21 days, having no food in my body

45
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,800
 was the hardest thing

46
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,040
 that I have probably physically ever done.

47
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,800
 Every single day, of course,

48
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,560
 my body was crying out for calories, for nutrition,

49
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,000
 for nutrients, for whatever it needed

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,040
 to have that energy to keep going.

51
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,880
 But actually the hardest part of the journey of that 21 days

52
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,440
 wasn't the physical pain,

53
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,760
 it was the mental suffering and anguish that I went through.

54
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,560
 It's incredible what your mind does

55
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,760
 when your body is crying out for food.

56
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,000
 And I had constant days

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,440
 where there was just this mental anguish and suffering

58
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,600
 where I was fighting the temptations.

59
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,880
 The irony is in this 21 days,

60
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,840
 my family was watching actually a cooking show.

61
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,900
 I kid you not, we were watching every night a cooking show.

62
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,320
 And I had to sit there and kind of go,

63
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,320
 I am not gonna be tempted to eat food in any way.

64
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,640
 And the only way I got through these 21 days

65
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,200
 was through the work of the Holy Spirit,

66
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,560
 was through his grace and his empowerment of me,

67
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,480
 the way that he strengthened me

68
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,720
 and moved in my heart and my life.

69
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,280
 That was the only way I was able

70
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,240
 to actually get through that time.

71
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,280
 And I realized that what God was asking,

72
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,760
 the challenge he was requiring of me was,

73
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,160
 will I put him first?

74
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,200
 No matter how much I suffer,

75
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,960
 no matter how much I'm sacrificing,

76
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,320
 will I actually put him first?

77
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,160
 Will I rely upon him and his help and his spirit

78
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,280
 above anything else?

79
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,840
 Even when my body and my mind is trying to fight against it,

80
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,780
 will I stand for him?

81
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,520
 I learned out of those 21 days,

82
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,520
 that actually if God calls me to serve,

83
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,400
 and if that serving comes with suffering and hardship,

84
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,000
 then by his grace, I am actually able

85
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,360
 to adhere to that service and to follow him.

86
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,200
 That personal strength was forged in me in that time.

87
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,720
 And it's not lost on me that actually

88
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,740
 that lesson I had to learn happened just one year

89
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:40,040
 before 2019 and 2020.

90
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,040
 That God knew all of the stuff

91
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,920
 that Hong Kong was about to enter into.

92
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,200
 And he knew what the vine was about to face

93
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,820
 as it was dealing with a political upheaval in its city,

94
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,200
 as it was dealing then eventually with a pandemic

95
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,360
 that was going global.

96
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,600
 As we were dealing with all that,

97
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,360
 God knew the stress and the pressure and the suffering

98
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,080
 that would come on me in my leadership

99
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,040
 in the midst of that.

100
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,520
 And prior to that, he's like,

101
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,280
 I'm gonna take you through something

102
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,880
 where you're gonna discover a personal strength in you

103
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,980
 that's going to be there when you need it the most.

104
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:16,120
 See, if post-traumatic growth teaches us anything,

105
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,200
 it teaches us this, that actually trauma can be the place

106
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,780
 where we discover a newness in life,

107
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,920
 a discovery of a personal strength,

108
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,480
 where we find ourselves a conviction of character

109
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,000
 that would not have been there

110
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,120
 unless we had been through that trauma in the first place.

111
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,680
 That we might be able to emerge out of our hard times

112
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,500
 going, you know what?

113
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,920
 I know myself better.

114
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,320
 I may not be perfect,

115
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,920
 but I know that there is a conviction of the gospel

116
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,480
 that sits inside of me,

117
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,400
 a conviction of what Christ is calling me to

118
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,920
 that wasn't there, that I couldn't rely on

119
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,680
 prior to that trauma, but now it is.

120
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,680
 You see, the survival of a highly traumatic experience

121
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,780
 forges in us a character and a focus of mind

122
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,400
 that rarely exists in those that have not faced

123
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,060
 a great trial or a great adversity.

124
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,940
 And you see, this is the beautiful thing, I think,

125
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,200
 about what we've been looking at in this series,

126
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,040
 this great invitation for us to think about our traumas,

127
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,240
 not as the stress they create,

128
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,280
 but actually as something that brings us

129
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,840
 into a newness with God.

130
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,460
 And here in my years of pastoring at the Vine,

131
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,360
 I've seen some of the worst things.

132
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,040
 I've seen people lose jobs.

133
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,440
 I've seen people lose family.

134
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,960
 I've seen people really struggle in their marriages.

135
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,640
 I've seen divorce and infidelity.

136
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,580
 I've seen depression and anxiety grip people,

137
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,580
 mental health issues.

138
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,600
 I mean, you name it.

139
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,240
 And almost every single case, when you look at it,

140
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,720
 these places are fertile ground for God to do something

141
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,440
 in those people that would not have occurred otherwise.

142
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,840
 Here's the thing, our trauma can actually create a boldness,

143
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,400
 a courage, and a conviction of character

144
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,640
 that is found in us because we've experienced a hardship

145
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,700
 and we have actually overcome it.

146
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:11,680
 You know, the apostles are a case in point

147
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,840
 in the death and resurrection of Jesus.

148
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,280
 The apostles show to us this beautiful picture

149
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,640
 of what it is to stand with a new

150
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,400
 and renewed personal strength in God,

151
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,120
 despite what they have been through.

152
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,480
 We've been sharing a lot about the apostles' stories.

153
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,520
 I shared a couple of weeks ago about Peter

154
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,040
 and what we see in Peter's life

155
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,540
 and how Peter in the arrest of Jesus,

156
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,600
 and he follows the crowd into the courtyards

157
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,080
 of the high priest and there warming himself by the fire,

158
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,880
 realizes that he's in trouble,

159
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,040
 realizing that actually he might,

160
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,520
 in his own life, might also be at risk here.

161
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,520
 And as he's standing around that fireplace,

162
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,840
 he hears the call of that on his spirit

163
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,960
 and the trauma and the fear of it.

164
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,320
 And he denies Jesus three times right there.

165
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,800
 And then in the shame and the guilt of that,

166
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,320
 he retreats to the beach,

167
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,040
 goes back to the very thing that he used to do,

168
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,360
 a fisherman before, not a fisher of men anymore,

169
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,600
 but a fisher of fish, literally,

170
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,000
 into the comfort and security of what he's always known.

171
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,500
 And Jesus has to go there, meet him,

172
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,660
 create a fire for him and release him back

173
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,300
 into the restoration of who he is

174
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,500
 by asking him three times, "Do you love me?"

175
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,540
 And that journey that Peter goes on

176
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,700
 is part of the trauma he needed

177
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,820
 to form what we eventually see in him.

178
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,140
 And it's not just Peter.

179
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,460
 All the apostles suffer Good Friday

180
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:31,860
 and hide themselves in fear on Easter Saturday,

181
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,460
 but it's in the resurrection of Jesus

182
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,460
 and in the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost

183
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:41,340
 that there is such a personal strength of character

184
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,380
 and conviction that falls upon the apostles

185
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:48,820
 that we see them do incredible feats for the church.

186
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,740
 We see them do for the church

187
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,300
 what the gates of hell cannot come against it.

188
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,340
 And here's the thing,

189
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,740
 the book of Acts is the picture of a group of people

190
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,620
 who have such profound conviction and personal strength

191
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:06,020
 simply because of the trauma they had been through

192
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,780
 and the resurrection of Jesus

193
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:11,420
 and the power of the Spirit that's been birthed upon them.

194
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,100
 And you see throughout the book of Acts,

195
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,980
 amazing moments where these apostles,

196
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,700
 the ones that had hid, the ones that had fled,

197
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,780
 the ones that were insecure,

198
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:24,060
 were able to stand in front of the worst powers

199
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,100
 that were trying to persecute them

200
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:30,420
 and not falter in their conviction of the gospel to say,

201
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:34,060
 "I will not be ashamed of the thing

202
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:37,820
 that has been formed in me by the resurrection of Jesus

203
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,020
 and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit."

204
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,820
 I wanna encourage you today with this,

205
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,300
 that I believe that same personal strength

206
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,740
 and that same sense of conviction can also be in you.

207
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:54,180
 Actually, let me say it this way, it needs to be in you.

208
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,220
 I wanna say today that I believe

209
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,140
 that the last one and a half years here in Hong Kong

210
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,840
 and all the trauma that it's created for all of us

211
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,300
 is actually the very thing that we have needed

212
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,980
 to be able to have a personal strength and conviction

213
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,980
 of the gospel in us for everything that is about to come.

214
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:17,340
 I believe that God is gonna meet you in this hour

215
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:22,060
 and in this time, and He's gonna so strengthen your heart

216
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,740
 that no matter what might take place in the future,

217
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:28,620
 you will stand up and be counted for the gospel.

218
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,860
 Could you imagine a church like that?

219
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,360
 Acts gives us a picture of that church.

220
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,200
 And today I wanna share a story actually

221
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,620
 out of Acts chapter five.

222
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,120
 It's right early on in the story of the early church.

223
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,680
 It's literally probably just a few months

224
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,120
 from the death and resurrection of Jesus.

225
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,560
 And in this story, the apostles have begun the church

226
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,440
 by regularly meeting every day on the temple courts

227
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,320
 just right outside the temple in Jerusalem.

228
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,920
 And they would gather in those courts

229
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,640
 and they would share boldly the message of Jesus.

230
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,560
 They would say that Jesus is the Messiah,

231
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,480
 that Jesus is the one that God has raised from the dead,

232
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,200
 ascended to the heavenly realms,

233
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,960
 that He's the one with all the power and authority

234
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,960
 to forgive and restore.

235
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,160
 And they preached the gospel and many people,

236
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,960
 many Jewish people were coming to faith.

237
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,840
 Now, perhaps not surprisingly,

238
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,480
 when this small little sect of Judaism was beginning

239
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,220
 and beginning to say that there is this carpenter

240
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,980
 from Nazareth who was actually the son of God,

241
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:30,680
 the powers to be, the power of the Jewish authorities

242
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,580
 of the day absolutely hated the guys for doing this.

243
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,940
 I mean, they were so angry and so upset.

244
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:40,820
 They were spreading this rumor about Jesus being the Messiah

245
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,140
 and they were doing everything in their power

246
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:43,980
 to stamp it out.

247
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,460
 Anytime that you speak out the gospel

248
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,860
 and that gospel stands against people who are in power,

249
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,740
 that power is going to fight back.

250
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,500
 And what you see in Acts chapter five

251
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,980
 is this power asserting itself onto the apostles.

252
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,940
 The power was called the Sanhedrin.

253
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:04,700
 The Sanhedrin was 71 men who actually were responsible

254
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,980
 for the control of the worship that happened in the temple.

255
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,780
 They essentially did three things.

256
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,780
 They set the temple service.

257
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:15,460
 They actually controlled all of the bartering system

258
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,580
 that took place for the sacrifices.

259
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,700
 So when people came to bring a sacrifice

260
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,660
 and they purchased the sacrifice at the temple,

261
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,140
 that was controlled by the 71 in the Sanhedrin.

262
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:28,100
 They actually profited off of that sacrificial system.

263
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,980
 And the third thing they did was actually set

264
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,020
 the common laws for the Jewish people

265
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,740
 and how they should interact with one another.

266
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,940
 So they were both the religious authority,

267
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,700
 but also the political authority

268
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,900
 for how the Jewish people worked

269
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,220
 and lived together in that time.

270
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:46,660
 And these people drag the apostles before them

271
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,860
 to hold them to court, to basically say,

272
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,500
 we want you to stop preaching the gospel

273
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,020
 because what you're doing in our eyes

274
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,300
 is blasphemous.

275
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,500
 I wanna pick up the story actually from that point.

276
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,740
 And I'm gonna start in verse 27 of Acts chapter five.

277
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,580
 Is everybody okay?

278
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,420
 You guys all right?

279
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,260
 You're with me?

280
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,080
 Okay, cool.

281
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,920
 I want to read this to you.

282
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,060
 Here it says this.

283
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,900
 Having brought the apostles, that's the Sanhedrin,

284
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,020
 they made them appear before the Sanhedrin

285
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,460
 to be questioned by the high priests.

286
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,900
 We gave you strict orders not to teach in his name,

287
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,420
 they said, yet you have filled Jerusalem

288
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,780
 with your teaching and are determined

289
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:27,260
 to make us guilty of this man's blood.

290
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,660
 I want you to notice what's happening here.

291
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:33,980
 They come and they call the whole of the apostles to account

292
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,340
 and they actually, funnily enough,

293
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,180
 kind of reveal all their cards at once.

294
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,780
 They say, look, we know that you're going around preaching,

295
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,380
 even though we told you not to.

296
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,700
 And we know that you're filling the whole land

297
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,580
 with this idea of what it is to see Jesus as the Messiah.

298
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,460
 And not only that, notice what they say here.

299
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,660
 He says, you are determined to make us guilty

300
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,420
 of this man's blood.

301
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:59,420
 You're determined to put his death on our shoulders.

302
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,980
 So they're basically charging the apostles

303
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,420
 with heresy, with blasphemy,

304
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,900
 and with kind of charging the Sanhedrin

305
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:13,900
 with the guilt of the murder of this Jesus from Nazareth.

306
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:18,580
 I want you to see how Peter responds, starting in verse 29.

307
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,820
 Peter and the other apostles replied this.

308
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:24,780
 We must obey God rather than human beings.

309
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,500
 The God of our father raised Jesus from the dead,

310
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,780
 whom you had killed by hanging him on a tree.

311
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:35,100
 God exalted him to his own right hand as Prince and Savior,

312
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,100
 that he might give repentance and forgiveness

313
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,620
 to the sins of Israel.

314
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:42,260
 We are witnesses of these things.

315
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:46,460
 And so it is the Holy Spirit whom God has now given

316
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,820
 to those who obey him.

317
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,900
 Check this church.

318
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:54,580
 This is the same Peter who just months prior

319
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,980
 is standing in the courtyard of the high priest's house,

320
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,740
 warming himself at the fire.

321
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:04,420
 And when they say, you knew Jesus, he denies it three times.

322
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,940
 Now, just a few months later,

323
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,020
 he's standing in front of the high priest,

324
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,740
 in front of all of the Sanhedrin,

325
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,060
 and he basically says three things to them.

326
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,380
 First of all, you're a bunch of murderers.

327
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:18,420
 That you've actually hung this Jesus on the cross.

328
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:22,340
 That it was you, that the blood is actually on your hands.

329
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,860
 And then he says, not only that,

330
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,500
 but you're actually a bunch of sinners.

331
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,580
 He actually says, here's the crazy thing.

332
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,260
 God has raised Jesus from the death,

333
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,580
 and he's put him now at the right hand of the father.

334
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,300
 The right hand always symbolized the place of power

335
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,700
 and authority, and Peter preaches the gospel to them.

336
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,860
 He says, now, because of the Savior and Prince, Lord Jesus,

337
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,180
 at the right hand of the father,

338
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,380
 anyone who asks for his forgiveness,

339
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:50,460
 anyone who repents will be forgiven by God.

340
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,660
 He's placing it before the Sanhedrin

341
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,900
 and before the high priest.

342
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,580
 He says, I know you killed Jesus, but guess what?

343
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,940
 There is still grace, even for you.

344
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,580
 There is still the ability for you

345
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,020
 to come under the grace of God,

346
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,860
 'cause Jesus is now seated at the right hand of the father.

347
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:09,020
 And if you confess, he will respond and forgive you.

348
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,220
 And if that wasn't enough,

349
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:13,100
 then Peter throws in an extra piece of hot sauce.

350
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,740
 He basically goes, hey, you know this Holy Spirit thing?

351
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,100
 This Holy Spirit thing that you try to control

352
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,220
 as the Sanhedrin in the temple,

353
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,140
 that you've kind of made all about the temple.

354
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,220
 Well, guess what?

355
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,700
 That Holy Spirit right now is poured out

356
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,740
 on anyone who's obedient to Jesus.

357
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:33,500
 Not just related anymore to what's happening

358
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,260
 in this building, but to anyone who's obedient with Jesus.

359
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,300
 Peter stands in front of the Sanhedrin,

360
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,660
 and he says, you're murderers, you're sinners,

361
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,500
 and guess what?

362
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,580
 The Holy Spirit is not contained by your laws

363
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,940
 or by your power anymore.

364
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:51,820
 And you have to ask yourself, how does Peter do this?

365
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,140
 I mean, what has happened in him?

366
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:57,780
 What is driving him to have such fortitude

367
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:00,940
 of his convictions that he's willing to say these things

368
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:05,340
 to the most powerful people around him in the region?

369
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,940
 Well, we find that answer right at the start of verse 29.

370
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:12,940
 He says this, we must obey God rather than human beings.

371
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:17,620
 We must obey God rather than human beings.

372
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,420
 No, this is Peter.

373
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,180
 And Peter, it's almost like he's saying this,

374
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,380
 I know what it is not to obey God.

375
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:28,100
 I know what the trauma has done to me.

376
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,780
 I know what it was to stand by that fire on that day

377
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,180
 and deny even knowing Jesus.

378
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:36,620
 I know what it's like to allow fear to hold back the gospel.

379
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,620
 I know what it's like to confess that I got it wrong,

380
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,500
 that I screwed up, but guess what?

381
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,940
 Jesus came and met me and he met me and restored me

382
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,660
 and renewed me and turned me into the person I am today.

383
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,460
 And through all of that trauma,

384
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,700
 a conviction of spirit has come.

385
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,060
 I will never deny him again.

386
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:55,900
 You know what?

387
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:00,460
 I will always obey God, even if it comes at the cost

388
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:05,460
 of disobeying humanity, human beings, the human law.

389
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:08,900
 Now, I want you to hear this.

390
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,860
 Peter is not totally disregarding the law.

391
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,220
 He's not trying to stir up people to be rebellious

392
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,420
 against the human law.

393
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:18,900
 Peter lived most of his life in conviction and obedience

394
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,660
 to the Jewish laws around him.

395
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,500
 But what he is saying is this,

396
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,900
 when those laws come into conflict with the gospel,

397
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,300
 you will always find me on the side of the gospel.

398
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,220
 When those two things conflict,

399
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,660
 I will always stand up and be counseled

400
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,980
 for the blood of Jesus.

401
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,780
 Maybe before in my story,

402
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,660
 I found myself on the wrong side of that equation,

403
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,540
 but through the fortitude that is now birthed

404
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:47,860
 and forged like diamonds is the crushing of coal

405
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,660
 and the crushing of my trauma.

406
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,860
 I stand before you now and I say,

407
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,620
 I am on the side of the gospel.

408
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:58,620
 I will obey God, even if it means having to disobey you.

409
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:05,460
 I mean, this is Peter saying, I put God first.

410
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:11,020
 My 21 days of fasting was me learning what it was,

411
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,940
 despite everything my body and my mind was saying

412
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,780
 to put God first.

413
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,700
 And I know what you're thinking.

414
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,180
 You're thinking, oh, Andrew, I put God first.

415
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,220
 That's what I do.

416
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,940
 Yeah, I'm a God first person.

417
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,460
 Me and my family, we put God first.

418
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,900
 Here's something that I've discovered

419
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,780
 in all my years of pastoring.

420
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,900
 It's easy to put God first when it comes

421
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,460
 with little personal costs associated with living it out.

422
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:36,140
 But when we put in God first,

423
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,460
 when it actually convicts us,

424
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,300
 when it actually comes with great cost

425
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,580
 and great personal suffering,

426
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,900
 when that happens, we so easily find ourselves

427
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,940
 on the side of what is safe rather than what is faithful.

428
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:54,820
 When personal costs, when putting Jesus first

429
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,620
 actually impacts us, when actually he's gonna have

430
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,260
 a problem, a suffering for us,

431
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:04,220
 we so often side with the safety net

432
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,820
 rather than being willing to stand up

433
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,180
 and be counted as faithful.

434
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,060
 That's the lesson the apostles had discovered.

435
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,340
 That's the thing that God had showed them.

436
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,340
 And they're willing to stand in front of the Sanhedrin

437
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,860
 no matter what the Sanhedrin might do

438
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:20,500
 and declare the reality of that.

439
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,780
 And the Sanhedrin wants to kill them,

440
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,900
 literally wants to kill them.

441
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,220
 And Gamaliel stands up, one of the Sanhedrin,

442
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,580
 and says, no, no, don't kill them.

443
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,500
 Actually, here's the thing.

444
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,260
 If we let them go and it's not from God, it's gonna fail.

445
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,660
 If we let them go and it's from God and we persecute them,

446
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,100
 then that is on us.

447
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,980
 And I wanna jump right to the end of this part

448
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,300
 of the story, and I wanna read you what happens

449
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,140
 right at the end.

450
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,140
 This is starting in verse 40.

451
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,860
 His speech, that's Gamaliel's, persuaded them.

452
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,660
 They called the apostle in and they had them flogged.

453
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,460
 Then ordered them not to speak of the name of Jesus

454
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,420
 and let them go.

455
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:58,040
 The apostles left the Sanhedrin rejoicing

456
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,860
 that they had been counted worthy

457
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:03,060
 of suffering disgrace for the name.

458
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:06,700
 They brought the apostles in.

459
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,140
 They told them no more preaching in the name of Jesus.

460
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,940
 And then they flogged them, they beat them.

461
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,680
 This is not some light little punishment.

462
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,500
 I mean, they went away with probably broken ribs,

463
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,600
 bruised faces, closed eyes.

464
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,620
 They were beaten up severely.

465
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,240
 There would have been weeks of need for recovery

466
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,380
 from the pain of what they had just gone through.

467
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,220
 And they leave there rejoicing

468
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:30,820
 that they had been counted worthy of suffering

469
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,540
 in the name of Jesus.

470
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,580
 From hiding and fleeing persecution,

471
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,380
 for rejoicing in the name of God

472
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,660
 and the suffering that that brings,

473
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,920
 what change has happened for these men?

474
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:47,420
 And I love this idea that they were able to rejoice.

475
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,400
 They weren't happy about their suffering.

476
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,180
 They're not finding joy in the act of suffering itself,

477
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,380
 but they're able to find rejoicing

478
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:01,140
 because actually the suffering was proof to them

479
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,140
 that they were living out the plans of Jesus.

480
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,300
 So they realized that if we're gonna follow Jesus,

481
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,300
 it doesn't mean just following him into the great moments,

482
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,380
 the miracles, the walking on water,

483
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,900
 the feeding of the 5,000.

484
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,780
 Yeah, Jesus did those things and he conquered that.

485
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:17,040
 But Jesus also went to the cross.

486
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,040
 Jesus also was ostracized.

487
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,740
 Jesus was ridiculed and beaten and abused

488
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,420
 and eventually killed on the cross.

489
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,200
 And so if we're gonna follow Jesus,

490
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,320
 we want the miracles, yes,

491
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,720
 but we also need to realize that in following Jesus

492
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,220
 and living out our convictions,

493
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,420
 it might also bring suffering to us.

494
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,260
 Why?

495
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,100
 Because actually to follow Jesus means

496
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,660
 we will encounter both.

497
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:43,060
 Oh, we will rejoice that we're not just

498
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,740
 receiving the miracles,

499
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,900
 but we have a strength of conviction in us

500
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:53,900
 that we can find solidarity in the sufferings of Jesus,

501
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:57,620
 that actually maybe it's in the suffering

502
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:01,600
 that I might become to know him most.

503
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,360
 Over these 21 days of our fast

504
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,120
 and over these devotions we've been reading,

505
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:09,960
 I don't know about you,

506
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,040
 but I've been blown away by the stories

507
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,920
 of the men and women from the vine

508
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,760
 who have suffered real trauma.

509
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,920
 We've heard stories of those who have lost loved ones,

510
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,000
 stories of those that have had great conviction

511
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,440
 in their lives, stories of those

512
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,320
 that were convicted of sin,

513
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:27,020
 stories of those who lost their jobs or everything,

514
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,400
 everything you can imagine has been in the last 21 days.

515
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,400
 And I've been so encouraged that in every single story,

516
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,800
 I see glimmers of the awakening of a personal conviction.

517
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:40,120
 I see a growth in the people who are able to then testify

518
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,100
 that God has done something in them

519
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,680
 that would not have happened

520
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,600
 unless that trauma had been there in the first place.

521
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,680
 Today's the last day

522
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,080
 and my mom wrote the devotional today.

523
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,200
 If you haven't read it today,

524
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,840
 your senior pastor, the son of the person who wrote it,

525
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,320
 is telling you to go read it.

526
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,800
 And my mom would be super embarrassed about this

527
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,060
 and she wouldn't want me to admit this,

528
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:03,260
 but I'm actually gonna quote her in one of my sermons.

529
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,660
 And my mom wrote this amazing devotional today

530
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,140
 about losing her husband two years ago,

531
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:11,100
 which of course is my father who died two years ago.

532
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,180
 I wanna read you something that my mom wrote.

533
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:16,660
 She said this, "So often I know God has carried me

534
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:20,280
 "in times of trouble, grief, and pain and sorrow,

535
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,520
 "even though I thought I was walking alone.

536
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,860
 "God is where you can be safe when life is hard

537
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:31,060
 "and he never leaves those who are looking for his help."

538
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:31,900
 Isn't that beautiful?

539
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,700
 Such encouraging words from my mom

540
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,020
 to say that God is right there

541
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,720
 in the midst of whatever it is

542
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,540
 that we might be challenged with.

543
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,420
 Those are some of the final words

544
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,000
 of the 21 days of devotions.

545
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,080
 But let me read to you some words that came to us

546
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,260
 at the very first day of devotions.

547
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,460
 And these are written by Joshua Wong.

548
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,540
 Let me read these to us.

549
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:54,840
 "God's intention is to leverage all of our experiences,

550
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,940
 "especially the painful ones,

551
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,320
 "so that our growth and progress

552
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:03,480
 "are beyond anything that we can imagine.

553
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,860
 "That God would take even the worst things

554
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:10,300
 "and in those forge in us something

555
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,680
 "out of those painful experiences

556
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,120
 "that are the very thing that we would need next.

557
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,040
 "Here's what the apostles did.

558
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,120
 "They allowed their past trauma

559
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,680
 "and the subsequent healing of the Holy Spirit

560
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,880
 "to prophetically forge in them a personal strength

561
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,460
 "exactly for the moment of launching the first church

562
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,680
 "in the first century.

563
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:34,920
 "God knew what he needed the apostles to do ahead of them.

564
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,520
 "And he understood better than anyone

565
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,940
 "the persecution that was about to come.

566
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:42,160
 "So God takes them through the fire of their trauma

567
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:46,320
 "to prophetically create in them a resolve strong enough

568
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,380
 "to stand up to the Sanhedrin

569
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,960
 "and say, God first."

570
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,240
 And I wanna say this over us as a church.

571
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,840
 And this is really important

572
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,960
 and actually quite strong for us.

573
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,920
 I believe that the last year and a half here in Hong Kong,

574
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,420
 with everything we've seen politically

575
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:06,040
 and everything we've gone through with this pandemic,

576
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,240
 all of it was God's fire

577
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,280
 in which he is forging prophetically in us

578
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,560
 a strength of character and a conviction of the faith

579
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,700
 so that when the time comes in the future,

580
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,420
 the church of Hong Kong can stand up

581
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,820
 and be counted for the gospel.

582
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,380
 So that the church in our city can stand up

583
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,700
 against whatever persecution might come

584
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,900
 and not be ashamed of the gospel,

585
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,580
 that we might be able to stand in front

586
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,900
 of whatever Sanhedrins might be in front of us

587
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:41,180
 in the future and boldly proclaim the gospel

588
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,780
 regardless of the cost.

589
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,800
 I think this is what God's doing in us, guys.

590
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,040
 I think he knows what's ahead.

591
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,600
 I'm not trying to preach doom and gloom on us.

592
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,000
 I'm not trying to say all this bad stuff is gonna happen.

593
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,600
 What I am saying is this, will we be found faithful?

594
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,560
 And I think the answer to that question

595
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,920
 comes from this trauma we're experiencing right now.

596
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,080
 Will we allow it to forge in us

597
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,760
 something that wasn't there before?

598
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:15,420
 Are we actually willing, like the disciples

599
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:18,440
 and like people we've seen in our city recently,

600
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,240
 to go to prison because of the conviction of the gospel?

601
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:27,580
 Are we willing to stand for the gospel

602
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:30,380
 no matter what might actually come our way?

603
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,980
 Not because we glory in the suffering,

604
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:35,260
 not because we want to be victims

605
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,260
 under the wheels of injustice,

606
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:40,100
 but because we have a conviction in our hearts

607
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:44,300
 that we will obey God first and foremost,

608
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:48,540
 that we will not be ashamed of the gospel

609
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:52,260
 no matter what might happen to us personally.

610
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:55,380
 Stephen refused to be silent in front of his critics

611
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,220
 and he was stoned to death.

612
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,380
 Peter refused to be silent in front of the people

613
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,500
 that wanted to pull him down

614
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,940
 and he was in prison many times.

615
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,060
 Paul and Silas refused to be silent

616
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,760
 with their conviction of the faith

617
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,980
 and they were in prison and eventually martyred.

618
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:11,920
 And I wonder whether the vine will add its name

619
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,180
 to that list.

620
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,700
 I wonder whether we as Christians here in Hong Kong

621
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,500
 would be willing to add our name to that list.

622
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,440
 That's not a small thing to say.

623
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,900
 But will we, like the apostles,

624
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,660
 be able to stand before whatever is in front of us

625
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:33,980
 and say that I consider it great joy

626
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:36,660
 that I've been counted worthy of suffering

627
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,300
 for the name of Jesus.

628
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,800
 Peter, at the end of his life, he wrote this.

629
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:47,540
 Writing to a church that was struggling and suffering,

630
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:50,860
 and Peter just a few moments before his own death says this.

631
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,980
 This is 1 Peter 4, starting in verse 12.

632
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:56,940
 Dear friends, do not be surprised at the painful trial

633
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,280
 that you are suffering,

634
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,020
 as though something strange were happening to you,

635
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,260
 but rejoice that you participate

636
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:06,020
 in the sufferings of Christ

637
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:11,020
 so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed.

638
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:16,140
 If you suffer as a Christian, do not be ashamed,

639
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:21,140
 but praise God that you bear that name.

640
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,460
 Church, we stand together

641
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:25,300
 in an important time of our city's history.

642
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,320
 We stand together, I think,

643
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,420
 in an important time of the vine's history.

644
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:32,020
 And I believe everything that we're going through right now,

645
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,580
 if we allow the Holy Spirit to speak to us,

646
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,140
 if we allow the Holy Spirit to come and have its way in us

647
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,580
 like it did in Pentecost,

648
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:43,040
 there will be forged in us exactly what it is that we need

649
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,220
 for whatever might be ahead.

650
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:49,660
 I believe that that personal strength

651
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:52,300
 is being raised up in the church in our city right now.

652
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,240
 And I believe that that personal strength

653
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,020
 is being raised up in your spirit

654
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,180
 in this moment right now.

655
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,740
 I wanna stand with you, I wanna pray for you,

656
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,660
 and I wanna believe that together

657
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:06,580
 we can be those on the roof, a community of faith,

658
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:09,580
 standing with the ones who are persecuted and oppressed

659
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:13,300
 and are pulled down, and Christ would look up and see us

660
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:16,660
 and say, "Because of their faith,

661
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:19,940
 I will do what only I can do."

662
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,060
 Let's pray, church.

663
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:24,100
 Father, we stand with you now.

664
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:29,340
 And Father, we wanna have such a conviction of faith, Lord.

665
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,160
 Father, we're humbled by Peter's story.

666
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:39,160
 A man who fled, hid, denied, was ashamed,

667
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:43,080
 and yet restored and renewed by you,

668
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,380
 filled with the power of the Holy Spirit,

669
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,160
 and then with such conviction

670
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,640
 could stand before the powers of his day

671
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:56,440
 and say, "I'm gonna obey God, no matter the cost."

672
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,360
 Lord, it was that faith and that personal strength

673
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,080
 and that conviction of spirit that formed a church.

674
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,520
 And Lord, we, the church today,

675
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,160
 we've so often come to define the blessings of God

676
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,560
 as the absence of pain,

677
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,000
 that we've come to define and think

678
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,280
 that God's blessings are health and having a good family

679
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,080
 and making sure I'm safe and comfortable

680
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,080
 when the first church defined blessing

681
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,720
 as suffering for the name of Jesus.

682
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:32,720
 Father, I pray that, Father, in our hour, in our moment,

683
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,360
 you would fortify your church, Lord.

684
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:40,560
 I pray that you would do prophetically in us right now

685
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,400
 what is needed for the years to come.

686
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:47,000
 I believe that you're returning for a spotless bride.

687
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,240
 And I believe your spirit, like a Pentecost,

688
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:54,160
 is at work right now in powerful, beautiful, amazing ways

689
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,480
 that you are able to do what we cannot do.

690
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,960
 And that ultimately, we know that our own personal strength

691
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,600
 will never be enough.

692
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,080
 And so we say, come Holy Spirit,

693
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,320
 would you fall on us as a church like you did that day

694
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,680
 for the apostles and the disciples?

695
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:14,680
 Would you come and fill us with such power and conviction

696
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,120
 and faith and hope

697
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,600
 that we would never be ashamed of the gospel?

698
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:27,160
 Father, would you release us, Lord, to love our neighbor,

699
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,720
 to stand for you,

700
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:34,520
 and to be your church on its knees in prayer?

701
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:39,840
 Move, Holy Spirit, move.

702
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:45,800
 Come, Lord Jesus, now, as we worship and respond.

703
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,480
 Speak to us.

704
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,060
 (gentle music)
