1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
 Well, it's good to see you all and to be back. I am excited about Christmas

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,200
 I'm excited about introducing Christmas traditions to my baby girl Ellie

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,040
 In Germany, they have a tradition

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,800
 It's a Christmas calendar, but it's not the chocolate calendar

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:24,860
 It's like it's a calendar that has big pockets and every day. There's actually quite a significant gift in there

6
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:28,960
 So so I'm ready, you know, I'm that's my one decoration

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,400
 But

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,400
 But hey, hey, it's good to see you

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:39,520
 Now when I was in university and I feel like I've been talking about university a lot. So it's like far far in the past

10
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,920
 I

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,880
 Did what university students do I studied I played basketball and I hung out with my friends

12
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,720
 Now there was one semester or one season

13
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,560
 Where I really studied a lot

14
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:02,400
 Like all the time and my friends they went on these exciting road trips event of Vancouver

15
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,000
 You know Canada on a road trip

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,080
 Need all sorts of stuff, but I didn't go because I needed a study or I felt like I needed to study

17
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:17,520
 And so I missed out on on all these fun trips. I missed out on hanging out with my friends and when I look back

18
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,520
 at that time I

19
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,480
 Actually think that I chose the wrong thing

20
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,800
 Because I

21
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,520
 Should have spent time with my friends instead of studying now. I know I'm in Hong Kong. I

22
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,960
 am aware there's a lot of you know parents from Hong Kong here and

23
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,360
 I did

24
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,760
 I I do believe studying is important. I did study

25
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:47,360
 You know, I was a good student. So I actually got good grades, but what I'm actually talking about is I studied excessively

26
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,080
 Because there was a fear inside of me somehow that I needed to do more

27
00:01:53,440 --> 00:02:00,840
 You know order to do well and it actually kept me from really enjoying my friendships

28
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,680
 And it kept me from having better relationships my friends

29
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,420
 Now luckily, I didn't do that throughout all University, but I did it for a part of my studies

30
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:19,360
 But isn't that interesting how we can invest ourselves in the things that we think are so important at

31
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,400
 That moment in our lives, you know take all the time we take all the energy

32
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,240
 maybe even a lot of resources and

33
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,240
 Then when we look back at those things

34
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:37,640
 We realized that they really did not matter that much or that they're really not that important

35
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,520
 So

36
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,280
 For me it was

37
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,760
 Studying excessively didn't improve my grades

38
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,440
 Lower the quality of my friendships. I mean that was basically it

39
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:55,680
 For a lot of us, I believe it's you know working excessively

40
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:03,240
 Right. There's this saying I used to put as a screensaver on my phone that says nobody

41
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,880
 ever

42
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,240
 Regrets spending what wait, how does it go?

43
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,280
 Let me get this right

44
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,040
 Nobody

45
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:22,040
 Well, let me just I'm not gonna I'm not gonna remember this basically it's the moral of the story

46
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,240
 How about that the moral of the story is this that?

47
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:31,080
 We add on our when we're at the end of our lives. We never wish that we would have spent more time at the office

48
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,320
 Finally landed there right took me a while, but I brought I made it. Yes

49
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,680
 Got a little confused there in my brain and

50
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,880
 And and the thing is what you know, why do we work so much?

51
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:49,760
 Is it sometimes maybe it's the police someone sometimes it's because we want, you know

52
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,080
 promotion where we're chasing after

53
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,960
 You know better better income for a family and and up to certain degrees that you know that that can be okay

54
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,780
 But there is also like an excessiveness, you know to that a lot of times in us

55
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,960
 Other ways that we might invest ourselves and things

56
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:13,760
 Maybe there's some relationships that are not that important. But for some reason they absorb all our time and our energy and so we give

57
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,680
 People all our time and energy instead of the ones that we should give it to

58
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:24,960
 Now, I don't know what you're you know, investing yourself and what you're spending your time on what you're using your energy for

59
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:33,800
 But what I want to explore with you today is how can we make investments that

60
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,960
 Truly matter, you know, how can we how can we focus on?

61
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,360
 Using our energy our resources our time and put it in the place

62
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:51,200
 That actually is really important so that when we look back we don't have to say. Oh my gosh. What did I do?

63
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,520
 I miss out on all these fun road trips

64
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,040
 You know and we have to be bummed that's quite you know, I can get over that one

65
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,880
 But there's other things, you know where there can be great regrets and we can miss out greatly

66
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,720
 on of course also especially what actually God has for us and

67
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,120
 So we're continuing our sermon series living the kingdom parables

68
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,380
 We've been looking every week at one of the parables of Jesus

69
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:26,920
 Part of it what we're looking to do is to be challenged by them, you know for Jesus to challenge us

70
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,320
 in our attitudes and our thinking and

71
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:38,800
 So that we can respond and align ourselves, you know to his kingdom values and we can shift our perspective

72
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,520
 It can live differently in light of you know

73
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,040
 Jesus teaching and

74
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:48,200
 So I want to encourage us as we go no more into the message to actually to open your heart and say Lord

75
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:53,640
 I want to be challenged by you. I want to hear from you what you have to say to me and

76
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:58,200
 So actually let me pray for us. Let me pray pray over us

77
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,520
 Heavenly Father we

78
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,680
 We are here because we want to hear from you

79
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,160
 We desperately need to hear from you

80
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:16,000
 We want to have you speak into our lives and say yes to what you have for us because what you have is always the best

81
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,640
 So will you prepare our hearts now to receive?

82
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,460
 What you have I praise in your name Jesus. Amen

83
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:32,640
 So we're in the gospel of Luke and I just want to set the context before we go into a specific parable so there is

84
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,760
 The context is it actually says there's a thousands of people

85
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,360
 Around Jesus and

86
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:47,560
 Jesus is teaching his disciples. So it's kind of like he's teaching his disciples and everybody else is listening to him teaching his disciples

87
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,880
 and

88
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,840
 The topic that he's teaching on is actually on obstacles to discipleship

89
00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:00,480
 like things that keep you from following Jesus that can derail your in your journey of being a Christian and

90
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:06,480
 the thing that that Jesus talks right before we get to the text that we're gonna look at is

91
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:11,640
 he talks about fearing God about fearing man and he

92
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:17,160
 Talks about being faithful to him even in persecution

93
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,320
 you know, even when we face persecution that we are faithful to Jesus and

94
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:31,480
 So then he moves to the next obstacle and that's where we're gonna pick up. So we're in Luke chapter 12 starting in verse 13

95
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,160
 It says this

96
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:38,640
 Someone in the crowd said to him teacher tell my brother divide inheritance with me

97
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:44,160
 Jesus replied man who appointed me judge or an arbiter between you

98
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,840
 Then he said to them watch out

99
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,400
 Be on your guard against all kinds of greed

100
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,640
 Life does not consist in abundance of possessions

101
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:01,360
 So we're gonna walk through this piece by piece. So I'm not reading everything to you right now

102
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,880
 But here's a man. Maybe he interrupts Jesus

103
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,520
 Maybe just sees the moment when Jesus quiet for one second

104
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:14,760
 He jumps in and he brings a request to Jesus and he asked Jesus to make a ruling over

105
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,640
 Inheritance, I guess fight or conflict that him and his brother are having

106
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,480
 Now, why does he come to Jesus with that?

107
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,640
 Well, if you know, he addresses Jesus as a teacher

108
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,360
 so

109
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:35,600
 People around Jesus they saw him as a teacher with authority a teacher also of the law a rabbi and

110
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:42,160
 At that time, you know all the rules regarding even inheritance. They were in the Torah. They were in the

111
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,000
 first five books of you know, the Bible of the Hebrew Scripture and

112
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,280
 So a lot of times rabbis and teachers they made actually rulings

113
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:56,240
 You know, they made judgments and then made decisions help the community sort out things

114
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,040
 Might that might be a little bit like a pastor, you know helping

115
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,240
 two conflicting parties settle an issue

116
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,240
 and

117
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,520
 What's interesting though is the man that approaches Jesus if we pay close close attention

118
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,880
 He actually doesn't

119
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,840
 Ask Jesus to mediate

120
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:23,840
 He wants Jesus to do what's on his agenda. He wants him to make a ruling that

121
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:30,840
 Inheritance is divided, you know, so he comes to Jesus. He wants Jesus to fill his plans his purposes

122
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,480
 He is actually not interested in anything else

123
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,200
 he just wants Jesus do what he wants him to do and

124
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,520
 What

125
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,520
 one thing with with that is

126
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,600
 You know

127
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:53,080
 That he's not interested in restoring his relationship with his brother. He just wants to get his he wants to get his inheritance

128
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:59,120
 He wants to get what he thinks is owed to him and there is no room for another perspective. He

129
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:05,000
 He just wants Jesus do what he wants from you and Jesus, you know being wise being discerning

130
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,960
 You know, he decides not to do a ruling not to do a judging but an instead

131
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,160
 He actually turns around and he starts teaching everyone

132
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:20,720
 So not just the man we asked some question not just the disciples, but he's speaking to the whole crowd

133
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,560
 and

134
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,360
 What he what he says to them is

135
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,880
 We find in verse 15

136
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:40,520
 He says watch out be on your guard against all kinds of greed life does not consist in abundance of possessions

137
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,680
 I'll just imagine yourself you bring an issue to Jesus and

138
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:51,000
 Then Jesus uses that as a springboard and starts teaching everyone around you and he kind of implies

139
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,400
 You know that your requests involved some greed

140
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,000
 Make makes us feel a little uncomfortable, right?

141
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,360
 And but but why does Jesus bring it to everyone

142
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:10,440
 Because greed it's a human issue. It's actually something that not just this man needs to hear about

143
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,000
 It's something that everyone needs to hear about because we all to one degree or another

144
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,560
 have heart issues, you know when it comes to possessions and money and

145
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,720
 Inheritance and all those things and so Jesus addresses everyone

146
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,760
 Now it's at this point in time. It's also important to remember when Jesus addresses something like that

147
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,400
 He never does it, you know to shame or to put down

148
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:41,480
 He does it because he wants to bring life. He wants to bring wholeness to an area in our lives that is broken

149
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,560
 And he wants to do something new. He wants to do something better. And

150
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,640
 So we just need to keep that in mind as we walk through the story

151
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:56,840
 So Jesus starts warning us against greed and actually false narratives that we believe

152
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:03,360
 He says in verse 15 life does not consist in abundance of possessions

153
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:10,980
 But we actually believe that it does right we actually believe that life or abundant life

154
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,920
 Exists in abundance of possession

155
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,720
 And so he's starting to dress this the slightest

156
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:23,960
 Narrative that we hold that if I only have this much money if I only have this house or this whatever

157
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,080
 You know, then I will be okay, then I will live the good life

158
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,800
 But Jesus, you know is saying that's not true

159
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,720
 You know abundant life does not consist in these things

160
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,000
 Well, let's continue in the story

161
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,040
 verse 16

162
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:48,520
 And he told him this parable the ground of a certain rich man yielded an abundant harvest

163
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:53,840
 He thought to himself. What shall I do? I have no place to store my crops

164
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,320
 Then he said this is what I will do

165
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:03,160
 I will tear it on my barns and build bigger ones and there I will store my surplus grain

166
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:08,000
 And I'll say to myself you have plenty of grain

167
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,260
 Laid up for many years take life easy eat drink and be married

168
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,880
 now

169
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,640
 In this parable, you know, there's a rich man. We're not told why he's rich

170
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,320
 There's no hint that he did anything unethical

171
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:30,560
 You know, he didn't somehow do some shady dirty deals and screw somebody over

172
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,640
 but we're just told he's wealthy and

173
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,760
 then

174
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,080
 There's another thing that happens. There's an abundant harvest on top of being already rich

175
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:46,800
 His ground, you know from whatever land he owned is yielding just an absolutely incredible

176
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,680
 Harvest much more than expected or would be usual

177
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,800
 So he's already he's rich and now he gets this

178
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,360
 extra stuff on top of it and

179
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:03,720
 This creates a challenge for him, you know, what what is he going to do with it?

180
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:10,120
 And it's interesting because we're actually let in on this inner dialogue in the parable where we can hear his thoughts

181
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,680
 It's kind of scary, right?

182
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,040
 If we could hear each other's thoughts

183
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,740
 But we get to hear his thoughts

184
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,000
 So good. It's that way around out the other way around

185
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:26,000
 and and we get to listen into his own inner inner dialogue and so he is like

186
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,520
 Oh, what am I gonna do? You know with all this extra crop because there's a problem. His barns are full. It's plural

187
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:37,720
 Yes, you know multiple barns. He doesn't have one. He has multiple ones. And so he comes up with solution

188
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:43,560
 I'm gonna tear them down. I'm gonna be bigger once I'm gonna store it up and then he concludes the whole thing was saying

189
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:50,640
 That you know and when that's done he can enjoy his life and leisure and eat drink and be merry

190
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,840
 That's his plan. You know, that's his conversation and

191
00:14:53,840 --> 00:15:02,280
 From from our perspective if we would not know that Jesus beforehand talks about greed if we just would hear the story in a different context

192
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:07,440
 We actually would be quite impressed with this man. Wow, you know, here's somebody who can scale a business

193
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,080
 Here's somebody who can be prudent and and build wealth

194
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:17,000
 if there was a YouTube video or something like wow, you know skies like

195
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:24,000
 He made it from like not having as much and he built his business empire, you know, that's impressive

196
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:31,320
 Now because this is in the context of Jesus teaching and we know what comes before we know there are some issue

197
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:39,800
 But what what what is it, you know, what what is the issue that Jesus is addressing here

198
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:50,160
 Well, if you pay close attention to the inner dialogue, we start getting a hint at what the problem is and it actually reveals to us

199
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,280
 You know some of the values and some of the motivations that this man is holding in his heart

200
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:59,140
 So if you notice there's all these I and my statements

201
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:06,200
 You know, it's all about him it's all about what he has done it's all his

202
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,400
 It's like my crops my abounds my surplus myself

203
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,560
 Actually a word transit here's myself is my soul

204
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,760
 You know, it's all my my my I I I

205
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:24,480
 There is no thought of every anyone else and there is no thought of God

206
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,200
 You know, there's an absence of acknowledgement of God

207
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:36,880
 So this goes in contrast, you know to what Psalm 24 one says says the earth is the Lord's and everything in it

208
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,840
 the world and all who live in it, which means that actually

209
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:47,680
 You know God has created everything and all that we have including our life our breath our health

210
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,000
 Whatever possessions we have everything is a gift from God

211
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,920
 Every single thing now we a lot of times think we did it ourselves

212
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:05,120
 You know, but everything we have is a gift from God and this man, you know, there is no God in his equation

213
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,640
 I mean he thinks it's it's all it's all him

214
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,640
 So and this is where the twist comes into the parable

215
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,880
 verse 20

216
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,840
 But God said to him you fool

217
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:24,680
 This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?

218
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:31,920
 This is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves, but is not rich towards God

219
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:38,160
 So while most of us, you know when you look at

220
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,720
 This story what made me think Wow a prudent successful

221
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,880
 Businessman who knows how to scale a business and accumulate wealth and do something good

222
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,880
 God calls him a fool

223
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:54,920
 You fool. It's quite a different verdict than we would expect, right?

224
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,440
 It's also quite strong language right to be called a fool

225
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:04,920
 So why why does God call this man a fool

226
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:12,440
 Well, God calls this man a fool because all of his investments all of his wealth is directed towards himself

227
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,880
 It's all for himself

228
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,200
 There's no thought of neighbor

229
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,680
 You know there it's it's all about himself

230
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,800
 and

231
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,600
 He just cares about himself. He just invests the money on himself. He doesn't think of anyone else

232
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,760
 There's no acknowledgement of God

233
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,240
 There is

234
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,640
 He actually sees this money as a security

235
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,640
 You know that

236
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,800
 You can see that in his plans, right? He has a plans that like I will live the abundant life

237
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,760
 I'm going to you know, eat drink be merry enjoy my wealth

238
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:59,160
 So he actually placed his faith in his possessions

239
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,840
 But he lacks faith in God

240
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:07,800
 And he thinks that his possessions were given the security of his anxious heart

241
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,840
 That the possessions will make sure that he's gonna be okay

242
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,720
 But when it comes to the end of his life

243
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,640
 they actually don't deliver and

244
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,640
 The lie is exposed

245
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:28,840
 That so many of us that we actually kind of believe right if we're honest

246
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:39,080
 And then in verse 20 we find out that God tells him, you know this very night your life will be demanded of you

247
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:44,520
 and it's actually interesting because a little literal Greek says your soul, you know before he says my soul and

248
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,920
 Then now he says that even our life, you know something that we steward

249
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:57,480
 And it will be demanded of you and then he asked a question and who will get what you have prepared for yourself

250
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,080
 Who's gonna have your stuff

251
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:06,160
 And at this time

252
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,480
 It just shows the emptiness

253
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,640
 the spiritual bankruptcy with which he stands before God, you know because

254
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,400
 That's not his question anymore

255
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,600
 He has different concerns on at this point

256
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,080
 and

257
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:28,080
 Then Jesus concludes by saying, you know gives like a wisdom saying he says is this is how it will be with whoever stores up

258
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,400
 Things for themselves, but is not rich towards God. And so there's a contrast

259
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,240
 there's like storing up things towards yourself versus being rich towards God and

260
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,000
 he's

261
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,080
 He's saying, you know

262
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:45,680
 that's a consequence when we're just all about ourselves when you try to find a security and possessions and wealth when we

263
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,080
 Maybe try to find power significance influence

264
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:53,520
 We know whatever it is for people money means different things for people or possessions mean different things for people

265
00:20:53,520 --> 00:21:00,080
 And whatever is that we're trying to find in that it does not deliver if it's just direct towards herself

266
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,360
 So Jesus then concludes that you know

267
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:09,960
 This man made a disastrous investment and actually kind of ends open-ended because we don't know what he does

268
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,200
 we don't know what he says now suddenly we don't hear his inner dialogue anymore and

269
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:19,040
 Actually is meant for ourselves to think about you know, what's inside of our what's our inner dialogue?

270
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,160
 You know, what are we saying to ourselves?

271
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:28,040
 And so while the man the parable didn't acknowledge God at all

272
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:32,400
 Many of us here we actually do not all of us, but many of us you do

273
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:39,600
 But nonetheless, we're not immune to the chasing after riches and trying to secure a future

274
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,120
 through the accumulation of wealth

275
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,840
 We we also believe that false narrative even as Christians

276
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:52,920
 Right that possessions they're gonna solve our problems. They're gonna give us security so we can finally rest not be anxious

277
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:57,880
 Possessions are gonna give us significance people gonna listen to me. I'm gonna have influence

278
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,600
 Possessions are gonna give us power so I can have an impact, you know, what whatever it is and

279
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:07,760
 And we we believe that and they do to a certain degree

280
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:16,240
 But in the end they never fully deliver and contrary to what Jesus says that life does not consist of abundance of possession

281
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,560
 We think it does

282
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:22,760
 You know, we actually believe that it does if you picture an abundant life what you picture

283
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:30,400
 Exactly right and I have to be honest I picture the same thing

284
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,500
 But what Jesus is trying to bring a corrective, you know to us

285
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:44,560
 So money and possessions that their idols, you know, the idols of a heart and Tim Keller who's a was a well-known pastor in the US

286
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:51,000
 He defines an idol this way an idol is anything more important to you than God

287
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,400
 Anything that absorbs your heart and imagination more than God

288
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,840
 Anything you seek to give you what only God can give

289
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,280
 and

290
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,600
 So in the in the parable, we see that this rich man. He is daydreaming

291
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,560
 You know his imagination is stirred by his possessions and by his wealth

292
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:18,720
 And he dreams of how this will give him security. How does will give him a relaxing retirement?

293
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,880
 And

294
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,400
 But but it reveals, you know that that's his idol

295
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:31,160
 That's what he puts his faith really in and I think with us we've been talking about there's a lot of theoretical in our Christian

296
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,800
 Faith we theoretically, you know believe that

297
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:38,720
 Abundant life isn't God, but if we actually look at our life practice we see a lot of times

298
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,040
 That we actually place our faith and other things

299
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:48,680
 We actually place our faith and you know in our in our jobs or in in our bank account or whatever it is

300
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,140
 Or your house that you own or working towards owning or whatever

301
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:58,080
 And the man that came to Jesus, you know with a request about his inheritance

302
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:05,800
 and he also thought that the inheritance is gonna deliver for him something, you know, whether it's that security again and

303
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:11,880
 We all heard or maybe even experienced personally yourself like just horror stories of inheritance

304
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,880
 You know where there's horrible fighting where relationships fall apart

305
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,820
 We're just brokenness and just destroys and devastates families

306
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:23,400
 And again, it just shows that we hold this idol in the heart

307
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,720
 You know that we think this inheritance is gonna do something and we don't care about the religion

308
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,760
 We just gonna we just want to get ours what we think is ours. It doesn't matter if the relationship is destroyed

309
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,800
 You know and it's devastating

310
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:41,240
 Now what's interesting when when we think about greed or a lot of times you don't think of ourselves

311
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:48,000
 Like I've heard several pastors say nobody ever comes to me and confesses that they're greedy

312
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,720
 You know, they can

313
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,720
 People share all sorts of things

314
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,480
 You know sexual brokenness

315
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,880
 affairs

316
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,640
 You know broken relationships. Well, whatever, you know like

317
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:05,320
 Having cheated someone what whatever it may be

318
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:11,200
 But what this shows is that most of us actually don't think of ourselves as greedy

319
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:19,560
 We don't think it's our issue. We think it's the other person's issue and we can always find someone that we can point to you

320
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,440
 right

321
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,040
 Can always find someone else where you can say? Oh, yeah, it's their issue, but it's not my issue

322
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:30,920
 But here Jesus he's he's exposing these inner dialogues and things in our hearts

323
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,240
 He's actually but actually is all of our issue

324
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,520
 You know and Jesus is calling us

325
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,120
 To bring this issue to him

326
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,640
 So that we can overcome this issue

327
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:54,240
 By the power, you know of Jesus in our lives and that we can live lives that are rich towards God

328
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,240
 not just rich towards ourselves

329
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,720
 now I

330
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,480
 Had a financial

331
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:06,040
 transaction that I was trying to or like a business thing that I was trying to do and

332
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,800
 It fell through in the last moment

333
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,920
 And I was so angry

334
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,560
 I'm a very relaxed person. I know a lot of you don't know me that well

335
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,720
 I'm a very relaxed person. I don't get very angry most of the time and

336
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:26,120
 But I was super angry and then as I suddenly realized my strong emotions, I was like, whoa

337
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,680
 What's going on here? Why am I so upset?

338
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,100
 and

339
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:37,940
 The truth is you know, because I placed hope in this investment that it would do something for me

340
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,520
 That actually only God can do

341
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,640
 you know, I

342
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:50,560
 Was I thought this thing will bring me security. I thought this thing will bring me significance, but it doesn't you know

343
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,560
 That is only found in God

344
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,280
 your significance your security

345
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:03,120
 And so when our faith is and other things besides God it's it's hard to live a life that's rich towards God

346
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,680
 Because we're trying to hold on to our possessions, you know

347
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:11,040
 We can't be generous other people because we think these possessions are significant

348
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,320
 so we should be grab onto them and we can't hold them loosely and

349
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:19,240
 Also keeps us from doing a lot of times the things that Jesus asked us to do

350
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,600
 Which maybe there's a brother or sister. He wants us to be generous to you

351
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,120
 But if we think this thing will secure us we can't let it go

352
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,960
 We can't be generous to that person

353
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,440
 And

354
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:37,760
 Jesus he wants to break the power of this grip of greed in our lives

355
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,640
 He wants us to be free

356
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,280
 Or you were saying what freedom

357
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,680
 So we can be free to love other people

358
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:51,760
 It can be free to reflect a carrot of God of generosity towards others

359
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:57,120
 That doesn't just have to be about ourselves and we don't have to direct, you know

360
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,720
 All this wealth or whatever it is to us and by the way

361
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:05,320
 This can be anyone you can be rich or poor and and we still struggle with the same heart issue

362
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:11,720
 You know, it's not about who has a lot or who doesn't have much we could we all struggle with with greed

363
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,720
 It's a heart issue for all of us

364
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,600
 and

365
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:23,000
 And then Jesus actually we're not going to read further. I'm gonna tell you what happens afterwards. He talks about not being anxious

366
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,200
 Because our loving father cares for us and to seek first his kingdom

367
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,440
 and

368
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,520
 Then all these things will be added unto you

369
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,040
 you know, it's and

370
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:41,000
 Isn't that amazing that actually God promises us that when we are generous when we live a life

371
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:47,240
 That's you know of love and serving our labors and making investments in the kingdom

372
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,960
 Then he will provide for us. He actually will give us what we need

373
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,800
 It doesn't mean that we're you know, he's gonna not give us a yacht or something like that

374
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,640
 But but he will provide for us what we need. He will take care of us

375
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:11,360
 So seeking the kingdom, you know if we make that a priority in our lives it it means that we're willing to do God's will

376
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:16,240
 And it means that we're following Jesus in all aspects of our lives

377
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,720
 but if we're holding idols, you know, they keep us from doing that and

378
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,520
 So Jesus wants to free us

379
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:29,720
 So we can actually fully follow him that we can fully live for him and I just picture as a church wouldn't it be amazing?

380
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,560
 if we all just grow in

381
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,200
 seeking the kingdom and

382
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:43,240
 In obedience to Jesus and living generous lives and growing in generosity. I think it's a process a lot of times

383
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,840
 It's not like what's time it's not just from one moment to next that you completely change

384
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:55,080
 What impact you know, we as a community could have for God's kingdom would be amazing. I want to see that

385
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:59,840
 But but in order to do that we need faith

386
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:04,360
 And we struggle to trust God that he will care for us and he will provide for us

387
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:08,560
 So my sense for this that Jesus wants to give us faith faith

388
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:13,020
 You know that he actually wants to today release faith on us

389
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:18,080
 He wants to give us trust so that we can courage us and live for him that we don't have to live in fear

390
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:23,440
 Because it's like, you know, we live by fear when we're holding on to possessions. We're living in fear

391
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,240
 Because we think these things will deliver

392
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:31,760
 But he's calling us the faith in him, you know that he loves you. He loves us

393
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:37,360
 He loves our heavenly father loves his children, you know, he will provide for us

394
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,880
 I was as I was thinking about as I was reminded of

395
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:46,120
 Being in the US as a child. I couldn't swim and I was a little kid

396
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,680
 We read some friends that lived in apartment complex

397
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:53,400
 He had a swimming pool like, you know that people live there can use and

398
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:57,640
 So I remember like running and jumping in a swimming pool, even I couldn't swim

399
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:01,560
 It's not a good idea, right

400
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,400
 But the reason why I could do it was because my father was there

401
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:09,440
 Because he caught me because I knew I could trust him. I could rely on him

402
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,840
 I could take the step of faith, you know and jump there because he would take care of me

403
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,160
 He would help me get back to the edge of the pool. I even went on the diving board

404
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:23,840
 You know and jumped in but it's just because I knew my father had my back and in a similar

405
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,520
 way when we when we know

406
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:32,040
 Just the father's love when when we know the saving love and care of Jesus in our lives it

407
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,240
 frees us

408
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,640
 to be generous and loving towards others

409
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,520
 You know

410
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:44,920
 We can have that same type of faith where we can just dive in because we know he loves us

411
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,040
 He will take care of us. We can be bold

412
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:55,120
 But if we don't if we don't know his love if you don't believe it if you struggle trust in his heart

413
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:01,880
 So I also believe that today God wants to reveal his love to us

414
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:06,600
 You know that that the reality of his love can break over our lives

415
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:13,440
 That we can start living differently and we can start living generously

416
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:19,000
 Beautifully abundantly and be rich towards God

417
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:23,240
 And seek his kingdom first and make incredible

418
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,240
 investments in this kingdom and

419
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,800
 See God do things that have

420
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:34,440
 Eternal, you know consequences that make an eternal difference

421
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,840
 So, how can I be rich towards God and

422
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:44,080
 Invest how can we be rich for us God invest ourselves in what truly matters?

423
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,120
 One invite the worship team to come up

424
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,240
 How can we take the step of actually living in this radical generosity

425
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:57,560
 That Jesus called us to where we're not just about accumulating things for ourselves

426
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:01,640
 We're not living in fear, but where you can live in faith

427
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,680
 How do we actually do that?

428
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,600
 Well, the first thing is it's not about trying harder

429
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,280
 you know, it's not not about I'm gonna try harder to be more generous and

430
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:17,040
 Give a little and give a little my time give a little my energy give a little bit of my money

431
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,520
 No, it's it's actually acknowledging

432
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:24,120
 It's surrendering to Jesus. It's like I can't do this

433
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:28,320
 And I need you

434
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:35,800
 That's also asking Jesus. I've been holding this this idol in my heart that I think delivers what only you can give

435
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:40,960
 Will you forgive me for this and will instead will you show me?

436
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,720
 You know your love for me

437
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:49,560
 Will you show me that you care for me that you provide for me that you will give me what I need

438
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,200
 and

439
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:58,000
 Then as that that reality breaks over our lives as a spirit of God, you know makes that known to us

440
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,720
 And we can ask them a Lord what how do you want me to be generous this week?

441
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,160
 What do you want me to do?

442
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,160
 You know, how can I show love?

443
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:13,280
 Towards people around me. Maybe how can I show love towards people here in this church community?

444
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:20,760
 How can I show love towards people in my family and in outside, you know the wider you long community?

445
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:27,800
 And then when God reveals to you what to do, you know, take the step of faith you jump into the pool and

446
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:32,560
 And you do it and you trust, you know that he will work through it

447
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,720
 But you also trust that you're not gonna suffer loss because of it

448
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:41,000
 You know, but that you are gonna live life that's rich towards God

449
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:45,520
 So I want to invite everyone to stand and I would love to pray over us

450
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:52,760
 If

451
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,600
 What invites you to?

452
00:34:54,600 --> 00:35:00,880
 Really think about right now. Am I seeking his kingdom first or is there other things I'm seeking after?

453
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:09,680
 Am I seeking his kingdom first or there are other things I'm seeking after

454
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,400
 And

455
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,800
 If you

456
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,640
 Just say Jesus I want to seek your kingdom, you know

457
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:23,640
 But I'm but I'm struggling to trust you that you are truly good that you will truly deliver that you will truly provide. I

458
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:28,120
 Just want to invite you to stretch out your hand, you know as an expression

459
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:33,680
 Of just openness to God and just a desire and a surrender

460
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,640
 To him like I want to seek you. I want to live for you

461
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:42,680
 I don't I want these idols to rule in my heart. I want you Jesus to rule my heart and let me pray over you

462
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:50,240
 Jesus I I thank you so much that you love us so incredibly much

463
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:55,560
 Lord, you know all of our journeys, you know every single heart in this room

464
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,320
 You know the things that we hold dear

465
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:04,280
 That we think will you know provide for us deliver things for us give us security

466
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:09,680
 But it's pray that everything is a lie that you expose that right now

467
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:18,040
 That you help us instead to turn our hearts to you now place our faith and our trust in you I

468
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:26,080
 Asked Holy Spirit that you will come right now and you reveal your love to us

469
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:32,240
 The love of the father who doesn't abandon his children who doesn't give bad gifts. He gives good gifts

470
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:38,320
 That's a father that and will add these things unto you when you live that radical life of generosity

471
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:43,960
 And radical life of faith of following him of doing the things Jesus calls us to do

472
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:50,200
 Or will you pour out just this faith and discourage in our hearts

473
00:36:50,200 --> 00:37:00,440
 We forgive us for you know for greed where we failed you but will you help us by your spirit to live differently

474
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:07,240
 Will you strengthen us by your grace will you help us to be people of faith not people of fear

475
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:11,560
 We know that is your spirits work. It's not we can't

476
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:17,880
 Do this out of our own strength Lord's will you come right now? We help us to be seekers of your kingdom

477
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:22,720
 As a community I pray all this in your name Jesus. Amen

478
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,920
 Let's worship
