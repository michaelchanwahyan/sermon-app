1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
 Well, thanks for the invitation that I got a chance to share something which I'm really,

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,560
 really passionate about, and that is work.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,960
 I love to work.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,280
 Sorry, it's a Sunday.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,720
 Well, this is July.

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:25,200
 July is always something memorable and significant for us in the medical field.

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:33,400
 And nowadays, most of the medical practitioners will start their lifelong career on July 1st.

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:40,960
 And I'm actually one of those starting on exactly 1st of July, 37 years ago.

9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:49,120
 Well, I was so excited and passionate about getting to start to save lives.

10
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:57,440
 Well, likewise, even fellow classmates who may or may not have a faith affiliation, but

11
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:04,080
 they also have that sense that there is a calling into an unknown world where we can

12
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:13,160
 grow in our profession, serve the community, and find our purposeful fulfillment in life.

13
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:19,960
 In a similar vein, I hope and pray that most of us would revisit our first entry into our

14
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:28,080
 work life, the passion, the sweet memories, and that should excite you.

15
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:34,160
 But somehow, July also continued to be some of my defining moments.

16
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:41,240
 Ten years into my career life, I felt really stuck and began to wonder how the rest of

17
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,520
 my professional life would evolve.

18
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,520
 We made a bold decision.

19
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:52,440
 We decided to emigrate to a foreign land to find a venue to fully develop my professional

20
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,800
 life and skills.

21
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:00,880
 I'm most grateful to the opportunities that opened up, and I propelled, I was propelled

22
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:08,680
 to a higher level than I ever aspired or even dreamed.

23
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:16,280
 Then July 2003, we finally came out of SARS.

24
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:22,280
 During those preceding months, I was quarantined for two separate occasions.

25
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,040
 We lost dear colleagues and patients.

26
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:33,480
 So in those stretch of quarantine, it was also a time for me to reflect upon the very

27
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:42,840
 notion of success or transforming from success to significance.

28
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,200
 So success in your career life, success in the marketplace is one thing, but in all of

29
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:57,360
 us, there should be a deeper yearning, calling into something even greater.

30
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,440
 So that means for me, that period, I revisited to look at my own calling and how I can best

31
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:10,240
 serve, not only making a difference in the marketplace, in my professional sphere, but

32
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:17,160
 also making a greater impact to be fruitful for Christ.

33
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:25,720
 And I realized that I had a strong desire to partner with God to advance his kingdom.

34
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:35,040
 Now today we shall refer to the passage in Acts 16, recalling Paul's second mission trip

35
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,320
 and how he crossed paths with three individuals where their lives were impacted.

36
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:50,520
 They are Lydia and then a demon-possessed girl and a prison guard in Philippi.

37
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:58,280
 We shall try to approach from their perspectives of how new life in Christ would mean for them.

38
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:08,200
 It might not be July 2000 years ago, but definitely there was their season of transformation.

39
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:17,240
 It started with Paul's vision of seeing a man crying for help from Macedonia, prompting

40
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:21,560
 the sail across Asia to Europe.

41
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:28,760
 That mission to Philippi became the first major city in Europe to ever hear of God's

42
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,720
 good news.

43
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,360
 Luke tells the exciting story of the birth of the church in Philippi by giving account

44
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,940
 to three incidents involving people who come into contact with the gospel.

45
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,000
 The first one was by the name of Lydia.

46
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:55,280
 She was a prominent and wealthy gentile businesswoman who was already a convert to the Jewish faith,

47
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:01,360
 and they were gathering in the riverbank as a small congregation.

48
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:09,560
 The second was a low-status slave girl who was being exploited for her spirit-inspired

49
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,320
 fortune-telling abilities.

50
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:19,620
 Luke never really tells us whether she puts her faith in Christ, but the account of Paul's

51
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:27,800
 encounter with her demonstrates the very power of Jesus over the realm of the demonic and

52
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,360
 the oppression.

53
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:36,560
 But that the spirit was driven out of this slave girl also means that the girl's owner,

54
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,340
 their business, was ruined.

55
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,120
 The story was well known.

56
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,360
 Peter and Silas were beaten and imprisoned.

57
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:52,280
 But then there was an earthquake in the middle of the night as the two of them were praying

58
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,240
 and singing hymns in the dark dungeon.

59
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,680
 The chains broke loose.

60
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,160
 The jailer, worried that the prisoners might have escaped, was actually about to commit

61
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,400
 suicide.

62
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:13,800
 Yet the two missionaries intervened and the prison guard was in fact converted, finding

63
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,400
 great joy in knowing the Savior.

64
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,080
 Why should I choose to share from these three individuals?

65
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,120
 In fact, the very title for today is "Faith at Work."

66
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:34,680
 Our faith in Jesus should be experienced and expressed in our work and workplace, even

67
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,160
 though it is a work in progress.

68
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,200
 Their stories should find and put on real faces of people that form a congregation,

69
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,440
 a community of believers.

70
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:52,440
 They are ordinary people from the various sectors of the work population in the real

71
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,900
 world of the society in their times.

72
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:01,840
 As much as anyone of you in this congregation who is essentially from the marketplace and

73
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,040
 part of the society.

74
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:11,960
 So bear with me, I'm actually only guessing as best as I can about what really happened

75
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,760
 thereafter for them.

76
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:19,000
 But I love the story of Lydia because she is a businesswoman.

77
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,480
 And in a sense, while I'm also a professional, but I also carry a business whereby we run

78
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:30,880
 a small company doing professional services related business.

79
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,680
 I'm really excited about learning from Lydia through some imaginations.

80
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,480
 Acts 16 here says, "While we sat down," that means Paul, Silas, and the team, "sat down

81
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,320
 and began to speak to the women who had gathered there.

82
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:52,440
 One of those listening was a woman from the city of Tyre-Tetra named Lydia, a dealer in

83
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,240
 purple cloth.

84
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,040
 She was a worshiper of God.

85
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,200
 The Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul's message.

86
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:08,800
 When she and the members of her household were baptized, she invited us to her home.

87
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,240
 If you consider me a believer in the Lord, come and stay at my house."

88
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,120
 And she persuaded us.

89
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,960
 In those days, it is not uncommon to find a woman undertaking business in Macedonia

90
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,320
 or in Asia Minor.

91
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:30,280
 Women had began taking up their significant business and civil roles in those societies.

92
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:37,600
 And evidently, Lydia had moved to Philippi and set up a business of selling dyed fabrics

93
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,920
 to Romans in the colony.

94
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:46,840
 While she is in that sense in fashion industry, she is a merchandiser and she is doing a trader's

95
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,920
 job.

96
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:55,640
 Her business was apparently doing fairly well if she owned a house large enough to accommodate

97
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:01,840
 Paul and his team, in addition to all the members of her household.

98
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:07,080
 In the subsequent letter to the Philippians, written years down the road while Paul was

99
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:14,840
 himself imprisoned on another occasion, he was most encouraged to receive the generous

100
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:19,760
 gifts from the Philippians church to support him in the prison.

101
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:27,680
 "You, the Philippian church, sent me aid more than once when I was in need.

102
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,000
 Not that I desire your gifts.

103
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,600
 What I desire is that more can be credited to your account.

104
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,160
 I have received full payment of more than enough.

105
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,360
 I am amply supplied.

106
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:49,320
 Now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent, they are a fragrant offering,

107
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,400
 an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God."

108
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:59,760
 Which means whatever the Philippian church is giving, it is a fragrant offering ultimately

109
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,320
 unto God.

110
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,620
 Whatever we give, it will be pleasant and pleasing to God.

111
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:12,520
 Of course it is not recorded exactly whether Lydia was part of that generous community,

112
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:18,280
 but we may assume that the businesswoman would have contributed.

113
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:25,520
 I am truly convicted that while businesswoman or businessman or anyone else in this congregation

114
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:33,600
 should give faithfully to the Lord, I myself have the joy of testifying his faithfulness

115
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,160
 in good times and in bad times in the economic sense.

116
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:45,360
 Well indeed even in our own industry, we also face many ups and downs and we often have

117
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:53,200
 to make painful and difficult business decisions, just like anyone of you in the marketplace

118
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,780
 will need to do day in and day out.

119
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:03,120
 But in the midst of all this, our faith in him is refined.

120
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,920
 More importantly, the poem is about we can all give of ourselves in the very marketplace

121
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,920
 situation we are put into.

122
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:19,720
 We can all transit from a place of gaining to a place of giving.

123
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:27,520
 Paul was encouraged not only by the presence from the Philippian church, but also the very

124
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:36,200
 presence of this friend, the messenger, a co-worker sent from Philippi.

125
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:45,420
 From gaining to giving, Epaphroditus was a messenger sent for Philippi to Paul.

126
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:55,560
 We are messengers sent by God and you are the very messenger sent to your workplace

127
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:06,000
 to encourage someone, whether you are a boss, a leader, a colleague, or an underling.

128
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:13,800
 From good to great, we talked about faithful giving, generosity, and being a messenger

129
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,800
 of Christ.

130
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,040
 These are all good things.

131
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:25,320
 Lydia was generous in hosting Paul and the team and brought the gospel into her household.

132
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,160
 But did she move from good to great?

133
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,800
 Well, that is a hypothetical question.

134
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:40,040
 We know that her industry was lucrative, where precious raw materials were extracted from

135
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,480
 the seashells to purple dyes.

136
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:50,880
 Her work transforms garments into royal class fashion.

137
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:57,520
 Can many of us in the business world today, in partnership with Jesus, transform the world

138
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,720
 around us?

139
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:05,640
 Can business, or more broadly speaking, the workplace, be a mission field?

140
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,960
 And how does that look like?

141
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:16,480
 According to Paul Stevens, an important figure in promoting marketplace ministry, there are

142
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,080
 a spectrum of possibilities.

143
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:25,880
 Business can be an arena for individual weaknesses.

144
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:31,840
 Business can also be a means of church planting, a means of society's service, of community

145
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:40,200
 building, or we can even negotiate and wrestle with the powers or the government.

146
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,400
 How to witness and do a church plant?

147
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:47,360
 Well, let me share how I dare to believe business owner has been doing.

148
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:53,760
 So my friend is running an oncology cancer clinic, but he wants to provide chaplaincy

149
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,640
 care to his patients while they are receiving chemotherapy.

150
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:06,840
 So he funded his own official space for pastoral care and engaged pastoral staff to provide

151
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:15,400
 the much needed comfort during the very tough times that the patients are receiving chemotherapy.

152
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:24,360
 Jesus is right there in the midst of his business, and the small community of people, patients,

153
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:33,560
 nurses, pastors, doctors, come to form a small church congregation in his clinic.

154
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,680
 How about serving the society?

155
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:43,260
 Another friend runs a beauty and well-being business, but they find that their technology

156
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:49,400
 is also useful to augment the behaviour of autistic kids.

157
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:56,680
 So his company, in partnership with NGOs, provide care for children with such needs

158
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,920
 and become a blessing for many.

159
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:09,480
 Then another schoolmate, he is in the building industry, but he insisted on fair and uncorrupted

160
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:16,360
 practices despite all the challenges and common practices.

161
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:24,520
 So while they bid for major metropolitan projects, his company is well recognised even by the

162
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:34,240
 various government officials that they are upright in their project bidding.

163
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:40,820
 So the point is whether we dare to believe that there are many and numerous opportunities

164
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:47,960
 and possibilities, but these would open up only if we as individual believers in the

165
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:56,960
 marketplace truly embrace the call from Jesus to serve in the marketplace, to make a real

166
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,300
 difference.

167
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:07,660
 We are all called to be ministers in the marketplace.

168
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:15,320
 In case you do not receive this well, I want to speak this over you all over again.

169
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:26,620
 We are all called to be ministers in the very marketplace that God has sent you.

170
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,620
 So shepherd your flock well.

171
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:36,940
 While I did not think of business opportunities or kingdom opportunities so much last time,

172
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:46,180
 rather I would just stick with the flow and the commonest pathway that would be predominant

173
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:49,260
 in our peers would be, well, something like this.

174
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:55,700
 In your early twenties, you work hard, you try to get ahead, you put in long hours, put

175
00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:03,460
 on extra work, try to work faster and smarter in order to beat the competition.

176
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:08,380
 Then towards your thirties, you may expect that you reap the rewards of your hard work,

177
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:13,860
 you get promoted, you receive better pay and better status.

178
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:21,860
 But then as I closed on to my forties and then fifties, I felt my own battle fatigue.

179
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:28,700
 I began to realise, well, I couldn't and I wouldn't want to live this way forever.

180
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:33,540
 If life turned out perfectly, what should it look like?

181
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,540
 What elements would that include?

182
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:41,140
 What would I be doing in five years or in ten years?

183
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,460
 How about you?

184
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:49,700
 How would you describe your idea of calling and destiny?

185
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:55,620
 How would you finally arrive at the point where you can say, "I am doing what I have

186
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:59,340
 always dreamed of doing.

187
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:05,660
 I'm finally doing what I've always dreamed of doing."

188
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:13,000
 So I want to share this understanding or concept of significance, which I define as being fruitful

189
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 in Christ.

190
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:20,620
 Well, it actually begins by stopping wherever we are in this journey to see what's really

191
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,380
 key in our life.

192
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,540
 And then we reorder everything around it.

193
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,620
 So imagine you have this treasure box.

194
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:35,260
 So let's see what you put into your treasure box.

195
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:42,140
 And when you are stripped of everything else, what remains in your treasure box?

196
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:50,920
 So I can probably safely say, "Well, money is not the most important thing in my treasure

197
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,920
 box."

198
00:18:51,920 --> 00:19:02,780
 Well, I gained a fair amount of wisdom through the years of hard work and leadership and

199
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:12,580
 teaching, but probably that may not be the one and most important thing in my life.

200
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:20,460
 So I gather that I have a key, the one and only thing that I will say while stripped

201
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:28,500
 of everything else, that I still want to be in the box.

202
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:37,020
 And I dare to share that that one thing, if I may put, is God.

203
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,020
 God in the box.

204
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:44,460
 Well, not that we can put God in the box, but we choose God to be the one and only when

205
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:50,540
 we are stripped of everything else.

206
00:19:50,540 --> 00:20:00,340
 What is that ultimate one and only thing that you most treasure in your treasure box?

207
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:10,940
 As fellow believers, while we put God in the box, it also means reordering everything.

208
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:16,780
 And that decision of putting God in your box leads you there after.

209
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:23,300
 Now, it is unfortunate that most people think, "Well, successful Christians in business

210
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:28,420
 are just rich people who give a lot of money to the church, and they don't do anything

211
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,420
 else."

212
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:35,620
 And whereas for ordinary workers, we are just too tight regularly.

213
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:45,180
 Significance, fruitfulness in Christ would be there for us when we, business people or

214
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:54,060
 otherwise, find a way to give of ourselves to God, if God is indeed in the box.

215
00:20:54,060 --> 00:21:01,740
 But this may or may not need a change of your job or otherwise, but it always requires a

216
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:11,180
 change of attitude, a transformed heart, a yearning to bear fruits for Christ.

217
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:18,460
 Well, generally, I actually do not believe that God creates us with such talents, abilities,

218
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:24,820
 or unique temperaments, or maybe unique business connections, but then asks us to do things

219
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:30,500
 entirely different, using different skill sets, different connections.

220
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:39,980
 But rather, many a times, moving towards significance does not need a 180 degree course change.

221
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:47,260
 Instead, we may do some retrofitting to find how we can best apply our gifts to allow us

222
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:54,780
 to spend more time on things related to what's in our box, and do it in such a way to reclaim

223
00:21:54,780 --> 00:22:01,580
 that very thrill the first business transaction brought us.

224
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,940
 God has a wonderful plan for our life.

225
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:11,020
 We can serve him by doing what we may like to do and we are good at.

226
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:15,660
 For my instance, I love to teach, even in my very young days.

227
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:21,420
 So I got to teach even younger kids when I was in Sunday schools.

228
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:27,260
 Then I got to teach medical students and post-graduate residents.

229
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:35,620
 And now, I've got the privilege and opportunity to teach or share work with you.

230
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:43,740
 I also got the privilege to teach in Tree of Life discipleship courses, including calling

231
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:48,980
 and phase of work courses, which I really was passionate about.

232
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:55,140
 And of course, the forthcoming marriage enrichment.

233
00:22:55,140 --> 00:23:01,460
 I'm now excited, or even more excited, to share work than my delivering a lecture in

234
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:05,020
 a conference hall during academic meetings.

235
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:16,700
 I'm hoping I'm transiting from good to great, from success to significance, from gaining

236
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,700
 to giving.

237
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:28,820
 That was what I told Andrew when we shared nine years ago about signing up to serve as

238
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:32,780
 an elder in the Eldership Board.

239
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:39,780
 And I hope that we, fellow elders, have served you well all these years.

240
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:46,980
 Your finding your significance could run a very different path, but be open-minded and

241
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:50,620
 keep your entrepreneurial spirit.

242
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:53,340
 Be bold and adventurous.

243
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:59,720
 The God who gave you much success in your business or your workplace would lead you

244
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:07,980
 into even better next stage of life, to fully realise God's given talents, to advance His

245
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,540
 kingdom and to make a real difference.

246
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:14,900
 Dare to believe.

247
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:19,940
 And you may say, "Well, I'm no businessman or businesswoman."

248
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:25,900
 In fact, you may even be saying, "I'm at the lowest end, in the bottom, in the combined

249
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,140
 chain of my employment or company.

250
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,620
 What else can I do?"

251
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:36,760
 Well, let's revisit the story of the slave girl as recorded.

252
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:43,320
 The Greek implies that she is very young and has literally a spirit of the serpent.

253
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:49,660
 It is the spirit that predicts the future.

254
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:56,260
 Paul became so annoyed that he turned around and said to the spirit, "In the name of Jesus

255
00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:01,200
 Christ, I command you to come out of her."

256
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,080
 At that moment, the spirit left her.

257
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:10,180
 But her owners realised that their hope of making money was gone.

258
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:18,140
 They seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to face the authorities.

259
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,820
 Marketplace.

260
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:26,340
 This poor girl was doubly exploited by the spirit and by those who owned her.

261
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:33,420
 But she was set free as now Jesus holds her future.

262
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:38,020
 You could feel that you are scrutinised by your boss.

263
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,700
 You are bullied by your colleagues.

264
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:44,960
 And you are frustrated by your underperforming underling.

265
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:50,400
 Or you may just have that sense of being oppressed in the workplace.

266
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,380
 But Christ has set you free.

267
00:25:54,380 --> 00:26:03,820
 Well, I have my honest confession that I myself is in my career low lately.

268
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:07,820
 I felt very oppressed myself.

269
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:16,060
 But I am learning from Paul and Silas how they chose to pray and sing at their low points

270
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:24,500
 in the dark dungeon, the prison cell, where God responded by shaking the earth and all

271
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,260
 the chains came loose.

272
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:37,660
 Praying and singing are the natural responses of that trust in God who holds our future.

273
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:46,940
 And for all you know, many others are listening just as other prisoners are listening to Paul

274
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:52,220
 and Silas as they prayed and sang.

275
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:56,380
 So dare to believe.

276
00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:05,900
 The spirit of deceit falsified that our future is held by someone else other than Jesus.

277
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:11,380
 May the spirit of falsehood be cast out from you today.

278
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,940
 Christ has set us free.

279
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:17,600
 And we are free indeed.

280
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,820
 On the other hand, well you may wonder, now that you are set free, you would devote yourself

281
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,860
 to follow Jesus.

282
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:29,380
 And in the literal sense, and you even consider quitting your job to enter into Christian

283
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,380
 ministry.

284
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:34,180
 Wow, what noble thoughts.

285
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,900
 You need prayerful deliberation.

286
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:44,780
 I do want to refer to Jesus' advice, the once demon-possessed young man.

287
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:52,220
 In Mark 5, as Jesus was getting back into the boat, the man who was once demon-possessed

288
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,420
 begged to go with him.

289
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,900
 But Jesus did not let him.

290
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:00,460
 He said, "Go home to your own people.

291
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:05,200
 Tell them how much the Lord has done for you.

292
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:11,320
 How much the Lord has done for you and how he has mercy on you."

293
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:19,060
 So this man went away and began to tell the people in the ten cities how much Jesus has

294
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,560
 done for him.

295
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:24,320
 And all the people were amazed.

296
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,540
 How much Jesus has done for you.

297
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:33,940
 I would not be able to offer you a simple solution if you are struggling in your workplace,

298
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:39,500
 especially regarding decisions to stay put or to venture out.

299
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:44,420
 I myself made numerous transitions to depart.

300
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:52,620
 But I'm glad to share that I saw God's hands in each of those career moves and I emerged

301
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:57,620
 stronger in each of those transitions.

302
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:03,860
 But I also strongly believe that regardless of the tremendous demand in our workplace,

303
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:10,140
 there must be purposes that God placed us in those situations in the first place.

304
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:19,100
 He has set us free so that we are liberated to work with new strength and a grateful heart.

305
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:25,020
 You might be doing the most mundane thing in the world, but what you are doing could

306
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:28,140
 make a difference.

307
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,140
 Let me share my story.

308
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:34,620
 I need to be admitted on a regular basis to one of the university hospitals to receive

309
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:37,340
 my chemotherapy.

310
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:45,820
 I confess that sometimes I will be very frustrated or even angry because it is typically the

311
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:53,340
 most junior medical staff, usually the fresh interns, who perform the routines in the ward

312
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,860
 that I will be staying.

313
00:29:55,860 --> 00:30:03,740
 So they will make numerous attempts to put in the cannula into my vein and if they finally

314
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:10,460
 did it, I'm truly blessed.

315
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,220
 They were doing good for me.

316
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:18,420
 My chemotherapy could start and my disease will be brought under control.

317
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:26,980
 Their mundane, often unappreciated work, and sometimes not even valued by themselves, made

318
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:33,820
 a literal lifelong impact on my life.

319
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:45,300
 We are all doing something that may help someone another one's day savor easier or just more

320
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,300
 pleasant.

321
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:53,300
 Don't despise the small things that you are doing every day.

322
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:57,940
 And now let's come to the last character for the day, the prison guard.

323
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:03,780
 This jailer in the story could be a director or a manager as he can command a few other

324
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,420
 colleagues.

325
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:15,100
 The interesting paradox here is that the prisoners, Paul and Silas, set this supposedly free prison

326
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:20,340
 guard in the secular sense, really free in the spiritual sense.

327
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:27,740
 Acts 16, the jailer called for the lights, rushed in and felt trembling before Paul and

328
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,940
 Silas.

329
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:34,780
 He then brought them out and asked, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"

330
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:42,340
 They replied, "Believe in Lord Jesus and you will be saved, you and your household."

331
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:47,180
 Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and all the others in the house.

332
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:52,740
 At that hour of the night, the jailer took them and washed their wounds.

333
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:56,940
 Then immediately he and his household were baptized.

334
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:01,780
 The jailer brought them into his house and set a meal before them.

335
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:09,780
 He was filled with joy because he had come to believe in God, he and his whole household.

336
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:15,420
 This prison guard in the story probably has more common grounds with the congregation.

337
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:21,940
 He is an employee, he has a job title, he has certain skill sets, he has a few underlings

338
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:27,500
 or colleagues, but he also has his boss, the magistrate, to report to.

339
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:34,340
 Now how should he express his newfound faith in this rather unpleasant workplace, dealing

340
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:42,700
 with people who are not the most likable, while trapped in the middle as mid-level management?

341
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:45,980
 How should his faith work out?

342
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:46,980
 Follow the books?

343
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,980
 Well, he didn't.

344
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:53,260
 He didn't just follow the book and lock up the prisoners all over again as per the duty

345
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,780
 manual or job description.

346
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:59,580
 Instead, he did the extra mile.

347
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,660
 He washed their wounds.

348
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:07,780
 He also brought them into his house, set a meal before them, but most of all, he was

349
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:11,020
 filled with joy.

350
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:15,340
 Recall how Paul advised the congregation in his letter to the Philippians.

351
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:25,380
 "For it is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfil His good purpose.

352
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:32,260
 Do everything without grumbling or arguing, so that you may become blameless and pure,

353
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:38,020
 children of God without fault in a white and crooked generation.

354
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:43,380
 Then you will shine among them like stars in the sky."

355
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:50,220
 Indeed we sometimes find our workplace white and crooked, yet we can shine like morning

356
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:54,180
 stars in the sky.

357
00:33:54,180 --> 00:34:02,020
 The jailer found great joy as he came to know Jesus in the workplace, as he continued to

358
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:07,380
 usher in Jesus' presence in his workplace.

359
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:16,620
 Likewise, Henry Nolan found his greatest joy, his inner renewal and his self-discovery as

360
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:26,580
 he served his severely disabled patient by the name of Adam through routine, long and

361
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:33,900
 tiresome days in Daybreak Community Centre in Toronto.

362
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:43,220
 And that joy was much more than he experienced in his lifetime as an academic professor.

363
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:55,100
 Somehow now he sees Jesus embodied in Adam, and he is serving Jesus.

364
00:34:55,100 --> 00:35:03,380
 "Dare to believe that you may find your rightful joy in your most challenging workplace, be

365
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:08,260
 it lowly or highly regarded in the secular sense.

366
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:15,700
 Jesus will call you good and faithful servant, if indeed you are good and faithful."

367
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:24,780
 Dear fellow brothers and sisters, I wonder whether July bears any particular significance

368
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,780
 for you.

369
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:32,500
 It's the mid-year turn, you have the remaining half the year to fulfil whatever you have

370
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:36,340
 set forth to fulfil for 2024.

371
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:41,700
 But even more importantly, whatever you have set forth as your calling and destiny you

372
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:45,260
 have yet to fulfil.

373
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:50,020
 Season of the year changes, like seasons of our life.

374
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:59,060
 Just continue to ponder upon how you want to move from good to great, from giving, from

375
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:05,220
 gaining to giving, and from success to significance.

376
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,480
 Let your life speak.

377
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:13,580
 You may be a high profile businessman, a leader, a CEO.

378
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:20,260
 Or you may feel more like a lowly employee receiving only crumbles.

379
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:26,260
 Or you're like many others, caught in the middle, having lots to manage but not a great

380
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,620
 pay or respect.

381
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:35,580
 Whatever you are, Paul's encouragement remains, "Let your life speak."

382
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:41,820
 Do everything readily and cheerfully, no bickering, no second-guessing allowed.

383
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,660
 Go out into the world uncorrupted.

384
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:50,340
 Be a breath of fresh air in this polluted society.

385
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:55,900
 Provide people with a glimpse of good living and of the living God.

386
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:01,020
 Every delight giving message into the night.

387
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,300
 Can I invite all of us to stand?

388
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:07,420
 The worship team will come up.

389
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:14,300
 And also invite the prayer team and fellow elders who are in the midst to come forth.

390
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:17,900
 I want to invite all of us to respond.

391
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:23,420
 By coming forward to receive a prayer, we want to pray with you.

392
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:27,020
 I want to speak to three groups of people.

393
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:33,500
 Business people, men and women, leaders in your industry.

394
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:43,460
 I would like to invite you to come forth so that we can pray with you to honour your calling

395
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:47,940
 to become a minister for Christ in the workplace.

396
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:53,580
 Be that shepherd of your flock.

397
00:37:53,580 --> 00:38:00,820
 For some of us who feel oppressed in the workplace, come forth, we want to pray with you that

398
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:04,780
 you're indeed set free.

399
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:14,180
 And for all of us here, that our yearning to shine for Christ will be stirred.

400
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:23,740
 That we commit ourselves to be fruitful for Christ so that we may move from success to

401
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,740
 significance.

402
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:29,860
 Come, prayer team, elders, yeah, please ready yourself.

403
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:34,900
 And we'd like to invite all of us while we begin to sing and worship, they come forth,

404
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,660
 then we can spend time praying with you.

405
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:40,240
 (gentle music)
