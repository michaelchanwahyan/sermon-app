1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,160
 Have a seat, have a seat.

2
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,120
 It's so good to be with you.

3
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,120
 My name's Andrew, I'm one of the pastors here.

4
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,880
 If you're new to the Vine, if you're new online, welcome.

5
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,520
 We're so glad that you found the YouTube link

6
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,120
 somewhere, somehow, and that you're with us.

7
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,480
 If you're here in this room, I'm so glad that you found

8
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,880
 29 Burroughs Street, somehow, somewhere, you're here.

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,720
 If you meant to go to the Baptist Church next door,

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,200
 we love the fact that you're here as well.

11
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,120
 Welcome.

12
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,440
 As we continue our series in Psalm 23,

13
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,120
 we do so today by looking at perhaps

14
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,120
 the single most famous verse of that Psalm.

15
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,760
 The most famous Psalm that we have in all of our scriptures,

16
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,840
 this is the most famous verse of that Psalm.

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,280
 You would have heard this verse spoken many times before,

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,320
 perhaps read it, seen it in movies.

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,400
 Let me read it to us once more.

20
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,520
 It says this, "Even though I walk through the valley

21
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,360
 "of the shadow of death."

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,080
 I'll say that again for us.

23
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,880
 "Even though I walk through the valley

24
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:05,880
 "of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil,

25
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,240
 "for you are with me.

26
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,920
 "Your rod and your staff, they comfort me."

27
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,760
 I've been saying throughout this series

28
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,540
 what an incredible poet David is.

29
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,040
 In fact, this whole Psalm is a beautiful,

30
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,260
 structured, ancient Near Eastern poem.

31
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,880
 And we've seen in the last few weeks

32
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,520
 the kind of poetry that he's brought to us,

33
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,000
 the imagery he's brought to us, it's been amazing.

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,520
 It's been talking about God being a shepherd,

35
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,320
 kind of trying to align our ideas

36
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,000
 to the fact that God is not this angry schoolmaster

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,240
 or God's not some ethereal thing up in the clouds somewhere,

38
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,680
 but he's like a shepherd present in our lives.

39
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,680
 He told us already that because he's our shepherd,

40
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,800
 we lack no good thing.

41
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,920
 There's nothing in our lives that we lack.

42
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,080
 He is abundant in his blessing to us.

43
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,440
 And he's described what some of those blessings look like.

44
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,860
 He's told us about green pastures,

45
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,600
 that God will lead us to places that will be abundant

46
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,120
 for our strength and for our life.

47
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,120
 He's told us about quiet waters,

48
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,960
 that God will take us to places that will chill us out,

49
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,800
 restore us, give us what we need to survive in life.

50
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,080
 He's talked about paths of righteousness,

51
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,200
 that God will lead us into places

52
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,400
 where we'll come to understand his righteousness

53
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,440
 in our lives, that we would know we're also righteous,

54
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,380
 not in our own strength, but in him.

55
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,200
 I mean, all that David has done so far in this Psalm

56
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,320
 has shown us everything that we can say amen to,

57
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,580
 the kind of life we want to live.

58
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,860
 I don't know about you, but I want green pastures.

59
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,220
 I want quiet waters.

60
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,340
 I want my soul restored.

61
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,660
 I wanna lean into the blessings and the goodness of God.

62
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,980
 And then he gets to verse four,

63
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,060
 and David does a U-turn on us.

64
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:45,340
 He suddenly goes, "Oh, and by the way,

65
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,900
 if God's gonna lead you, guess where he'll also lead you?

66
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,460
 To valleys that are like shadows of death over you."

67
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:57,140
 And when you're reading this Psalm

68
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,500
 and you're tracking along with the poetic nature of it,

69
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,100
 you're all like, you're on a high

70
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,340
 thinking how amazing God is with green pastures.

71
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,100
 And then David sort of takes the rug

72
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,300
 and pulls it out from under us.

73
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,740
 And he says, "You wanna know what life is also like?

74
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:12,420
 Oh, we all want to lie down in green pastures.

75
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,580
 We all want that lovely quiet water.

76
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,820
 We all want the bonus at the end of the year

77
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,340
 that we've worked really hard on.

78
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,880
 We all want the relationship that we're in to work out.

79
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,320
 We all want to find that perfect spouse for us

80
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,160
 for the rest of our lives, whatever it might be.

81
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,520
 We want the green pastures."

82
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,440
 But David is telling us

83
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,640
 that there's another kind of season of life.

84
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,680
 That if you think as a Christian,

85
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,440
 your whole life is gonna be dedicated to only green pastures

86
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,080
 then you need to wake up.

87
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,400
 In fact, he's using the poetic structure here

88
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,520
 to wake the reader up,

89
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,080
 to kind of subvert the feeling that he had placed in them.

90
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,200
 And he's saying this, "Guys, you need to understand.

91
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,420
 Yes, there will be times of greatness,

92
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,760
 times of blessing, times of abundance,

93
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,540
 but there's also gonna be times of struggle

94
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,240
 and hardship and pain,

95
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,420
 times where it's gonna feel like you're in the shadow

96
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,340
 of the valley of death."

97
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,300
 David's saying, "You gotta understand the seasons

98
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,540
 that you're in in life."

99
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,720
 And we've just come through the last three years

100
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,560
 here in Hong Kong.

101
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,700
 We're like, we know that season, right?

102
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,860
 Like every single one of us in this room,

103
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,020
 we know what it is to suffer.

104
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,100
 We know pain, we know hardship.

105
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,820
 We know what it was to go through the process,

106
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,180
 the time to go through COVID,

107
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,140
 the restrictions that are still upon us now,

108
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,500
 the struggles with travel, the disruption of family.

109
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,980
 And when we've all felt like we've been in a valley

110
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:31,380
 of the shadow of death, perhaps, over the last three years.

111
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:36,380
 And David is writing this Psalm in a valley of death himself

112
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,940
 as he's literally writing Psalm 23,

113
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,600
 his own son, Absalom, is trying to kill him,

114
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,340
 trying to track him down and kill him.

115
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,700
 So David has fled from the safety of his home

116
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,460
 into the Judean wilderness,

117
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,900
 and he's now hiding in dark caves.

118
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,860
 So when he writes, "I," this idea that God leads us

119
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,580
 in the valleys of shadows of death,

120
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,860
 it's basically David saying, "I know what that feels like

121
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,260
 'cause I'm in that place right now."

122
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,660
 There's pain there.

123
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,860
 And if you're in this room and you're in a place

124
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,780
 of the valley of the shadow of death,

125
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,060
 then the good news is you're in good company

126
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,300
 with the rest of humanity.

127
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,340
 And don't fall for the lie

128
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,260
 that just because you believe in Jesus,

129
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,900
 your life is gonna be suddenly all green pastures.

130
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,800
 Come on, church.

131
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,460
 But here's the crazy thing.

132
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,780
 David's actually saying something even more than that.

133
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,460
 David's not actually saying

134
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,640
 that you're gonna experience in your life

135
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,780
 sometimes a season of green pastures

136
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,740
 and sometimes a season of dark valleys.

137
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:46,260
 He's actually saying that those two things

138
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,380
 can actually coexist at the same time.

139
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,340
 And the reason we know he's saying that

140
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,560
 is because in our modern translations of Psalm 23,

141
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,700
 we've added numbered verses,

142
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,320
 verse one, verse two, verse three, verse four,

143
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,280
 to help us dumb sheep understand what's going on here.

144
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,180
 In the original that David wrote,

145
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:11,180
 he didn't number his sentences one, two, three, and four.

146
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,660
 He actually wrote a poetic structure.

147
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,620
 And in fact, when you read the Psalm in Hebrew,

148
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,300
 verse three and four,

149
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,820
 verse three speaking about the right paths

150
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,100
 that God leads us on,

151
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,500
 and verse four talking about the valley

152
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,620
 of the shadow of death,

153
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,860
 those are not two separate thoughts for David.

154
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,620
 It's one continuous flow, two different sentences,

155
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,420
 but one continuous flow.

156
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,400
 It's like David wants you to understand

157
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,820
 that the right paths and the valleys that are dark

158
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:42,700
 can sometimes be two realities of the same moment in life.

159
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:47,060
 And that's actually a deeply profound thing.

160
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,580
 That love and suffering can be side by side.

161
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:54,940
 That hope and despair can have a similar experience

162
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,700
 in the same moment of our lives.

163
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,900
 And it's like David is inviting us into something

164
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,100
 that is so beautifully nuanced

165
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,420
 that we have to realize it's not just about separate seasons,

166
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,480
 it's about actually what I'm walking through right now,

167
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,220
 that I can have in my everyday moments of great joy

168
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,060
 and moments of great despair.

169
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,360
 And in fact, he's even saying it more deeper than that.

170
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,980
 He's saying this, listen to this.

171
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:24,100
 Sometimes the path that God needs to lead you on

172
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:28,620
 is only right if it goes through a darkened valley.

173
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:33,900
 Oh, you don't want me to preach on that, do you?

174
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,940
 That's what I'm gonna preach on today.

175
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:40,380
 That sometimes the actual right path for you

176
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,820
 that God wants you to be on

177
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:47,820
 actually takes you into the valley of the shadow of death.

178
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:52,520
 That actually God understands what you really need

179
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,600
 for your soul to be restored.

180
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,600
 And sometimes that means that there is the beauty of pain.

181
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,420
 Oh, the beauty of pain.

182
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,380
 If you're an anesthetologist in this room,

183
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,580
 you would understand what I'm talking about.

184
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:17,660
 I wanna unpack the idea that there could be beauty in pain,

185
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,460
 that there could be God in the dark valleys.

186
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,340
 And as I do that today,

187
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,020
 I pray that this will be helpful for some of you

188
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,580
 who have lived more of a dichotomous life,

189
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,420
 where you've come to, and I wanna say this,

190
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,620
 I feel this is prophetic for some of you in this room,

191
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,440
 you've come to only ever associate God with a good feeling.

192
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,260
 Oh, I'm gonna say that again.

193
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,420
 That's not in my notes, that just came.

194
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,060
 That's cool, I'm gonna say that again.

195
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,100
 Some of you in this room,

196
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,800
 you only ever associate God with a good feeling.

197
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,440
 And of course, God has lots of good feelings,

198
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,940
 but he's also something more.

199
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:58,060
 I want you to see what he says here.

200
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,540
 He says, "Even though I walk through the valley

201
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,040
 "of the shadow of death."

202
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,260
 The term that he uses, David, for shadow of death here

203
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,260
 is a Hebrew word, it's tzaltzmach death.

204
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,100
 And what that word literally means is shadow of death,

205
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,860
 or total and complete darkness.

206
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,580
 David is trying to help you to understand

207
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,740
 what the valleys of life can feel like.

208
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,260
 And he's not just writing poetically and metaphorically,

209
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,620
 he's actually talking about real valleys.

210
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,860
 Remember, I've been saying in this series

211
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,460
 that David is writing in the Judean wilderness.

212
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,500
 He's writing in the very place of a desert.

213
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,700
 He's writing in the very place where he had been a shepherd

214
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,460
 at the early stages of his life.

215
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,300
 Now he's hiding in caves there.

216
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,820
 And in the Judean wilderness,

217
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,180
 where shepherds would bring their flocks all the time,

218
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,540
 there were these places of valleys

219
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,300
 that were known as Tzmalfeth.

220
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,700
 And these valleys were literally craggy rocks

221
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,300
 within the Judean hills.

222
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,860
 And they were shaped sort of really narrowly.

223
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,180
 Sometimes to get through them,

224
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,980
 you could only get through the rocks single file.

225
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,700
 There were quite high as well, craggy, broken rocks.

226
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,940
 And you would have to go down in through the valley

227
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,060
 in order to get out the other side

228
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,580
 where perhaps you would want to go.

229
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,900
 There was no way of getting over it,

230
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,300
 or under it, or around it.

231
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,940
 You would have to always go through it.

232
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:21,020
 David is picturing this idea as he talks here in the psalm.

233
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,500
 I've actually personally experienced

234
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,740
 these valleys for myself.

235
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,860
 I actually stayed a night out in the Judean wilderness

236
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,900
 on my own in 2016,

237
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,060
 with nothing other than two bottles of water,

238
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,540
 a rucksack on my back, and a sleeping bag.

239
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,980
 And I did it because I wanted to experience

240
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,980
 what Jesus would have felt being tempted in the wilderness

241
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,700
 for 40 days and 40 nights.

242
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,860
 Now, because I'm not Jesus,

243
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,420
 I did not do it for 40 days and 40 nights.

244
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,980
 I did it for about 14 hours.

245
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,380
 But I was on my own,

246
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,420
 completely in the middle of the Judean wilderness,

247
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,900
 which is a very dangerous place.

248
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,980
 Not just Bedouins,

249
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,740
 the Israeli military operates in that area as well.

250
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,580
 And the Israeli guide that I had,

251
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,940
 who was helping me do this,

252
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,900
 he didn't come with me,

253
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,620
 but he stood on the outside of the Judean wilderness.

254
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,660
 And he said, "Okay, you're gonna walk that way."

255
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,540
 I'm like, "Okay, cool."

256
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,260
 He's like, "And here's how you survive."

257
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,260
 I'm like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, hang on a second.

258
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,860
 What do you mean survive?

259
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,940
 Like, is it that dangerous?"

260
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,060
 He's like, "Here's how you survive.

261
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,620
 You need to go through for about three and a half hours,

262
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,180
 and then you'll find yourself coming out

263
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:20,700
 onto like a raised plain, like a higher area."

264
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,540
 And he said, "That's the place that's safe to sleep."

265
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,940
 And I'm like, "What do you mean by safe?

266
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,460
 Can we break that down, please?"

267
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,140
 He's like, "Well, the dogs don't come up there.

268
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:28,980
 So that's good."

269
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,980
 I'm like, "That's good."

270
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,620
 And he said, "The Bedouins also don't rarely come up

271
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,460
 in that space.

272
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,780
 If you actually camp down in the lower places

273
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,940
 of the wilderness,

274
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,940
 you'll actually get attacked by the Bedouins probably.

275
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,340
 They'll come and mug you and take your valuables.

276
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,660
 So get through that and end up in the plain."

277
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,620
 So I hiked for about three and a half hours

278
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,700
 through what David describes

279
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,140
 as the Valley of the Shadow of Death.

280
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,460
 It was scary.

281
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,740
 It's dark in there.

282
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,860
 And it's so dark actually in places

283
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,220
 where you're walking single file

284
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,980
 through that kind of valley area

285
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,940
 that the sun never gets in that place.

286
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,340
 So though it was like 40 degrees

287
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,780
 and I was hiking in about 40 degrees,

288
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,220
 when I was inside, it was super cool.

289
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,860
 At night, if you were in there, it would be freezing.

290
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,580
 You'd probably freeze really badly.

291
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,100
 It's weird to think about freezing in a desert,

292
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,140
 but that's what happens in these valleys.

293
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,180
 That's what David's picturing.

294
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,940
 And I realized I needed to get through that

295
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,540
 in order to get to the other side.

296
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,460
 David is explaining in the Psalm

297
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:24,340
 that here's what the shepherd sometimes has to do,

298
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:27,260
 to take you from the pasture that you're currently in

299
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,980
 to the one that's actually going to be

300
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,380
 the thing of blessing for you,

301
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,740
 the thing of growth for you,

302
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,140
 the thing of restoration for you.

303
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,900
 The shepherd needs to lead you through the valley

304
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,220
 that feels like a shadow of death.

305
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,780
 Notice here the word that's used.

306
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,820
 It says, "Through the valley."

307
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,780
 David did not say, "We run through it."

308
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,180
 He doesn't say, "We crawl through it."

309
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,380
 He says, "I walk," because the shepherd is leading me,

310
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,100
 "through the valley, but I'm getting through it."

311
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:51,940
 And here's the first thing

312
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,460
 some of you in this room need to know.

313
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,260
 The dark time that you're in right now,

314
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,860
 the thing that you're really struggling with,

315
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,540
 the place of suffering and pain,

316
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,540
 you need to know it's a path

317
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:04,500
 that God is moving you through it,

318
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,460
 that it's not actually gonna be your permanent home.

319
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,420
 Some of you in this room,

320
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,580
 you think because of how crazy this is

321
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,620
 and how hard your life is right now,

322
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,460
 that you think that's the permanent place

323
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,340
 that you're going to be.

324
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:18,140
 David is saying there's a valley of the shadow of death.

325
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,140
 He's not trying to hide the reality

326
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,220
 that sometimes we face struggles in life.

327
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:25,420
 But what he's saying is it is not your home.

328
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,300
 It is not where you camp.

329
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,740
 You camp through and up on the other plane.

330
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,660
 You need to get through that valley.

331
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,540
 It is not the place for you to stop.

332
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,700
 It is not the place for you to feel like it's home.

333
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,740
 But some of us, when we're going through hard times

334
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,900
 and suffering in life, it can be so all-encompassing

335
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,740
 that we actually begin to think, "Well, this is my life.

336
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,740
 "This is all I can have.

337
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,980
 "This is my plot.

338
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,300
 "I guess I'm just gonna have to live here."

339
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,620
 And David's saying, "Do not stop walking."

340
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,940
 There's momentum here.

341
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,620
 Even though I walk, he doesn't say I pause.

342
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,860
 He doesn't say I stop.

343
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,300
 I walk through the valley.

344
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,500
 I've got to go through it.

345
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,700
 I can't avoid it.

346
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,860
 There's blessings in it,

347
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,300
 which I'm gonna talk about in a minute,

348
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,660
 but I still need to get through it.

349
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,060
 Some of you have stopped,

350
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,940
 and the Spirit's word to you today is walk again.

351
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:14,300
 Equally, for some of you,

352
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,060
 the dark valleys have come to define

353
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,620
 how you think about yourself.

354
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,660
 This is really beautiful, what David does here.

355
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:27,140
 He says the valley is the dark place.

356
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:30,300
 He doesn't say you are the dark place.

357
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,940
 He doesn't say the sheep are the dark place.

358
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,340
 He says the valley is.

359
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,100
 The valley feels that way.

360
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,460
 And so often what happens for us as Christians sometimes

361
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,660
 when we go through a hard time

362
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,580
 is that we actually, the enemy does this to us.

363
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,300
 He tries to create a strategy

364
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,300
 where we take that dark and hard time,

365
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,020
 and we begin to think that that's who we are.

366
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,900
 We begin to think that, oh, this always happens to me.

367
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,940
 I deserve this because of X, Y, and Z in my life,

368
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,700
 or this is happening to me.

369
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,180
 This is part of my identity now.

370
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,700
 I guess I'm just always gonna be an unlucky person.

371
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,940
 I'm always gonna be a person that's upsetting people.

372
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,140
 I'm always, and we suddenly start to think

373
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,300
 that we are defined as the darkness.

374
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,780
 And David's like, never think of yourself as the darkness.

375
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,900
 You are children of God, saved by Him,

376
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,580
 redeemed by Him, released into the light.

377
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,220
 Doesn't mean you don't experience some darkness,

378
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,100
 but the darkness is not you.

379
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,940
 Some of us need to release the fact

380
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,380
 that we've identified ourselves in the darkness and go,

381
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,620
 no, no, no, hang on a sec.

382
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,660
 This situation I'm in, it sucks.

383
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,540
 It sucks.

384
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:38,340
 But I am not the sum total of that situation.

385
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,660
 He then says this.

386
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:44,580
 He says, "Even though I walk through the valley

387
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:47,820
 of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil."

388
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,860
 It's like, David, really?

389
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,020
 I will fear no evil.

390
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:59,020
 The word evil here literally means disaster or calamity.

391
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,740
 David's saying, when I'm in the darkest of places,

392
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,020
 I will fear no calamity.

393
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:08,060
 I will fear no ultimate disaster in my life.

394
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:12,820
 Notice that David does not say, I won't have any disasters.

395
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,140
 He doesn't say, I walk through the valley

396
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,700
 of the shadow of death and nothing impacts me.

397
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,020
 He doesn't say, I avoid the disaster

398
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,460
 or I circumvent the disaster.

399
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,020
 He just says, I will not fear the disaster.

400
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,060
 In other words, he's talking about an internal perception

401
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,820
 about the reality of his circumstances.

402
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,500
 He's not, again, trying to give us a prosperity gospel.

403
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,220
 He's not saying, hey, if you just believe in Jesus,

404
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,420
 you'll be sort of sucked out of all the bad stuff

405
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,620
 that's ever gonna happen in your life.

406
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,900
 He's saying, no, we sometimes walk through valleys

407
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,540
 that feel like the shadow of death, but guess what?

408
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,980
 I won't fear the reality of the situation I'm in.

409
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:48,060
 The situation may happen, that calamity may take place.

410
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,540
 For some of you in this room, that marriage might break down.

411
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,460
 That job may not work out.

412
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,820
 That relationship that you've invested your time in

413
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,900
 might not come into fruition.

414
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,780
 That thing, that investment that you made,

415
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,860
 you might lose your money and all of that might happen.

416
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,220
 And that will be a calamity.

417
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,500
 It'll be a disaster.

418
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,360
 It will suck, it'll hurt.

419
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,900
 There'll be suffering involved.

420
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,900
 But what David is saying is when we know the shepherd,

421
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:16,020
 we do not have to fear the reality, the impact,

422
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,660
 and the shaping of all of that stuff.

423
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,320
 It may still happen,

424
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,500
 but we don't have to allow it to define us.

425
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,220
 The word fear here literally means

426
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:30,440
 to not be overcome by or shaped by, transformed by.

427
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,540
 It's like David is putting a stake in the ground

428
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:37,200
 and saying evil, calamity, disaster will happen

429
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,020
 in your life, but it doesn't have to define you.

430
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,700
 There is other things that will seek to transform you.

431
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,820
 You don't need to allow those things

432
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,580
 to tell you who you are.

433
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,700
 There is more to you

434
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,620
 than the disaster you might be in right now.

435
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:57,900
 What is the thing that's more?

436
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:02,540
 He says this simply, "For you are with me."

437
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:07,740
 This is quite profound, although we read it and we think,

438
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,040
 oh yeah, but it's actually really profound.

439
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,380
 David's saying the reason why I can be

440
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,620
 a non-anxious presence, fear no evil,

441
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:20,060
 a non-anxious presence amid the chaos of this world

442
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:25,060
 is 'cause I know God is with me in the darkest of places,

443
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:28,180
 in the places of greatest pain,

444
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,380
 in the places that have overwhelmed me.

445
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:34,700
 He's saying God's presence is in the darkened valleys

446
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,940
 as much as it is in the green pastures.

447
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,380
 And church, this is something we really need to wrestle with

448
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,460
 because as Christians, it's very easy for us

449
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,700
 to just think that God is only with us

450
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,420
 when things are going well.

451
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,020
 We have a tendency to think God's presence is found

452
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,900
 when we're lifting our hands in worship in church.

453
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,340
 We think God's presence is there

454
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,020
 when we get the bonus at the end of the year.

455
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,620
 We think God's presence is there

456
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,340
 when we find our spouse for life.

457
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,400
 And yes, he is there in all of those moments.

458
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,060
 But we have this idea that we've come to define

459
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,500
 God's presence as only a good feeling,

460
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,020
 so therefore God's presence is only ever with us

461
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,500
 when things are green pastures.

462
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,180
 But when things are hard, when suffering comes,

463
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,940
 when my life has been turned upside down,

464
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,020
 we tend to think God has left us.

465
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:22,940
 We need to confess that faulty thinking of God.

466
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:27,540
 We think in our suffering, God is not there.

467
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:31,580
 And David is saying, "In the darkest of valleys,

468
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,900
 he is with me.

469
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,660
 He never gives up on me, never leaves me,

470
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,980
 never forsakes me.

471
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,900
 He's always there for me all the time."

472
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,700
 And the reason why that's such a joy for David

473
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,100
 is 'cause he realizes, "If I understand

474
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,460
 that God is present with me in the good moments

475
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,660
 and the bad moments, here's the thing.

476
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:54,660
 I've come to realize what is the only true constant in life."

477
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,060
 Listen to this, church.

478
00:19:56,060 --> 00:20:00,820
 Everything in the Psalm so far, in Psalm 23, verses one to four,

479
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,900
 all of the circumstances and situations

480
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,020
 David has been speaking about, green pastures,

481
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:08,100
 quiet waters, paths of righteousness,

482
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,140
 even valleys of the shadows of death,

483
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,620
 all of them are temporary.

484
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:16,260
 David is saying all these things are temporary.

485
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,100
 They're not your home.

486
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,140
 They're not the true constant in life.

487
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,660
 You wanna know the one thing that is constant,

488
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,420
 that is bankable, that you can put your whole life upon?

489
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,020
 You can't guarantee green pastures all your life.

490
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,180
 Likewise, you can't always be in dark valleys.

491
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,860
 What you can know is that God will be with you

492
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,540
 no matter what is going on.

493
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,660
 That's the permanency of this.

494
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,220
 This is the permanency of blessing,

495
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,940
 that God is always with us.

496
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:48,780
 Stop thinking that blessing means good things for you

497
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,620
 and start realizing that blessing

498
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,940
 means the presence of God in your life.

499
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,900
 And the presence of God in your life

500
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,900
 is needed in the hard times, perhaps even more

501
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,220
 than it's needed in the good times.

502
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:04,140
 He's the one constant thing that you can take to the bank

503
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,740
 and believe because of that,

504
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,900
 I can be a non-anxious presence in this world

505
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,900
 'cause I know my life is not dependent

506
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,980
 on the temporary nature of circumstances.

507
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,060
 My life is dependent on the permanent nature

508
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,620
 of God's character.

509
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,460
 He is with me.

510
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,860
 He's with me.

511
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:23,500
 My darkest valley,

512
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:29,900
 my darkest valley was 22nd of March, 2019.

513
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:35,860
 By that day, my dad had been in the hospital for three days

514
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,380
 and he'd had cancer for a couple of years,

515
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,140
 but the cancer had finally shown up in his liver.

516
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:46,060
 And so for three days, he was in the hospital

517
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,700
 and the doctors were doing some great work

518
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,820
 to help him to try some experimental treatments

519
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,420
 to see if there's any way of saving their lives.

520
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,140
 And the doctors were saying to us,

521
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,540
 maybe a week, maybe two.

522
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,700
 And we were in the midst of trying to process that.

523
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,500
 And on the evening of the 22nd of March,

524
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,660
 one of the doctors said to us,

525
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,180
 "Hey, it'd be really good if one of you could stay

526
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,940
 "with your dad through the night."

527
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,020
 And because he was in a male-only ward,

528
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,420
 that responsibility fell to me.

529
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:14,300
 And so my family all left at about 10 o'clock at night.

530
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,540
 And my dad was conscious.

531
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,900
 He was awake.

532
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,940
 He was able to move about a little bit.

533
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,260
 He was obviously bedridden in many ways.

534
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,300
 His liver was causing him to feel like he needed

535
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,740
 to go to the toilet every two minutes,

536
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:30,220
 even though he had no water in his system to urinate out.

537
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:36,180
 And I didn't really know what to expect that evening.

538
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:40,140
 But I sat at his bedside,

539
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:44,420
 and I did everything I could in my power

540
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,860
 to make him feel comfortable for about six hours

541
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,820
 when my dad was in continuous pain.

542
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:54,460
 And I couldn't give him drugs, of course.

543
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,300
 And it wasn't right.

544
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,300
 He'd had some drugs earlier,

545
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,500
 so he couldn't take drugs again for a while.

546
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,500
 And I don't wanna tell you all the things

547
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,820
 that we did over those six hours,

548
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,620
 'cause that's between me and my dad.

549
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:12,020
 But it was really painful to see my dad

550
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,460
 in that much pain and suffering.

551
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,300
 And none of my other family members saw it

552
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,660
 because they weren't there.

553
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:24,260
 And I had to try to help him as best I could.

554
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,900
 And after about, by about 3.30 in the morning,

555
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:31,500
 I realized I am absolutely at the end of my ability

556
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,780
 to help my dad, to relieve his suffering,

557
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,780
 to do whatever he needed.

558
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:40,260
 I think it was about 3.30 in the morning,

559
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:45,220
 and I was literally like, I have nothing in me,

560
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,220
 physically, emotionally, spiritually.

561
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,460
 There's nothing left.

562
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,260
 I felt a failure.

563
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,060
 I felt a deep sense of pain

564
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,660
 that I couldn't be the son I wanted to be

565
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,900
 to my dad in that moment.

566
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,620
 I felt like I was just useless.

567
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:03,300
 And the Holy Spirit woke Sidney up.

568
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,380
 Sidney's sitting here.

569
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,340
 He's a doctor at the Adventist Hospital.

570
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,020
 And woke Sidney up at 3.30 in the morning

571
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:12,820
 and brought him to my dad's bedside.

572
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,420
 And Sidney walked into the room,

573
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,780
 and I think immediately he could see

574
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,820
 that I was completely done.

575
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:21,660
 But I think he could also see that my father was not long.

576
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,820
 And so he said to me, you need to call your family,

577
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:28,100
 get them here as soon as possible.

578
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:28,940
 So I did.

579
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,740
 I called my mom, my sisters, my extended family,

580
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,820
 my dad's extended family, and they all came in,

581
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,940
 and about 30 minutes later, my dad passed.

582
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:41,340
 And for about three months after that moment,

583
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:44,300
 I was very angry at God.

584
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:49,660
 Because I couldn't understand why I had to be the one

585
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,660
 to see my dad like that for six hours.

586
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:56,500
 That the last memories of my father were those memories.

587
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,520
 And you know that if you go through a traumatic time

588
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,700
 or something that's really difficult,

589
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,520
 those become fresh and lingering memories for you.

590
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,460
 And I was angry at God that he would leave me

591
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,660
 with those memories.

592
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,580
 I was angry at God because he had called me

593
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,580
 to do something I was not capable to do.

594
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,060
 Because I couldn't stand with my dad

595
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,260
 in the way that I wanted to really stand with him.

596
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:21,140
 And during those three months that I was angry at God,

597
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:24,660
 he came into my life and began to work through

598
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,960
 what was happening in that moment with my dad.

599
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:33,020
 And he said to me, "You can't imagine what it meant

600
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:36,420
 "to your father for you to be present with him

601
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,420
 "in the final six hours of his life."

602
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:42,660
 He said, "Andrew, you can't even begin to grasp

603
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,980
 "what that meant to him."

604
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,840
 And he said, "And I know how hard it was for you.

605
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,860
 "But I want you to know that in and through

606
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:55,740
 "that experience, I wanted you, Andrew,

607
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:00,280
 "to understand what it's like for me to be at your bedside

608
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,740
 "every moment of your life.

609
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,140
 "I will never give up on you.

610
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,380
 "I will never forsake you.

611
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,540
 "Even if you do the worst things,

612
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:12,180
 "I will be there right for you.

613
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,660
 "'Cause that's who I am.

614
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,660
 "I'm your God."

615
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:21,020
 And even now, as I tell you this story,

616
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,340
 I feel a sense of like,

617
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,220
 why did I have to go through that dark valley

618
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,460
 to learn that lesson?

619
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:30,980
 But at the same breath, because green pastures

620
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,200
 and dark valleys can exist together in the same moment,

621
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,460
 I can stand before you now and say,

622
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:39,800
 "I am more at peace in my life as your leader here.

623
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:45,620
 "I am more deeply understanding of the power

624
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:49,700
 "of the presence of God in my life for you as your pastor

625
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,740
 "because I went through that experience."

626
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:57,740
 And David's trying to explain here in the Psalm

627
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:02,500
 that there are moments of green pastures in our lives

628
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,700
 that are designed specifically

629
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,740
 because there is only a part of God's character

630
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,240
 that can be learned during a green pasture moment.

631
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,400
 But he's also saying that the reason why he leads us

632
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,520
 through valleys of the shadow of death

633
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,080
 is because there are things of God's character

634
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,240
 that you can only ever grasp or know

635
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,200
 if you experience him in the midst of that place.

636
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,820
 Some of you here right now,

637
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:33,320
 you're seeing your dark valley as how I felt on that day.

638
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,920
 And look, we know as we go through these things,

639
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,600
 it's really difficult.

640
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,560
 David understood that.

641
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,680
 He's not saying just 'cause God's there,

642
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,040
 you don't suffer any pain.

643
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,920
 In fact, sometimes God's presence is the thing

644
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,040
 that brings us the pain

645
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,480
 because God's presence causes us to repent,

646
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,480
 causes us to do things that we need to do

647
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,680
 to get right with him and right with others.

648
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:59,080
 But he's saying, "I'm with you.

649
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:03,020
 "And if you really know that I am with you,

650
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,360
 "no matter what happens in your life,

651
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,480
 "you will be set free from fear."

652
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,080
 I stand before you today way more set free from fear

653
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,900
 than when I was before that moment with my father.

654
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,080
 And then what does he say?

655
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,540
 Well, how does David finish this idea?

656
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,300
 How do we receive the presence of God?

657
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,720
 How do we know that comfort?

658
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,160
 How does that comfort fill us with hope?

659
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:30,000
 He says at the end, "Your rod and your staff,

660
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,240
 "they comfort me."

661
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,360
 He's talking about the shepherd, right?

662
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,320
 He's continuing the imagery of the shepherd.

663
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,480
 He says, "The rod and your staff, they comfort me."

664
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,680
 This is a rod and a staff, a shepherd's rod and a staff.

665
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,660
 Let me explain these to you real quick.

666
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,920
 This is a rod.

667
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,200
 This is actually a little bit bigger

668
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,600
 than what a shepherd's rod would have been.

669
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,020
 A shepherd's rod is about a meter long,

670
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,920
 so it would be about maybe that long.

671
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,560
 And it was designed to fit custom-made

672
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,080
 into the shepherd's hand.

673
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,360
 And the shepherd would use the rod

674
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,000
 for two primary things for the sheep.

675
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,400
 The first was the first line of defense

676
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,020
 on behalf of the sheep.

677
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:08,020
 The shepherd was very skilled at using this rod

678
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:11,660
 to defend back or to knock back any enemy

679
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,100
 or threat to the sheep.

680
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,260
 The shepherd could throw this thing

681
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,900
 and it would sort of spin in the air

682
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,980
 and the hard end of it would hit against, say,

683
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:23,260
 a bear or a cougar or a lion, something like that,

684
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,940
 and knock it back from the sheep.

685
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,500
 Sometimes the shepherd would get right in front of the sheep,

686
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,500
 sorry, and smack them like this,

687
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,860
 smack, not the sheep, not the sheep,

688
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,380
 but the, you're a lion right now,

689
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,400
 smack the lion away from the sheep, right?

690
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,700
 So sometimes that's what the shepherd would do,

691
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,740
 like hit or throw.

692
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,500
 If you get up and go to the toilet in the next 10 minutes,

693
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,380
 I'm throwing this thing at you.

694
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,080
 Don't think I can't get you in the upper house.

695
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,620
 I've done it before, I'll do it again.

696
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,460
 No, just kidding.

697
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,280
 But that's what he would do.

698
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,300
 He would defend the sheep with the rod.

699
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:53,480
 And you need to know here, if you're in a dark valley,

700
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,980
 God defends you.

701
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,340
 And he defends you not with a physical rod

702
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,240
 like the shepherd today,

703
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,060
 but he defends you with three things.

704
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:00,900
 You've been making notes?

705
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,020
 These three things are very helpful to make a note of.

706
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:07,560
 The first thing he defends you with is the word of God.

707
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:11,080
 His word defines for you who you are.

708
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:14,420
 His word tells you the person that you are

709
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:17,440
 when the valley is trying to define you as the darkness.

710
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,620
 It's his word that we stand upon.

711
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:22,180
 It's his word that is the rock that is under our feet.

712
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,360
 It is what scripture says about God

713
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,880
 that drives us to understand who we are in him,

714
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,280
 no matter the circumstances, situation that we are in.

715
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,840
 His word is always primary.

716
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,400
 And God is never, ever going to back away from his word.

717
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,840
 He's never gonna contradict it.

718
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,360
 He's never gonna present anything other

719
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,560
 than who he has already presented to us in the scriptures.

720
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,380
 That's number one.

721
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,600
 The second thing is the blood of Jesus.

722
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,580
 The blood of Jesus is the rod of God

723
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,700
 to defend the enemy's attack from your life.

724
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,640
 The blood of Jesus,

725
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,840
 the death and resurrection of Jesus on the cross

726
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,620
 has purchased for you salvation and redemption.

727
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,960
 It has set you free.

728
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,360
 It means that death no longer is the end of your story.

729
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,600
 It means that you have a new path now.

730
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,360
 It means that the shadow of death is not a dead end.

731
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,080
 Before you came to Christ Jesus,

732
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,880
 the shadow of death is a dead end.

733
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,960
 After Christ Jesus, it's a path and a valley

734
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,600
 that has an entrance and an exit point.

735
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:18,100
 Christ is returning so that you would know the fullness

736
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,560
 of what it was that you were created for.

737
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,800
 He's returning so you'll never know pain,

738
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,300
 suffering, or death anymore.

739
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,280
 But in the moment right now,

740
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,500
 where both green pastures and dark valleys

741
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:31,300
 can exist in the same moment, His blood covers you.

742
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:35,120
 It protects you and fights for you.

743
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,920
 The final thing is the church.

744
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:40,360
 God's community is a defense for you.

745
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,280
 It's the thing that stands beside you and says,

746
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,720
 "We hear you, we see you,

747
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,040
 we know the hard time you're in.

748
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,000
 We're praying for you right now."

749
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,920
 God's church is the brothers and sisters,

750
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,220
 the children of God coming around us and saying,

751
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,760
 "I've got you.

752
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,880
 You matter to me.

753
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,620
 And my prayers, the prayers of a righteous person

754
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,120
 is powerful and effective.

755
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,760
 And if you're going through a hard time right now,

756
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,360
 I will put that stake in the ground and I will defend you.

757
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,160
 I'll grab my rod on your behalf,

758
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:08,240
 which is the power of prayer, and I will stand for you."

759
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,640
 In fact, 'cause I feel the Holy Spirit right now,

760
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,700
 we're gonna do this right now.

761
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,060
 I haven't finished my sermon, just to let you know,

762
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,200
 but we're gonna do this right now.

763
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:20,200
 If you are in need of the church to pray for you

764
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,680
 for whatever it is right now that's going on in your life,

765
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,180
 I want you to stand right now.

766
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,760
 Come on, let's do some business with God right now,

767
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,600
 right in the middle of this.

768
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,320
 If you would like the church to pray for you,

769
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,060
 if you'd like someone to stand with you,

770
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,640
 if there's something going on in your life right now,

771
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,640
 why don't you stand?

772
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,940
 And if you're still sitting, which is awesome,

773
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,940
 I want you to lay hands on the people that are now standing.

774
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:48,520
 We're not gonna worry about COVID in the name of Jesus.

775
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,540
 You can put your hands on people, physical human people.

776
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:55,220
 Father, we wanna stand as a church community

777
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,640
 over the people that are standing right now.

778
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:01,180
 Holy Spirit, we pray in the name of Jesus

779
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:04,200
 that you would come and fight back the enemy strategies

780
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,000
 over the people that are standing right now.

781
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,580
 Lord, if there are concerns, you would come, Holy Spirit.

782
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,860
 If there are fears, you would take them captive

783
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,600
 in your name, Lord Jesus.

784
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,200
 Lord, if there are things that are happening

785
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,460
 that are just not controllable for them,

786
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,840
 we pray that you would step in and take control.

787
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:24,460
 Lord, as the church of Christ, as children of God,

788
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,960
 we stand on their behalf.

789
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,080
 And we pray scripture that it says that the prayers

790
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,560
 of a righteous person is powerful and effective.

791
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,380
 We're not righteous in our own strength,

792
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,100
 but because of the blood of Jesus.

793
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,800
 So everybody in the lower house, in the upper house,

794
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,360
 online right now, we stand with you,

795
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:44,200
 and we say, get back, enemy, in the name of Jesus.

796
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,760
 You do not have any authority.

797
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,640
 You take authority over these people.

798
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,360
 We release them into the care and the hope

799
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,880
 and the life of Jesus.

800
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,660
 And we pray this in Jesus' name, everyone says.

801
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,880
 All right, you can sit back down,

802
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,680
 but do not leave, 'cause I'm not done.

803
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,160
 Here's the other thing.

804
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,640
 I said there were two things the rod did.

805
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,580
 Here's the other thing the rod did.

806
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:10,220
 The rod was also used by the shepherd

807
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,620
 to discipline the sheep.

808
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:14,660
 And this is the bit that we don't like to think about,

809
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,880
 but I'm gonna preach on this one for a minute.

810
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,680
 In fact, David said, this is a comfort to me.

811
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:24,680
 It's a comfort to me that the shepherd disciplines me,

812
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,840
 that the shepherd corrects me,

813
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,300
 because I need correction,

814
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,280
 'cause I'm the sheep and not the shepherd.

815
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,600
 And he said, one of the things that helps me

816
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,540
 get through a valley of the shadow of death,

817
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,920
 when I realize that the valley

818
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,560
 was sometimes caused by my sin,

819
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,560
 when I realize that sometimes my poor choices,

820
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,920
 my words, my language, my actions

821
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,800
 actually created the suffering that I'm in right now,

822
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,840
 I'm grateful that I have a God who's big enough

823
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:52,020
 to come alongside of me in grace and forgive me, yes,

824
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,840
 but also say, go and sin no more.

825
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,320
 Also say, hey, there's a way that you are living

826
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,200
 that's not the way I want you to live.

827
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,840
 A shepherd with the rod,

828
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,740
 let's say a sheep was on its way

829
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,720
 to eat some poisonous weeds.

830
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,940
 There were a lot of poisonous weeds

831
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,000
 in the Judean wilderness.

832
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,160
 And the sheep didn't know a poisonous weed

833
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,920
 from a non-poisonous one, but a good shepherd did.

834
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,520
 And so if the sheep was heading towards the poisonous weed,

835
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,720
 here's what the shepherd would do.

836
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,440
 He would take the rod and he would smack it on the ground.

837
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,900
 He would never hit the sheep,

838
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:23,480
 but he would hit the ground in front of the sheep.

839
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,560
 And immediately the sheep will then be so scared

840
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,040
 that it would turn around and run in the other direction.

841
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,600
 I've had many times in my life

842
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,600
 where God has taken the rod and smacked the ground before me.

843
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:38,300
 We said last week that we should have an expectation

844
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,700
 that God leads us.

845
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,720
 Part of God's leadership in your life

846
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,440
 is his discipline of your life.

847
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,280
 It's his correction over you.

848
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,720
 And I wasn't gonna talk about that last week

849
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,800
 'cause I wanted to talk about it this week.

850
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,220
 But here's the thing you need to realize,

851
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,360
 that we can't have the expectation

852
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,060
 of God's direction in our lives

853
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,800
 without actually opening ourselves

854
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,020
 to the acceptance of his correction.

855
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:05,320
 In fact, expectation of God's leadership

856
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:10,320
 without the appropriate acceptance of his discipline

857
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,340
 is delusional.

858
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:16,120
 God desires to discipline you because he loves you,

859
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,640
 because he's making an investment in you,

860
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,000
 'cause he's saying you're my sheep

861
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,440
 and my sheep need to walk strong in this life.

862
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,220
 My sheep need to know my voice.

863
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:26,680
 My sheep need to be the non-anxious presence

864
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,560
 in a chaotic world.

865
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,120
 My church needs to rise up in strength.

866
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,880
 And when the church is in sin,

867
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,440
 he will come and discipline those that he loves.

868
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,920
 So you need to realize

869
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:42,360
 that you're actually interpreting the discipline of God

870
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,040
 for an attack of the enemy in your life,

871
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,800
 because you associate God too much with a good feeling.

872
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:53,280
 And sometimes we turn conviction into condemnation.

873
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,360
 In fact, in the New Testament,

874
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,320
 I've just got a few more minutes.

875
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,760
 Is that okay if I can keep going with you guys for a bit?

876
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:06,320
 Okay then.

877
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,840
 I wanna read you something from Hebrews.

878
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,080
 And in the New Testament,

879
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,440
 they talked about this all the time.

880
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,920
 It's not just the Psalm 23 thing.

881
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,640
 Here's how the author of Hebrews put it.

882
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,640
 Endure hardship as discipline.

883
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,500
 God is treating you as a child.

884
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,360
 For what children are not disciplined by their fathers?

885
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,800
 If you are not disciplined and everyone undergoes discipline,

886
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,360
 then you are illegitimate children

887
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,080
 and not true sons and daughters.

888
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,880
 Moreover, we have all had human fathers

889
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,920
 who have disciplined us and respected them for it.

890
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,200
 How much more should we now submit ourselves

891
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,000
 to the father of our spirits and live?

892
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,800
 Our fathers disciplined us for a little while

893
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,880
 as they thought best,

894
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,560
 but God disciplines us for our good

895
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,520
 that we may share in his holiness.

896
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,200
 No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful.

897
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,640
 There's Hebrews saying,

898
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,000
 God sometimes feels like a bit of pain.

899
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,480
 It's painful at the time.

900
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,000
 But later on, however,

901
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,840
 it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace

902
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,640
 for those that have been trained by it.

903
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:14,160
 Oh, David says, your discipline comforts me

904
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,720
 'cause it keeps me away from the poison weeds

905
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,760
 and it releases me onto the right paths,

906
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,760
 even when those right paths take me

907
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,320
 through a valley of the shadow of death.

908
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,920
 And then he says, finally, and I'm finishing with this.

909
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,680
 He says, your staff comforts me.

910
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,640
 A shepherd's staff is perhaps the most iconic picture

911
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,800
 of a shepherd that there is.

912
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,160
 In fact, there's no other profession

913
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,480
 that uses a staff that's shaped like this,

914
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:41,280
 the iconic hook shape of the shepherd's staff.

915
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,720
 David says, this thing comforts us

916
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,880
 in the darkest of valleys.

917
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,800
 And the question is, how does this staff comfort us?

918
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:54,720
 Shepherds use the staff for one primary purpose.

919
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,280
 And it's perhaps one that you wouldn't necessarily think of.

920
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,560
 In birthing season, when the sheep are giving birth,

921
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,520
 when the mother sheep are giving birth to the lambs,

922
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,480
 when the lamb is birthed,

923
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:11,360
 the shepherd scoops up the lamb at the end of the hook.

924
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,520
 Here, scoops up the little lamb,

925
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,000
 carries the lamb and places it at the head of the mother.

926
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,960
 Now, why does the shepherd scoop up the lamb

927
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,120
 rather than grab the lamb with his own hands?

928
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,280
 Well, it's because if the shepherd grabbed the lamb

929
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,920
 with his own hands, his scent would be on the newborn lamb.

930
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,600
 And so when the lamb comes and be placed before the mother,

931
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,960
 because it's smelt human and not like the lamb,

932
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,680
 there's a chance the mother might reject it.

933
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,200
 So instead, it's like a pizza oven.

934
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,880
 Ooh, there's the pizza,

935
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,200
 and bring it over to your table right here, right?

936
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,880
 Like, there's the lamb and there's the mother.

937
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,400
 And so in other words, God's staff comforts us

938
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,680
 because he enables us to be connected to one another.

939
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:01,800
 He wants unity in the body of Christ.

940
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,160
 He wants us to do what we just did a moment ago,

941
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,560
 praying for one another, loving each other,

942
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,440
 cheering each other on, disciplining each other,

943
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,240
 being open to the discipline of one another,

944
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,240
 listening to critique and feedback.

945
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,560
 He wants us to be unified together.

946
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,800
 And so God does that for us, and it's a comfort,

947
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,240
 particularly in the valley that is shadowy

948
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,800
 and feels like death.

949
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,800
 The other thing that the staff does,

950
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,440
 and this is the one that you'd probably know it for mostly,

951
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,960
 is when a sheep got a little bit out of the way,

952
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:37,400
 he would take it like this and pull the sheep forward,

953
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,480
 like that.

954
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,760
 Good job, buddy, good job.

955
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:45,540
 Now, not yank, not hurt, but a gentle connection

956
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:48,040
 to pull the sheep back to him.

957
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,280
 So the staff not only brought the sheep

958
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,400
 and connected them to the sheep,

959
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,720
 but it also brought the sheep towards the shepherd.

960
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:59,480
 And so when David says the staff is a comfort to us,

961
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,720
 he's talking about the fact that we can react

962
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,240
 and relate to one another,

963
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,020
 and the fact that we can relate and react

964
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,360
 and be intimate with God.

965
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,680
 Where the rod was a symbol of power and authority

966
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:14,200
 and strength, the staff is a symbol of intimacy and love.

967
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,800
 So let me summarize all this with this.

968
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:23,680
 God and his presence is what transforms you.

969
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,560
 The single most important thing David wants you to know

970
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,440
 when you're in the valley of the shadow of death

971
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,560
 is that it is his presence that transforms us,

972
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,080
 transforms you.

973
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,440
 And I want you to take this,

974
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,640
 'cause this is really important.

975
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:39,820
 He does not say that he will transform your circumstances.

976
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:42,280
 In fact, God is not interested per se

977
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,080
 in transforming your circumstances.

978
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,480
 What he's interested in is transforming you.

979
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:52,180
 Because if he can make you fear no evil,

980
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,640
 no matter what you go through in life,

981
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:59,240
 he will make you a fiery, passionate, non-anxious presence

982
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,840
 in the chaos of this world.

983
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,960
 And there is nothing greater than that.

984
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,120
 His desire is to change you

985
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,920
 more than his desire is to change your circumstances.

986
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,600
 And let me finish by saying this.

987
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,260
 Some of you need to stop asking God

988
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:16,160
 to change your circumstances

989
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,240
 when God is using your circumstances to change you.

990
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,080
 For those six hours with my dad,

991
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:27,680
 I prayed a lot for God to relieve my dad and relieve me,

992
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,880
 and it didn't happen.

993
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,120
 I prayed for God to change my circumstances,

994
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,200
 and it didn't happen.

995
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,680
 And I was bitter about that for months,

996
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,000
 until God showed up and said,

997
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,920
 "I changed your dad 'cause he's now in glory.

998
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,980
 And I changed you,

999
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:47,240
 'cause you're now that much stronger in me."

1000
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:52,400
 May you know a God who loves and transforms you,

1001
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,460
 and may you not allow the darkness to overcome you.

1002
00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:00,440
 I wonder if you'd stand with me, I'd love to pray for you.

1003
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:08,880
 Father, we're just grateful that we have a God

1004
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,760
 who doesn't hold back on us,

1005
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,000
 who doesn't try to paint a rosy picture

1006
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
 and ignore the big elephant in the room.

1007
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,680
 A God who is willing to say,

1008
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,040
 "Green pastures and dark valleys exist together,

1009
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,160
 at least in this time before the return of Christ."

1010
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:30,240
 Father, I thank you that there are things

1011
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,520
 that we can only know about you in the green pastures,

1012
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:35,160
 and things we can only know about you

1013
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,520
 in the darkest of valleys.

1014
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:39,440
 Lord, people in this room,

1015
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,420
 some of them are going through

1016
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:42,720
 the darkest of valley right now.

1017
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,440
 Lord, I wanna pray that they would know you are here.

1018
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,480
 I wanna pray right now.

1019
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,560
 If that's for you, just open your hands as I'm praying.

1020
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,640
 I wanna release this over you today,

1021
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:56,400
 so that you leave here filled with hope and expectation.

1022
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,560
 I'm not promising you today a change in your circumstances.

1023
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,320
 I'm not promising you that you're suddenly

1024
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,880
 gonna get out of the valley that you feel you're in.

1025
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,920
 God, what I will promise you

1026
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,120
 is that God is leading you through the valley.

1027
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,880
 What I will promise you is that you're not alone.

1028
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,080
 What I will promise you is that you have the word of God,

1029
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,840
 the blood of Christ, and the church standing on your behalf.

1030
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:19,480
 What I will promise you is that you have the spirit of God

1031
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:22,280
 working on behalf of you to draw you in intimacy

1032
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,960
 with the people around you, with your community group,

1033
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,480
 with your family, and here with him as well.

1034
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:33,360
 I will promise you transformation for yourself,

1035
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,720
 if not transformation for your circumstances.

1036
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,060
 Lord, I pray that you would root us as non-anxious presence

1037
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:42,000
 in the chaos of our city.

1038
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,520
 Lord, I pray that we would know you

1039
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,560
 as a shepherd in this way.

1040
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,520
 (gentle music)

1041
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,680
 And I pray too, Lord.

1042
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:54,040
 I pray too, Lord, that you would,

1043
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:59,360
 you would be a God that we honor.

1044
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:04,620
 I just confess, Lord, that I have not honored you always

1045
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:06,000
 in the seasons of my life.

1046
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,440
 I confess, Lord, that I have not always honored you

1047
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,280
 in the dark valleys.

1048
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,160
 And I pray now, Lord, for all of us here,

1049
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,120
 for the Vine Church, for those online

1050
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,280
 and those in this room.

1051
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,760
 Lord, we're sorry if we haven't honored you at times

1052
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,700
 in the dark valleys.

1053
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,240
 Lord, would you forgive us?

1054
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,560
 I know you do forgive us.

1055
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:30,040
 Lord, would you scoop us up on that staff of yours,

1056
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:34,400
 the Holy Spirit, and would you bring us close to you again?

1057
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,920
 And Lord, we thank you for this.

1058
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,280
 We'll encourage you not to rush.

1059
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,280
 We're gonna continue to worship now,

1060
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,160
 and we'll close the service in just a minute.

1061
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,360
 But I wanna allow this space

1062
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,560
 for the Spirit to minister to you.

1063
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:51,040
 So maybe just keep your hands open where you are.

1064
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,720
 Maybe just allow the Holy Spirit to continue to come.

1065
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,040
 We've got a prayer team as well,

1066
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,240
 and the prayer team are gonna be available

1067
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:02,320
 for you to receive personal prayer, if you would like that.

1068
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:06,840
 But as the worship team come and just sing over us again,

1069
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:07,800
 take this time.

1070
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:11,320
 The Holy Spirit is here so beautifully with you.

1071
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:15,240
 Don't rush the time to just connect with Him.

1072
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,340
 We thank you for this.

1073
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:26,340
