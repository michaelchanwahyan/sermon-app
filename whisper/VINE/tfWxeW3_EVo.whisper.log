[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   Thank you, Francesca. Can we put our hands together for Francesca?
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.600]   [applause]
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.600]   And happy Chinese New Year, everyone.
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.600]   I know, once a year today, I finally look like Chinese.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.600]   [laughter]
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.600]   That's what I was told.
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.000]   But good. How's the holiday so far?
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   Are you doing okay?
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   - Yes. - Yes.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Rest enough? Or is it...
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   I'm not going to ask all the parents here, I know.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   I've had that as well.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   Have you been eating a lot of, like, Chinese New Year food so far?
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   A lot of food?
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Have you been receiving a lot of red packet laixi?
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   No, no, no, you're not the ones.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Those who got a lot are all inside right now.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   So probably those people here around this room,
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   we are the ones who have been busy giving out red packets.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   Oh, not yet? Okay, not yet.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Good for you, good for you.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   So my generation, when we grew up,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   I think we were very privileged.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   My generation is that we receive a lot of red packets
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   because my parents' generation, they have a lot of siblings.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   So on average, my parents' generation,
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   they would have four or five or six or seven,
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   eight, nine, ten, like brothers and sisters.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   And so every Chinese New Year, when we go to do this,
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   like, "Gong hei, gong hei,"
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   and we will receive a lot of red packets.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   And that's what we really enjoy.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   That's what we look forward to every year.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   But then as we grew older and older,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   well, I would say the value of red packet kind of like,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   it start to fade away.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   I'm not talking about inflation.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   I'm not talking about the buying power of money, not that.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   But especially as we start to work,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   as we start to have our own income,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   the value of the red packet you get,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   it start to diminish.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   But what start to become more and more important,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   it's actually time spent together with our loved ones, right?
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Time like just having a dinner or having a meal together,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   just talking to each other,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   like seeing how each other is doing.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   These are the things that really matter to us in Chinese New Year.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   And we call that togetherness.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   That's the thing we enjoy most in festival like this,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   being together, right?
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   And here's a picture of my family with my grandma.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   It was taken three days ago.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   It was such a precious moment for us.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Oh, actually, Megan and Mabel,
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   they're wearing the exact same outfit today again.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   But this picture was just taken three days ago.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   It was a very precious moment for me
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   because just a little bit more than a month ago,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   my grandma was actually hospitalized.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   And not just that, she was in such a bad condition.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   When I arrived in the hospital,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   I thought I was going to lose her.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   It was so bad that all my aunts and uncles and relatives,
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   my cousins from all around the world,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   they all flew back within two days.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   That's how bad it was.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Everybody thought we were going to lose her.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   And so my aunts, my uncles,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   they flew in from Canada, from the UK, from New Zealand.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Everybody just came back to be there.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   It's such a bittersweet moment
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   because every day at the visiting hours of the hospitals,
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   you see my entire family sitting outside the ward.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   We're there having a family gathering outside.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Togetherness.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   I never grew up seeing all my cousins at once.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   That was the very first time.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   We cherish that.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   This togetherness, this moment where we could spend together.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   If I would say, I remember standing at my grandma's bed,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   holding her hand, just me and her,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   and I was praying, "God, this is not how I'm going to lose her.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   "She's going to die at a good old age in Jesus' name.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   "She's not going to pass like that."
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   I remember I was praying very hard.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Having this picture, three days ago,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   she was completely fine in her house.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   We were there just to eat porridge with her.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   I was like, "That's a prayer answered."
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   And I give praise to God for that.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   (applause)
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   And so togetherness,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   it's no doubt one of the quite high up--
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   it's quite high up on the money can't buy list.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   It's important for us.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   The reason is simple, because togetherness,
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   it's a fundamental aspect of human nature.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Psychologists, they do a lot of research, a lot of studies,
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   and all this research, they indicate that we humans
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   were inherently social beings.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   We need to spend time with one another.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   We crave this togetherness.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   And feelings of loneliness, or being alone, or being isolated,
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   it actually impacts our physical and even mental health.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   It's bad for us.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   And the research says it has a greater risk
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   than smoking every day when we're alone,
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   when we're lonely or isolated.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   The sense of belonging or the sense of connection,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   it fuels motivation and enhances our overall life satisfaction.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   So there's this guy, his name is Abraham Maslow.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   He is a specialist in human behavioral psychology.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   He has come up with what we now call a hierarchy of needs,
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   and it's on the screen here behind me right now.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   As you can see, besides all these very basic physiological needs
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   like food, sleep, water, oxygen,
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   and then the next level, what we need is security,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   our safety needs, and then our love and belonging needs.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   And you will find a lot of these, a majority of our love and belonging needs
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   in relationships, in our togetherness.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   And even our security, in our basic safety needs,
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   you can find it through relationships as well.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   You see this togetherness, this togetherness, this relationship,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   it's how we survive, it's what we need for survival.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   And this is something very interesting,
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   and this is something we think about, we're grateful for
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   in times like this, like Chinese New Year.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   And in fact, not only psychologists, they will tell you
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   that togetherness is important to human beings.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   If you ask one of the authors of the Bible,
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   they will actually tell you the same thing.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Not drawing from tons of research, but they drew from revelation.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   More specifically, revelation from the very being that created you and me,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   God himself.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   They will tell you how togetherness, how being together,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   how being in a community is important for us as God's people,
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   as God's creation.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   And for instance, in the account of creation, in the book of Genesis,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   it recorded God says this, God looked at Adam,
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   when he first created Adam, he looked at him and said,
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   "It is not good for the man to be alone."
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   And so he created Eve as his companion.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   And scriptures go on to say things like, "Two are better than one."
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Or even in the New Testament, it states things like,
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   "Do not give up meeting together.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Don't give up on spending time with one another."
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Scripture goes on and on and on to tell us we are social beings.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   We need to be in community.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   We need togetherness.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   We need to be with one another.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   And we've read some--oh, okay, maybe it's not on the screen.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   But we've read some of these writings from scripture
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   that's more logical, more instructional.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   It tells us what to do about how God sees this togetherness.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   But there are also people in the Bible like David.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   These are artists at heart.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   And if you ask him, "Oh, what do you think about this togetherness?"
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   He will answer you in a very poetic way.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Indeed, David actually wrote a psalm about it,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   and that's what we're going to read today.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   So we're going to read Psalm 133.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   It says this, "How good and pleasant it is
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   when God's people live together in unity."
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Or in the original language, it even says,
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   "Look, behold, see how good and pleasant it is
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   when God's people are living in perfect harmony, in unity."
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   And then he tells us this,
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   "It is like precious oil poured on the head,
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   running down the beard."
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Sorry, I don't have that. Matt, you can...
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   Yeah, yeah, he's there.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   "Running down the beard, running down the beard of Aaron,
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   down on the collar of his robe.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   It is as if the dew of Hermon were falling on Mount Zion.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   For there the Lord bestows His blessing, even life forevermore."
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   This is just three short and beautiful verses.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   Oh, by the way, I was telling my friends in seminary,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   like we always talk to each other, I told you that.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   We would tell each other, oh, what we're going to preach,
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   like this coming week.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   I told them, yeah, I'm going to speak on Psalm 133.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   And they said, "Three verses only?"
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   I said, yeah, but two weeks ago I preached on 1 Thessalonians.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   I also just preached on three verses, and I managed to overrun.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   So I said, yeah, let's just stick with three verses, shall we?
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   So these three beautiful verses, it's very simple,
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   but they are rich in imagery.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Drawing from the history and the geography of Israel.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   In this psalm, David mainly uses two similes or metaphors
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   to describe what the unity of God's people look like or even feel like.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   He compares the togetherness of God's people to two objects,
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   oil and dew.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   But not just any random oil or any random dew.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   He was very specific.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   So why don't we talk about this oil first?
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   So David says this oil is precious,
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   which probably means it's quite expensive,
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   and that would be rightly so.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   It is indeed the anointing oil of Aaron,
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   brother of Moses, the first high priest of Israel.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   Last week we witnessed the commissioning of Pastor June,
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   who was there, like Pastor June's commissioning, we were there,
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   and we had all this prayer time.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   We have all the wonderful time, like Pastor Tim, Pastor Andrew,
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   Pastor Ivan, they all prayed for her, said something.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   But one of the very significant things we did, or Pastor Tim did,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   was actually he took out this little bottle of anointing oil,
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   and he anointed Pastor June on her forehead.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   This is a symbol of that commissioning.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   It's a gesture saying that now she is set apart for what God has for her.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   She is set apart for God's calling, for God's purpose,
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   and that it's a symbol of God's selection, of God's empowerment,
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   and of God's presence.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   This is a very important moment for Pastor June last week.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   It's a very important moment for Aaron when he became the high priest.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   It's a moment that is sacred.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   It says, God says, "Now I'm going to set you apart.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   You're going to be consecrated.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   Now you're going to walk in the path that I've prepared for you.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   Now you're going to do the things I called you to do.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   Now you are special.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   You are set apart just like God is holy.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   He is set apart."
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   And so this is the anointing process.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   In the Old Testament, we see that whenever a king or a prophet or a priest,
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   when they--before they begin their office, before they start their work,
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   first they have to be anointed.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   And nowadays, when we address Jesus, we always address him as Jesus Christ.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   And fun fact, Christ is actually not his last name.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   It's his title.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   Yeah, his name is--okay, Mr. Christ--no, he's not Mr. Christ anyway.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   It's his title.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   And that title means--or it translates the Old Testament word "Messiah,"
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   which you may have heard of, which literally means "the anointed one."
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   So Jesus, he is the ultimate anointed one.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   But we are also called as we walk into our callings,
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   as we go into what God calls us to do, we are also anointed,
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   just as the Bible says.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   So this anointing, or when an individual is anointed,
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   establish, equips, and empowers an individual
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   with the necessary authority to lead or to serve God's people.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   And of course, you may have heard about this,
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   this anointing oil, or this oil in the Bible,
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   throughout it always symbolizes the Holy Spirit.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   So the act of anointing symbolizes the coming upon of the Holy Spirit.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   And if you remember what Jesus said to his disciples in Acts 1,
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   he said, "You will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you."
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   So through the act of anointing, the individual receives authority
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   and power to carry out the work he or she is called to do,
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   the empowerment, the authority from the Holy Spirit.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   So when here, coming back here to this passage,
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   when David was trying to describe in this psalm that the communal harmony,
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   this unity when God's people live together,
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   this is a sign of consecration.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   This is a sign of the dedication of God's people to serving God,
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   to witnessing in this world.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   It is through which we receive a spiritual authority and power.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   When God's people, as we come together in unity, that's the sign.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   That's our anointing moment.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   That's the moment when we said we as a community,
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   we are set apart to do whatever God calls us to do here.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   That's the evidence that we're anointed to do it.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   When we read about calling and empowerment of God
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   or from God in scriptures,
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   nowadays in the modern day reading, as modern day readers,
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   we tend to interpret it in a very individualistic way.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   Oh yes, God's calling for me, my vision, my calling,
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   my ministry, my work.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   We always focus on the individual, we focus on ourselves.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   But you know, even sports player, even like those who play team sports,
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   I don't know who play team sports here, like football, basketball,
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   if you play team sports, even team sports player understand this one simple truth,
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   that when we come together, we become something more.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   That when we come together as a team,
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   a team in itself it's greater than the sum of all the players adding together.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   We become something more when we are together.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   And perhaps we do need to change our language even in church.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   Maybe instead of saying, you know, God calls me,
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   we could say God is calling us as a community.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   Maybe we should say God is empowering us as his people.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   Together we are set apart and together we receive our spiritual authority
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   and power to do the work of the kingdom.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   Can I get an amen for that?
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   It's a corporate calling, we do it together.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   We're not alone and we're not just thinking about ourselves.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   But that's just a function of the anointing oil.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   What makes the oil so precious, so costly or even so identifiable,
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   even when you're miles away?
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   It's probably the fragrance.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   It smells really good, the anointing oil.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   They put some special spice and there's a special recipe
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   and that makes it so costly, so expensive, but also wow, it smells amazing.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   It's like perfume.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   And here David is saying, you know, the unity of God's people,
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   it gives off this very nice smell.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   It's so identifiable.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   I can tell from far away, I could notice it and people would even enjoy it.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   This fragrance, it's actually attractive.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   It's a good thing.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   Unity is attractive, it should be attractive.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   What kind of family would you want to be a part of?
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   Would you want to be a part of a family that quarrels every day?
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   Or would you want to be one that file lawsuits against each other?
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   Or would you want to be one where families would support one another,
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   they would show up when their family needs them,
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   they would genuinely care for the well-being of each other?
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   This is the kind of family that we want to be a part of.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   We have this desire, this craving for togetherness, for love and belonging.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   That's what we want.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   And so we're born with a need for security.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   We're born with a need for love and belonging.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   We were created for community.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   And unity or harmony will always be a fragrance to us if we're mentally healthy.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   I know there are people, well, they'd rather be alone,
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   they're going through things, but if we're mentally healthy, we're stable,
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   that's what we crave for, community, unity, harmony.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   The unity of God's people, it should be attractive to people around us.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   It should be attractive to men and it should be pleasing to God.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   In fact, it is pleasing to God.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   That's why David says this harmony, this unity, it's like this anointing oil,
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   this precious, costly anointing oil is giving out this fragrance.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   It's an aroma, sweet aroma to God.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   And Jesus even says, you know what?
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   Unity among you guys, you guys loving one another,
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   that's how the world will recognize you as my disciples.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   It gives off this vibe, it lets people recognize who we are
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   when we start to love one another, when we start to live in unity.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   And this oil is being poured out over Aaron's head
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   and is running down his head, his beard, his robe.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   It is abundant and it is overflowing.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   And this is what God wants to do in this church community, I believe.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   What he desires, what God desires is the unity of his spirit flowing
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   in the body of Christ here in the Vine Yuen Long
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   so that we will walk as a community, confidently as his chosen people,
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   full of his spirit and carrying his authority and power
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   to serve the city around us.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   I believe that's what God wants.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   He wants that fragrant anointing of the Holy Spirit to flow over us
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   as we come together in unity so we're ready to do what he calls us to do.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   And so this is a beautiful picture David is trying to paint for us here.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   But he didn't just stop here with the anointing oil.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   Instead, he carries on to use another image to describe the unity of God's people.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   He says, "It is as if the dew of Hermon were falling on Mount Zion."
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   Here, this image is connected to the geographical features of Israel.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   So let me explain with--oh, map is not here.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   But let me explain this.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   Mount Hermon and Mount Zion are two different mountains in Israel.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   One is in the north.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   Mount Hermon is in the north and it's also the highest mountain in the entire Israel.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   It is a place where there are a lot of moisture.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   There will be precipitation into snow or water or even thick moisture.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   And on the other hand, we have Mount Zion.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   Mount Zion is located right in Jerusalem.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   It's a place--it's a lower place and it's a very dry place.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   And so when David says, "The dew of Mount Hermon," the moisture,
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   "is falling on Mount Zion," it talks about this refreshment.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   It talks about this nourishment coming from another place,
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   from the high place of Israel down to this low mountain where the temple is,
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   where Jerusalem is, and it becomes a refreshment to the people there.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   It becomes a refreshment to all that lives in that area.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   It talks about the abundance of God.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   It talks about the blessings of God.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   You know, unity should look like that.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   If we understand what these two mountains, they represent,
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   this high mountain and this low one, how the dew flow,
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   how that moisture just flow down from this mountain to this,
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   and you will see that what David wants to tell us
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   is that the unity of God's people, it should be like a plentiful source
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   of life-giving moisture that it enriches and revitalizes the community.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   That's how it flows down all the way to our community.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   And love and unity within the community of believers,
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   the togetherness, it will transform even barrenness.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   It will transform all the dry places in our hearts, in our lives.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   It will transform and brings beauty.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   It will bring abundance.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   It will bring fertility to our lives.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   If you think I'm feeling very dry right now,
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   I'm not achieving anything right now, or I'm feeling I'm so lonely right now,
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   being in that community, that's how God flows His blessing into our lives
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   so that we could be transformed, so that we could really flourish,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   so that we could become part of a true Christian community.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   And also, one of these mountains, Mount Hermon,
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   it's in the north of Israel.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   It's near the border of Lebanon.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   And this one, Mount Zion, is in the south of Israel.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   So when these blessings or this moisture flows all the way from the north
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   to the south, it also symbolizes people in different places,
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   they come together, they bless one another.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   David is trying to describe a very beautiful picture of the geography of Israel,
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   trying to tell us what refreshment, what flourishing,
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   actually means in a community of God's people.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   Yesterday, our CG met for Chinese New Year gathering,
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   and it was beautiful.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   We are always very grateful for Derek and Dorothy for hosting us.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   It's wonderful.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   But Derek also led us into a beautiful time of reflection
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   and a time of sharing, just counting God's blessings in us
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   through our church community.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   And so I just sat there, and I was listening to my small group members.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   I'm not going to say what they told us, but I was just sitting there listening,
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   and I was like, "Wow."
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   Without mentioning their names, I'll just recap a little bit.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   One of us said it was such a blessing when something happens in our families
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   or in their families, there is actually someone they could immediately pick up
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   their phones and message and say, "Hey, please pray for us.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   We're going through this right now."
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   It's such a blessing.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   And some of us talk about how we could grow in this community
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   by actively picking up some roles at church to serve
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   and how we can grow in a faith, in a relationship with God.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   And some of us said how we found community.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   Yeah, I've been in some other places, but it doesn't feel right.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   Oh, yeah, this place just feels right.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   Just feel that connection.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   And as I was listening to all this sharing, I'm like, "Wow, this is that blessing
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   flowing in God's community."
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   That's what we're talking about.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   That's what David is talking about here.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   Yeah, surely there are ups and downs in our journeys.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   Surely there are different things going on, but being in a community
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   when we're dry like Mount Zion, we can see there is still moisture.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   There is still dew.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   There is still blessings flowing all the way from Mount Hermon into our lives.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   And I'm wondering today if you are Mount Zion church, where is your Mount Hermon?
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   Where are the people where blessings would flow into your life?
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   Who are those people in your life? Where are they?
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   Do you get to see them regularly?
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   Do you get to spend time with them?
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   Do you get to receive that blessing from them?
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   Or maybe sometimes you are Mount Hermon and they are Mount Zion,
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   like blessings flow through the other way.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   And that's important for us.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   The dew symbolizes the blessings of God as we had talked about.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   And there's more to this beauty picture.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   The comparison of unity with the dew of Hermon points to the fact that
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   there is true unity here. It's like any good gifts.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   You see, this dew, they fall from heaven.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   That's how Jewish people or ancient people understand where moisture,
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   where rain comes from. The source is always from heaven.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   So this dew of Hermon is like a heavenly source of blessing coming down.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   It's like any other good gifts. They are all from above.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   They are all bestowed rather than contrived.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   We cannot work hard for it. It's a blessing rather than achievement.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   So what David is telling us is that when we as God's people,
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   when we gather together in unity, there is something not achieved by our human effort,
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   not just by us doing harder, not just by us trying to be nicer,
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   but there's a spiritual blessing from God, from heaven,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   that will fall first onto this Mount Hermon and flow into our lives on Mount Zion.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   This talks about the source of blessing.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   The source of blessing is always God. It's not our human effort.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   Even unity, unity is from God. It's not from a human effort.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   And you think, "What are you talking about, Chapman?
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   If I need to be in unity with those people, I need to do something,
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   I have to behave, I have to say nice things,
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   if I don't like them, I just shut up.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   I have to make an effort to be in unity with other people."
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   Yeah, you may be right, but let me give us another perspective.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   Indeed, it's not from me. It's from this late German theologian, Copenhaver.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   We talk about him from time to time.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   This is what he wrote in his book, "Live Together."
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   He says this, "Christian community is not a human ideal,
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   but a divine reality created by God in Christ."
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   All right, I know, "What are you talking about? Let me unpack this."
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   What he means is that Christian community is not something
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   that we could achieve by our human effort,
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   but rather it's a gift we should receive with a thankfulness.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   Why? I know that question.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   So he would go on to explain that Christian community exists
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   only through and in Jesus Christ.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   Okay, stay with me for a moment. I'm going to explain this.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   So the simplest way to put this, I have a relationship with Jesus
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   because what He has done for me on the cross,
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   He died for me, He has forgiven me,
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   now I could build a relationship with Jesus.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   And because of what Jesus has done for you, what Jesus has done for you,
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   what Jesus has done for you, you, you, you, you, you,
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   you all build a relationship with Jesus.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   And here in church, in this Christian community,
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   I come here because of what Jesus has done,
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   so I come here kind of like through Jesus.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   You come here because of what Jesus has done for you
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   and you accepted it, you come through Jesus.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   So today if I want to come to you, Francesca,
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   I am coming to you through Jesus as well.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   Because without Jesus, this community, this relationship
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   wouldn't exist in the first place.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   Yeah, maybe we can be friends, maybe you have friends outside of church,
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   but in a real Christian community, in a community of faith,
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   our relationship, they only exist through Jesus.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   I can't be your brother in Christ if it's not through Jesus.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   I can't be your brother in Christ if it wasn't for Jesus.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   So all relationships happening in this place,
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   unless you want to keep it secular, you want to keep it out of God's hands,
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   otherwise all the relationships we have here,
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   our Christian community, it only exists through Jesus Christ.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   Are you following? Yes.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   Right, that's quite simple, right?
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   All right, so this is what he wants to talk about.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   That's why spiritual or Christian community,
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   it's not by human effort.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   It's not about, okay, if I read the Bible more,
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   if I sing louder in worship, if I come to church more diligently, okay,
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   and then I think, I guess, I read the Bible, I try to do whatever Jesus said,
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   maybe we could be friends?
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   No, no, no, it doesn't work that way.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   It's not by human effort.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   These relationships exist only because of Jesus.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   It's a divine reality.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   God has paid for it. God has done it all.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   We come to each other through Jesus only.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   This relationship between us, between me and you,
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   it's entirely dependent on our relationship with Jesus.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   And so we can only experience the dew of Hermon,
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   the refreshment and the abundance in this community
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   because of what Jesus has done for us.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   And this community exists, or it doesn't exist, without Jesus.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   It doesn't exist just based on how hard we try,
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   or try to be nice and try to say all the right things.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   No, it doesn't work that way.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   That's why it should be received as a gift with gratitude.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   Jesus, I thank you. You made this possible for us,
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   that I could have people, that I could call brothers and sisters in my life.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   They're my family.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   And we could love each other as any physical, biological family would.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   That's something different.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   And it's also because it is based on what Jesus has already done on the cross
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   and not by our own human efforts.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   This community is not human ideal and you cannot undo this.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   It's not shaped by what we want.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   This church community is not shaped by, you know, oh, I like this.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   Oh, yeah, I like to talk like this.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   Oh, we should do that.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   It's not shaped by our ideals, our desires.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   It's shaped by Jesus and what he has done.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   And so this is a spiritual reality that is established by God
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   and therefore nobody can destroy this.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   There will always be a church in this world because of what Jesus has done.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   If we are willing, we could join him.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   We could be a part of it with a heart of gratitude
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   and we could learn to go to each other,
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   build this relationship with each other through Jesus.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   And if we could understand the depth of the reality of these two pictures,
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   you know, this Mount Hermon and Mount Zion and that anointing of Aaron,
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   if we understand the reality presented by these pictures,
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   then perhaps we would understand why David in the first verse,
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   he says how good and pleasant it is when God's people live together in unity.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   It is good because this community is set apart,
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   because it's consecrated for God's purpose.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   It is functioning exactly the way,
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   or it should be functioning exactly the way God has designed and created it to be.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   Just like in Genesis 1, when God created the entire world
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   and he looked at everything, everything was running just as he has designed
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   and he looked at his creation, he says, "This is good."
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   It is the way it's supposed to be.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   When we could come together through Jesus
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   and we could put aside all those hurts, all those differences,
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   all those personalities or preferences or perspectives,
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   we could put all those aside in Jesus
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   and try to have a relationship with one another.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   When our relationship is the way that it was supposed to be,
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   how God designed it, created it to be,
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   and we can look at this relationship and say, "This is good."
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   And it is pleasant because of this fragrance.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   When God's people come together, this unity, it's attractive.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   When there's this fragrance and people's lives start to flourish
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   because how we are supporting each other, we're loving on each other,
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   we're refreshed, there's an overflowing of blessing in the community.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   It brings joy, it heals brokenness, and it lifts people up.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   When we see that, we would say, "Wow, this place, it's pleasant.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   It's such a pleasure to be in this community.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   It's such a pleasure to come here."
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   People thought going to church on Sunday is work.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   You know, you have to sacrifice something, you sacrifice your holiday.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   No, no, no, I'm telling you, it's pleasant.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   It's a pleasure to be here.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   If you know what I'm experiencing with my brothers and sisters
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   every week here in this building, you would know it is good, it is pleasant,
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   and I want to be here.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   It's attractive.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   And church, this is the kind of community that we are called to be.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   This is the kind of community that David, he's describing here.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   Anointing oil, the Mountain Dew, pun intended.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   Like, just be together and have the sweetness, this fragrance in our lives.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   This is what he wants for us.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   But I know reality sometimes look a little bit different.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   Like I said, we have our personalities, we have our preferences,
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   we have our perspectives, and then relationships start to fall apart,
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   and we're all broken people inside, hurt people, hurt people.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   You understand what I mean?
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   Like if we're hurt, we tend to hurt other people as well.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   We've seen communities being broken down, even church communities.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   So what should we do?
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   In fact, before the sermon, during worship, we've done something so significant.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   If we know the true meaning to it, if we keep practicing that,
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   that's God's antidote to all these brokenness in the world
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   that will lead us back into true and genuine community.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   And that's the communion you just--you had just taken.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   You know, in order to enter into a communion,
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   you have to come to Jesus recognizing that what the cup and the bread represents.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   It represents forgiveness of sin.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   So as you approach, as we approach communion,
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   we're coming here with a heart of confession.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   I'm saying, "God, I'm so sorry for what I did, and I'm here to receive your forgiveness."
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   And sometimes we thought about communion as this is just something between you and God, you and God,
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   but God is very clear.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   If you want to come and worship me, you want to bring a gift to me, bring an offering to me,
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   but there's something wrong between you and the other brother, go fix it first.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   Go and confess. Go and forgive.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   So that when you're in right relationship, we can be in right relationship as well.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   The practice of confession and forgiveness,
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   it's key to being in this kind of community where broken people can actually be together.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   That's something we have to practice.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   All you married couples, you understand this.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   In order for your marriage to even last for more than five days,
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   you need forgiveness and confession.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   Maybe five days is too long, I know.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   And this is what we are called to.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   We should be building a community, a space where we feel safe to confess,
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   and we could be brave to forgive.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   We should be building a community that we feel safe to confess,
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   and that we could be brave to forgive.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   That's what we are called to.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   I was talking to one of the members here in our church who is fairly new here.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   So I was just asking her, "Hey, what do you feel about our community?"
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   Surprisingly, she told me that she spoke to different people in church.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   She felt, "Wow, people here are really open about their own personal journeys
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   or their ups and downs in life.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   It's openness, honesty, vulnerability.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   It can be witnessed by talking to a few different people."
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   I remember I started explaining to her how this happened.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   Apparently, you ever heard Pastor Andrew preach last week.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   He is very open and vulnerable.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   Pastor John, you've met him multiple times.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   He is a father figure to a lot of us.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   If you know like either me or Tim, Pastor Tim,
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   we have all been through ups and downs in our lives.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   When we entered this community, we were completely accepted for who we are.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   We're still completely accepted and encouraged to do what God has called us to do.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   This kind of acceptance gives us a safe space to confess, to be who we really are.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   It gives us that grace to be brave to forgive as well
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   because we are also forgiven in this community.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   How good, how pleasant it is when the people of God live together in harmony, in unity.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   We cannot take that for granted.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   Without confession, without forgiveness, we will never experience that.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   In this new year, in a time of Chinese New Year,
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   where we celebrate this togetherness,
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   where we celebrate unity in our biological families or maybe across extended families,
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   today I pray that we would extend this desire for togetherness,
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   for unity into our spiritual family as well.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   And we all come before God and said, "God, teach us. It's not just me.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   God, I don't just want to see a vision for myself.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   I want to see the vision for our community, for our church.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   God, I don't just want to hear the calling for myself.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   I want to hear the calling for my community, for my church."
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   And perhaps you can start looking for either the Mount Hermans in your life
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   or the Mount Saints in your life.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   Where are those people where blessings would flow either through them to me or from me to them?
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   Who are those people around me that I should be spending regular time with?
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   And let's build a space together where we will feel safe to confess
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   and where we can be brave to forgive.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   Shall we pray?
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   (Silence)
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   Father, I thank you for all of us in this room who have had the experience of being lifted up in a community.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   Who knows what spiritual friendships actually look like.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   Who knows what connecting with a brother or sister in Christ through Christ look like.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   Father, I pray that in this new year all these relationships through you in this church will start to grow.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   We'll start to build more of these kind of relationships in this community.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   I pray that our unity will be like the anointing oil of Aaron.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   I pray that it would overflow in this community.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   I pray that even people in Yuen Long when they see us, when they hear about us,
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   they will recognize us because of our unity, because of our togetherness.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   I pray that blessings will start to flow around this community
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   as we come together and allow your blessings to flow in our lives.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   Father, we need to come before you and know that we're accepted
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   in order for us to be brave to accept others, accept ourselves, and start to forgive.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   So Holy Spirit, I pray that you would come not just to empower us,
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   but also to heal us, to fill us, to pour out the love of Father on us
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   so that we could together build a community that is good and pleasant.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   I thank you, Jesus. Thank you for what you have done to make this possible.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   In your name we pray.
