[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300]   Lord, we thank you for this in Jesus' name.
[00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.320]   Everybody says, amen.
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.760]   Can we thank our team?
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.840]   Wonderful.
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.680]   Have a seat, have a seat.
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.120]   Say hi to somebody, say hi to someone.
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.320]   Hi to everybody in the overflow.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.480]   It's great to have you with us as well.
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.600]   Welcome to us.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.480]   And so good to see you.
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.960]   Anybody online, it's great to have you two with us.
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.640]   We are so glad you're here.
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.480]   How's everybody doing?
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.640]   You're right?
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.440]   We are in week two of our Exodus series here at the Vine,
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.240]   and we're studying the book over Exodus over the next
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.520]   six months or so.
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.400]   And this week, we actually get into the text itself.
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.680]   This week, we find ourselves right at the beginning
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.040]   of Exodus chapter one.
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.280]   And this week, we're also unveiling for you
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.340]   a couple of tools that we've created in this series
[00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.480]   so that you can really dive deep into Exodus.
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.240]   You see, for us, our heart is is that Exodus
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.160]   is not just a sermon series that you come to.
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.160]   Exodus is a book that you study yourself
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.440]   over these next six weeks, next six months.
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.320]   And we want you to find yourself opening the pages
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.000]   of scripture during the week.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.760]   We want you to be thinking and reflecting
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.860]   about the things that we speak about on Sunday.
[00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.280]   But more than that, we want you in the text itself.
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.840]   And I feel like if all you do in the series
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.800]   is come on Sunday and listen to me or other preachers
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.360]   unpack a text, that's one thing.
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.200]   But if you're then diving into the scriptures yourself,
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.000]   if you're then asking God for Exodus yourself,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.920]   if you're opening the word during the week
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.880]   and saying, God, I need this, this is a reality of my life,
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.620]   I can tell that I've got some slavery that I'm a sin to,
[00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.720]   that I'm broken and holding back from,
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.560]   and Lord, I want freedom myself, and I'm opening the pages,
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.660]   and I'm grateful that I get what I get on Sundays,
[00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.780]   but that's not enough for me.
[00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.220]   I want the scriptures to come alive for me.
[00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.560]   - Yeah.
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.820]   (laughing)
[00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.920]   - Oh, we got some ways to go.
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.960]   That's good.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.120]   So we've created a couple of tools to help you
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.480]   to get into the word.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.160]   First of all, I want you to know this series is structured,
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.840]   I told you last week is 24 weeks.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.760]   We're gonna structure it in two segments of 12 weeks each.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.880]   So between now and the end of June is part one.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.600]   Part two will begin at the end of August,
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.160]   and we'll go all the way to the middle of November.
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.600]   There'll be a break for the summer
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.200]   for about six weeks or so in July and most of August.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.680]   But we're breaking it up in two big blocks.
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.960]   Now, one thing that I also said last week
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.960]   is that the whole book of Exodus
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.600]   is structured around five movements.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.680]   That's the way it's written.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.780]   It's written in these five movements.
[00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.860]   It's also the way that we believe that all Exodus
[00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.740]   from any slavery into freedom happens in our lives
[00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.440]   through these five movements.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.920]   God uses them today,
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.200]   just like he did for the Israelites back then.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.680]   And those five movements, as we talked about last week,
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.120]   are slavery, promise, liberation, identity, and home.
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.000]   And so we've structured this whole sermon series
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.180]   around those five movements.
[00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.040]   So we want you to be able to track every single week,
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.940]   where are we in the book of Exodus?
[00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.280]   Like what passage are we in?
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.100]   We also want you to be able to track with these five things
[00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.760]   to help you to know how we're progressing
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.600]   through that journey.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.280]   So in order to do that, we've created a tool.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.560]   We've actually made a bookmark for you
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.280]   that you can either put in your physical Bible,
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.240]   or you can put in another book,
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.560]   or you can stick it on your fridge.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.340]   The bookmark looks like this.
[00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.980]   That's the front and the back of it.
[00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.860]   And what you'll see, every single week,
[00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.000]   it has the date of that Sunday.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.160]   It has the topic that we're speaking about,
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.480]   but most importantly, it's got the passage of scripture
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.760]   we're preaching from or looking at as a church
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.960]   on that Sunday, so that in preparation, you can pray,
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.820]   you can read that passage for yourself.
[00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.920]   You can come on a Sunday already soaking in the word of God.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.160]   And what you'll notice here is we've got the five movements,
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.980]   slavery, promise, liberation, identity, and home.
[00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.480]   So again, you're able to track through the whole series.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.800]   So if you miss a couple of weeks
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.000]   and you're coming back to the vine,
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.140]   maybe you're away for business or whatever, or holiday,
[00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.160]   you come back, you might be like,
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.580]   "Where are we in the story?"
[00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.500]   Well, you've got this.
[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.040]   It'll tell you exactly where you are.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.500]   It'll tell you what passage we're in,
[00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.100]   and it will tell you which movement we're a part of.
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.400]   Is that helpful?
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.400]   You will get that next week.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.740]   Yeah, babies.
[00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.900]   You gotta come back for that piece.
[00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:04.980]   You gotta come back for that one.
[00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.620]   We're gonna hand that one out to you guys this week.
[00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.900]   But we do actually have something
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.620]   for you to take home this week,
[00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.300]   and I'm really excited about this.
[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.860]   Again, our heart in this series
[00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.780]   is not just that you hear something on a Sunday,
[00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.780]   but you'll begin to study Scripture yourself.
[00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.500]   And so one of the ways that we've done that,
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.580]   our creative team have done an amazing job.
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.700]   We have created a coffee table book for you on Exodus,
[00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.900]   and particularly Exodus part one,
[00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.900]   between now and the end of June.
[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.780]   What this is is a beautiful book
[00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.720]   filled with incredible images and resource.
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.240]   Some of the stuff that we took ourselves
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.620]   as part of the filming, others that we have licensed.
[00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.580]   But what's most important in this
[00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.580]   is that every chapter is a devotion that we've written
[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.060]   that connects to a specific passage
[00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.700]   that we're preaching that week.
[00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.360]   So the whole point of this
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.980]   is that we want you to come on Sunday,
[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.200]   hear what's said on Sunday,
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.340]   but then we want you to go away
[00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.700]   and read a deeper reflection
[00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.300]   on what we spoke about on Sunday in your own time.
[00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.940]   These are written in a way
[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.400]   that you can't do this in five minutes.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.180]   This is not a brush your teeth devotion.
[00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.380]   This is a 15 to 20 minute,
[00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.700]   read it, pray about it, soak in it,
[00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.340]   which is why we've made it a book.
[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.580]   It's something that you can keep at home,
[00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.020]   put in your living room, put by your bed,
[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.820]   whatever you wanna do, and utilize it that way.
[00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.240]   These devotions have been written
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.740]   by one of our congregation members.
[00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.220]   His name is Chris Webster.
[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.740]   He comes to our 2 p.m. service.
[00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.460]   He is a phenomenal writer, theologian, and thinker.
[00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.880]   And his reflections, he wrote,
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.500]   I actually reached out to him four years ago.
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.620]   I'm like, "We're gonna do this crazy thing
[00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:33.860]   "called the Exodus project.
[00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:34.700]   "We're gonna do this whole thing.
[00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:35.520]   "We're gonna make films.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.920]   "I'd love you to write a devotion
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.100]   "for every single week of the series."
[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.060]   And so he went away.
[00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.920]   He was very grateful that we delayed, by the way,
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.220]   so he could keep writing.
[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.420]   And he went away and he wrote all the devotions,
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.560]   and he wrote them without knowing
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.640]   what I was gonna say on a Sunday.
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.320]   So it sits completely separate to what I'm gonna teach you,
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.300]   which is why it's a beautiful compliment for you.
[00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.540]   And here's the amazing thing.
[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.460]   You get to take one of these home today, okay?
[00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.500]   We have one of these for every single person here,
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.800]   and it's completely free.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.880]   Yes, completely free for you.
[00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:09.980]   You know, one of the things that we realize
[00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:10.820]   here at The Vine,
[00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.500]   we're a broad socioeconomic demographic here,
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.220]   and we don't want anyone to miss out on this resource
[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.660]   if you can't afford it.
[00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.840]   So we decided to give it away for free.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.780]   There is a catch, though, two catches.
[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.480]   Number one, we only have enough
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.220]   for physically everybody across our three services.
[00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.660]   So what I do not wanna see after the service
[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.800]   is you walking away with 20 copies like this,
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.660]   'cause you wanna give it to your friends and family
[00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.160]   who don't come to The Vine, okay?
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.420]   This is for us here at The Vine.
[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.180]   We got enough copies for every single one of you
[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.020]   to take a copy, but please do not take more
[00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.860]   than just your own personal copy this week.
[00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.620]   If we have any left over at the end of this week,
[00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.220]   we will make them available next week,
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.600]   and you can take as many as you want next week, okay?
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.060]   But for a starting point, just one today, is that okay?
[00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.020]   Here's the second little catch.
[00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.360]   Although I say it's free, and it is,
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.460]   if you would like to make a donation towards its cost,
[00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:05.660]   we would be very helpful,
[00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.300]   and that would be very good for us.
[00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.060]   So we're suggesting $100 donation for this
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:10.900]   if you would like to.
[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.900]   You don't have to, again, hear my words.
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.980]   Please take it home for free, okay?
[00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.460]   But if you are able to, and you'd like to give 100,
[00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.820]   or maybe more than that,
[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.500]   to help with the cover of the printing of it,
[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.340]   we would love for you to do that.
[00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:22.460]   You're gonna get this.
[00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.500]   It's gonna be on the second floor after the service
[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.380]   in the upper house.
[00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.460]   Hey, everybody in the upper house, you get a copy as well.
[00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.200]   Just come down the stairs after the service,
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.900]   and you can grab it from the lobby here.
[00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:31.760]   You don't need to rush.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.540]   There's enough available for everybody.
[00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:34.580]   Is that awesome?
[00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.580]   - Yes. - All right, all right.
[00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:40.700]   So, now, there's another reason
[00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.160]   why we've made you this amazing resource
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.420]   that we wanted to generously give to you today,
[00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:45.700]   because it actually connects
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.620]   to what the starting point of Exodus,
[00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:49.780]   the book of Exodus, is all about,
[00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.560]   because the cultural and contextual backdrop
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.700]   to the first verses in Exodus
[00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.180]   is the idea of abundant blessings
[00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.300]   that have been handed and given out.
[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.300]   The book of Exodus begins right off the back
[00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.300]   of the narrative from the book of Genesis.
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.120]   There's no break.
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.220]   They flow from one to the next.
[00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:08.860]   And what we see right at the end of Genesis
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.660]   is something that has happened to Joseph,
[00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:13.460]   Joseph, the 11th son of Jacob,
[00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.100]   Jacob, who's the grandson of Abraham.
[00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:17.380]   And we see right at the end of Genesis
[00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:22.380]   that Joseph is sold into slavery by his own brothers,
[00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:25.380]   and he is trafficked to Egypt.
[00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:28.400]   And although his circumstance is a terrible beginning,
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.460]   God's favor and honor is on Joseph.
[00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:34.660]   And whilst Joseph is there, Pharaoh has a dream.
[00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:37.240]   And Pharaoh's dream is very disturbing to him.
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.980]   And he asked for his own court,
[00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:42.080]   magicians and astrologers to interpret the dream.
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.700]   No one can interpret the dream.
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.260]   And somebody says, "There's a Hebrew in our land
[00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.120]   who has been able to interpret other dreams
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:48.960]   for other people.
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.260]   He might be able to interpret for you."
[00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.000]   So Pharaoh calls Joseph to him,
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.980]   and Joseph interprets the dream through the power of God.
[00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:56.760]   And in the dream, Joseph sees
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.180]   that what God is saying to Pharaoh
[00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.060]   is that there is a time coming of abundance
[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.260]   and a time coming of famine.
[00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:03.800]   And Joseph basically says to Pharaoh,
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.580]   "Hey, we need to start storing up food now
[00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:07.840]   in the time of abundance,
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.260]   because the time of famine is coming.
[00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.380]   And if we don't have those resources available,
[00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.140]   then we're gonna really suffer in famine."
[00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:17.280]   Well, Pharaoh agrees, believes in Joseph.
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.340]   In fact, he actually empowers him
[00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:23.540]   to become the number two person in power over all of Egypt,
[00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.420]   in particular, over the land of Egypt.
[00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:28.100]   And so Joseph goes and he builds storehouses.
[00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.580]   He begins to take the grain.
[00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:30.820]   He stores it there.
[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.820]   And when the famine years come,
[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.460]   the nations around Egypt are really suffering.
[00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:38.860]   Famine hits hard, and it hits the people of Egypt hard too.
[00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.740]   But because of Joseph's insight, his wisdom,
[00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:42.800]   and his hard work,
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.460]   there is the abundance available for Egypt.
[00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:49.700]   Now, at this time, Joseph then goes to Pharaoh.
[00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.340]   And he says, "Look, my family,"
[00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:54.500]   talking about his father, Jacob, and his remaining family.
[00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:58.040]   At that time, there was about 70 people in Jacob's family.
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.300]   Joseph goes to Pharaoh and says,
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.580]   "Can I bring Jacob to Egypt?
[00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.580]   Can I bring him here as a refuge?"
[00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.940]   'Cause this land has an abundance right now.
[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.140]   And basically, Pharaoh,
[00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:08.340]   because of all the incredible things
[00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:10.460]   that Joseph had done for him, Pharaoh agrees.
[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:11.460]   And at that point,
[00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.140]   Jacob and his family are able to travel to Egypt.
[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:15.700]   Now, I'm gonna show you a map.
[00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.480]   This is a modern map of Egypt.
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.280]   We're gonna use this map a lot throughout our series.
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:24.540]   It is a modern map rather than one in the ancient times,
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:25.700]   but that's because it connects
[00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.320]   to a lot of what we're gonna be teaching for us.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.860]   This area up here roughly was Canaan
[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:33.880]   at the time of the beginning of the book of Exodus.
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.380]   The modern day Israel wasn't yet boundaried like this.
[00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:39.480]   They lived in this area up here.
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.280]   And so it was from there that Jacob
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.900]   and his 70 people would travel.
[00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.560]   Now, this is Cairo, the modern day city of Cairo.
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.400]   This is the Sinai Peninsula
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:50.200]   where a lot of the Exodus narrative takes place.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.060]   This is Mount Sinai right about down in here.
[00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:56.920]   Now, very importantly, when Jacob and his family comes,
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.640]   right around about here is a land called Goshen.
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.160]   In fact, we've got another map here
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.500]   that makes that clear to you.
[00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:06.080]   This area right here became known in the Bible as Goshen.
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.400]   And Goshen was the area that Pharaoh gave to the Israelites
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.720]   to be able to settle in.
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.240]   And this is where Jacob came.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:16.680]   This is where Joseph would have spent time as well.
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.360]   And this is where the Israelites
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.700]   were able to take refuge during famine.
[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.240]   They were able to receive the food
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.440]   that had been prepared for them.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:27.520]   And this is the starting point of Exodus chapter one.
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.280]   We're now gonna start our journey.
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.000]   Are you excited?
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.440]   All right, here we go.
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.700]   Exodus one, verse one.
[00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:36.440]   These are the names of the sons of Israel
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:39.080]   who went to Egypt with Jacob, each with his family.
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.800]   Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.800]   Iscah, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.960]   Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Esher.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.560]   The descendants of Jacob numbered 70 in all,
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.540]   and Joseph was already in Egypt.
[00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:53.920]   Now Joseph and all his brothers
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.740]   and all the generations died.
[00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.680]   But the Israelites were fruitful and multiplied greatly
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.760]   and became exceedingly numerous
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:04.140]   so that the land was filled with them.
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.000]   Now I said last week that one of the things
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   the author of Exodus, Moses,
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.400]   who also authored Genesis, the same person,
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:15.320]   he's writing the book of Exodus using language and imagery
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:18.040]   that connects to the Genesis creation event
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.040]   of Genesis one, two, and three.
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.160]   And right here at the start of the book of Exodus,
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.720]   we see a great example of this.
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.040]   I wanna read to you verse seven once again.
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.280]   It says, "But the Israelites were fruitful
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:31.520]   "and multiplied greatly and became exceedingly numerous
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.560]   "so that the land was filled with them."
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:37.560]   The words that Moses is choosing here are very specific
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:41.380]   'cause he's linking what the starting point is for Israel
[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:45.520]   at the beginning of Exodus to the call that humanity had
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.960]   in Genesis chapter one and the call and the blessing
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.620]   that God gave humanity.
[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:53.640]   Let me show you Genesis 1, 28, which also Moses wrote.
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:54.900]   "God blessed them and said to them,
[00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:57.120]   "be fruitful and increase in number,
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.720]   "fill the earth and subdue it,
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.840]   "rule over the fish of the sea, the birds of the air,
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:03.500]   "over every living creature that moves on the ground."
[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.720]   So exactly what Moses is doing here
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.260]   is he's saying at the beginning of the Exodus narrative,
[00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.320]   there is this connection to the beginning
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.400]   of God's call on humanity where God said,
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.500]   "I'm gonna bless you.
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:15.540]   "I'm gonna bless humanity, male, female,
[00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.360]   "I've created you, you're made in my image
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.540]   "and you're gonna be a blessing.
[00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:19.920]   "And here's the blessing,
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.360]   "you're gonna be able to multiply,
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.800]   "you're gonna be prosperous,
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.360]   "you're gonna be able to fill the earth."
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.600]   And so when Moses starts Exodus, he says,
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.140]   "You need to know that my people are in a blessing.
[00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:31.380]   "You need to know where they are.
[00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:33.300]   "They're in this place where they're receiving
[00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.200]   "a great blessing from Egypt.
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.200]   "This place is abundant blessing to us.
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.800]   "And in that, we're living out the call of humanity
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.340]   "right in this land."
[00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:45.120]   Now we know what happens next in the story.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.520]   We know that slavery comes.
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.960]   But it's really interesting that Moses,
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.760]   before he tells us about that,
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:53.480]   he starts with the Genesis 1 and 2 picture.
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.800]   In other words, it's like, almost like Moses is saying,
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:59.780]   "Our time in Egypt for 380 years before slavery happened
[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.440]   "was like our garden of Eden.
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.020]   "It was an abundant place.
[00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:05.360]   "We had favor there.
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.160]   "Pharaoh liked us.
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:08.820]   "There was a beautiful environment."
[00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:11.700]   Now, yes, that turns into Genesis 3.
[00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.540]   That turns into the slavery that's to come.
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:14.800]   But the starting point is good.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:18.340]   And some of you resonate with this in this room.
[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:19.480]   The journey that there is
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.460]   between sometimes something starting well
[00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:23.300]   and ending up really bad.
[00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:25.120]   Some of you in here, it's like a relationship.
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.040]   It started so well, but it's turned bitter,
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.000]   and it's painful now.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.980]   For some of you here, it's like a job.
[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:34.040]   The job started great.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.120]   You loved it at the start.
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.180]   It was a great blessing to you.
[00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:38.560]   But now you've become bitter, and it's annoying,
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.920]   and you hate it, and you wanna do something else.
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:45.400]   It's interesting how fickle the human experience is.
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.880]   And Moses wants to pick up on that right at the start
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.560]   and say, "Know that there was blessing.
[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:50.920]   "Know that there was favor.
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:55.920]   "But it's so easy for that favor to change in a heartbeat."
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:01.540]   Now, at this point, all we have is Moses' word
[00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:04.360]   that this happened to Israel and happened to Egypt.
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.980]   But what actual evidence is there?
[00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:11.380]   I mean, before we look at anything else in the Exodus story,
[00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:12.980]   surely we have to start by saying,
[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:15.440]   "This is actual historical truth.
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.300]   "We need to know that this is not just
[00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.940]   "some fairy tale myth, but it actually sits
[00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.760]   "in some actual historical truth."
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.100]   We're not gonna just take Moses' word for it.
[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.580]   What is there in Egypt itself today
[00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:30.720]   that helps us to understand that this is the reality
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.580]   for God's people, that this actually took place?
[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:34.020]   Well, here's an amazing thing.
[00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:36.440]   When I started researching this whole project for Exodus,
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.620]   and I was researching about the evidence that exists,
[00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:41.460]   I discovered a really interesting thing.
[00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:45.940]   There's hardly any evidence in Egypt
[00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:48.260]   that Israel even lived there,
[00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.400]   let alone that the Exodus happened.
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.980]   There's very, very, very little evidence at all.
[00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:56.560]   And that should concern us.
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:57.740]   Because what is this thing then?
[00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:01.340]   Is this book just some story that's been made up?
[00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:05.460]   Or does it root itself in actual archeological evidence
[00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:08.980]   and actual historical events?
[00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:10.720]   Well, to answer that question,
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.420]   let me take you now back to Egypt.
[00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.140]   (dramatic music)
[00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:36.420]   The first thing you need to know about the Exodus
[00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:38.740]   is that it's more than just an event.
[00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:41.580]   In fact, it's perhaps the most significant demonstration
[00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:43.620]   that we have in all of our scriptures
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:46.780]   of God's dealing on a daily basis with humanity,
[00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:49.540]   of his power and control over nations,
[00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:51.860]   and of course, his ability to literally change
[00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:53.700]   the course of history.
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:57.340]   But the Exodus is more than just old history.
[00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:59.660]   It's also alive still today.
[00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:01.900]   I mean, it's celebrated regularly by Jews
[00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:05.540]   at the Passover every year, and by Christians at Easter.
[00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.160]   But perhaps more than that,
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.300]   the Exodus has become a metaphor for revolution,
[00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:12.180]   for those of oppression
[00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:14.580]   to the social injustices of the world.
[00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:18.260]   I mean, from Mahatma Gandhi, from Martin Luther King Jr.,
[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.980]   from Bob Marley, all of them have evoked
[00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:22.740]   the imagery of the Exodus,
[00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:26.960]   and have spoken about Moses' cry, "To let my people go."
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:36.400]   All of which is fascinating
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:38.860]   when you consider one sobering fact.
[00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:41.740]   There's actually very little archeological evidence
[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:43.820]   that Israel was ever in Egypt,
[00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:46.660]   let alone that the Exodus actually happened.
[00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:50.500]   I mean, could it be that the Exodus is some fairy tale myth
[00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:53.340]   invented by religious leaders to teach us a moral
[00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:56.580]   about good versus evil, oppression versus freedom?
[00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:59.420]   I mean, could it be that we've been believing a lie,
[00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:02.460]   albeit a very inspiring and motivating one?
[00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.620]   Well, to begin to answer that question,
[00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:12.380]   I've come here to Beni Hassan,
[00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.780]   a small village just south of modern-day Minya
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.580]   in Middle Egypt, to a series of remote tombs
[00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:19.260]   that are cut into the hillside
[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.500]   to uncover perhaps the only physical proof
[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.900]   there is in this whole country of Semitic people
[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:27.660]   arriving in the land of Egypt itself.
[00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:31.100]   This is a breathtaking place to bury your dead.
[00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:32.580]   The people buried here are actually
[00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.580]   from the elite class of nomachs.
[00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:36.140]   They were provisional governors here
[00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.420]   in the Middle Kingdom period,
[00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.940]   about 4,500 years ago.
[00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:42.460]   Now, there are 39 tombs here in Beni Hassan,
[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:44.300]   and each one of them has an outer court,
[00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:46.300]   an inner pillared room, and then a shaft
[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:48.740]   that leads down to the burial chambers.
[00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:50.220]   But we haven't come all this way
[00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:52.540]   for me to show you things that are dead and buried.
[00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:54.700]   Today, we've come here so I can show you something
[00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:56.740]   that is still very much alive.
[00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:06.700]   These tombs are covered from floor to ceiling
[00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:09.740]   in vibrant, beautiful, living art.
[00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:12.140]   The paintings here depict everyday scenes
[00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:14.660]   of the common life of this area at the time,
[00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:17.500]   as well as stories about their history and livelihood,
[00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.420]   their homes, and their culture.
[00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:23.060]   Standing in the tomb here, I really get a sense
[00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:25.060]   of the sheer scale of this place,
[00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:27.740]   which is why it's a little bit boomy and echoey.
[00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:30.740]   But when you look at the beauty in the art here,
[00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.980]   it amazes me 'cause it tells me something
[00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:35.260]   about the culture of this people,
[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:38.300]   that at the end of their lives, when they bury themselves,
[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:41.420]   they want to be surrounded with story.
[00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:43.780]   They want the future generations to come here
[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:47.100]   and not learn about how they died, but how they lived.
[00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:49.420]   They wanted to tell them about their experiences
[00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:52.300]   and help them to get to know them personally.
[00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:53.740]   I mean, this blows my mind.
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:55.540]   I mean, us in the West, when we die,
[00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:58.700]   we just erect a tombstone with a couple of words on it.
[00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:02.060]   But in this culture, they wanted to really communicate
[00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:05.220]   the heart of who they were to the future generations.
[00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:09.620]   And as a storyteller myself, this truly just inspires me.
[00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:12.500]   And it's actually amongst all of this storytelling
[00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:15.180]   that our Exodus journey truly begins.
[00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:21.860]   This might be a small section
[00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:23.940]   of the overall paintings in these tombs,
[00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:27.300]   but its significance to us cannot be overstated.
[00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:29.980]   What you see here are figures wearing a fashion
[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:32.020]   that is completely different to any other people
[00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:33.620]   depicted in these tombs.
[00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.380]   Their upper bodies are covered,
[00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:39.140]   and their clothes are of a striped red and spotted nature.
[00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:42.140]   This was the clothing of the Semitic people of the time.
[00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:45.860]   And the scene here depicts a story of Asiatic migrants
[00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:49.500]   arriving in Egypt with the hopes of starting a new life,
[00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:52.940]   making this the only recorded history we have
[00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:55.860]   in the whole of Egypt of the arriving presence
[00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:58.700]   of a Semitic people in this land.
[00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:00.580]   From religious fairy tale myth
[00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:02.900]   to recorded historical evidence,
[00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:05.740]   these tombs tell us a story we all need to hear.
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.700]   God's people did indeed come to this land.
[00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.900]   But the question remains, did they actually settle?
[00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:13.260]   Well, to answer that question,
[00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.740]   I need to take you about 200 miles north
[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:18.140]   to a land that the Bible calls Goshen.
[00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:20.900]   (dramatic music)
[00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:40.500]   These fields behind me here may not look like much,
[00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.100]   but hidden underneath them
[00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:45.220]   is some of the most significant archeological evidence
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:48.540]   for the existence of God's people here in Egypt.
[00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:51.700]   This area around me is known as Goshen.
[00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:54.220]   It's found actually in Genesis 47,
[00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:56.940]   as well as in Exodus chapters eight and nine.
[00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:59.860]   And Goshen is the very place where God's people lived
[00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:03.800]   for the 480 years that they were here present in Egypt.
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:06.380]   Now, unfortunately, much of that evidence
[00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:08.380]   is still under the ground here.
[00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:09.640]   But there is one place,
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.860]   not too far from where I'm standing right now,
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:13.540]   where they've been able to excavate.
[00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:16.620]   And what they found there is truly significant.
[00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:18.900]   Unfortunately, it's not a public place,
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:21.060]   so I wasn't able to get in there and film,
[00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:23.020]   but we were given some footage.
[00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:25.180]   And that footage reveals to us
[00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:27.660]   what it would have been like for God's people
[00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:28.960]   to live in this land.
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:32.300]   These pictures and artist renderings
[00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:34.180]   show what is essentially the site
[00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:36.620]   of an ancient home here in Avaris.
[00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:40.060]   In the excavation, you can clearly see various rooms,
[00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:41.060]   as well as the walls
[00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:43.340]   and the general structure of the house as a whole.
[00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:45.820]   Now, the form of the house is not in the style
[00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:48.620]   of Egyptian homes in the time of the Exodus,
[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:51.940]   but it's actually North Syrian in its form and construct,
[00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:55.340]   the area that the patriarchs were originally from.
[00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:57.380]   This particular house has become known
[00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:58.820]   as the House of Jacob,
[00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:01.380]   and archeologists have found something fascinating
[00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:03.060]   in the garden surrounding it,
[00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:06.060]   a portico with 12 pillars.
[00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:09.180]   Is this coincidence, or is it further evidence
[00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:11.900]   of the presence of the settlement of a Jewish people
[00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:13.700]   celebrating in their architecture
[00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:16.380]   the 12 tribes of their generation?
[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:26.880]   Either way, the home that is being discovered
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.000]   not too far from where I'm standing right now
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.100]   proves to us something beyond the shadow of a doubt.
[00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:34.280]   You see, Beni Hassan showed us
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:36.780]   that a Semitic people arrived in Egypt.
[00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:39.580]   The House of Jacob shows us that they settled here.
[00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:42.340]   (dramatic music)
[00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:57.020]   - It's a really important thing
[00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:59.620]   that we can base the story of Exodus
[00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:03.220]   in actual recorded history for us.
[00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:04.740]   But as I said earlier,
[00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:07.020]   sometimes the fate and the blessings of somebody
[00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:08.660]   can change in a heartbeat.
[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:11.700]   And as is so often the case when a immigrant group
[00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:15.100]   grows to prominence and power within a nation,
[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:18.300]   the majority group of that nation can often fear
[00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:21.340]   and respond in tragedy and evil.
[00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:23.180]   And that's exactly what we see happen here.
[00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:24.980]   Let me read on from verse eight.
[00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:27.740]   Then a new king, and by king, when it's mentioned here,
[00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:29.660]   it's always referring to a pharaoh.
[00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:32.260]   Then a new pharaoh, who did not know about Joseph,
[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:34.060]   came to power in Egypt.
[00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:35.560]   "Look," he said to his people,
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.300]   "the Israelites have become much too numerous for us.
[00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:40.820]   "Come, we must deal shrewdly with them,
[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:42.620]   "or they will become even more numerous.
[00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:44.620]   "And if war breaks out, we'll join our enemies
[00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:46.620]   "and fight against us and leave the country."
[00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:48.220]   The pharaoh begins to freak out,
[00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:51.180]   that this pharaoh has no connection to the Jewish people.
[00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:54.420]   He has no connection to the pharaohs of the past
[00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:57.820]   who were influenced by Joseph and his wise decision-making.
[00:24:57.820 --> 00:24:58.960]   He has no connection.
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:02.860]   It's been over three generations have passed
[00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:04.860]   as this person now comes into power.
[00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:06.780]   And because he's got none of that connection,
[00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:08.580]   he just sees this Israelite group
[00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:10.340]   as a massive group of people
[00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:14.420]   that he knows are not Egyptian, and he fears them.
[00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:15.340]   Now, it's really interesting,
[00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:17.740]   'cause Moses uses a specific word in verse 10
[00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:18.740]   to describe this.
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:20.900]   He says, "Come, we must deal," this is pharaoh speaking,
[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.540]   "Come, we must deal shrewdly with them."
[00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:27.020]   That's exactly the same word that's found in Genesis three,
[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:29.700]   when Moses writes about Satan as a snake.
[00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:33.380]   He says the snake was more shrewd or crafty
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:35.020]   than any of the other animals.
[00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:36.580]   Remember, this is still Moses writing.
[00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:39.700]   He takes that same word that he applies to Satan,
[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:42.620]   and he puts it right on pharaoh straight away.
[00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:44.780]   And basically what he's saying here is pharaoh
[00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:48.900]   is in this narrative going to be like for us the snake.
[00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.180]   He's going to be the one
[00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:52.180]   who is gonna have influence over us,
[00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:54.360]   and he's the one that's gonna make decisions
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.420]   that are of the enemy, not of God.
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:02.420]   And Moses wants us to understand the satanic influence,
[00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:06.980]   the evil that sits behind all the things
[00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:08.300]   that pharaoh does next.
[00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:09.700]   Let me read it to you from verse 11.
[00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:11.740]   So they put slave masses over them
[00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:13.780]   to oppress them with forced labor.
[00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:16.940]   They built Pithom and Ramesses as store cities for pharaoh.
[00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:18.980]   But the more that they were oppressed,
[00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:20.640]   the more they multiplied and spread.
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:23.380]   So the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites
[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:26.820]   and worked them ruthlessly.
[00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:28.940]   They made their lives bitter with hard labor
[00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:32.020]   in brick and mortar, and with all kinds of work in the fields
[00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:33.700]   and in all their hard labor,
[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:36.360]   the Egyptians used them ruthlessly.
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:40.340]   There's this power that comes from Egypt on Israel.
[00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:42.380]   They're thrown into slavery,
[00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:44.860]   and that slavery is painful, it's hard,
[00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:47.420]   and it's in the totality of who they are.
[00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:50.440]   Now, I want you to see something really important here.
[00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:55.280]   What Moses is trying to communicate to us as we read this
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:58.700]   is a simple starting point of slavery.
[00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:00.620]   He's trying to help us to understand
[00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:02.820]   that there is a key starting point
[00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:05.380]   that happens so often in slavery,
[00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:08.840]   and that's the starting point of insecurity.
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:14.740]   You see, Pharaoh here acts insecurely before his people.
[00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:18.020]   He looks at this migrant group who've grown to a big size,
[00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:20.900]   and they've never done anything to make Pharaoh
[00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:22.800]   think that they're gonna rebel against him,
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.500]   but he's so afraid of that,
[00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:27.300]   and in his own insecurities of losing control
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:29.060]   and losing his own power,
[00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:31.300]   he decides to suppress them
[00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.940]   in order to make sure that he would increase.
[00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:36.660]   And what you need to know is that insecurity
[00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:40.540]   is so often the primary brokenness
[00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:44.580]   that actually enslaves and oppresses other people.
[00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:46.260]   Say that again.
[00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:48.500]   Insecurity is primarily, often,
[00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.820]   so often the primary brokenness
[00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:53.500]   that is the driving factor
[00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:56.300]   that would enable people to be enslaved and oppressed.
[00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.960]   That's what insecurity does.
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:01.140]   And Moses is trying to get us to know this
[00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:03.580]   because actually throughout the whole Exodus journey,
[00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:05.020]   you're gonna see time and time again
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:07.380]   the issue of insecurity rising up
[00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:10.220]   and then the issue of needing to deal with it before God.
[00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:12.620]   This is why one of the movements
[00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:16.460]   of the five movements of Exodus is all about identity,
[00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:18.580]   because when our identity is broken,
[00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:20.780]   we operate out of a place of insecurity.
[00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:24.140]   And insecurity happens because we look at ourselves
[00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:27.380]   and we look at others and we make comparisons between them
[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:30.080]   and we make assumptions between them.
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:32.160]   And you'll recognize in your own life
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:35.480]   that your insecurities will always tempt you
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:39.060]   to suppress others in order to elevate yourself.
[00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:41.400]   Are you guys with me?
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.640]   And if that's the case,
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:44.640]   here's the key that Moses is giving us
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:45.760]   right at the start of the story.
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:48.240]   He's saying, if there's one thing that you could do
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:51.040]   to align yourself to the process of Exodus,
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.960]   if there's one thing you could do to position yourself
[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.920]   for more freedom in your future,
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.200]   it's deal with your insecurities.
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:02.260]   And how do we deal with our insecurities?
[00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:03.820]   We don't deal with them
[00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:06.980]   by trying to become more secure in ourselves.
[00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:08.400]   We don't try to convince ourselves
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:09.860]   that we're actually not as bad as we think.
[00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:11.060]   We don't try to convince ourselves
[00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:12.980]   that we've got power ourselves.
[00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:15.060]   No, what we do, this is what the Bible says,
[00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:17.380]   the only way you free yourself from insecurity
[00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:18.860]   is not finding security in yourself,
[00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:21.060]   but finding more security in God.
[00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:23.940]   By actually looking out of yourself and looking to Him
[00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:25.540]   and saying, I will follow Him,
[00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:27.860]   I will trust Him, I will put my promises,
[00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:29.860]   my life, my faith in Him.
[00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:32.140]   As I find my security in Him,
[00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.840]   I'm able to deal with the insecurities that sit in me.
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:38.900]   See, as we become more secure in Christ
[00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:42.900]   and who we are as His children made in the image of God,
[00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:46.660]   we become less a vehicle of slavery and injustice
[00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:50.180]   and more a vessel of freedom and grace.
[00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:52.060]   That's the journey of Exodus.
[00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:54.260]   And Moses is saying, get that right here,
[00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:55.100]   right at the start.
[00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:58.060]   And I wanna speak that over every person in this room.
[00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:00.340]   If there's one thing I invite you to deal with
[00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:03.860]   over the next 24 weeks is to bring your insecurities to God.
[00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:05.140]   He's got you.
[00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:07.980]   And He, let me say it this way.
[00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:10.820]   There is no other name more powerful than the name of Jesus.
[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:13.340]   We just sang it, but we sing it.
[00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:14.480]   Do we believe it?
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.860]   And if we believe it,
[00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:19.260]   then we're able to move away from our tendency
[00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:22.240]   to enslave and oppress others
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:24.360]   and become more like Christ
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:25.920]   wanting to bring freedom and grace in this world.
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:29.520]   And there's an army rising up
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:31.480]   of people that are willing to do that.
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:35.700]   That, my friends, is an echo of Exodus.
[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.840]   Now, what does this slavery feel like?
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:40.860]   What was it like to be found in slavery in those days?
[00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:42.520]   What was it like to actually be oppressed?
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:45.240]   Was it just a physical thing or was it much more than that?
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:48.860]   And were men and women enslaved in the same way?
[00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:50.260]   Well, to answer those questions,
[00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:52.420]   let me take you back once again to Egypt.
[00:30:52.420 --> 00:31:07.700]   We are introduced to the starting point
[00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:11.820]   of the Exodus narrative in Exodus 1:8-11,
[00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:14.900]   where we learn of a new king who comes to power in Egypt
[00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:17.560]   and immediately places Israel into slavery.
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:20.220]   I mean, literally overnight, their freedoms are gone
[00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:23.100]   and they're suddenly thrust into forced labor,
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:24.820]   constructing storehouses
[00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:27.880]   as well as temples of Pharaoh across the land.
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:34.440]   One such temple is here at Tel Basta,
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:37.780]   some 80 kilometers northeast of modern-day Cairo.
[00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:40.240]   Built for the worship of the feline goddess Bastet
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:42.540]   some 3,500 years ago,
[00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:44.660]   the temple now lays here in ruin
[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:46.540]   but gives us a unique insight
[00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:50.660]   into the kind of slavery the Jewish people were placed under.
[00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:53.420]   Standing here today and being surrounded by all of this
[00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:55.940]   is an incredibly rare privilege.
[00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:59.760]   I mean, these are 3,500-year-old antiquities.
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:02.820]   And being here, I get a great sense of the grandeur
[00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:05.260]   and the size that this temple would have been.
[00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:08.940]   It would have taken thousands of slaves years to construct it.
[00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:11.460]   And take, for example, the granite here.
[00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:13.340]   This granite is not from around here.
[00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:16.780]   It's probably from a quarry about 1,000 kilometers away.
[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:19.620]   So the slaves would have had to have dragged this here
[00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:22.260]   and then shaped and constructed it on site.
[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:24.620]   I mean, that's incredibly backbreaking work
[00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:26.820]   in the harsh climate of this land.
[00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:42.420]   Not only this, but the slaves also would have had
[00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:45.500]   to spend their days carving out idols of gods
[00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:46.940]   that they refused to worship
[00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:49.660]   and worldviews that they refused to accept.
[00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:51.460]   Case in point is seen here.
[00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:53.020]   This is the image of Ka.
[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:55.460]   It's two arms pointed to the heavens,
[00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:59.300]   which in ancient Egyptian religion symbolized the soul.
[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:00.440]   But notice something.
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:02.900]   There's no head and no real body to it.
[00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:04.500]   And that was on purpose,
[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:07.120]   'cause this was communicating that our connection
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:09.920]   of our soul to the gods is devoid
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:12.440]   of any of our personal identity.
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:15.940]   Now, think about the Jewish slaves and their worldview.
[00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:18.860]   They worshiped a god that they saw as a good father,
[00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:23.420]   who they understood created them in the image of their god.
[00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:26.780]   So the idea of kind of taking away the identity
[00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:28.260]   from our worship of God
[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:30.760]   would have been actually deeply offensive to them.
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:36.700]   All of which actually raises a really important point
[00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:38.020]   for each of us to reflect on
[00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:41.840]   as we think about our own journeys from slavery to freedom.
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:44.940]   You see, slavery is never just merely physical.
[00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:47.440]   It involves the whole of who we are.
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:50.700]   The mental, emotional, and social toll on the Israelites
[00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:53.640]   in constructing this temple was just as cruel
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:57.200]   as the physical toll that was required to do it.
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:00.160]   And I think actually that that was the main point.
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:02.060]   You see, in constructing this temple,
[00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:04.060]   it was designed not just to break
[00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:06.140]   the Jewish people's physical backs,
[00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:08.100]   but their spiritual ones as well.
[00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:13.320]   There was one further aspect of slavery
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:15.820]   that was unique to the Israelites here in Egypt
[00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:17.320]   and actually profound for shaping
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:19.420]   the whole of the Exodus itself.
[00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:20.660]   And to tell you about that,
[00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:23.660]   I now need to take us from the temple here in Tel Basta
[00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:26.580]   to the remote turquoise mines of Sinai Peninsula.
[00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:39.060]   The Sinai Peninsula is nicknamed the land of turquoise
[00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:41.340]   by the local Egyptians that live here.
[00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:44.180]   The mining of it dates back to the first dynasty
[00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:46.360]   when Egyptians sourced it from the coastal mines
[00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:48.240]   and mountains of this area.
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:49.620]   And while much like today,
[00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:52.420]   it was originally used for jewelry and ornaments,
[00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:56.460]   its adoption by many pharaohs created a mythology around it
[00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:59.060]   centered on the idea that the stone was a protector
[00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:01.100]   and bringer of good fortune.
[00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:03.820]   So many Egyptian women wore the stone
[00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:05.320]   in hopes of becoming pregnant
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:07.820]   that the goddess of fertility, Hathor,
[00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:10.900]   was eventually called the mistress of turquoise.
[00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:13.480]   (gentle music)
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:38.080]   The turquoise that is mined in this area
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:39.920]   is some of the purest in the world
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:43.760]   and it really is so vivid and so beautiful.
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:45.960]   But as is often the case in life,
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:48.920]   sometimes the things that are most beautiful on the outside
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:50.700]   are actually distracting us
[00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:52.780]   from the things that are dark within.
[00:35:52.780 --> 00:36:06.460]   This is a small example of the mines
[00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:09.660]   that are found scattered in the mountains in this area.
[00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:13.260]   Now, the actual turquoise itself is mined from the veins
[00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:15.820]   that you can see here in the ceiling and on the walls
[00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:20.000]   and then sent for processing at the plants in this region.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.140]   Now, the earliest evidence suggests
[00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:23.580]   that the mining was done here
[00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:26.980]   by local Sinai inhabitants at the start.
[00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:30.460]   But as the turquoise gained in its popularity and demand,
[00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:33.320]   they needed to ship in some additional labor force.
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:37.080]   So it was here in the hills of Sinai
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:40.140]   that many Jewish slaves were forced to come to work,
[00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:43.420]   spending countless hours in cramp and awkward conditions,
[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:46.000]   often in the dark, digging and excavating
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.100]   for the precious stone that would go on
[00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:50.060]   to adorn the rich and powerful.
[00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:54.680]   And here is what is important about all of that.
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:56.760]   You see, unlike the muscle and brawn
[00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:59.760]   that was needed to construct the temple in Tel Basta,
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:03.040]   the work here in these caves was intricate and detailed
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:04.560]   and very repetitive.
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:08.240]   It was work that was done largely by women.
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:09.480]   I want you to think on this.
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:13.880]   Imagine a thousand enslaved Hebrew women in these caves,
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:17.660]   working day in, day out to mine a precious stone
[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:20.560]   that would go on to be adorned by Egyptian women
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:23.520]   to symbolize their freedom and power.
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:26.380]   And if that wasn't kind of ironic enough,
[00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:29.840]   the actual ancient Egyptian goddess of justice
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:32.820]   came to be symbolized by turquoise.
[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:35.600]   Yeah, the goddess of justice.
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:38.720]   I think for the Jewish women enslaved in these caves
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:43.360]   for hours upon hours, surely turquoise was anything but.
[00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:52.680]   So slavery impacted both men and women alike,
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:55.240]   whether it was in temples or in caves,
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:57.100]   in cities or in deserts,
[00:37:57.100 --> 00:38:00.200]   the Jewish people were placed under a brutal regime
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:03.020]   that impacted their mental, physical, social,
[00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:04.840]   and spiritual lives.
[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:07.000]   Indeed, the oppression was so strong
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.580]   that in order to stop it,
[00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:11.580]   it would require an equal but opposite force
[00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:14.740]   that was so powerful that actually the whole of history
[00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:17.300]   itself turned on its axis.
[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:19.460]   And how did that power begin?
[00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:22.380]   Well, Exodus chapter one introduces us
[00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:25.620]   to two Hebrew unnamed midwives
[00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:28.220]   who have the courage and the audacity
[00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:31.860]   to finally stand up against an empire of injustice
[00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:36.460]   and draw the line in the sand and say enough is enough.
[00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:41.460]   Deliverance so often begins in the most unlikely of places.
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:46.480]   Would you like to meet these two women?
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:47.480]   - Yes. - Yes.
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:49.580]   - Yes.
[00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:56.240]   - Exodus one, starting in verse 15.
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:59.440]   The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.720]   whose name was Shifra and Pua,
[00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:03.960]   when you help the Hebrew women in childbirth
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:05.800]   and observe them on the delivery stool,
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:08.360]   if it's a boy, kill him,
[00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:10.980]   but if it's a girl, let her live.
[00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:13.160]   The midwives, however, feared God
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:16.960]   and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do.
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:20.000]   They let the boys live.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.760]   Just a few verses here that Moses includes,
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:26.800]   but this is the most incredible turning point
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.480]   in this whole story,
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:31.040]   because the very first people that stand up
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:35.140]   against an evil empire and an evil regime are two women,
[00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:39.320]   two women who have the courage
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:41.880]   when Pharaoh has told them to do something,
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:44.040]   and remember, they're slaves,
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:47.680]   so they actually have no choice whether they do it or not.
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:50.480]   They're expected to carry it out.
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:52.800]   They decide that enough is enough
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.840]   and it's time to make a change,
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:56.080]   and Moses, who's writing this,
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:58.340]   it's fascinating to me because Moses was steeped
[00:39:58.340 --> 00:39:59.880]   in the culture of patriarchy.
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:02.640]   He understood the culture of patriarchy
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:06.040]   and the way that men were seen as the movers
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.920]   and the shakers and the change agents,
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:09.680]   and he says, "You need to understand,
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:12.120]   "before I'm even on the scene,
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:16.160]   "the people that really change history are two women,
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:18.600]   "two women that are willing to stand up
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:21.080]   "at a time when they so easily
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:23.580]   "could have just turned a blind eye
[00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:26.480]   "and say, 'This slavery is wrong.'"
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:29.560]   The Bible describes them here as Hebrew midwives.
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:31.920]   Now, the profession of being a midwife,
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:34.960]   midwifery in those days, was incredibly important.
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:38.120]   In fact, in the ancient Near Eastern time,
[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:39.320]   particularly in Egypt,
[00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:41.760]   infant mortality rates were incredibly high,
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:45.320]   so the profession of being a midwife was very respected,
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:47.380]   and often family would put their trust
[00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:49.560]   in a particular midwife to ensure
[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:52.480]   that their child would be delivered alive or not.
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:54.440]   In other words, they saw that the midwives
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:58.960]   held in their hands literally the power of life and death,
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:01.280]   and in Egypt in particular,
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:03.880]   these midwives were deeply revered.
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:06.480]   They were revered because of the superstitious
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:09.920]   and supernatural belief that the Egyptians had
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:13.120]   around life and death and birth and that sort of thing,
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:15.360]   and so they would see these midwives
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:17.780]   as actually very important people within society.
[00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:22.380]   Now, we know that these particular midwives are actually,
[00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:24.980]   'cause they're Hebrew, they would have been slaves.
[00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:26.980]   Now, because Pharaoh deals with them,
[00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:30.000]   it shows both the respect to the role they had,
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.500]   but it was also likely that these two midwives
[00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:36.120]   were midwives within Pharaoh's wider harem,
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:38.900]   probably within his house in particular,
[00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:40.820]   and he says to these two Hebrew women,
[00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:43.240]   "Hey, when the men are delivered,
[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:46.220]   "when you deliver a boy, kill him right there
[00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:47.060]   "and right there."
[00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:47.880]   Now, you might think,
[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:52.780]   "Why would a Hebrew kill another Hebrew in those moments?"
[00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:55.220]   Again, you got to remember, this is slavery.
[00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:56.940]   This is a time when when you're given an order,
[00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:59.080]   you never doubt it, and you do what it says.
[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:02.060]   Not only that, though, history will tell you
[00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:04.300]   that so often when a majority culture
[00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:07.420]   wants to do a genocide on a minority culture,
[00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:11.220]   so often that power will get members of the minority culture
[00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:13.500]   to carry out the genocide itself.
[00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:15.460]   That has happened throughout human history,
[00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:17.900]   and here we see another example of it.
[00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:22.140]   And so Pharaoh expects these two women to act.
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:23.380]   Now, the other interesting thing
[00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:25.200]   about being a midwife in those days
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:28.120]   is that midwives themselves were chosen for that role
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:31.180]   largely because they were infertile and barren.
[00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:33.940]   These are women that weren't able
[00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:36.180]   to bring their own children into the world,
[00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:38.120]   and because of that, they were then selected
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:41.080]   to bring the children of other people into the world.
[00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:43.060]   Now, you can imagine that could either be viewed
[00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:45.720]   as a bit of an embarrassment, a bit of a shame,
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:47.880]   or that could be viewed as a great gift.
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:48.780]   And we don't know what it is
[00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:49.800]   for these two particular women,
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:52.520]   but we do know that they are childless.
[00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:54.680]   We do know that they have no families of their own,
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:57.800]   and we know that there are slaves within Pharaoh's harem,
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:01.080]   and they're responsible for now committing genocide.
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:04.080]   And they decide that this is not what they're gonna do.
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:05.320]   And I want you to see why.
[00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:06.460]   It says here in verse 17,
[00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:09.240]   "The midwives, however, feared God."
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:10.240]   There it is.
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:12.200]   Very simple thing, feared God.
[00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:14.240]   And this fear of God was greater for them
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:16.160]   than the fear of Pharaoh.
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:17.800]   And by fearing God, they're not,
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:19.560]   this word is actually repeated a lot
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:20.600]   throughout the Old Testament.
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:24.000]   It's not about this idea of afraid or scared,
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.720]   but feared God is the idea of reverence and awe
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:30.640]   and worship and respect and humility of saying,
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:31.800]   "God is all-powerful.
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:32.960]   "He is all-holy.
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:35.640]   "We're not, and we need to worship Him,
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:37.600]   "respect Him, be in awe of Him."
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:39.600]   That's the idea of fearing.
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:42.360]   And what Moses tells us here is that these two women
[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:44.920]   who are named Shiphrah and Puah,
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:47.600]   these two women are actually fearing God.
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:49.920]   And because they fear God,
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:52.440]   they're able to take a stand
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:54.800]   against what's happening to their people,
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:55.920]   and they're able to take a stand
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:57.320]   against what they've been told to do,
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:59.000]   which is to do genocide.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.160]   Now, here's the important thing.
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:04.620]   All of this is Moses trying to communicate to us
[00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:06.800]   one really critical piece
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:09.120]   right at the start of the Exodus story.
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:10.080]   He's trying to say,
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:14.000]   no matter how powerful slavery might be,
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.440]   no matter how powerful the force of slavery might be,
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:22.440]   there exists in the world a power that is greater than it.
[00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:25.920]   And that power is the courage
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:29.040]   that comes upon us as humans
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:34.040]   that is fueled and driven by our fear of God.
[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:37.640]   And that courage enables these two women
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:41.280]   to realize that despite how strong slavery was,
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:46.080]   it did not remove the power of their choice.
[00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:47.880]   They still had a choice.
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:52.160]   And their choice was obey Pharaoh's order and live
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:55.180]   or disobey Pharaoh's order and die.
[00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:59.360]   And they choose death to themselves
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:01.720]   so that others might live.
[00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:03.520]   Now, I want you to see why this is really important.
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:04.520]   Note this.
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:07.680]   The Hebrew midwives choose death for themselves
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:09.560]   so that others might live.
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:13.200]   That is the exact opposite of what insecurity does.
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:16.240]   Insecurity ensures a life for yourself
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:18.040]   through the death of others.
[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:19.040]   Are you with me, church?
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:20.160]   Do you follow this?
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:21.680]   And so what Moses is saying is
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:23.760]   there's Pharaoh in insecurity
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:25.600]   who's enslaving the Israelites
[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:27.800]   and calling out for genocide.
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:31.340]   Here's two women who stand up against it
[00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:33.360]   because they decide that they have the courage
[00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:34.800]   in their fear of God,
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:36.520]   that they're saying he is more powerful,
[00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:37.720]   he is more honorable,
[00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:40.000]   I'm gonna listen to him over anything else.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.680]   And they're willing to even sacrifice their own lives
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:44.880]   so that others might live.
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:47.360]   That's the exact opposite of insecurity.
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:50.680]   And Moses is saying, check out the power of these women.
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:53.240]   That when you're willing to stand in the gap
[00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:54.420]   against injustice,
[00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:57.040]   when you're willing to stand in the gap against enslavery,
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:00.080]   when you realize that you still have the power to choose,
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:02.440]   then Exodus happens.
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:05.240]   The beginning of our Exodus story
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:09.760]   is the incredible story of two women
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:13.360]   who make an overtly political decision
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:18.360]   to stand against the political authority of their day
[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:20.080]   and fear God first.
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:23.200]   And that changes everything.
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:28.480]   That literally is the starting point of everything.
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:32.320]   The courage to choose life over death.
[00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:37.320]   And what Moses is asking of everybody reading this,
[00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:38.360]   right at the start of the story,
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:39.520]   it's essentially this,
[00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:41.760]   whom ultimately will you serve?
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:43.640]   Come on church.
[00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:46.480]   Whom ultimately will you serve?
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:47.840]   Will you serve me?
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:48.920]   He's saying, this is God,
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:50.960]   will you serve me or will you serve her?
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:54.280]   Will you serve life or will you serve death?
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:57.560]   Will you serve the things of the flesh in your soul
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:46:59.960]   or the flesh in your sinful nature
[00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:02.920]   or will you serve and fear me and want to please me?
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:05.000]   Which will you choose?
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.600]   He's basically saying.
[00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:08.680]   Because here's two women
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:12.680]   who are under the oppression of slavery from Pharaoh
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:15.040]   and they make a choice for life.
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:17.400]   And then there's us.
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:18.280]   And we have to think,
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:20.920]   are we in such a situation that they're in?
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:22.640]   Like are the choices that we're making ones
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:24.200]   where we could literally die?
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:28.320]   And yet how often do we choose death over life?
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:30.600]   Yet how often do we choose to remain enslaved
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:32.600]   rather than move into life?
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:35.160]   You see, Shifra and Pua teach us
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:37.920]   that we don't have to be passive in the face of evil.
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:40.840]   Shifra and Pua actually teach us
[00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:44.480]   that we don't have to adopt the role of victim in a story.
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:48.120]   Shifra and Pua actually teach us that when we fear God,
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:50.560]   we can find the courage inside of us
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:52.880]   to actually stand against the darkness of our day
[00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:54.400]   and say enough is enough
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:57.840]   and flex the one muscle that always breaks through
[00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:00.040]   and that's the muscle that is no.
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:02.880]   This is enough.
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:04.000]   This is done.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.840]   We are not gonna do what you say.
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:13.200]   And in the beauty of this, Exodus begins.
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:16.400]   And I want you to see what God is doing here.
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:18.160]   And this is so beautiful to me.
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:20.800]   You see, note this.
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:24.600]   The very instruments that Pharaoh had chosen
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:26.720]   to carry out his plans
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:29.920]   became the very instruments that God uses
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:32.520]   to thwart those plans.
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:33.520]   Isn't that powerful?
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:39.360]   Because Pharaoh wanted to use the women to kill the kids.
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:40.280]   That was his desire.
[00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:42.560]   He wanted to use these women to kill the kids,
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:45.080]   to kill the men that were being born.
[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:47.240]   And God steps in and says,
[00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:49.840]   I'm gonna use those very instruments to change the world.
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:51.120]   I'm gonna use those very instruments
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:52.760]   to be the starting point of no.
[00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:54.280]   I'm gonna use those very instruments
[00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:56.200]   to be the beginning point of all that I'm gonna do
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:58.000]   in the rest of the story.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.160]   You see, what Pharaoh wanted to do
[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:03.200]   was bring women under subjugation.
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:06.120]   Notice this, women who are the carers
[00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:09.960]   and the givers of life are chosen by Pharaoh
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:11.400]   to be the destroyers of it.
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:14.200]   And these women say, no, that's not our role.
[00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:15.120]   That's not who we are.
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:16.960]   We are not the destroyers of life.
[00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:19.080]   We're the carers and the givers of life.
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:23.200]   And these two midwives say, we're the deliverers of life.
[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:25.200]   And I want you to see the powerful prophetic thing
[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:26.240]   that's happening here.
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:28.040]   These two women are basically saying,
[00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:31.120]   our role is to deliver life and not death.
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:32.840]   And so right at the start of the story,
[00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:36.960]   you see two women delivering Hebrew children to life.
[00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:39.160]   And this is a prophetic announcement
[00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:41.240]   of what God's gonna do next in the story,
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:45.160]   where he delivers a whole nation from death to life.
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:46.680]   But in the starting point,
[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:49.800]   it's a microcosm on these two women.
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:52.040]   And I think essentially what they're saying is this,
[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:54.280]   hey, we're all midwives.
[00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:57.080]   We're all midwives.
[00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:59.800]   And we might not be delivering children,
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:01.920]   but we are delivering choices.
[00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:06.720]   The most spiritual act you will ever do
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:08.400]   is the act of a choice.
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:11.720]   Right at the end of the Exodus,
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:13.160]   and I'm jumping forward a little bit,
[00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:15.680]   Moses stands before his people and he says,
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:18.200]   today I give you life and death.
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:19.760]   Choose life.
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:22.760]   He says, me and my household, we're gonna choose life.
[00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:24.480]   And I wanna stand before you
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:26.440]   at the beginning of your own Exodus.
[00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:28.160]   As you thought about your departure point last week,
[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:30.440]   and you think about Exodus that's ahead here,
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:31.440]   and I know the stories,
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:32.880]   oh, Angie, if only you understood
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:34.040]   the slavery that you're under.
[00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:35.760]   And here's two women,
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:38.120]   already under the slavery
[00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:40.640]   of a patriarchal society and culture,
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:45.120]   but equally under the slavery of Pharaoh and Egypt,
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:48.800]   who say we still have the power to choose life.
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:51.480]   My prayer for you as you start this journey
[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:54.360]   is that you would find in the fear of God,
[00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:56.280]   in your relationship with Him,
[00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:59.160]   the courage you need to say no
[00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:01.560]   to whatever it is that is enslaving you.
[00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:03.240]   The courage that you need to say,
[00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:04.800]   I'm gonna make better choices.
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:06.920]   The courage that you need to say,
[00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:09.120]   I'm not gonna be tempted by that sin anymore.
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:12.440]   The courage that you need to say no
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:14.760]   where you have been saying yes.
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:17.080]   And as you take that courage,
[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:19.880]   you align yourself to the freedom that comes,
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:22.280]   not with the insecurity that wants to enslave,
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:25.800]   but the fear of God that wants to bring life.
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:28.400]   Can I pray for you guys?
[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:29.280]   Would you stand with me?
[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:30.120]   Let me pray.
[00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:37.880]   Father, I thank you so much for Shifra and Pu'er
[00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:40.120]   and for the legacy they leave behind to us.
[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:43.280]   I thank you so much, Lord,
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:45.440]   for the way in which they live their lives.
[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:48.400]   I thank you that we have,
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:51.800]   in Moses' recounting of their story, their names.
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:57.040]   It's fascinating to me that we never hear the name of Pharaoh
[00:51:57.040 --> 00:51:58.880]   but we are given the name of these two women.
[00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:01.120]   And so for 3,500 years, they've been known.
[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:05.960]   And we know their names because they decided
[00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:10.280]   that they still had a power of choice.
[00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:12.440]   And they were willing to go to their death
[00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:14.280]   so that others might live.
[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:18.160]   They were willing to sacrifice their freedom
[00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:21.160]   so that others might find freedom.
[00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:24.480]   And as Moses brings us to the picture of these women,
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:27.080]   he's really bringing us to the picture of ourselves.
[00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:32.440]   And he's saying, who it is
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:35.800]   that you're ultimately gonna follow, me or Pharaoh?
[00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:40.840]   Are you ultimately gonna think you're a victim?
[00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:44.640]   Or are you gonna realize that because my spirit is in you,
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:49.080]   same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead in you,
[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:53.080]   that together we can work towards freedom
[00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:54.400]   and the chains can break.
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:57.800]   There is no greater name than the name of Jesus.
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:01.160]   And as we put our security in him,
[00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:05.560]   we find ourselves becoming vessels of freedom and grace.
[00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:08.480]   Father, I wanna pray that you would move
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:09.880]   over each person here now.
[00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:13.960]   And Father, I ask that you would give them courage, Lord.
[00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:16.480]   Courage for the journey ahead in Exodus.
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:19.200]   Courage to say no to the things that they need to say no to,
[00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:21.400]   yes to the things they need to say yes to.
[00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:25.320]   Courage to stand against the work of sin in their lives.
[00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:28.480]   Courage in the fear of you to know that they don't need
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:32.880]   to be giving in all the time to the temptations around them.
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:35.280]   Courage to start making better choices,
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:37.360]   better decisions for their families,
[00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:39.760]   for their marriage, for their children.
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:43.040]   Courage for their marriages, for their relationships.
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:44.840]   Lord, I pray you'd fill us with the courage
[00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:47.200]   that you filled those two women with.
[00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:49.920]   That in our fear of you, the awe, the worship,
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:51.200]   and the majesty of you,
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:54.600]   your spirit would work to set us free.
[00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:58.840]   I encourage you just to bring that before the Lord
[00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:00.880]   in your own way right now.
[00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:02.440]   Ask for his courage.
[00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:06.720]   Commit yourself in fear of him, in that awe,
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:08.680]   in the respect and the wonder of him.
[00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:09.840]   And through that,
[00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:13.800]   put yourself right at the starting line
[00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:17.120]   of everything that he wants to bring to you.
[00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:19.720]   (gentle music)
[00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:22.320]   (gentle music)
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:24.920]   (gentle music)
[00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:27.520]   (gentle music)
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:30.120]   (gentle music)
[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:32.720]   (gentle music)
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:35.320]   (gentle music)
[00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:37.920]   (gentle music)
[00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:40.520]   (gentle music)
[00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:45.120]   (gentle music)
[00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:49.120]   (gentle music)
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:53.120]   (gentle music)
