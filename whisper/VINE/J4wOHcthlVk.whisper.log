[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800]   reflecting the boundless limits of God's creativity as glory to him.
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.800]   A place where people gather, hungry for the presence of God,
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.520]   and passionate to see this invade all aspects of their lives.
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.360]   Where they seek to develop an intelligent, spiritual faith,
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.200]   rooted in God's word and driven with prayer.
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:29.120]   A church that does not make its Sunday services the exclamation mark of its existence,
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.320]   but instead the comma in its ongoing sentence.
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.000]   A time of service, love, and engagement that inspires and emboldens all equally
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.280]   for the conversation that lies ahead.
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:49.480]   A church that cares, disciples, rebuilds, renews.
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.720]   This is our city.
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.000]   This is our church.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.320]   This is our home.
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.480]   Good morning and welcome.
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.520]   Welcome to the Vineyulong.
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.640]   It is so great to see you all.
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.440]   Today is an exciting day.
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.120]   Does anyone know why today is an exciting day?
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.040]   Yes, we can eat.
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.640]   We're going to break the fast.
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.840]   I'm ready.
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.360]   Hey, on that note, I hope that you have been, as we've been setting aside time
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:35.680]   for 21 days to fast, to seek God personally, but also corporately as a church family,
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:42.000]   that you have encountered God in fresh and new ways.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.080]   And I hope that you have been encouraged and strengthened in your faith.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.640]   I know that I have.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:55.080]   And I've been so encouraged by being able to do this together as a church.
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.680]   I've been so encouraged by that.
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.640]   Because if you try to do it on your own, it's a lot harder.
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.400]   So today we're going to, in a moment, enter into worship, but I want to invite you to
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.400]   prepare our hearts.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.920]   So let's quiet down for a moment.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.240]   There's been a lot going on during this week.
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.440]   You know, maybe it's been a good one, maybe it's been a tough one.
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.520]   And I just want to ask you to just give to the Lord right now, whatever's on.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:33.040]   His word says that we can cast our anxieties on Him, because He cares for us.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.040]   So let's do that right now.
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.880]   Let's just share whatever's been weighing on our hearts.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:49.000]   Let's just give that to Him right now.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.360]   I want to invite everyone to stand and I'll pray for us.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:05.000]   Jesus, we thank you so much that we can know you, that you make yourself known to us.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.120]   We thank you for this fasting season and how you've met us, how you spoke to us, how you
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.760]   gave revelation to us, direction to us.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.400]   We also thank you that we could set aside this time to step with you into 2024, not
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.040]   to run ahead on our own strength and our own wisdom, but to really just say, Lord, we want
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.040]   to do it with you.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.400]   We want to hear from you.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.400]   We want to be led by you.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.880]   We want to do it by your spirit, by your power, not out of our own strength.
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.320]   And so right now we want to give you praise, Lord.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.280]   May our worship be pleasing and honoring to you.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:51.280]   I pray this in your name, Jesus. Amen. Let's worship.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:04:16.600]   Amazing love that welcomes me, the kindness of mercy.
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:41.920]   God, you're so good.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:05:08.240]   You're so good to me.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:35.560]   God, you're so good.
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:06:03.880]   You're so good to me.
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.880]   I am blessed.
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:06.880]   I am blessed.

[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:13.880]   I am blessed.

[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:20.880]   I am blessed.

[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:43.880]   And rain came, wind blew, and my house was built on you.
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:48.880]   I'm safe with you.
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.880]   I'm going to make it through.
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.880]   The rain came.
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:15:02.880]   Rain came, wind blew, my house was built on you.
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:07.880]   And I'm safe with you.
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.880]   I'm going to make it through.
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.880]   Oh, the rain came.
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:20.880]   Rain came, wind blew, my house was built on you.
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.880]   And I'm safe with you.
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:26.880]   I'm safe with you.
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.880]   I'm going to make it through.
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.880]   Oh, the rain came.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:40.880]   Rain came, wind blew, my house was built on you.
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:45.880]   And I'm safe with you.
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.880]   I'm going to make it through.
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.880]   I'm going to make it.
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:54.880]   I'm going to make it through.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:58.880]   Because my house was built on you.
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:15:59.880]   I'm going to make it.
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:04.880]   I'm going to make it through.
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.880]   Because my house was built on you.
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:09.880]   I'm going to make it.
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:13.880]   I'm going to make it through.
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.880]   Because my house is built on you.
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.880]   I'm going to make it.
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:23.880]   I'm going to make it through.
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.880]   Because my house is built on you.
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:32.880]   Christ is my foundation.
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:41.880]   The rock on which I stand, when everything around me is shaken.
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:51.880]   I've never been more glad that I put my faith in Jesus.
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:55.880]   He's never let me down.
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:01.880]   He's faithful through generations.
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:05.880]   So why would he fail now?
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:06.880]   He won't.
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:11.880]   He won't.
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:16.880]   He won't fail.
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:21.880]   He won't fail.
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:26.880]   He won't.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:30.880]   No, he won't.
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:31.880]   He won't.
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:36.880]   He won't fail.
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:41.880]   He won't fail.
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:46.880]   He won't.
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:47.880]   No, he won't.
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:48.880]   He won't.
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:52.880]   He won't.
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:57.880]   He won't fail.
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:02.880]   He won't fail.
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:08.880]   He won't.
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:09.880]   No, he won't.
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.880]   He won't.
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:17.880]   He won't fail.
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:22.880]   He won't fail.
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:27.880]   He won't.
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:35.880]   [MUSIC - "HE WON'T FAIL"]
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.880]   [MUSIC - "HE WON'T FAIL"]
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:17.880]   Oh, Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:31.880]   consider all the works thy hath made,
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.880]   I see the star.
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:50.880]   I hear the rolling thunder by Passuwack.
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:59.880]   The yule beavers display, and sings my soul.
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:09.880]   And sings my soul, my Savior God, to thee.
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:12.880]   How great thou art.
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:17.880]   How great thou art.
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.880]   Oh, how great thou art.
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.880]   How great thou art.
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:36.880]   And sings my soul, my Savior God, to thee.
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:39.880]   How great thou art.
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:42.880]   How great thou art.
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:49.880]   How great thou art.
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:21:06.880]   And when I think that God his Son not spare him,
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:16.880]   sent him to die, I scarce can make it in.
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:33.880]   And on the cross my burden gladly bearing,
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:42.880]   he bled and died to take away my sin.
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:56.880]   And sings my soul, my Savior God, to thee.
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:02.880]   How great thou art.
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:10.880]   How great thou art.
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:13.880]   And sings my soul.
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:23.880]   And sings my soul, my Savior God, to thee.
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.880]   How great thou art.
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.880]   How great thou art.
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:35.880]   How great thou art.
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:51.880]   Then I shall bow with shouts of acclamation,
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:23:01.880]   and take me home where joy shall fill my heart.
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:17.880]   Then I shall bow in humble adoration,
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:27.880]   and there proclaim, my God, how great thou art,
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:33.880]   when Christ shall come, when Christ shall come.
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:47.880]   With shouts of acclamation and take me home,
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:55.880]   where joy shall fill my heart.
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:24:08.880]   Then I shall bow in humble adoration,
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:18.880]   and there proclaim, my God, how great thou art.
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:22.880]   Then sings my soul.
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:31.880]   Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to thee.
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.880]   How great thou art.
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.880]   How great thou art.
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:41.880]   Oh, how great thou art.
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:44.880]   How great thou art.
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:57.880]   Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to thee.
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:00.880]   How great thou art.
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:03.880]   How great thou art.
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:10.880]   How great thou art.
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.880]   Then sings my soul.
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:23.880]   Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to thee.
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.880]   How great thou art.
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:29.880]   How great thou art.
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:33.880]   Oh, how great thou art.
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:36.880]   How great thou art.
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:48.880]   Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to thee.
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:55.880]   How great thou art.
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:03.880]   How great thou art.
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:11.880]   Lord, we praise you.
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:15.880]   And we are humbled by your faithfulness,
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:17.880]   that you are faithful to us.
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:20.880]   You never fail us.
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:24.880]   Thank you, Jesus, for laying down your life for us
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:28.880]   so that we can be forgiven, that we can have new life.
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:32.880]   Thank you for loving us in such an incredible way.
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:35.880]   Lord, and we are humbled, and we are in awe.
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:40.880]   And we declare and we confess our faith in you.
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.880]   So we give you all the praise.
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:46.880]   And we pray all this in your name, Jesus.
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:47.880]   Amen.
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.880]   Amen.
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.880]   Thank you, worship team and production team,
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:55.880]   for so beautifully leading us.
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:56.880]   You may be seated.
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:00.880]   Hey, right now we have a celebration.
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:03.880]   And it is a child dedication.
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:10.880]   So I want to invite Joshua and Esther and Deborah and family
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.880]   and friends to come on up.
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.880]   So they're getting ready.
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:20.880]   And friends, you can already come up if you know them.
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:23.880]   We have a tradition that we just stand with them.
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:27.880]   So if you know Joshua, if you know Deborah,
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:29.880]   if you're a family member, just come on up.
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:35.880]   Oh, this is like a grand entrance right here.
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:40.880]   Yeah, come on up.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:43.880]   If you know them, come on up and let's stand together here.
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:49.880]   All right, there's Deborah and--
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:50.880]   Wow.
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:53.880]   And baby Esther, so beautiful.
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:56.880]   Yeah, you can stand up here.
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.880]   Yeah.
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:27:59.880]   Wow.
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:05.880]   What a precious baby girl.
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:09.880]   So this is Joshua, Deborah, Esther.
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:17.880]   We also have Joshua's mom right there, who came from Nigeria--
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.880]   Yes.
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:24.880]   --to support them with the birth of the child.
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:28.880]   And so hey, now biblically, the reason
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:33.880]   why we sell a child dedication or why we practice this
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.880]   is because this is actually something that's been happening
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.880]   throughout biblical history.
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:41.880]   There's a Hannah who dedicated Samuel to the Lord.
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:45.880]   There's Joseph and Mary who dedicated Jesus.
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:48.880]   And so it's a way of saying everything we have
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.880]   is a gift and a blessing from God,
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.880]   and we want to give this to you.
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:56.880]   And so this is what Joshua and Deborah are saying about Esther,
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:59.880]   that she is a beautiful and precious gift from God.
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:02.880]   And they want to offer her to the Lord and just say, Lord,
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.880]   we want you to bless her.
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:08.880]   And we want to-- yeah, our heart is for her to know you.
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.880]   And so that's what we're celebrating.
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.880]   So what we're going to do is we have three questions
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:15.880]   for three different groups of people.
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:18.880]   So first, I have a question for mom and dad.
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.880]   Then I have a question for family and friends.
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.880]   And then afterwards, I have actually a question
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.880]   for the whole congregation.
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:29.880]   And so let me ask you the first question.
[00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:34.880]   So will you raise Esther in an atmosphere
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:36.880]   of God's unconditional love?
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:40.880]   Will you teach Esther to the best of your ability
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.880]   the ways she should go?
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.880]   Will you teach Esther about Jesus Christ and his love
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:47.880]   for all humanity?
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.880]   And will you pray for Esther to be a child
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:52.880]   that will be used for God's glory?
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.880]   If so, please respond, "I will."
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:56.880]   Yes, we will.
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:57.880]   We will.
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:58.880]   Yes.
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:02.880]   [applause]
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:03.880]   Hi.
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.880]   Aw, thank you.
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:11.880]   Okay, this question is for friends and family.
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:14.880]   Will you commit to supporting Joshua and Deborah
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:16.880]   in this journey of parenthood?
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:20.880]   Will you be patient with them, listen to them,
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.880]   help them when they need support?
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:27.880]   Will you also be models and examples to Christ's love
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.880]   that Esther grows up in an environment, in a community
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:34.880]   that will always point her towards her creator?
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:37.880]   If so, please respond, "We will."
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:38.880]   We will.
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:39.880]   All right.
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:42.880]   [applause]
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:46.880]   And this one is for all of you, and I really want to hear
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:49.880]   aloud, "We will," okay?
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:53.880]   So will we as brothers and sisters in Christ
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:58.880]   remember as often as we can to pray for this new family,
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:02.880]   to reach out and support whenever appropriate and necessary?
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:05.880]   Would we be a church that welcomes children
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:07.880]   just as Jesus did?
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:10.880]   If so, please respond, "We will."
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:11.880]   We will.
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:12.880]   Amen.
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:16.880]   [applause]
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:20.880]   And so what we're going to do now is we're going to pray for them.
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.880]   First I'm going to invite family and friends just to start
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:27.880]   praying over them all at the same time, and then Francesca
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:30.880]   will pray, and then I will pray a prayer as well.
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:32.880]   So let's do that right now, and you also, let's carry them
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.880]   in prayer as well.
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:37.880]   You can stretch out your hands towards them.
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:40.880]   [praying in Tongues]
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:32:07.880]   [praying in Tongues]
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:11.880]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for Esther, this beautiful
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:14.880]   and precious gift you've given to Joshua and Deborah
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.880]   and the family and our community.
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:20.880]   We lift up Esther to you and pray that she'll grow and feed
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:23.880]   on your word and that she will choose a personal relationship
[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:25.880]   with you.
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:28.880]   May she be so in tune with your heart that she can distinguish
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:32.880]   your loving voice from the voices of this world.
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:35.880]   And your word says that the pure in heart are blessed.
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:39.880]   I also pray this child will yearn for a life of purity and
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:42.880]   holiness and that the joy of her heart will come from walking
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.880]   in steps with you.
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:47.880]   And Lord, I pray that she may grow in grace and knowledge of
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:51.880]   your ways and that she will have a sense of awe and respect in
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:53.880]   your presence, Lord.
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:57.880]   And Lord, we pray for blessings and protection over this family.
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:00.880]   May you guide Joshua and Deborah and the family to seek your
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:04.880]   heart and to bring up this child in your ways.
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:05.880]   And thank you, Lord.
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:09.880]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:14.880]   Lord Jesus, I also pray for Deborah, for Joshua.
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:18.880]   As they are parent to Esther, I pray that you bless them, that
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:21.880]   you give them wisdom on how to raise Esther in the knowledge of
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:23.880]   you.
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.880]   I pray that you give them the grace and the strength that
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:29.880]   parenting takes, that you give them patience when they need
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:31.880]   patience.
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:34.880]   I pray also that you bless their marriage, that you strengthen
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:38.880]   them as a couple, that you learn, that you continue to grow
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:41.880]   them deeper in love for each other and deeper in love for
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:43.880]   you.
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.880]   I pray that you allow them to be encouragement to each other.
[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:48.880]   But Lord, I also want to pray especially Esther on this
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.880]   special day.
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:53.880]   I thank you for her, for this precious gift that she is to you.
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.880]   I pray for your anointing and blessing and for your Holy
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.880]   Spirit's filling of her.
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:00.880]   I pray that she will know your love.
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.880]   I pray that you will do her a favor in her life.
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:05.880]   And we are so grateful for her.
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:09.880]   And we celebrate this life that you have given to her.
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:12.880]   And so we pray this in your name, Jesus, amen.
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:14.880]   Amen.
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.880]   [Applause]
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:18.880]   Yes.
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:20.880]   What a joyous occasion.
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:24.880]   Congratulations.
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:26.880]   So cute.
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:28.880]   It's so little.
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.880]   Yeah.
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:34.880]   So by the way, since we do have a lot of children and babies, if
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:38.880]   you do want to dedicate your child, your baby to the Lord,
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:42.880]   you can just let Pastor Ivan or myself know and we can help
[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:44.880]   arrange a time to do that.
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:50.880]   We want to at this point in time welcome anyone here who is here
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:52.880]   for the first time today.
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:54.880]   If you don't mind just slipping up your hand, we just want to
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:56.880]   say hi.
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:58.880]   A little yes, welcome.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.880]   It's great to have you.
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:02.880]   Thank you for joining us.
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:06.880]   If you would like to connect with us, there's a QR code.
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:10.880]   You can -- yeah, let us know how we can help you find footing
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.880]   here in this community.
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:16.880]   Also right now, as we do every Sunday, I want to pray for you
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:18.880]   kids.
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:20.880]   I want to pray for your time in K4C.
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:24.880]   So if you see a child, let's stretch out our hands and let's
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:26.880]   pray for them.
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:30.880]   Jesus, we thank you for every single child that is here.
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:34.880]   We thank you that you love every single one of them.
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:38.880]   We pray that they would come to know your love, that you would
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:42.880]   bless them as they go into K4C, that they will grow in the
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:46.880]   knowledge of you, that will form their own relationship with you.
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:50.880]   We also pray for a great time, that they have a great time of
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.880]   the day.
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:56.880]   So parents, you may bring your children to K4C.
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:00.880]   We have two to five -- three to five years and six to 12 years
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:02.880]   over here.
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:06.880]   If you have a young baby, you're also welcome to go on the crash
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:08.880]   the service is being streamed live from there as well.
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:12.880]   So during this time while the parents are doing that, let's
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:16.880]   take a moment to say hi to the people next to you.
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:20.880]   Say hello, get to know them, introduce yourselves.
[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:22.880]   We'll be right back.
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:32.880]   [Music]
[00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:42.880]   [Music]
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:52.880]   [Music]
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:37:02.880]   [Music]
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:12.880]   [Music]
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:22.880]   [Music]
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:32.880]   [Music]
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:34.880]   >> All right.
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:36.880]   Time to bring things back.
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:40.880]   There's several things that we want to keep you in the loop on.
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:44.880]   One thing that I am very excited today is bring your own lunch.
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:46.880]   Yes, it's happening today.
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:48.880]   After the service.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:52.880]   If you don't know about it, it's okay, you go outside, get food,
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.880]   get a beverage of your choice and come bring it back and hang
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:56.880]   out, meet people.
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:00.880]   Also part of our culture with that too is we always want to
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:02.880]   talk to one or two people we don't know.
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.880]   Just connect with new people.
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:06.880]   Let's do that during our bring your own lunch.
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:08.880]   Let's talk to one or two people we don't know.
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:10.880]   This is part of our DNA, part of what we do.
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:12.880]   So that's happening at 1 o'clock following our service.
[00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.880]   Then we have a lunch.
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:18.880]   So that's happening at 1 o'clock following our service.
[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:22.880]   Then we have alpha training coming up.
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:26.880]   So I'm curious, who here has ever participated in an alpha course?
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:28.880]   All right.
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:30.880]   So quite a few of you are familiar with it.
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:34.880]   So if you have enjoyed it, been blessed by that, I want to invite
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:36.880]   you to volunteer.
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.880]   There's different roles.
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:42.880]   You can scan a QR code and can see in what ways you can help and
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.880]   serve with that.
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:48.880]   The training for that is February 4th, 2 to 4 p.m.
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:50.880]   So do consider joining that.
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:54.880]   Also alpha, if you're not familiar with what alpha is, what is this
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:56.880]   even that you're talking about?
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:58.880]   Alpha is a ten-week course.
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:00.880]   It has basically three components.
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:02.880]   First, you eat together.
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:06.880]   So it's Wednesday nights, 730 to 930, starting February 21st.
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:08.880]   You eat a meal together.
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:12.880]   Then you watch a video that talks about one relevant topic, connected
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:16.880]   with the life, about importance that's important to our lives.
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:20.880]   And then you discuss it in a safe environment where you can just share
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.880]   your thoughts.
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:26.880]   And it's a great way to explore the Christian faith.
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:30.880]   So if that's something that's relevant for you, you can share it.
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:32.880]   And then you can also share it with your friends.
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:36.880]   So it's a great way to explore the Christian faith.
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:40.880]   So if that's something that's relevant for you, and you've maybe been
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:44.880]   wondering about what does it mean to be a Christian, I want to encourage
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.880]   you to sign up for the alpha itself.
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:50.880]   Maybe also you grew up in a Christian church, but haven't been in a church
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.880]   for a very long time.
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:56.880]   You haven't really thought through things as an adult or so about faith.
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.880]   Also great.
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:00.880]   I want to encourage you to sign up for that.
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:06.880]   And I want to encourage us, if you have friends that you can ask, you can
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:10.880]   pray, you can ask God to maybe highlight two people to you that you could
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:16.880]   invite that could benefit from this safe space of connecting with new people
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:18.880]   and of exploring Jesus.
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:22.880]   I want to encourage you to invite them to alpha.
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:28.880]   So we're going to be, yeah, inviting friends as well.
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:34.880]   So right now we're going to transition into a time of tithes and offerings.
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:40.880]   So welcome team, you can come up and can start passing the baskets.
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:42.880]   I want to just say thank you.
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:46.880]   You know, this past month there's been a lot of new people that have been
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:48.880]   giving, and it's been a blessing.
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:54.880]   So thank you so much for your generosity and for giving and for helping us as
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:41:00.880]   a church community to do this work that God is calling us to do of facilitating
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:04.880]   all of this, but also loving and serving our neighborhood.
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:08.880]   So thank you so much for your generosity in this.
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:10.880]   As you can see, there's different ways to give.
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:12.880]   There's also envelopes.
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:14.880]   They have information there.
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:18.880]   So, yeah, thank you so much for that.
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:22.880]   Now, I would love to pray with us in just a moment.
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:28.880]   I'll just wait until the buckets, you know, have passed around.
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:34.880]   Part of giving is because, you know, Jesus has been so generous to us, and he
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:40.880]   calls us his people to have his character, you know, as his followers, and
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:43.880]   there will be also people who are generous and who give towards his work
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:44.880]   and his things.
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.880]   So that's why we do that.
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:48.880]   But let me pray for the offering.
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:54.880]   Jesus, we thank you for all your provision, for everything that's given.
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:58.880]   And this is part of our worship, and we offer this up to you.
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:03.880]   And we pray that it would honor you and that you would use us for your purposes
[00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:05.880]   here in New Long and beyond.
[00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:07.880]   And so we pray all this in your name, Jesus.
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:08.880]   Amen.
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:10.880]   Amen.
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:14.880]   Well, right now I have the privilege of introducing to you, if you don't know
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:17.880]   him yet, our senior pastor, Andrew.
[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:19.880]   So let's welcome Andrew.
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:21.880]   Thank you.
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:23.880]   Thank you.
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:26.880]   Yeah, so...
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:27.880]   I always feel so small with you.
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:28.880]   Get down there.
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:29.880]   There you go.
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:30.880]   All right.
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:32.880]   There you go.
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:37.880]   So for those of you who don't know, so Andrew is a senior pastor of the Divine
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:43.880]   Church in Wan Chai and also overseeing all of the Divine churches, including
[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:45.880]   his church plan as well.
[00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:48.880]   And so he's been, of course, been dreaming about this, and it's been exciting
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:51.880]   for you to see this unfold.
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:52.880]   And it's great to have you.
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:56.880]   So we'd love to pray for you, for us as well, for this message.
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:57.880]   So let me do that.
[00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:58.880]   Thank you.
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:00.880]   You can stretch out your hands towards him, and let's pray.
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:04.880]   Jesus, thank you so much for Andrew, for his faithfulness in serving you,
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.880]   for his love for your word.
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:09.880]   I pray that you anoint him right now with your Holy Spirit as he shares this
[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:12.880]   word that you've put on his heart for us here today.
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:17.880]   Also pray for us that you prepare our hearts to receive what it is that you
[00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:18.880]   want to speak to us.
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:19.880]   Thank you, Lord.
[00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:22.880]   And so we come expectantly before you, Lord, that you will meet us through this.
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:24.880]   I pray this in your name, Jesus.
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:25.880]   Amen.
[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:26.880]   Amen.
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:27.880]   Well, good morning, everyone.
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:29.880]   It is such a deep privilege to be here.
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:33.880]   I was saying to the Cantonese service earlier today that every single week
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:37.880]   since we've launched Yinlong, I've felt like I want to be in two places at the
[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:38.880]   same time.
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:43.880]   And Tim and I connect at the end of each Sunday, and we share kind of stories of
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:45.880]   how Wonchai was, how Yinlong was.
[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:50.880]   And it is such a blessing for us to have one church in Hong Kong, but have two
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:54.880]   expressions of that church, one in Yinlong and one in Wonchai.
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:58.880]   And so I bring you greetings from everybody in Wonchai, and it is such a
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:03.880]   wonderful thing to be able to see this community growing and deepening.
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:05.880]   I see a lot of familiar faces in this room.
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:08.880]   When I've been here in the last number of times that I've been with you, but I
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:10.880]   see a lot of new faces in this room as well.
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:14.880]   And perhaps the Vine is a new church to you, and we are just so grateful that
[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:15.880]   you're here.
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:20.880]   I really want to honor Tim and Ivan, Chapman June, and all of the people that
[00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:21.880]   are serving and the volunteers.
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:25.880]   This thing could not happen without the incredible volunteers that we have here
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:26.880]   in Yinlong.
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:30.880]   So thank you guys for pouring your heart and your energy into this community.
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:33.880]   And today I get to share in this series that we've been doing on Fresh
[00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:37.880]   Encounters, something that I feel is actually very personal to me.
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:41.880]   And one of the things that we do here at the Vine in terms of our leadership is
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:45.880]   we want to always lead or try to lead out of a place of authenticity, out of a
[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:52.880]   place of our own brokenness, our own need for the reality of Christ in our lives,
[00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:57.880]   and come and serve, really, whether that's through the pulpit or through other
[00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:01.880]   ways that the leaders here serve, from a place of that authenticity and that
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:02.880]   brokenness.
[00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:05.880]   And much of what I want to talk about today, I think, has the ability to
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:11.880]   catalyze you into a deeper time of intimacy with Jesus than you've ever
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:12.880]   experienced before.
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:15.880]   But it also has the ability to hold us back.
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:20.880]   If we don't address the issue that I'm talking about today, if we don't embrace
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:25.880]   how we can use that in our lives, it actually can hold us back from entering
[00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:27.880]   into deeper intimacy.
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:32.880]   And as we were worshipping, I saw a picture for us as a community.
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:36.880]   And the picture was a grandfather clock, one of those old -- I'm British, by the
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:39.880]   way, in case you can't work out my accent.
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:41.880]   I am British, all right?
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:46.880]   And in the U.K., in my grandfather's house, up in the bedroom where I used to
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:49.880]   sleep when I was a kid when we would go over to my grandfather's house, he had a
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:51.880]   big grandfather's clock.
[00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:55.880]   And it was one of those ones that had, like, the little pendulum that swung, and
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:57.880]   it made a really loud ticking noise, you know that thing?
[00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:00.880]   Like, dong, dong, dong.
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:04.880]   I could not get to sleep in that bedroom at all because this thing was just
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:07.880]   swinging like this all night long and making a noise.
[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:11.880]   And I felt like I was reminded of that as we were worshipping, weirdly, and I was
[00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:14.880]   like, what are you trying to say to us as a community?
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:17.880]   And I felt like for some of us in this room, and I know that I resonate with this
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:23.880]   as well, we sort of are constantly swinging from one thing to the next.
[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:28.880]   And just like my experience in that bedroom, I could not find rest.
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:32.880]   I couldn't sleep when that thing was just ticking away like it was every night.
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:35.880]   And I feel like for some of us, we're crying out for rest.
[00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:38.880]   We're crying out for our soul.
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:43.880]   Not maybe even just physical rest, but a soul rest, a sense of feeling like we are
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:49.880]   connected to Jesus that enables us not to have to try, not to have to try to be
[00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:54.880]   something, not to have to try to constantly try to create something in our lives,
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:47:01.880]   but when we just relax and know that we are loved and embraced and accepted for
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:07.880]   who we are and we find great joy in just being at shalom, the biblical word,
[00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:08.880]   being at peace with him.
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:10.880]   Does that resonate with you?
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:13.880]   And as I unpack what I want to talk about today, I hope for some of you it will
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:18.880]   perhaps maybe help you to actually slow down a little bit and actually find your
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:22.880]   soul at rest with him.
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:24.880]   I want to talk about sin today.
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:26.880]   I know, I know.
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:30.880]   You didn't want to come to church to hear about sin today, okay?
[00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:35.880]   But I'm really excited about this because I think as we unpack what is perhaps one
[00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:39.880]   of the most central topics in scripture, I believe you're going to find great
[00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:40.880]   freedom today.
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:43.880]   I want to start by telling you a little story out of my own life.
[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:48.880]   A number of years ago, I woke up in the morning, as we do most mornings.
[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:52.880]   I woke up in the morning and I went to the bathroom and I brushed my teeth and I
[00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:56.880]   was washing my hands and we have a mirror, as many of us do, in our bathroom
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:58.880]   right in front, and I'm washing my hands and I look up in the mirror.
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:01.880]   And when we look in a mirror, we're normally seeing a reflection of
[00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:03.880]   ourselves and what we can see in front of ourselves.
[00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:09.880]   We very rarely, do we, very rarely check behind ourselves or anything like that.
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:13.880]   For whatever reason, I'm washing my hands that morning and I felt like I should
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:15.880]   check my back.
[00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:20.880]   So I kind of did this and sort of turned and looked in the mirror and I noticed
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:23.880]   that there was like a little lump in the center of my back.
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:25.880]   I'd never noticed it before.
[00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:27.880]   I'd never felt it before.
[00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:30.880]   I didn't even know it existed until that very moment.
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:33.880]   But as I was washing my hands, I just had this thought I should look at my back
[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:35.880]   and I noticed this thing that was there.
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:39.880]   And my immediate thought was, "Huh, I've got a lump on my back."
[00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:42.880]   I didn't think anything that much about it.
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:45.880]   I was just like, "Oh, okay, I've got a lump on my back and it doesn't hurt me.
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:47.880]   I can't see it.
[00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:49.880]   It doesn't bother me.
[00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:51.880]   I don't feel it even.
[00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:53.880]   It's kind of like just one of those things.
[00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:54.880]   So I was just like, "Forget it.
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:55.880]   Who cares?
[00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:56.880]   I'll just get on with my life."
[00:48:56.880 --> 00:49:01.880]   Well, a number of weeks later, I was up again, washing my hands in the morning,
[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:03.880]   looked in the mirror again, and the thought came, "Oh, I should have a look at
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:04.880]   that little lump again."
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:07.880]   And I had a look and now it was the size of a bit of a golf ball,
[00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:10.880]   like about the size of a golf ball on my back.
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:12.880]   Now you would think I might sort of go, "Oh, that's strange."
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:16.880]   But again, my reaction was, "Oh, that's interesting."
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:20.880]   I was like, "Okay, I've got like a lump on my back and it's grown a little bit,
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:22.880]   but I can't feel it.
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:23.880]   No one notices it.
[00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:26.880]   Even my wife hasn't said anything about it.
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:27.880]   Like no one notices it.
[00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:28.880]   It doesn't seem to bother anything.
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:29.880]   It doesn't hurt me.
[00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:30.880]   It's just like whatever."
[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:31.880]   So I'm like, "Okay, fine.
[00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:32.880]   I'll just carry on with life."
[00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:38.880]   But about a month later, I wake up in the morning and I'm in excruciating pain.
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:41.880]   Like my back is just screaming with pain.
[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:45.880]   I rushed to the mirror and I looked like this and I could not believe what I saw.
[00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:47.880]   Part of half of my back was just red.
[00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:50.880]   The little golf ball had become a baseball.
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:56.880]   It was now this big, huge, angry red mark and big, huge bump on my back.
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:59.880]   Every time I sort of turned and my muscles moved, it really hurt.
[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:02.880]   And I realized, "Okay, I better actually deal with this.
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:05.880]   I better actually get this thing sorted out."
[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:09.880]   So that morning, I booked myself in to a doctor that we have as a family.
[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:10.880]   We went in to this doctor.
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:14.880]   I laid down on the bed and I kind of took my shirt off and I showed him.
[00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:15.880]   And he was like, "Oh, okay.
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:17.880]   That's pretty ugly."
[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:21.880]   He put his gloves on and he kind of touched the bump on my back
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:22.880]   and he kind of moved it around.
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:24.880]   And he goes, "Oh, okay.
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:26.880]   It's no big deal."
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:27.880]   And I was like, "Great.
[00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:28.880]   It hurts."
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:30.880]   But he said, "It's no big deal."
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:34.880]   He said, "It's just a"--the technical term--"a sebaceous cyst."
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:35.880]   It's just a cyst.
[00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:40.880]   It's a bunch of kind of tissue and fat that has kind of gotten fat and congealed.
[00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:41.880]   But he's moving it around.
[00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:43.880]   He's like, "It's not attached to anything.
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:44.880]   It's no big deal.
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:48.880]   What we will do, we just open you up, we pop it out, we zip you back up again,
[00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:49.880]   and you're good."
[00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:52.880]   He said, "It takes 15 minutes."
[00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:53.880]   How about that?
[00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:56.880]   He said, "You can come and do it on your lunch break."
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:59.880]   That's like Hong Kong efficiency for you, by the way.
[00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:03.880]   "On your lunch break so you don't have to take any time off work.
[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:06.880]   Lunch break, come in, open up, pop it out, zip you back up again,
[00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:07.880]   and we're good to go."
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:09.880]   He's like, "We could even do it tomorrow.
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:11.880]   What are you doing for lunch tomorrow?"
[00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:12.880]   And I looked at my diary.
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:14.880]   I wasn't doing anything for lunch, so I thought I would have surgery
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:15.880]   instead of just lunch.
[00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:21.880]   So the next day, I go back and I lie down again, and I take my top off,
[00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:22.880]   and there it is.
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:23.880]   It's all kind of ugly and stuff.
[00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:25.880]   He gets some local anesthetic.
[00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:28.880]   And local anesthetic, it just numbs the surface.
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:33.880]   And so he kind of injects this local anesthetic onto the lump.
[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:36.880]   He opens me up, and then I hear this.
[00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:40.880]   I hear--now remember, I'm lying face down, facing up the floor,
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:44.880]   and I hear him go, "Oh, my gosh."
[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:49.880]   Now, if you're ever in surgery, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:54.880]   and you're awake, and you hear the surgeon go, "Oh, my God,
[00:51:54.880 --> 00:52:00.880]   that is not a good sign," okay, he goes, "Oh, my God," like this.
[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:01.880]   He's kind of freaking out.
[00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:02.880]   I'm lying there.
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:05.880]   I'm like, "Doctor, is there a problem?"
[00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:10.880]   He's like, "Well," he said, "I've noticed that the cyst is actually
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:13.880]   attached to all of your back muscle.
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:17.880]   It's actually now kind of gotten attached to all of your back muscle."
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:20.880]   Now, what he should have done, if you're making notes,
[00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:24.880]   what he should have done at this point is sewed me back up, right,
[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:28.880]   and then scheduled a proper surgery where I could have general anesthetic,
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:31.880]   get completely knocked out, and he could do whatever he wanted with my back, right?
[00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:34.880]   Serious surgery.
[00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:35.880]   He doesn't do that.
[00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:39.880]   He just decides to keep going.
[00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:43.880]   So I'm lying there, and I'm in a lot of pain,
[00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:46.880]   and he's injecting local anesthetic around the wound,
[00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:49.880]   which is not doing anything because what he's doing now
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:54.880]   is he's pulling out my back muscle, and he's cutting my back muscle
[00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:58.880]   so that he can free this thing and get it out of me.
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:03.880]   I cannot describe to you how excruciatingly painful it is
[00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:06.880]   to be completely awake and have somebody,
[00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:10.880]   "Ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ping," cutting your back muscle.
[00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:15.880]   It was no amount of local anesthetic could touch anything
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:17.880]   to the depth of what he was doing.
[00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:22.880]   In fact, after an hour and a half of him doing this--
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:25.880]   I'm screaming my head off, by the way.
[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:28.880]   If anybody was in the waiting room, they left the doctor, right?
[00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:30.880]   Imagine if you're in the waiting room, right,
[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:32.880]   and there's a closed door, and somebody's going, "Aaah!"
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:34.880]   I'm screaming, right?
[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:37.880]   They have injected so much local anesthetic into my back
[00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:40.880]   that they have run out of local anesthetic.
[00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:42.880]   They no longer--he says to the nurse at one point,
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:44.880]   "More local anesthetic!"
[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:47.880]   The nurse says, "We've run out of local anesthetic."
[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:51.880]   I am crying and crying and crying, so much pain.
[00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:53.880]   He then goes to me--he kind of whispers in my ear--
[00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:56.880]   he said, "Would you like some Valium?"
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:59.880]   Now, apparently, you're not supposed to give Valium
[00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:01.880]   unless somebody has actually signed off on it, right?
[00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:04.880]   But I'm in so much pain, and he can see that I'm in so much pain.
[00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:06.880]   He's like, "Can I give you some Valium?"
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:09.880]   And I'm like, "Please give me Valium, yes!"
[00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:11.880]   So he injects some Valium into my arm.
[00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:14.880]   Suddenly, I'm like, "Aaah!"
[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:18.880]   The swinging stopped, and I entered into Shalom.
[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:20.880]   And it was like I was in heaven,
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:24.880]   and the doctor could do anything he wanted with my back at all.
[00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:27.880]   I'm like, "Cut away, baby. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter."
[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:29.880]   I couldn't feel anything at that point.
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:31.880]   I was off in some la-la land.
[00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:35.880]   It took him another about 45 minutes to get the cyst out of my back.
[00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:37.880]   He sewed me up.
[00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:40.880]   I had 3 months of physiotherapy on my back--
[00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:43.880]   how to move my back and move my arm properly again.
[00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:46.880]   I mean, this was an absolute disaster.
[00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:48.880]   During the physiotherapy over 3 months,
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:52.880]   God began to speak to me personally out of this trauma.
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:56.880]   He said, "Andrew, you need to understand
[00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:59.880]   that the way that you treat your sin
[00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:03.880]   is exactly how you treated your cyst.
[00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:07.880]   You know that there's some stuff going on in your life.
[00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:10.880]   You know that there are a few things that are not fully aligned,
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:12.880]   but just kind of like that mirror, you're like,
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:15.880]   'Oh, yeah. Well, it's not hurting me.
[00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:17.880]   It's not really hurting anyone else.
[00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:21.880]   It's really not such a big deal. I'll just carry on.'"
[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:26.880]   And God was like, "Andrew, you just walk on and carry on with your sin
[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:28.880]   until it actually starts hurting yourself,
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:30.880]   until it actually does something.
[00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:33.880]   Maybe you get caught in something, or maybe somebody finds out,
[00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:37.880]   or maybe you realize that it's impacting a relationship in your life
[00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:38.880]   or something like that.
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:40.880]   Then you're willing to deal with it.
[00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:42.880]   But even then, you're just like the doctor.
[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:44.880]   "Oh, just open it up, pop it out, zip it back up.
[00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:46.880]   It's no big deal. It's fine. I can handle it.
[00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:50.880]   It's just a minor thing. It's not a major sin. It's a minor sin."
[00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:53.880]   By the way, the Bible doesn't talk about sins in that way.
[00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:56.880]   But we so often do, "It's just a minor thing. It's not a big deal.
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:59.880]   We just don't understand fully the impact."
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:01.880]   And I felt like God was saying, "Andrew, you don't fully get it.
[00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:05.880]   You don't fully see that actually your sin goes so much deeper
[00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:07.880]   than what you just see on the surface.
[00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:12.880]   You see maybe anger, but you don't realize what the depth of that is
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:14.880]   and why it is that you're so angry.
[00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:18.880]   You see lust and some of the issues that you struggle with in that area,
[00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:20.880]   but you don't understand the roots of that.
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:23.880]   You think it's just an easy thing, something to quickly deal with,
[00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:27.880]   when actually your sin so deeply is entangled with you
[00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:32.880]   that no local anesthetic of you just trying to be a good Christian,
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:34.880]   of you just trying to be a better person,
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:38.880]   of you just trying to go to church more is going to solve the reality
[00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:41.880]   that there are some sins in your life that you're carrying around with you
[00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:44.880]   and you're not willing to truly deal with.
[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:46.880]   You're just trying to put a band-aid on something
[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:49.880]   that's going to require some valium and some uprooting
[00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:52.880]   at the very root of what it's entangled into.
[00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:54.880]   Are you with me?
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:58.880]   I'm a pastor of a church, and I think I'm a pretty good person,
[00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:00.880]   and I do my best to walk with Jesus,
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:07.880]   and I realized that sin in my life had gone far deeper
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:09.880]   than perhaps it should have.
[00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:12.880]   And what I thought was something I could pop out and deal with in my lunch break
[00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:15.880]   was actually something that I needed to go on a journey with the Lord
[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:20.880]   and to see the freedom that He truly wanted for me.
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:23.880]   It's interesting because Scripture speaks about sin this way.
[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:26.880]   Let me read you this beautiful verse from Hebrews 12, verse 1.
[00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:31.880]   It says this, "Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses,
[00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:36.880]   let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles."
[00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:38.880]   Notice that.
[00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:42.880]   "The sin that is not surface, the sin that we think is surface,
[00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:47.880]   and it's no big deal, but it so easily entangles in so much of us.
[00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:51.880]   And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us."
[00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:53.880]   I love the writer to Hebrews here.
[00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:56.880]   He's speaking to the church, and he's saying, "Church, you've got to understand
[00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:58.880]   that there is a great cloud of witnesses.
[00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:01.880]   There are men and women who through all the history have gone on a journey
[00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:04.880]   and walking with God, and we need to throw off everything
[00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:07.880]   because there is a race that God is calling us to run.
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:09.880]   There is something that God is calling you to do.
[00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:13.880]   There's a part of who you are that you are created and shaped and formed by God.
[00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:15.880]   God is doing something in your life.
[00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:17.880]   He's using in your workplace, in your family.
[00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:19.880]   There's a purpose. There's a mission.
[00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:22.880]   There's a race to run, and he's saying there is this race,
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:25.880]   but in order to run that race, in order to do that,
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:28.880]   you've got to throw off the things that are holding you back,
[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:30.880]   the things that are weighing you down.
[00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:34.880]   And he says, "The sin that so easily entangles."
[00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:41.880]   The word for "entangles" here in the Greek means literally trapped, ensnared.
[00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:43.880]   It means hidden.
[00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:47.880]   "The sin that so easily is not just the surface stuff,
[00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:51.880]   but the stuff that is so much deeper than that."
[00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:55.880]   It's like the writer in Hebrews is saying, "I want to invite you on a journey,
[00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:59.880]   a journey where you can truly be free."
[00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:03.880]   When the doctor finally got my cyst out and managed to cut all the stuff
[00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:06.880]   that needed to be cut out, it never returned
[00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:10.880]   because he had dealt not just with the surface issue but with the roots.
[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:15.880]   And the thing that the Holy Spirit has for us as believers in Jesus
[00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:20.880]   is the joy of knowing a God who truly can get to the roots,
[00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:23.880]   not just deal with some of the stuff that we find
[00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:28.880]   on the surface of our relationship with Him.
[00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:30.880]   God actually gives us a tool.
[00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:34.880]   He gives us a gift in order to be able to really get to the roots
[00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:39.880]   of our sin and our brokenness, and it's the gift of confession and repentance.
[00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:42.880]   And again, I know that confession and repentance seems like a really heavy topic.
[00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:46.880]   It seems like something that we kind of don't want to go to church to hear about that.
[00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:48.880]   That seems like something that's a little overwhelming.
[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:51.880]   But when you think of confession and repentance,
[00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:55.880]   what I want you to actually be thinking about is freedom and intimacy
[00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:58.880]   because confession and repentance is really just a process
[00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:00.880]   of bringing freedom and intimacy into your life.
[01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:04.880]   And so when the Bible speaks about confession and repentance,
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:08.880]   our natural response is to often think of the negative side of that,
[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:11.880]   but the Bible so often presents it more as the journey
[01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:13.880]   and what it brings you into.
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:16.880]   It brings you actually into a profound place of greater freedom in your life
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:17.880]   and intimacy with God.
[01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:21.880]   And if this whole series over January has been about fresh encounters,
[01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:25.880]   if your fast has been about a desire to be in deeper intimacy with Christ,
[01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:29.880]   then confession and repentance is perhaps the greatest tool
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:34.880]   that God has given you to bring you into a place of fresher encounter with Him.
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:40.880]   In fact, the writer in the book of Acts, which we know of as Luke,
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:45.880]   he writes it this way in Acts 3, starting in verse 19.
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:50.880]   He says, "Repent then and turn to God so that your sins will be wiped out
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:54.880]   and that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord."
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:56.880]   Isn't that beautiful?
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:00.880]   Notice how Scripture speaks about the work of confession and repentance.
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:02.880]   It doesn't wrap it up in some fear.
[01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:03.880]   It wraps it up in joy.
[01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:07.880]   It says, "When we confess, when we repent,
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:10.880]   we turn from the brokenness and the bad stuff,
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:13.880]   and we find ourselves in times of refreshing with the Lord."
[01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:18.880]   In the Greek, when you read that, the emphasis is in the times of refreshing.
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:22.880]   It's like Luke is saying, "Hey, guys, this is the joy of knowing Jesus.
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:23.880]   This is actually what it's about.
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:25.880]   You want to know what intimacy is with Him?
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:30.880]   It is confessing and repenting the stuff that so easily entangles in us.
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:34.880]   It is taking seriously the fact that we walk so often in brokenness,
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:37.880]   and in releasing ourselves from that, we have times of refreshing
[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:39.880]   in the presence of the Lord."
[01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:43.880]   It's like this great invitation into something that is far more profound
[01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:45.880]   than we ever realized.
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:48.880]   And the problem is that so often through the history of church,
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:53.880]   the church has talked about confession and repentance as a scary thing,
[01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:57.880]   as if there's some God who's super angry at us,
[01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:02.880]   a God who is so angry at us that He's punishing us in wrath
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:05.880]   for the broken things that we struggle with.
[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:09.880]   And I think one of the things that we need to do to free ourselves as Christians
[01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:12.880]   is we actually need to make a shift in our mindset away from thinking
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:16.880]   about confession and repentance from a fear-based perspective,
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:19.880]   but actually think about it from a joy-based perspective.
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:22.880]   I mean, could you imagine what it would be like if we all thought
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:25.880]   that confession and repentance is a joy?
[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:26.880]   Like, what a gift.
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:30.880]   What a joy it is to not have to walk around with my brokenness all the time,
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:33.880]   but to realize that Jesus went to the cross, shed His blood,
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:38.880]   so that I would be free, so that I would know times of refreshing from the Lord.
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:41.880]   So that would be the constant state that I find myself in,
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:46.880]   not the state of feeling guilty or shame or a state of feeling like I've got a God
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:50.880]   who's angry at me, but instead the reality is I have a God who loves me
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:57.880]   and, yes, sees sin, sees what sin does to me, hates sin, but loves me.
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:01.880]   And because God hates sin but loves me, when He sees that I'm in sin,
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:04.880]   what He sees is not I'm angry at this person.
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:08.880]   What God says is there's a race that I want this person to run,
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:11.880]   and if they're struggling under the yoke and the brokenness
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:16.880]   and the entanglement of this sin, they can't run as free as I want them to run.
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:20.880]   I wonder if you could sense this, that the Holy Spirit looks over you today
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:23.880]   and He says, "Man, I see so much for you.
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:26.880]   I see so much in your life.
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:29.880]   I see so much that I want to take you in and draw you into.
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:32.880]   This is the great joy of God for you.
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:37.880]   He loves you so much. He wants to release you into that."
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:40.880]   Imagine what it would be like if we came here on Sundays
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:46.880]   in the joy of being honest about our sin and our brokenness,
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:51.880]   knowing not that we celebrate it, not at all,
[01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:57.880]   but knowing that as we confess it, as we speak of it, as we recognize it,
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:02.880]   as we take ownership for it, we are releasing ourselves
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:05.880]   into the race that Christ has called us to run
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:10.880]   and at times of refreshing of the invitation.
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:12.880]   I love how Tim Keller puts this.
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:15.880]   Tim Keller, one of the great pastors of our time,
[01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:18.880]   unfortunately passed away recently from cancer,
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:21.880]   but leaves behind a legacy of amazing books and teaching.
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:25.880]   One of the great pastors in the city of New York, he wrote it this way.
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:29.880]   He said, "Fear-based confession and repentance makes us hate ourselves.
[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:34.880]   We feel really bad, but joy-based confession and repentance makes us hate sin."
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:36.880]   Do you see the difference?
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:40.880]   And some of you in this room, you come in today hating yourself.
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:43.880]   You come in feeling really bad about yourself.
[01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:47.880]   You're so wallowing in guilt and shame
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:49.880]   and you think God hates you too.
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:51.880]   You think God is angry at you, upset at you.
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:54.880]   You think God is distant from you.
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:58.880]   And we need to shift our mentality here to realize that there is a hate at work,
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:00.880]   but it's not a hate of ourselves.
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:04.880]   It's a hate of the impact and the entanglement of sin
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:08.880]   and the joy of knowing a Christ who can free us from that
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:15.880]   and set us back into a new place, a place of love and joy and grace and hope.
[01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:19.880]   So you need to understand that confession and repentance
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:23.880]   is actually the truest form of worship that we have.
[01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:25.880]   Because think about it.
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:29.880]   If worship is about ascribing glory to Christ,
[01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:34.880]   the greatest glory that Christ will ever do for you is to save you.
[01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:38.880]   It is, in other words, to deal with the sin issue in your life.
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:41.880]   It is to free you from sin and brokenness
[01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:44.880]   and bring you back into right relationship with Christ
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:46.880]   and reconcile you with Him.
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:51.880]   And because of that, our joy of confession and repentance
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:53.880]   is actually an act of worship.
[01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:58.880]   It's actually a way for us to honor and to glorify what Christ has done on the cross.
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:03.880]   And when we fail to repent and confess, when we hold on to sin,
[01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:05.880]   we're actually doing the opposite.
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:08.880]   We're not honoring the work that the cross has provided for us,
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:13.880]   and instead we're holding on to our brokenness as if the cross hasn't happened.
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:16.880]   But the cross has happened. You have been set free.
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:20.880]   And what that means is that sin no longer has a grip on you.
[01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:23.880]   Sin does not get the final say. Amen?
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:26.880]   It does not get the final say in your life.
[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:28.880]   And because it no longer has the final say,
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:31.880]   when we engage in confession and repentance,
[01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:37.880]   we're aligning our belief to the reality that the cross is louder than sin.
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:40.880]   Whoa, that was cool.
[01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:44.880]   The cross is louder than sin.
[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:48.880]   Are you tracking with this?
[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:53.880]   I've noticed in my life as I've made the shift from thinking about repentance and confession
[01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:56.880]   from a fear place, from a place of guilt and shame,
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:07:00.880]   to a place of honor and joy and ultimately love,
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:03.880]   I've noticed a lot of changes in my life.
[01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:08.880]   I've noticed that when I'm in sin, which I am at times,
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:12.880]   when I'm in a place of sin, before when it was fear-based,
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:14.880]   I felt a lot of condemnation.
[01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:17.880]   Now when it's joy-based, I feel a lot of conviction.
[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:20.880]   And conviction enables me to deal with that sin.
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:23.880]   Condemnation makes me feel bad about it. Are you with me?
[01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:26.880]   I've noticed when I've made the shift that before,
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:30.880]   when I had a fear-based relationship with confession and repentance,
[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:33.880]   I noticed that I would often blame God.
[01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:39.880]   Now I find myself within the joy aspect, actually wanting to align with God
[01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:43.880]   and how He sees the reality that's happening in my life.
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:49.880]   I've noticed before that I would find myself being angry at myself.
[01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:54.880]   I now find myself through a joy-based confession and repentance,
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:57.880]   finding myself humbled.
[01:07:57.880 --> 01:07:59.880]   It's a different experience.
[01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:01.880]   I still recognize the sin and I'm not proud of it.
[01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:05.880]   But rather than feeling like I'm beating myself up about it,
[01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:09.880]   I'm able to humble myself into the hands of the Lord
[01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:12.880]   and ask Him to deal with what only He can deal with it,
[01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:15.880]   because my local anesthetic can't touch it.
[01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:22.880]   But His Valium, the Holy Spirit, the blood of Jesus on the cross,
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:25.880]   can truly get to the root. Are you tracking with this?
[01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:30.880]   David, one of the great psalmists, writes so beautifully of this whole process.
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:33.880]   I want to just sit us in Psalm 32 for a little bit
[01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:36.880]   as I unpack this idea a bit more with you guys.
[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:39.880]   David's an interesting man, because when we hear of David in the Old Testament,
[01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:42.880]   we often think of David as this amazing guy,
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:44.880]   this guy that had the idea for the temple,
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:48.880]   a great leader who established Israel into Jerusalem.
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:51.880]   Christ, we know, comes from the Davidic line.
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:54.880]   Often the Scriptures talk about this Davidic dynasty,
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:56.880]   that the Messiah would come from the house of David.
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:00.880]   So David has a lot of sense of revere and honor in the Old Testament,
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:03.880]   but the reality is David was a very broken man.
[01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:06.880]   David was a sinner. He was a deep sinner.
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:10.880]   He was a man who committed murder. He was a man who committed rape.
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:13.880]   He had a lot of lust issues. He had a lot of sexual brokenness in his life.
[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:16.880]   He is not a perfect person.
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:19.880]   And I want to encourage you that there are no perfect people in this room.
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:22.880]   There are no perfect people here.
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:25.880]   And the vine celebrates the beauty of the fact that none of us are perfect,
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:27.880]   but we have a perfect Savior.
[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:31.880]   And that's the invitation we have to a God who is so good.
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:35.880]   Now listen to how David in his brokenness, who knows God so well,
[01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:39.880]   notice what he says. He says, "Blessed is he whose transgressions are forgiven."
[01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:42.880]   That's sins. "Whose sins are forgiven, whose sins are covered.
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:46.880]   Blessed is the one whose sins the Lord no longer counts against him
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:48.880]   and whose spirit is no deceit." Notice how he starts.
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:51.880]   He says, "You need to understand that you're blessed,
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:55.880]   that you're blessed when the Lord doesn't hold any sin against you.
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:58.880]   You're blessed when you're in a relationship with God
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:00.880]   where he sees you through the blood of Jesus.
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:03.880]   You're blessed because you live on this side of the cross of Calvary.
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:07.880]   You're blessed because you have a place to bring your brokenness and bring your sin.
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:10.880]   That's a place of blessing. Blessing here means flourishing.
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:15.880]   It means life. It means abundancy. It means growth. It means goodness.
[01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:19.880]   That's how David starts. He says, "You need to understand how God sees you
[01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:22.880]   through the cross of Jesus. You are blessed.
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:27.880]   Blessed are those whose sins are forgiven and your sins are forgiven because of Christ."
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:30.880]   That's a beautiful place to start.
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:33.880]   In other words, when we're talking about confession, repentance, and sin,
[01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:37.880]   our starting point should not be, "Oh, I'm bad. I'm terrible. I'm horrible."
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:41.880]   Our starting point should be, "I'm blessed because I have the opportunity to be redeemed.
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:45.880]   I have the opportunity to be reconciled. I have the opportunity to be changed."
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:48.880]   Are you with me? That's the starting point for us.
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:52.880]   We are blessed. That doesn't mean that we don't still have sin.
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:55.880]   It doesn't mean that we don't need to deal with some things.
[01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:58.880]   It doesn't mean that we can't just go, "Oh, okay, whatever."
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:00.880]   We'll get on to that in a moment.
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:04.880]   But your starting point is you're blessed because you have an opportunity
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:08.880]   to fully get untangled. Are you with me?
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:12.880]   This is really important because the whole of Scripture speaks this way.
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:15.880]   I love actually, let me just jump to 1 John.
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:20.880]   Right at the end of the New Testament, 1 John puts it really quite powerfully in verse 9.
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:25.880]   He says, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just and will forgive our sins
[01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:30.880]   and purify us from all unrighteousness." There's the concept, "Purify us."
[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:34.880]   If we confess our sins, He is faithful to forgive.
[01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:38.880]   Now, anyone in this room right now, whatever it is that you've brought in today,
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:42.880]   no matter what's going on in your life, no matter what sin that you know you're carrying,
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:45.880]   no matter what brokenness, no matter you know what you've done in your past,
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:49.880]   none of that is unforgivable. Are you with me?
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:52.880]   Every single sin that you're carrying in your heart, in your life,
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:58.880]   anything that's ever happened, you can be cleansed from that because Christ is faithful.
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:01.880]   He doesn't say, "I'm just going to pop it up, zip you out. It's fine."
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:04.880]   He doesn't treat it lightly. He says, "I'm going to get into the root of it.
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:08.880]   I am faithful and the cross has dealt with it and you can know times of refleshing.
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:11.880]   You are blessed."
[01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:17.880]   Now, this is a great joy, but David goes on to do something that's really important.
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:21.880]   He goes on to say, "The problem we have as Christians, though,
[01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:25.880]   is that even though we have this ability to confess and repent,
[01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:30.880]   our issue is we very rarely do so."
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:36.880]   Yeah, not the best, but it's not really hurting anyone.
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:40.880]   Nobody knows about it. I've gotten away with it for some time.
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:43.880]   I guess I'll just keep getting on with it.
[01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:47.880]   It's very easy for us, I think, as Christians to recognize that there is this brokenness in us
[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:49.880]   and to hold on to it.
[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:54.880]   I want you to hear how David describes what it is to hold on to unconfessed sin.
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:13:00.880]   Verse 3 and 4, "When I kept silent, when I just kind of went, 'Meh, no big deal,'
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:01.880]   here's what happened.
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:05.880]   My bones wasted away, though through my groaning all day long,
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:08.880]   for day and night your hand was heavy upon me.
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:12.880]   My strength was sapped as in the summer heat," or the heat of the summer.
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:16.880]   He says, "Here's how it felt when I didn't confess, when I didn't repent,
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:21.880]   when I realized that I'm blessed, but the problem is I held on to my sin
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:22.880]   and I remained silent.
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:26.880]   And here's what it felt like. It felt like my bones were wasting away."
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:29.880]   I wonder if anybody resonates with that in this room, because I know I do.
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:31.880]   "It felt like my bones were wasting away.
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:33.880]   It felt like I was groaning all day long.
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:37.880]   It felt like I had a heaviness, a yoke upon me.
[01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:40.880]   It felt like I was in Hong Kong in the middle of the summer,
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:42.880]   and it was crazy humidity, and I was wearing too many clothes,
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:46.880]   and I'm sweaty, and I'm tired, and I'm worn out, and I just want to go home.
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:48.880]   That's what it feels like.
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:51.880]   When I kept silent, that was what my life was like."
[01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:53.880]   And I want you to see what David is doing.
[01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:54.880]   Listen to this. This is really important.
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:56.880]   Here's what David's doing in this psalm.
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:00.880]   He's setting up two true realities, the reality of being blessed,
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:04.880]   because you have your sins forgiven, and the reality of holding on to your sins
[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:07.880]   and feeling anything other than being blessed. Are you with me?
[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:10.880]   And David is basically saying, "Choose one of those things,"
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:13.880]   because every single human being is going to be in one of those things.
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:15.880]   You're either blessed because you know that your sins are forgiven,
[01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:17.880]   and you're finding refreshing times in the Lord,
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:20.880]   or your bones are wasting away, and there's this groaning in you,
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:25.880]   and a heaviness upon you, and it feels like your energy is sapped from the summer heat.
[01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:30.880]   He's like, "Those are the two realities in life you can choose."
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:35.880]   "When I kept silent, that was my choice. My bones wasted away.
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:41.880]   When I confessed, something changed. Something happened."
[01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:45.880]   It's very easy for us, however, to remain silent.
[01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:48.880]   And here's the question we need to ask ourselves this morning.
[01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:55.880]   Why do we as Christians, when we understand the benefits of confession and repentance,
[01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:59.880]   very often remain silent?
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:03.880]   Why is it that we don't always confess and repent?
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:07.880]   Let me offer you a couple of quick thoughts.
[01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:12.880]   I think one of the reasons why we don't is because we actually deny the reality of sin.
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:14.880]   We actually just deny it.
[01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:18.880]   We actually think we don't call it sin. We call it, "Ah, just a little mistake."
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:25.880]   Or we look in the mirror like I did and go, "Ah, yeah. Nah. Don't need to do anything."
[01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:27.880]   And we actually deny the reality of our sin.
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:32.880]   One of the very first things we need to do is actually be honest with ourselves about what it is that we carry.
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:37.880]   That doesn't mean it has to come with emotions of guilt and shame and wrath and anger.
[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:39.880]   It doesn't mean that we have to go there.
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:43.880]   But we have to kind of say to ourselves, "I recognize that there is a brokenness I'm carrying."
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:47.880]   "And that brokenness is not right. I recognize that it breaks the heart of God."
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:49.880]   "I recognize that this is not what I've been created for."
[01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:52.880]   "And I recognize that there's another way that I could be living."
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:55.880]   We have to take seriously the reality of our sin.
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:58.880]   I eventually had to deal with that thing on my back.
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:01.880]   This is what confession is, my friends.
[01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:04.880]   Confession is taking ownership of our sin.
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:13.880]   You see, you cannot repent of sin until you have first confessed your sin.
[01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:18.880]   Repentance of sin, the changing from it, and being back in right relationship with God,
[01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:21.880]   only happens when we take ownership of our sin.
[01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:26.880]   When we confess it, confession is saying, "Yeah, I recognize that there is this sin in my life."
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:30.880]   It's actually verbalizing in our hearts or even out loud with others
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:34.880]   that there is a brokenness that we're dealing with and we cannot deal with on our own.
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:39.880]   You cannot have repentance of sin until there is first confession of sin.
[01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:40.880]   Does that make sense?
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:44.880]   And one of the reasons why I think we don't confess is we don't take that part seriously enough.
[01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:47.880]   We deny the reality of our sin.
[01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:50.880]   I think the second reason why we don't confess and repent sometimes
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:56.880]   is because we fail to find true sorrow in us for our sin.
[01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:59.880]   It's interesting, the word "confession" in the Greek in the New Testament
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:04.880]   is actually the word homo legeo.
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:06.880]   And homo legeo is two words broken down.
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:10.880]   Homos means "the same," and legeo means "to speak."
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:15.880]   And it's really interesting that the Bible would use this word to talk about the act of confession,
[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:23.880]   because really what it's saying is that the act of confession is to speak the same thing about sin as God does.
[01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:28.880]   It is to say the same thing about sin as God does.
[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:31.880]   And here's what God says about sin.
[01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:33.880]   Sin breaks relationship.
[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:36.880]   Sin breaks relationship with one another, and it breaks relationship with Him.
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:40.880]   Sin breaks His heart, because He sees what He has created you for,
[01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:44.880]   and He knows how sin holds you back from the things that He has created you for.
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:47.880]   Those are the things that God says about sin.
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:50.880]   He also says that Jesus has paid the price for sin.
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:55.880]   He also says that there is a way for you to be blessed and not to be silent anymore.
[01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:57.880]   He says all of that about sin.
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:05.880]   So when we confess, our sorrow is aligning ourselves to say we actually agree with God that the sin is not right,
[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:08.880]   that the sin that I'm struggling with breaks His heart,
[01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:15.880]   that the sin that I'm holding on to is my reality, when actually I could be someone who's released from that in forgiveness with Him.
[01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:23.880]   When we confess, we are aligning our heart, our values, our voice, our mouth to the same things that God says about sin.
[01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:24.880]   Are you with me?
[01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:31.880]   We're not embracing all of that stuff that comes with the negative fear-based side of it.
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:37.880]   We're releasing it to Him, and we're saying the same things about sin as God says,
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:40.880]   which includes, "I love you."
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:47.880]   It's actually realizing and recognizing that we are still loved despite the reality of our sin.
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:54.880]   The third reason why I think we hold on to sin and we don't repent and confess is because we think we're alone in our sin.
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:58.880]   This is a very powerful, subtle thing.
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:04.880]   We come into church, and we say, "Wow, Pastor Tim. Oh, man. Pastor Tim's awesome.
[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:06.880]   Pastor Tim's great.
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:08.880]   Pastor Tim's a perfect Christian.
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:13.880]   Pastor Tim's a great husband, a great dad. He's a great pastor, a great preacher.
[01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:16.880]   Oh, man, look at his life. I wish my life was like that.
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:19.880]   He doesn't struggle with anything, but I'm struggling.
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:23.880]   Oh, look at everybody around my row. They're all raising their hands in worship.
[01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:26.880]   Oh, man, they look great. They look like they got life all sorted out.
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:28.880]   I don't have life sorted out.
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:33.880]   If I told somebody here that my life wasn't sorted out, but their lives are perfect, that's not going to go well.
[01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:34.880]   Are you with me?
[01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:38.880]   We come into a church environment, and we think we're alone in our sin.
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:40.880]   Let me just be very honest with you.
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:42.880]   Tim is a sinner.
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:44.880]   I'm a sinner.
[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:48.880]   I'm your senior pastor, and I'm a sinner in need of a Savior.
[01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:50.880]   There are no perfect people here.
[01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:55.880]   Because that's our reality as people in Christ, that we are broken.
[01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:57.880]   We are sinners in need of Him.
[01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:00.880]   No one is alone in their sin in this room.
[01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:02.880]   Not any of us.
[01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:04.880]   We're all one family.
[01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:09.880]   All one family, recognizing that we all carry stuff, and we all have to deal with stuff.
[01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:11.880]   There's all individual things that are going on in our lives.
[01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:13.880]   You are not alone.
[01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:20.880]   Every time you step in here on a Sunday, you come into a family who loves you, embraces you, thinks you're awesome,
[01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:25.880]   who will walk with you in the brokenness of your sin as they walk in the brokenness of theirs.
[01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:30.880]   In fact, as we do it together, the Bible says, when we confess together, we forgive.
[01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:35.880]   When He forgives us and we find healing, it's a wonderful invitation from Him.
[01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:37.880]   But the fourth thing is even worse.
[01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:42.880]   Because in the fourth thing, we think if we do share, we're going to be judged and condemned for what we share.
[01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:44.880]   This is another reason why we don't share our sin.
[01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:46.880]   Because we think other people are going to judge us, they're going to condemn us.
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:49.880]   And maybe some of you in this room, that's been your experience in church.
[01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:56.880]   Maybe you come into a church, maybe even the Vine, and you come into a church, and you felt condemned, or you felt judged for your sin.
[01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:59.880]   Let me tell you, that is not the way church should be.
[01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:00.880]   That is your experience.
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:05.880]   Don't allow somebody else's sin to stop you from dealing with your own.
[01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:06.880]   Are you with me?
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:10.880]   Don't allow someone else's sin, because if you've been treated that way, that's a sinful thing.
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:11.880]   You shouldn't have been treated that way.
[01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:14.880]   Instead, you should be able to come into a church like this, in an environment like this.
[01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:19.880]   And I know that Tim's heart, Ivan's heart, my heart, is to create an environment at the Vine,
[01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:21.880]   where you feel accepted no matter what's going on in your life.
[01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:24.880]   Where you feel loved no matter what brokenness it is that you carry.
[01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:29.880]   Where you feel like the Vine is a home for you, even in the depths of the brokenness that you're trying to deal with.
[01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:33.880]   You come in here, you will be loved, you will be accepted, you'll be embraced.
[01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:37.880]   We will do our very best to see you as God sees you.
[01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:40.880]   A sinner in need of a Savior.
[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:43.880]   Just like us.
[01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:44.880]   Are you with me?
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:50.880]   Now, I want you to see how then David then flips things when he begins to confess.
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:55.880]   In verse 5 he says, "Then I acknowledged my sin to you, and I did not cover up my iniquity anymore."
[01:21:55.880 --> 01:22:03.880]   I said, "I will confess my sins to the Lord, and you forgive the guilt, and forgave the guilt of my sin."
[01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:04.880]   Isn't that beautiful?
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:07.880]   I confess to you, and you came and you forgave me.
[01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:11.880]   He said, "This is awesome. I no longer covered it up anymore.
[01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:17.880]   I welcomed myself into this relationship that I have with you, and now that I'm in that relationship, I've been set free."
[01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:20.880]   It is a wonderful thing.
[01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:23.880]   Some of us in this room, as we finish this 21-day fast,
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:26.880]   and as we come into this idea that we want fresh encounters with God,
[01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:29.880]   as we desire to be in deeper intimacy with Him,
[01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:37.880]   the greatest tool available to you is just to confess and repent.
[01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:40.880]   Not because you feel terrible, and you feel like you're the worst,
[01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:43.880]   and you've got to try to appease an angry God,
[01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:47.880]   but because you're blessed, and Christ has gone to the cross,
[01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:52.880]   and in the joy that there is in knowing times of refreshment with Him,
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:57.880]   we come and we express, we confess.
[01:22:57.880 --> 01:22:59.880]   I want to finish with this.
[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:04.880]   Confession in Scripture is not just about confessing sin,
[01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:07.880]   it's also about confessing faith.
[01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:15.880]   In fact, we ought to confess our faith in Christ as often as we confess our sin before Christ.
[01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:17.880]   Come on, church, this is really important.
[01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:23.880]   We ought to confess our faith in Christ as much as we ought to confess our sins before Christ,
[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:29.880]   because our confession of faith actually creates the environment whereby we know that we can deal with our sin.
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:32.880]   As we confess that we believe that Jesus did go to the cross,
[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:35.880]   that He did pay the price, that He was raised again,
[01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:40.880]   and that the same Spirit that raised Jesus from the death raises me and is in me,
[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:42.880]   that I'm reconciled in my relationship with Him,
[01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:48.880]   our confession of faith puts us in a place where we know Christ can deal with our sin.
[01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:52.880]   So confession of faith actually will spur you on to confess sin more,
[01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:58.880]   and your confession of sin will actually create the space for you to have more faith.
[01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:01.880]   Come on, church, follow this. This is really important.
[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:02.880]   Okay, I'm going to say that one more time.
[01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:08.880]   Your confession of faith, what you believe about Jesus, will open you up to confess your sin more.
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:13.880]   And when you confess your sin more, you will find yourself with more faith,
[01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:15.880]   which then will enable you to confess more sin.
[01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:20.880]   And God has created this biblical circle of life together, if you will,
[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:25.880]   where confession of faith and confession of sin strengthens who you are
[01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:28.880]   and strengthens our community as a church.
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:33.880]   That's the invitation. That's joyful.
[01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:37.880]   And so as you come to the end of the fast today,
[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:41.880]   and as you desire to connect more deeply with Christ this year,
[01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:44.880]   I wonder whether you could shift your thinking
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:50.880]   and become somebody who lives out of the joy of bringing your brokenness to Christ,
[01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:54.880]   having short accounts with Him from a place of joy,
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:58.880]   knowing that the work of the cross is for you and for your neighbor,
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:01.880]   knowing that we could create something in this room
[01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:04.880]   that actually has something to say to the world out there.
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:08.880]   Could you imagine if church was actually a place
[01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:12.880]   where rather than people out there going, "That's a place of judgment.
[01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:14.880]   That's a place of condemnation.
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:18.880]   That's a place where they just talk about sin and make you feel bad about yourself."
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:23.880]   Imagine if people out there were like, "Church is a place where people love.
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:26.880]   Church is a place where people feel safe.
[01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:30.880]   Church is a place where people actually can deal with some of their bad habits
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:32.880]   and some of the stuff in their life.
[01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:36.880]   Church is actually a beautiful thing."
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:41.880]   That's joy-based confession and repentance
[01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:45.880]   that welcomes in everybody to knowing Christ.
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:48.880]   I want to pray for you today that that would be your journey
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:52.880]   and that in the discipline of confession and repentance,
[01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:57.880]   you will find yourself intimately engaged with Him.
[01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:01.880]   Let Him come and untangle what only He can untangle.
[01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:04.880]   Can I pray for you? Let's pray.
[01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:08.880]   Maybe if you're just in the quietness of your heart now,
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:11.880]   if this has been a helpful message,
[01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:14.880]   I wonder whether you just, where you are, just open your hands before the Lord.
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:20.880]   That's just a symbol of saying, "I'm open to hearing from you, Jesus."
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:27.880]   Father, we come now seeing all the things that David speaks of in Psalm 32,
[01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:32.880]   knowing we're blessed and yet recognizing so often we're silent,
[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:38.880]   knowing that we have a God who completely and perfectly purifies His church
[01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:41.880]   and yet realizing that our bones waste away so often
[01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:46.880]   because we hold on to the brokenness that we carry.
[01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:51.880]   Father, I thank You that David said, "I found myself confessing to You
[01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:58.880]   and I experienced Your forgiveness, and I know what it is now to be set free."
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:00.880]   Lord, I pray for every person in here,
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:04.880]   that they would change their thinking about confession and repentance
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:07.880]   away from an angry God who wants to smite them
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:13.880]   to a loving God who is welcoming them to times of refreshing,
[01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:18.880]   fresh encounters.
[01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:23.880]   So I wonder whether you just quieten your heart before the Lord in this moment.
[01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:30.880]   As you're sitting there with your hands open and your heart turned to Him,
[01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:37.880]   may I invite you to start by asking Him to reveal truth to you.
[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:46.880]   Invite Him to speak to you about what it is that you might be carrying around with you.
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:50.880]   What cyst, if you will, might be on your back.
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:58.880]   Maybe it's been there for some time, just like it was for me.
[01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:01.880]   Allow Him to show you. You might be surprised.
[01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:03.880]   Maybe when you came in here you'd be like,
[01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:05.880]   "This is the area God would speak to me about,"
[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:08.880]   but in this moment He shows something else to you.
[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:14.880]   I want to encourage you to trust the Holy Spirit.
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:18.880]   Holy Spirit, would you come and speak to your children?
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:20.880]   We love each person here so much.
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:23.880]   You want them to run the race that you have set before them
[01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:26.880]   without anything that hinders them.
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:29.880]   And you've provided the way for them to be free.
[01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:33.880]   So come, Holy Spirit, come.
[01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:39.880]   I pray you would speak.
[01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:41.880]   And as you notice the Holy Spirit showing you something,
[01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:44.880]   the next step is just to confess that before Him.
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:50.880]   As I shared earlier, to take that responsibility in your heart
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:56.880]   and in that confession just bring it to Him.
[01:28:56.880 --> 01:29:06.880]   To say the same thing about sin that He would.
[01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:09.880]   And in that you can ask Him to forgive you
[01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:13.880]   and to ask Him to show you that forgiveness,
[01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:17.880]   that peace that surpasses our understanding,
[01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:22.880]   that swinging pendulum of the clock to actually be still
[01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:26.880]   and to find your soul at rest in Him again,
[01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:31.880]   knowing that you are blessed.
[01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:34.880]   So, Holy Spirit, I pray that you would release, Lord.
[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:40.880]   You would release the power and the joy of forgiveness over your people.
[01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:43.880]   And that, Lord, this spiritual discipline of confession and repentance
[01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:47.880]   would be something that we joyfully embrace as a community,
[01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:49.880]   that we would come here on Sundays willing to be open
[01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:52.880]   and vulnerable with one another,
[01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:56.880]   that we would have the courage to ask people to pray for us,
[01:29:56.880 --> 01:30:00.880]   that we would desire to keep these short accounts together,
[01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:06.880]   to pray for one another and expect the healing that comes from that,
[01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:10.880]   to be an example of the love of Christ to the world
[01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:18.880]   and to model a new narrative in how we treat each other.
[01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:22.880]   And Father, I thank you that there is great hope
[01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:28.880]   and that intimacy is the fruit of a life of short accounts with you.
[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:30.880]   And so, Lord, I want to pray for that this week,
[01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:32.880]   that as some people do some work with you,
[01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:34.880]   whether in this moment or in the week ahead,
[01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:38.880]   that they would find themselves stepping into that greater place of intimacy
[01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:41.880]   and joy in you.
[01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:46.880]   So just take a moment just in this time here
[01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:52.880]   to just do your own walk with Christ now
[01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:56.880]   as He leads you by His Spirit.

[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:19.880]   Yes Lord, we thank you that we can come to you
[01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:22.880]   and that you receive us,
[01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:24.880]   that you receive us, that you have broken us,
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:26.880]   but you don't leave us there.
[01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:32.880]   You forgive us, you restore us as we confess, as we repent,
[01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:36.880]   and you just pour your mercy, your grace over us.
[01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:40.880]   And it is, you bring us joy and refreshing.
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:45.880]   And so Lord, I ask for that, for us here,
[01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:52.880]   that you pour out this joy and this refreshing of forgiveness
[01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:58.880]   as we've brought to you the things that you've convicted us that are not right.
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:01.880]   And so we pray that we can now walk in joy,
[01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:05.880]   that we can walk in freedom because of what you have done.
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:10.880]   We pray all this in your name, Jesus. Amen. Amen.
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:14.880]   Well, thank you worship team for joining us.
