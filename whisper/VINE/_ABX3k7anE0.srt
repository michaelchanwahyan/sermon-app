1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Why don't we put hands together for Benedict? It's amazing.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 I especially love the soundtrack analogy.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 So, this week earlier I was editing June's video on Instagram

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 and I posted it and something was off.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 And I re-watched again, oh, I forgot to put the soundtrack there.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 So it sounds different. Although her message is still very good,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 but it still sounds a little bit different.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 So I re-uploaded it. So the soundtrack is very important.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Can we put hands together for him again for that? Yes.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Let me put this down.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 So, this is the third week of Advent.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 We are 10 days away from Christmas.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 How are you guys doing?

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Too many parties already?

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 You're like, "Oh, good. Too many parties, too many wine.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 I'm so tired."

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Too many parties?

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Anybody went to more than like three Christmas parties already?

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Yeah.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Yeah.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Well, yeah, staff and small group and our daughter's school's

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Christmas parties were three.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Anyway, party is great. Party is good.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Nobody believes the pastor is saying, "Hey, come on."

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Parties are biblical, all right?

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 You see parties in the Bible.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 As long as we are doing the, you know, we're celebrating for the

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 right thing, we're not getting wasted.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 It's biblical. Come on.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Do you know that when we get saved, there's a party going on

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 in heaven? You know that, right?

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 So celebration, it's good.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 It's biblical.

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 And in fact, celebration, it's a vital part of life.

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 It's so important that what we're doing here every Sunday

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 morning or afternoon, it's a celebration in itself, right?

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 The songs we sing, the way we, you know, the way you clap, the

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 way we do what we do, it's part of a celebration, amen?

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 I'm like, okay, half of you, half agree with me.

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Okay.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 All right.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 I still love you.

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Anyway.

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 So Christmas is coming.

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 I'm sure you've been hearing a lot of music going on.

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 We did sing some Christmas songs.

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 And in the car, I play Christmas songs.

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 And fun fact, my daughter asked me to play a Christmas song a

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 couple weeks ago.

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Said I want a Christmas song in the car.

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 I was about to reach for, you know, jingle bells or something.

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 And she said, I want "Last Christmas."

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 [Laughter]

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Yeah.

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 So you know the music taste of my daughter now.

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Anyway, yeah, music, it's so beautiful.

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 And we sang a lot of Christmas songs, a lot of songs we do,

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 they are for Christmas only.

59
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 Worship team, we have a special set list for Christmas.

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 And in fact, in the Bible story or in the Bible narrative, when

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 you look into it, in the gospel of Luke, those chapters talking

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 about the birth of Jesus, there were indeed some songs inside.

63
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Today we're going to talk about one of them.

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 And that song, it's by Mary, Jesus' mother.

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Let me just read that to you in fact here.

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Sorry, this is what the water is for.

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Sorry.

68
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 So we'll start from Luke 1, verse 46.

69
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 There it says, "Mary said, 'My soul glorifies the Lord, and my

70
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 spirit rejoices in God my Savior.

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 For he has been mindful of the humble state of his servant," me

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 basically, "from now on all generations will call me blessed.

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 For the mighty one has done great things for me.

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Holy is his name.

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 His mercies extend to those who fear him from generation to

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 generation.

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 He has performed mighty deeds with his arms.

78
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 He has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts.

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 He has brought down rulers from their thrones but has lifted up

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 the humble.

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 He has filled the hungry with good things but has sent the rich

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 away empty.

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 He has helped his servant Israel, remembering to be merciful to

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 Abraham and his descendants forever, just as he promised our

85
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 ancestors."

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 So you probably would have heard of this before.

87
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Some composer, they even used these words, composed music, put a

88
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 soundtrack to these words, and it becomes songs that we would

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 sing throughout different centuries of the church.

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 And we've been calling this song or this passage the "Magnificat."

91
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 It comes from the very first word in this passage in the Latin

92
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Bible.

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 So this -- oh, it's on the screen.

94
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 Thank you.

95
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 This "Magnificat," it's a beautiful piece.

96
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 But if you start reading it and if you are a Bible reader, you

97
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 like to read, for example, the Psalms in the Old Testament when

98
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 you can't sleep or maybe you can sleep, you just love reading the

99
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Bible.

100
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 You start reading it.

101
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 You find a little bit of similarities.

102
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 This Psalm started with, you know, "My soul glorifies the Lord

103
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 and my spirit," and my spirit does what?

104
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 My spirit will also, you know, sing him praises.

105
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 My spirit is also worshiping him, worship God, my Savior.

106
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 And this kind of reminds you of something like Psalm 103, right?

107
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 You know, "Bless the Lord, O my soul," something like that.

108
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 And if we continue to read and we would see this Psalm, actually,

109
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 it follows a certain format.

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 This format in the Old Testament Psalm, one of the hymns we call

111
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 it, we call this kind of Psalm a "Thanksgiving Psalm," a

112
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 "Thanksgiving poem."

113
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 And it always starts with a call to worship or a call to praise

114
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 God or in itself just a statement to praise God, like what I just

115
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 said, "Bless the Lord, O my soul."

116
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 It's a statement calling myself to praise God.

117
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 This is what Mary is doing here.

118
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 "My soul, my soul, my soul glorifies the Lord."

119
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 And it's like one of these old Psalms that we normally read.

120
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 And when Mary says, "My soul and my spirit," she is actually saying,

121
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 "My very being, my whole self, I'll be here to praise God,

122
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 to worship him, to love him, to bring glory to him."

123
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 And that's what it is.

124
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 But, you know, this is what we do nowadays as well.

125
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 We have songs like this, "Bless the Lord, O my soul."

126
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 And then, you know, we sing a lot of songs every Sunday.

127
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 We do this every single week.

128
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 We have praise songs.

129
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 We praise God whenever we come into church.

130
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 So praise is part of the routine, the activities that we do here.

131
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 And we can just follow the screen.

132
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 There are lyrics right now, and we just follow, and we sing something.

133
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Sometimes you feel your heart is resonating or your heart really,

134
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 "Wow, it really makes my heart beat," you know, when I see those

135
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 lyrics, when I'm singing those.

136
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 Sometimes you're like, "Oh, okay.

137
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 That's all right."

138
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 But for Jewish worshipers, whenever they're worshipping,

139
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 yes, this call to worship, this statement of worship, yes,

140
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 it's important.

141
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 But they always have the next part in their psalm.

142
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 And they always have a word, a transition word that sounds like,

143
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 "For I bless the Lord, I love you, Lord.

144
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 For you have done certain things for me."

145
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 They always put a reason.

146
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 They always put a testimony of their own story to that psalm.

147
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 They're always telling you, "I'm here to praise God.

148
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 I'm here to worship him because something he has done for me in my life."

149
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 In other words, praise, there's always a reason for it.

150
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 And a joy in our lives, there's always a source for our joy.

151
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 Let me say that again.

152
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 There's always a reason for our praise, and there's always a source

153
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 for our joy.

154
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 That's what the Old Testament Psalms, and we see how people worship.

155
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 That's what they're trying to do.

156
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 They're saying, "My praise is not empty.

157
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 There's always a reason behind to back it up."

158
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 That's my question for us today.

159
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 I'm wondering when we walk through these doors, when we come and praise God,

160
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 is there a reason behind our worship?

161
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 We can put that slide for those words just now.

162
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 Do we have a reason for our worship?

163
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 When we walk in, do we feel, "Wow, yes, God, I'm praising you today

164
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 because of this or that," or sometimes it feels like we're just going

165
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 through the motions?

166
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 And I know sometimes we all do that.

167
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 We all go through the motions.

168
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Maybe we're half awake, or maybe, you know, for me, it was Manchester United

169
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 that suffered a huge defeat last night.

170
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 When I come in on Sunday morning, oh, yeah, bless the Lord, oh, my soul.

171
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Yeah.

172
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 Like, oh, my gosh.

173
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 So sometimes that happens, but I want to reassure you that if sometimes

174
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 you don't feel like saying those words, you don't feel you're totally connected

175
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 with the lyrics, it's not a sin, I just want to tell you, but that also shows us

176
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 that we're missing out on something.

177
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 It's an omission.

178
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 We're missing out on something because when these people, when the people of God

179
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 in the Bible, when they're praising God, they said, "There's always a reason.

180
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 I can always think of something that he has done for me in my life."

181
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 And unless your God stopped working in your life, unless your God no longer

182
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 exists in your life, otherwise, there should always be a reason.

183
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 There should always be something that he's doing in your life that gives you,

184
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 that brings you to praise, brings you to worship him.

185
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 And so here, when we look at the Song of Mary, the Magnificat, we can see that

186
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 this song, she starts with, "My soul glorifies the Lord.

187
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 I bless him.

188
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 I praise him, and for he has done great things for me."

189
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 But she didn't just stop there.

190
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 She didn't just stop with her own personal story, what God has done for me.

191
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 She goes on and on and on to talk about the character of God.

192
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 And throughout this song, you would see God is mighty, he's powerful,

193
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 but he's also merciful.

194
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 He said he will have mercy on those who fear him, like he draws near to us,

195
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 that he will be good to us.

196
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 He knows what we're going through, and he will not abandon us.

197
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 So God is powerful.

198
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 He is merciful.

199
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 But then at the same time, she also shows us that we have a God who is just.

200
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 In him, we find justice.

201
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 And justice in the biblical world, it means God is going to lift up the

202
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 humble, and he's going to humble those who are proud, something we explored

203
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 in a previous sermon series.

204
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 And you can go back and listen to that again, and that's our God.

205
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 That's what he's doing.

206
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 And so when we look at Mary's song, we see that she starts with calling us

207
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 and calling herself to worship, and then she moved on to giving a very

208
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 reason why she's worshiping God right now, why she's praising with her own

209
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 story what God has done for her.

210
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 And she talks about what God has done for all her people, how that shows

211
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 God's character.

212
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 And we see that there's a great reversal that we have seen, what we talked

213
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 about, he will bring down those rulers from their thrones, he will lift up

214
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 the humble, and we see that's what God's going to do.

215
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 For Mary, that's something she experienced very personally, because she

216
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 knows she was a nobody.

217
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 She's from a nobody town called Nazareth, and she's a nobody there.

218
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 If God choose to come into this world as a baby, probably he should have

219
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 choose someone more prominent, someone more like her relative Elizabeth,

220
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 or maybe when she was a bit younger, because Elizabeth is a bit old now,

221
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 but somebody who looks perfect, who has a perfect record, who comes from a

222
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 great family, maybe those people should be the ones who carry this baby Jesus

223
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 or the Messiah.

224
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 But Mary knew, wow, God is going to come here and turn everything upside

225
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 down.

226
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 And it's not just for Mary, it's not just for herself, that's for the entire

227
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 world, because the kingdom of God that this baby inside of her womb, Jesus, he

228
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 came to establish is an upside-down kingdom.

229
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 It's to reverse the world order, it's to turn things upside down, and that's

230
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 what Mary was trying to communicate to us in this song.

231
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 It's beautiful, it's biblical.

232
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 We read about that Jesus talked about this kind of stuff.

233
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 But today I want to draw your attention to one particular line of this song.

234
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 Mary says this, "From now on, all generations will call me blessed."

235
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 I know, we're here sitting in 2024, we look back this story in the Bible from

236
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 2,000 years ago, I'm like, "Yeah, of course, Mary, of course you're blessed.

237
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Come on, you're the mother of Jesus."

238
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 And in some areas, there are people who would even say prayers to you, and you're

239
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 in a place where everybody celebrates you at least every Christmas we talk about

240
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 you.

241
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 I remember as a young kid when I was in my church, I was a four or five-year-old

242
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 kid, they made us do a Christmas play, and I think I was Joseph, and I learned

243
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 about Joseph and Mary there, and I was like four or five.

244
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 Even young kids know about her.

245
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 Of course you're blessed, what are you talking about?

246
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 Of course that's true if we look at that story from a 2024 perspective.

247
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 But today I want to bring us back to the first century.

248
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 I want to bring us back to the time and space where this story actually happened.

249
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 You know that this story happened about 2,000 years ago in Middle East in an

250
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 area called Judea.

251
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 So Jewish people, they have their own customs, they have their own laws, they

252
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 have their own religious laws.

253
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 When Mary, when the angel one day show up to her and say, "Hey, you know what,

254
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 Mary?

255
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 You're going to get pregnant because God loves you.

256
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 You're going to get pregnant.

257
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Yes, I know you're not married yet, but don't worry, you're going to get

258
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 pregnant."

259
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 What?

260
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 "Don't worry, you're going to get pregnant, okay?

261
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Because God loves you, he favors you, you're going to get pregnant."

262
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 If I were Mary, honestly I would freak out.

263
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 I'm like, "What are you talking about?

264
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 Oh, no."

265
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 Because like some parts of the world, maybe in a city among the more Chinese

266
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 culture, it's still true.

267
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 If you're unmarried and you're pregnant, it's actually a big deal.

268
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 In the Jewish culture, any unmarried pregnancy, it's considered a sin.

269
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 And the Jewish law is actually punishable by death.

270
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 Of course, during that time, nobody really does that anymore, but it's still

271
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 a big sin.

272
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 So you get rejected by your husband or your fiance, you get rejected by your

273
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 own family, your own father, and those synagogue leaders, those Pharisees,

274
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 they will brand you as a sinner.

275
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 It sounds familiar, we talked about that a couple of weeks ago.

276
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 You will become a sinner, you will become an outcast of the society from now on.

277
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 Nobody wants to do business with you, nobody wants to talk to you, nobody wants

278
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 to stay near you.

279
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 People, when they see you, "Oh, okay, hi, I'm sorry."

280
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 They will just run away from you.

281
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 Nobody would want to be with you anymore.

282
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 That's what we're talking about here.

283
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 If you said, you know, "Mission Impossible," you say yes to this mission,

284
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 if you say yes to it, you're going to be an outcast for the rest of your life.

285
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 Nobody is going to have, won't have anything to do with you.

286
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 That was what Mary facing during that time.

287
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 And so when this angel showed up, when the angel broke the news to her,

288
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 when she said, "I'm the Lord's servant," there is a prize there.

289
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 There's a huge prize indeed.

290
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 And today I want to continue to read with us a few verses before that song.

291
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 I'm going to read from Luke 1, verse 39.

292
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 It says, so 38, that's the end of the angel, Gabriel, bringing that message to her.

293
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 Verse 39 says this, "At that time, Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country

294
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 of Judea, where she entered Zechariah's home and greeted Elizabeth."

295
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 So Mary, she lives in Nazareth in Galilee, and she's going to this place,

296
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 a hill country of Judea.

297
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 That's about 80 to 110 kilometers, give or take.

298
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 If you start your journey here from Yuen Long and walk for 110 kilometers,

299
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 you probably, one of the possible places you would end up in, it's Guangzhou.

300
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 Of course now, as Hong Kongers, we take the high-speed rail, you'll be there in less than an hour.

301
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 But we're talking about 2,000 years ago.

302
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 We're talking about this rural area, so she would have to walk all the way there,

303
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 and she could only take this journey by herself.

304
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 And we're seeing that she's actually not in a good mood to do a road trip.

305
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 We think, oh yeah, there's a relative, let's go and visit her.

306
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 That's what we do sometimes, right?

307
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 Okay, I'm going back home to see my family, you know?

308
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 See you in a few weeks, bye, that's Christmas, that's what everybody does.

309
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 That's not what Mary is doing.

310
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 She's not doing a road trip to see her friends or relatives or family.

311
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 It's not a pleasant trip for her.

312
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 Maybe, in fact, while she was traveling, she's asking herself a lot of questions.

313
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 She got a lot of things going on in her mind, things like,

314
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 "What am I going to say to my family when they find out eventually?

315
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 What should I tell Joseph?

316
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 Will he even believe me?

317
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 Will he even try to listen to me if I tell him I got a baby,

318
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 and that baby is from the Holy Spirit, you know?

319
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 Will he even listen to me?"

320
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 You see, when Mary was on her way to see Elizabeth,

321
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 she probably might be filled with confusion and questions and different emotions

322
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 all mixed up inside of her.

323
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 That shocking news from the angel would probably have disoriented her life

324
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 or even turned her life upside down.

325
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 As a teenager, she had to face a challenge that she would have never imagined before.

326
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 As I was reading this story, I was actually wondering in my head,

327
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 "Did Mary take this trip before or after the angel Gabriel appeared to Joseph in Matthew 1?"

328
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 If you know the story in Matthew 1, the angel actually appeared to Joseph

329
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 to tell him the same message because before the angel visited Joseph,

330
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 he was actually thinking about divorcing Mary, saying, "Sorry, this is over.

331
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 I don't know what you're talking about.

332
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 I don't understand. You mean you're pregnant?

333
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 We're not married. How can this happen?

334
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 You must be with another man. Sorry, Mary. I like you.

335
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 You're cute. You're great. And you're beautiful.

336
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 But you're pregnant. So I'm sorry. This is the end."

337
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 And the Bible says he wants to do it quietly.

338
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 He wants to say, like, "Goodbye. That's it.

339
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 Let's break up. Last Christmas, I gave you my heart, but that's it.

340
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 All right?"

341
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 So my guess is, my guess, the Bible didn't say this timeline,

342
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 but my guess is that this trip was even before Joseph found out.

343
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 Because number one, there's no ultrasound in those days.

344
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 And number two, for a girl even to find herself pregnant, to confirm her pregnancy,

345
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 I have two kids, so I know.

346
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 It takes at least like a month or a few more weeks when your period stops

347
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 and you start to wonder and you check.

348
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 I don't know how they do it before, like, all these--

349
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 Yeah, anyway, I don't know about technology in first century,

350
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 but it would at least take a few weeks or at least a few months for her to find out.

351
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 But she took this trip immediately to visit Elizabeth.

352
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 So perhaps she hasn't even thought about how to talk to Joseph yet.

353
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 She's just, you know, raising herself, her heart, like, "What am I going to do?

354
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 What am I going to say? What am I going to tell him?"

355
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 So this is where Mary was.

356
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 Maybe she hasn't even thought about how to talk to him.

357
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 Maybe, you know, maybe, maybe, maybe.

358
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 And yeah, of course, if you read the Bible in the Old Testament,

359
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 there is a prophecy in one of the prophets, Isaiah.

360
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 It says there will be a virgin giving birth to a kid.

361
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 If you take--if Mary take this prophecy to Joseph, to his family,

362
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 I have imagined that, you know, as a father myself,

363
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 I do believe in God's power that could be a virgin giving birth to a child,

364
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 but that would not be my daughter.

365
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 As a brother myself, I could totally believe that by God's power

366
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 there could be a virgin giving birth to a child, just not my sister.

367
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 As someone's ex-fiancé, because I'm a husband,

368
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 as an ex-fiancé, I could believe that God could miraculously make a virgin,

369
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 you know, give birth to a baby, but just not my fiancé.

370
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 You get what I mean?

371
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 Yeah, there could be a miracle, but that miracle wouldn't be in my home.

372
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 This is what Mary was facing.

373
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 The rejection, the scandal, the way people look at her,

374
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 the way people are rejecting her, don't want to have anything to do with her.

375
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 That's what Mary was facing.

376
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 Being an unmarried, pregnant teenager in the first century Jewish society

377
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 could be the worst nightmare.

378
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 It brings shame to her.

379
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 It brings shame to her family.

380
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 She'll be rejected by Joseph, by her father, by her synagogue community,

381
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 and for the rest of her life she's going to be branded as a sinner.

382
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 And because in the first century Jewish community, you know what?

383
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 Women, their social status, their economic status

384
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 is totally dependent on her family or her husband.

385
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 And so if she's unmarried, she's pregnant,

386
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 she didn't just mess up her social life or her self-esteem.

387
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 We're talking about her livelihood.

388
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 We're talking about every possible area in her life will be affected.

389
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 So if there's a simple way to describe the situation Mary was in,

390
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 she was simply in a crisis with her unmarried pregnancy.

391
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 And not only that, later because of this child of hers,

392
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 after this child was born, you know, she was rejected by other people as well.

393
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 Because of this pregnancy, when she was in Bethlehem,

394
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 when she was supposed to follow her fiancé to his hometown,

395
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 they were rejected.

396
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 They couldn't even find a place to stay,

397
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 and they had to give birth in an animal shelter.

398
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 And after this child was born, because this child was being hunted down,

399
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 they end up, this family end up as refugees in a country they had never lived in.

400
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 They become refugees.

401
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 And not only that, when this kid finally, you know, grew up,

402
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 she had to watch him being tortured to death, horrible death.

403
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 She had to watch it with her own eyes.

404
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 And if we add all these things up and you tell me,

405
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 "From now on, all generations will call me blessed,"

406
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 I think that doesn't quite add up to the math.

407
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 If you're telling me that's how God is going to bless me or bless you,

408
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 I don't know about you.

409
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 Probably I'll say, "Pass. I don't want to be blessed like that.

410
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 I don't want to be blessed in a way that I'll have to go through pain,

411
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 I'll have to go through suffering, I'll have to see a loved one die,

412
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 I'll have to be rejected many, many times."

413
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 I don't even know if that's blessing.

414
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 How about you?

415
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 What do you see as blessings of God in your life?

416
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 Is it possible in this scenario, if we look at it and we think about our lives,

417
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 would there be any scenario that God is actually blessing us,

418
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 but we simply miss it because we thought,

419
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 "No way, God cannot bless someone like that."

420
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 Would we be passing God's blessings without knowing and said,

421
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 "Sorry, I don't want this, I don't want this,"

422
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 but in fact, it's God's blessing in our life.

423
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 But what changed?

424
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 Like if she's going through so much suffering,

425
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 if she's going through so much trauma or so much stress

426
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 while she was on her way to see Elizabeth,

427
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 what has changed in that house that Mary suddenly said,

428
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 "You know what? From now on, all generations are going to call me blessed."

429
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 So why don't we find out what happened in that house of Zechariah and Elizabeth.

430
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 I'm going to read from verse 41.

431
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 "When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby, John the Baptist, inside her womb leaped,

432
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.

433
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 In a loud voice she exclaimed, 'Blessed are you among women!

434
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 Blessed is the child you will bear!

435
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 But why am I so favored that the mother of my Lord should come to me?

436
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears,

437
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 the baby in my womb leaped for joy.

438
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord would fulfill His promises to her."

439
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 It's beautiful here. It says, "Elizabeth, she was filled with the Holy Spirit,

440
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 and being inspired by the Holy Spirit, she recognized who the baby in the womb was."

441
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 It's interesting because the Holy Spirit has always been the one that points us to Jesus.

442
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 The Holy Spirit has always been the one that reveals Jesus to us.

443
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 This is the first person being filled with the Holy Spirit in the New Testament,

444
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 and her first reaction, she recognized Jesus.

445
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 "Oh, that's Jesus. Oh, that's the Messiah.

446
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 That's the mother of the Messiah, the mother of my Lord coming to me."

447
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 She recognized.

448
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 And because she knew who the baby was, so she said those words, "Blessed are you among women."

449
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 In today's terms, you are like not greatest of all time, you're the most blessed of all time.

450
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 So if you can come up with a meme like that, that's Mary,

451
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 and she's the most blessed of all time.

452
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 She's the most blessed woman of all time.

453
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 That's what she meant.

454
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 And what? All right, memes, right?

455
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 Okay, and said, "Oh, yeah, this will be my Lord."

456
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 And so Mary, Mary, we have to look at Mary.

457
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 She has experienced this blessing, but there are actually, according to the words of Elizabeth,

458
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 this blessing, there are two parts.

459
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 So the first part, of course, is that baby is the work of the Holy Spirit.

460
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 The Holy Spirit came and she become pregnant,

461
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 and that's her blessing because of the baby inside of her womb.

462
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 That's why she's blessed.

463
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 But you know that part, she doesn't have to do a thing.

464
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 She just sit there, do nothing, and "I'm pregnant."

465
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 She doesn't have to do anything.

466
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 Completely passive in this part of the blessing.

467
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 But then Elizabeth also talk about an active part in this blessing.

468
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 She said, "Blessed is the one who believed that the Lord will fulfill his promises to her."

469
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 In other words, when the angel came, Mary, she believed.

470
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 She believed the promises of God, no matter how difficult it seems,

471
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 no matter how crazy it sounds, she believed that God is gonna do something.

472
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 And that belief, that trust, that faith becomes a blessing in her life.

473
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 And so those who continue to believe, who continue to trust,

474
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 who continue to hold on to God's promises, just like Mary, they will be blessed.

475
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 But this is very important here.

476
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 When Elizabeth declared these words over her, she was filled with the Holy Spirit.

477
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 I don't know if you've ever been in a room or in a situation where someone was filled with the Holy Spirit

478
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 and they just start praying for you, they're just speaking over your life,

479
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 they start prophesying over you.

480
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 I've had that in a Zoom call before, I've had that face to face before,

481
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 I've had that in many different scenarios before.

482
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 You know, what I learned is that when someone is filled with the Holy Spirit

483
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 and they're speaking life over me or speaking God's words over me,

484
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 the only thing I felt was, "Oh, I have a direct encounter with God."

485
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 I think Mary, when she left Nazareth, she was totally puzzled, she was totally confused.

486
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 But when she arrived in that house, when Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit

487
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 and started prophesying over her, I think she had an encounter with God

488
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 and things started to change.

489
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 The confusion was gone and she was like, "Now I know my soul glorifies the Lord

490
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 and now generations will call me blessed.

491
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 Whatever is going to happen to me, I know I'm blessed."

492
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 A visitation of the Holy Spirit, a word, a ministry from the Holy Spirit

493
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 changed the entire scenario.

494
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 And I'm wondering if, you know, we need that in our lives.

495
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 We need the Holy Spirit to speak to us either directly or through someone,

496
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 speak over us so that something inside of our lives, maybe some strongholds,

497
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 maybe some previous hurts, maybe something stuck inside us could be changed.

498
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 Some of us, some of you here have heard of my story or more correctly, my mother's story.

499
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 She found out she had cancer not long after she gave birth to me, so I was still very young.

500
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 And some of you knew that she passed away eventually because of cancer.

501
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 But what I didn't share with you all was that my mother actually passed on my third birthday.

502
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 I remember as a kid on Tomb Sweeping Festival, all those double nines like Chinese festival

503
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 will go tomb sweeping.

504
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 I remember arriving at my mom's gravestone and looking at a date.

505
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 That date was supposed to be my birthday.

506
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 It's supposed to be a date for celebration, but then that date has ever since been turned

507
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 into a date for mourning.

508
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 In fact, when I was young, my family never celebrated my birthday with me on the actual date.

509
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 Well, my birthday was right after a major holiday, so we always just do it by the way

510
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 and let's just celebrate, have a party during the holiday, but we never do it on my actual birthday.

511
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 Ever since I was young, I thought when I look at that day, I always approach that day with mourning,

512
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 with sadness, with, "Oh, this is a bad day.

513
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 I don't like this date.

514
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 This is so bad," because my mom left the world and she lost her life on this date.

515
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 Fast forward, I remember on my 18th birthday, I was just praying and worshipping at home.

516
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 I was just singing songs to praise God and I was praying, and somehow, I don't know why,

517
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 I thought about this part, my mom and the Holy Spirit just came into my bedroom

518
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 and He started speaking to me.

519
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 He said, "Chapman, you know what?

520
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 15 years ago this date, yes, it was the day that your mom passed away,

521
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 but that was actually the day that she finished running her good race.

522
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 It was the day she finished fighting the good fight.

523
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 It was the day that she has kept her faith and now, she would receive the crown of life

524
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 and the entire heaven was cheering for her.

525
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 That's what happened 15 years ago.

526
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 If there's something you need to react to, if there's a proper reaction, that would be celebration."

527
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 The Spirit just came upon me and I remember for the first time, I started celebrating that.

528
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 Not just my birthday, not just my birth, but I started celebrating the end of my mother's life on my birthday

529
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 because I know what her life actually meant, not just to me or my family,

530
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 but to all those people she helped during her time.

531
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 I know she fought this good fight, so it's a time worth celebrating because that's the day she said,

532
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 it's kind of like Olympics, she got on stage and somebody gave her a medal.

533
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 That's the exact moment.

534
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 If there's something I should do, I should be standing there giving her a round of applause.

535
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 And that day, the Holy Spirit just came and spoke to me and changed my heart.

536
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 And ever since, for the next almost 20 years now, I do celebrate that.

537
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 I do celebrate my birthday, but above all, I celebrate the day my mom,

538
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 which we say graduated from this life or she finished her mission here,

539
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 and she entered into eternity.

540
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 That's beautiful.

541
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 [Applause]

542
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 Thank you.

543
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 As I was preparing the message for today, I felt that's what the Holy Spirit wants to do with us today.

544
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 Perhaps some of us, we are struggling with certain things in our lives.

545
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 Perhaps there are wounds He wants to heal.

546
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 There are strongholds He wants to take down.

547
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 There are things He wants to speak to us directly or maybe through somebody else.

548
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 He wants to speak life into us.

549
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 I do want to give us room and space and time just to be in the presence of God,

550
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 in the presence of the Holy Spirit.

551
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 When Mary left Nazareth, I think she was quite puzzled.

552
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 I think she was quite nervous, but that encounter with God in Zechariah, in Elizabeth's house,

553
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 I think it changed her.

554
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 I think one encounter with God can do a lot in our lives.

555
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 And I believe that's what God wants to do this morning here or this afternoon here with us.

556
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 This is what we're going to do.

557
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 We're just going to--you can sit, you can stand.

558
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 We're just going to worship God for a bit.

559
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 And then later I'll give us some instructions on how we're going to pray.

560
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 So if you want to stand, you can stand.

561
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 If you want to sit, you can sit.

562
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 But we're just going to worship right now.

563
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 [music]

564
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 Holy Spirit, we invite you.

565
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 We welcome you.

566
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 We open our hearts to you today, Lord.

567
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 Whether we're like Mary, perhaps there are things in our lives that you want to come and bless us,

568
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 you want to come and speak to us, you want to come and release a word of life over us.

569
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 Perhaps today here some of us will be like, "Elizabeth, you are going to fill us with your Spirit and you're going to speak through us.

570
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 We're going to be your mouthpiece today."

571
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 Holy Spirit, I just welcome you.

572
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 I just pray that you will come and fill us right now.
