1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
 would be a significant shifting moment for many of us.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,480
 And we thank you for this in Jesus' name.

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,800
 Everyone says, amen.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,040
 Amen.

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,440
 So early in December, Andrew asked me,

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,880
 are you free to preach on the 29th of December?

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,680
 And I was like, sure.

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,720
 And then he said, and you can preach on whatever you want.

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,920
 I was like, yes.

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,120
 I can preach about this.

11
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,960
 I can preach about that.

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,520
 And then I thought, well, maybe I

13
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,480
 should actually pray and ask God,

14
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,800
 is there anything specific you would

15
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:40,720
 like me to bring on the last Sunday of 2024?

16
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,920
 And so as I began praying for our time together

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,920
 and for what to share, I sensed that God impressed upon me

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,320
 three words, three words that I believe

19
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,760
 are important to us as a church and also for us individually.

20
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,160
 So if you're visiting here and you're passing through Hong

21
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,360
 Kong or for whatever reason you find yourself right now

22
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,680
 in the vine at this service or if you're watching online,

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,800
 then this message is also for you.

24
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,440
 We don't believe in coincidences.

25
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,320
 And again, as I sensed around how to bring this message,

26
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,680
 I felt that it was important that it was something

27
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,680
 that we leaned into that would encourage us.

28
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,160
 And that words, these three words

29
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,480
 God was asking of all of us.

30
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,920
 So those three words are don't hold back.

31
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,960
 As I was chatting with a friend a while ago,

32
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,520
 they were struggling with something.

33
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,800
 And I asked them, well, have you asked God about this?

34
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:52,520
 Their response was no, which kind of surprised me.

35
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,880
 But as we were talking more, it was clear

36
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,040
 that there was already an assumption about how

37
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,280
 God would respond.

38
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,080
 So they didn't ask.

39
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,240
 Does anybody relate?

40
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,840
 Recently, I was talking to a colleague,

41
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,000
 and she mentioned casually how sometimes it's actually

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,640
 hard to talk to God about areas of your life

43
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,800
 because you're not quite sure what he's going to say.

44
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,560
 And again, I was surprised.

45
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,520
 But then I thought, actually, there's

46
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,760
 probably areas in my life, too, that I may not always

47
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,120
 bring to God and how easy it is to hold back.

48
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,520
 So when these three words came through strongly

49
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,480
 about to share with you today, I felt

50
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,440
 that this was something that God was saying very specifically

51
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,800
 to us today about how we are to enter 2025

52
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,000
 and that we are to enter 2025 without holding back.

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,240
 Don't hold back is what God would say to us this morning.

54
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,480
 So we'll be looking at two examples in scriptures

55
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,320
 of not holding back.

56
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,120
 And through incredible acts of courage and conviction,

57
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,720
 we see that God moves in surprising ways that

58
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,280
 dramatically change trajectory of lives

59
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,720
 and serve as important examples to us today.

60
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,320
 And my prayer really is, as we open scripture

61
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,680
 and as we allow the Holy Spirit to speak to us,

62
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,280
 is that we would learn we cannot assume to know

63
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,480
 what God thinks on all things because that often

64
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,840
 causes us to hold back.

65
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,840
 When we choose to hold back, we miss out.

66
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,480
 If we choose not to hold back, we

67
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,160
 will experience a depth in our relationship with God

68
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,760
 as well as freedom.

69
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:56,680
 And that is what God desires for us as we enter 2025.

70
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,480
 So our first story is found in the Old Testament,

71
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,160
 is in the Book of Numbers.

72
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,920
 It's one of my favorite stories.

73
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,800
 It's the story of five sisters who,

74
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,320
 with great courage and humility, choose not to hold back,

75
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,400
 even when holding back would appear

76
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,840
 to be the right thing to do.

77
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,280
 So we pick up the story from chapter 27.

78
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,480
 And the context is Moses is distributing land

79
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,600
 to the families of the Israelites

80
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,800
 for when they enter the promised land, land which,

81
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,080
 according to the law, would pass from father

82
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:40,080
 to son for generations to come.

83
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,400
 The daughters of Zelophehad, son of Hepha, the son of Gilead,

84
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,680
 the son of Mecca, the son of Manasseh,

85
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,960
 belong to the clans of Manasseh son of Joseph.

86
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:55,080
 The names of the daughters were Marla, Noah, Hogla, Milcah,

87
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,720
 and Tirzah.

88
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,040
 They came forward and stood before Moses, Elizar

89
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,200
 the priest, the leaders, and the whole assembly

90
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,040
 at the entrance to the tent of meeting and said,

91
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,280
 our father died in the wilderness.

92
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,440
 He was not among Korah's followers who banded together

93
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,640
 against the Lord, but he died for his own sin

94
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,000
 and left no sons.

95
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,560
 Why should our father's name disappear from his clan?

96
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,560
 Because he had no son.

97
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,120
 Give us property among our father's relatives.

98
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,080
 So Moses brought their case before the Lord.

99
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,600
 The Lord said to him, what Zelophehad's daughters are

100
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,440
 saying is right.

101
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,440
 You must certainly give them property

102
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,640
 as an inheritance among their father's relatives

103
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:47,000
 and give their father's inheritance to them.

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,240
 What's interesting about their story

105
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,340
 is that it holds a prominent place in scripture.

106
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,120
 It's mentioned five times throughout the book of Numbers,

107
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,600
 Joshua, and 1 Chronicles.

108
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,400
 So we have to see this as an important incident

109
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,040
 that the biblical authors want us to take note of.

110
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,720
 See as well, the daughters are all named.

111
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,040
 Again, highly unusual, amplifying this story

112
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,600
 and the women as important and their actions

113
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,400
 not to be ignored.

114
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,600
 The daughters of Zelophehad challenged property laws

115
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,280
 in ancient Israel, which said that only sons could

116
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,120
 inherit land.

117
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,400
 They chose to approach Moses, Eleazar the priest,

118
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,480
 and the leaders of the whole assembly.

119
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:43,280
 Now that is a lot of people right there,

120
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,600
 and people of power and influence.

121
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:52,200
 And so no doubt quite intimidating to the sisters.

122
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:57,480
 But they do so out of a concern for their families

123
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,600
 and for the name of their father.

124
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,520
 Why should our father's name disappear from his clan?

125
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,320
 Because he had no son.

126
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,520
 So they made this request despite the risk.

127
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:18,720
 Possibly being ostracized from within their own extended

128
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,520
 family.

129
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,320
 Imagine what their uncles would be

130
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,880
 thinking who were due to inherit the land

131
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,880
 and with that a lot of money.

132
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,040
 It would have put the sisters potentially

133
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,400
 a very vulnerable position because they

134
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,680
 would have controlled what to do with the land.

135
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,000
 They could have asked the sisters to work the land

136
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,680
 as slaves.

137
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,680
 They could have asked them to leave the land.

138
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,800
 And possibly within their own broader community,

139
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,920
 they would face ridicule and even rebuke

140
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,400
 from their spiritual leaders.

141
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,120
 Because after all, this was Torah law.

142
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:05,440
 So why did they take the risk and not hold back?

143
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,760
 I believe the sisters understood something

144
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,440
 about what it means to walk in faith

145
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,800
 with the promises of God, the promises of Yahweh.

146
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,920
 They knew they were entering the promised land,

147
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:23,320
 and with it the promise of God's provision for their future.

148
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,160
 The law, however, would leave them

149
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,840
 not only in a vulnerable position, but without land.

150
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,720
 Their father's name would be no more.

151
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,520
 Zelophehad and his family would be forgotten

152
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,880
 and would not inherit the promised land,

153
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:48,080
 not inherit promises of God through no fault of their own.

154
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,440
 And that stirs them to speak out.

155
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,880
 I wonder at their courage.

156
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,000
 But I'm also inspired.

157
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,560
 I'm inspired because of how much they trusted God would act

158
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:10,280
 justly and ultimately fulfill his promises to provide.

159
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,440
 So let's pause for a moment and ask ourselves, honestly,

160
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,400
 how much do we really trust God?

161
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,360
 Where is our faith in God's promises?

162
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,400
 Or as Andrew reminded us during the Advent season,

163
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,120
 our wholehearted trust?

164
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,880
 Do we trust God enough to speak up

165
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,440
 about the things that unsettle us,

166
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,160
 enough to bring our big questions or our fears,

167
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,200
 our frustrations and disappointments to God?

168
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:49,040
 Do we trust him enough not to hold back?

169
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,000
 As the sisters go to Moses, we see

170
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,760
 Moses respond in a way that should be a lesson for us all,

171
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,480
 especially for those of us who are in this room now

172
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,120
 watching online where you are holding

173
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,120
 any position of authority or influence

174
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,200
 or have power over another.

175
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,680
 Remember, Moses was a spiritual leader of the people,

176
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,360
 revered and respected.

177
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,960
 And he knew the law.

178
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,720
 He wrote the law inspired by God.

179
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:25,640
 And yet he chose to go to God first with this request.

180
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,160
 Why?

181
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,320
 He could have just said, "No, it's the law.

182
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,600
 The law is the law."

183
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,600
 I believe this tells us something very special

184
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,240
 about the relationship that Moses had with God.

185
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,040
 He knew God more than anyone else.

186
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,200
 Moses earned the title, "Friend of God."

187
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,200
 Exodus 33 tells us, "The Lord would speak to Moses

188
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:55,200
 face to face as one speaks to a friend."

189
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,840
 I can therefore imagine there was a deep conviction

190
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,960
 within Moses about the sisters' request

191
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:06,200
 because he knew God, Yahweh, God of justice,

192
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,480
 always on the side of the poor and the vulnerable.

193
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,760
 And that stirred Moses in his own humility

194
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:20,680
 to bring their case to God, even though he had the law.

195
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:27,880
 May we always be willing to go to God first whenever

196
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,120
 we are unsure of something and not just assume

197
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,160
 that we know it all or that we have it right

198
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,720
 or even assume that somebody else does.

199
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,160
 May we not be afraid to question when something feels unjust.

200
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,440
 Remember the gaps Andrew spoke about at the start of Advent,

201
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,240
 the gaps that the Apostle Paul wrote about in his letter

202
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,880
 to the Corinthians, "I know in part."

203
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,760
 Even the learned Apostle Paul, he did not claim

204
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,920
 to know everything, and nor should we.

205
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,840
 I also believe this passage teaches us something

206
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:15,200
 hugely profound about God and our relationship with him.

207
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,800
 The laws of the Torah were given by God,

208
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,680
 but I don't believe for a moment that God accidentally

209
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,240
 got this law wrong, mistake.

210
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,280
 Oops, didn't think about that.

211
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,320
 No.

212
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,480
 But rather, God knew the laws could not possibly

213
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:42,080
 cover every situation and every evolving circumstances,

214
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:47,320
 but he wanted his people to be responsible to seek wisdom

215
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,160
 from the principles within God's law.

216
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,960
 He didn't want them just to follow a law for the sake of it

217
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:01,840
 without fully understanding God's heart behind the law,

218
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,560
 not to hold back from being willing to approach God

219
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,080
 for guidance and wisdom.

220
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,960
 Now, don't mishear me.

221
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,440
 God is the same yesterday, today, and forever.

222
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:19,240
 But rather, we understand God's heart and his character

223
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,440
 when we are facing those challenging situations

224
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,880
 that we wrestle with.

225
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:31,160
 Why do you think Jesus got so angry with the Pharisees?

226
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,080
 Because of the way that they practiced the law

227
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,640
 and missed completely the heart of God.

228
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,760
 Ultimately, in this account, we see the faith and the courage

229
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,040
 of five sisters not to hold back,

230
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,880
 and that brought the fulfillment of God's promises

231
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,440
 and the literal promised land.

232
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,960
 So we cannot assume to know everything God is saying

233
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,720
 or doing with our own limited knowledge.

234
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,320
 Who God is and what he is doing is so much more

235
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,840
 than we can possibly fully comprehend.

236
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:15,240
 We cannot put God in our neat little boxes that suit us.

237
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,840
 But rather, we work in our relationship

238
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,560
 so that we can work with knowing God more,

239
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,840
 and then we can fully comprehend what

240
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:31,480
 it means to not hold back because we trust him,

241
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:36,080
 because we call him friend.

242
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,400
 We are far less likely to make decisions

243
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:44,120
 based on what we think we know when we are willing to seek God

244
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,640
 in prayer first.

245
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:51,320
 Our second example of not holding back

246
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,040
 is found in the Gospel of Mark, and is

247
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,840
 a retelling of Jesus encountering

248
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,840
 a woman who's been sick for many years

249
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,440
 whilst on the way to heal a child.

250
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,280
 We pick up the story in Mark.

251
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,000
 "A large crowd followed and pressed around him,

252
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,760
 and a woman was there who'd been subject to bleeding for 12

253
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,800
 years.

254
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,880
 She'd suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors

255
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,400
 and had spent all she had.

256
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,400
 Yet instead of getting better, she grew worse.

257
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,400
 When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd

258
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,200
 and touched his cloak, because she thought,

259
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,040
 if I just touch his clothes, I will be healed.

260
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,360
 Immediately, her bleeding stopped,

261
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,920
 and she felt in her body that she

262
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,560
 was freed from her suffering.

263
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,200
 At once, Jesus realized that power had gone out from him.

264
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,480
 He turned around in the crowd and asked,

265
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,880
 who touched my clothes?

266
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,680
 'You see the people crowding against you?'

267
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,960
 his disciples answered.

268
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,000
 'And yet you can ask who touched me?'

269
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,560
 But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it.

270
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,600
 Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her,

271
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,200
 came and fell at his feet, and trembling with fear,

272
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,560
 told him the whole truth.

273
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:06,040
 And he said to her, 'Daughter, your faith has healed you.

274
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,360
 Go in peace.

275
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,800
 Be free from your suffering.'"

276
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,240
 I love that Jesus makes a point of stopping and acknowledging

277
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,920
 this suffering woman after he had healed her,

278
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:24,080
 and that the writer captures the raw details of her suffering.

279
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:28,520
 Imagine her life before her encounter with Jesus.

280
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,120
 We don't know a lot about her, but we

281
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,200
 do know she'd suffered physically, economically,

282
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,800
 and socially.

283
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,920
 Mark Haidt likes this when he says,

284
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,840
 "She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors

285
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,360
 and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better,

286
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,320
 she grew worse."

287
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,880
 According to Jewish law, she would

288
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,360
 have been considered ceremoniously unclean,

289
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,560
 which meant for 12 years she would

290
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:02,240
 have been enforced in social and religious isolation.

291
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:08,080
 Imagine her life if she hadn't held back and not touched,

292
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,720
 Jesus wrote.

293
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,720
 The ongoing suffering, the ongoing hopelessness.

294
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,880
 Then imagine her life after her encounter with Jesus,

295
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,400
 after she did not hold back.

296
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,320
 Now, you could say, well, she had nothing

297
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,720
 to lose by reaching out to Jesus,

298
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,320
 but actually that's not true.

299
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,760
 She carried a lot of shame in her condition.

300
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,520
 She experienced so far disappointment

301
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,800
 after disappointment after disappointment.

302
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,720
 She would have been setting herself up

303
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,560
 for disappointment again if she was not healed.

304
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,720
 Plus the public humiliation.

305
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,920
 She wasn't even allowed to touch another person,

306
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,200
 otherwise they would be considered ritually unclean.

307
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,480
 So the crowd could have turned against her.

308
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,160
 But she took the risk.

309
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,520
 With faith and courage, she didn't hold back.

310
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,120
 Rather, she literally reached out and touched Jesus

311
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,800
 and was healed.

312
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,840
 And I wonder if maybe there are some of us

313
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:21,840
 today that hold back, because we too believe

314
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,520
 we have something to lose.

315
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,320
 Maybe you've prayed and prayed and yet to receive an answer

316
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,760
 or to see change, maybe you have experienced rejection,

317
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,640
 humiliation, and you're afraid to talk about it.

318
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:42,200
 Let alone come to God and ask in prayer.

319
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:47,440
 The woman teaches us that even in our darkest places of shame,

320
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:53,160
 fear, disappointment, by taking the courage to reach out,

321
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:58,520
 she was met with love, compassion, and restoration.

322
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,600
 And we can too.

323
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:07,400
 Imagine your life if you choose not to hold back.

324
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,000
 So why do we hold back?

325
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,360
 What are some of the obstacles that we face

326
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:17,640
 that keep us from truly surrendering to God?

327
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:23,040
 Shame, societal pressure, faulty beliefs about who God is,

328
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,000
 complacency, fear, to name a few.

329
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,920
 And I'm sure that there are many other reasons

330
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:34,000
 that you would have for holding back.

331
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,840
 I also know that sometimes our prayers are not answered

332
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,960
 in the way we had hoped.

333
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,200
 And for some of us, the very real sense of disappointment

334
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,640
 holds us back from being truly honest with God.

335
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,640
 We might think we're being honest,

336
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,920
 but truly being honest with Him.

337
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,920
 You see, the reality is our world is broken.

338
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:03,440
 And there is pain and suffering all around us and in our lives.

339
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,400
 But in the midst of this,

340
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,480
 we have to be able to go to God with our pain

341
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,600
 and trust that we can be completely honest with Him.

342
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:19,040
 Think of Job, the suffering he went through,

343
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,240
 the death of loved ones, financial ruin,

344
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,320
 betrayal, physical sickness.

345
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,960
 And through it all, he did not hold back his feelings

346
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,960
 and his sufferings from God.

347
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,000
 He asked a lot of questions.

348
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,840
 But in the end, whilst in the suffering

349
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,240
 and when there was no change in his circumstances,

350
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,240
 there was a shift in his relationship

351
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,160
 and understanding of God.

352
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,600
 Now, we often look at the story of Job

353
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,040
 and we immediately know how it ends.

354
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:56,400
 But don't forget that right in the midst of his understanding

355
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,160
 of who God truly is,

356
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,480
 he was in the midst of his suffering.

357
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,720
 And I don't think for a moment it was easy for Job

358
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,040
 to forget all of the suffering,

359
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,400
 to forget the loss of his wife,

360
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,040
 to forget the loss of his children

361
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,480
 and all the pain that he had gone through.

362
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:23,800
 So in this place, he comes to be able to say,

363
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:30,320
 "My ears had heard of you, but now my eyes have seen you,"

364
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:37,440
 as he experienced true realization of who God was.

365
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,800
 When we don't hold back, even in our pain

366
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,320
 and with our unanswered questions,

367
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,840
 even in the midst of our suffering,

368
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,760
 there is a deep sense of peace and comfort in who God is

369
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:56,080
 that builds our faith, that builds our trust

370
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,320
 and brings us peace.

371
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,000
 And as we remain in this place of being in the now,

372
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,080
 but not yet, as we are in the present,

373
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,720
 as we are waiting in the hope we have

374
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,760
 of the life we will have when Jesus returns,

375
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:20,880
 in that place, we don't want to hold back.

376
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,200
 So as I was praying about, "Well, how do we respond to that?

377
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,240
 How does a room full of people, those watching online,

378
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,120
 how do you respond to a message?

379
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,080
 You know, what do you do with that?

380
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,800
 And God, what are you saying to us?"

381
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,040
 And God gave me a picture.

382
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,560
 And God sometimes speaks to me in pictures.

383
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,960
 He speaks in many different ways, through Scripture

384
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,120
 and through various different ways.

385
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,080
 And one of them for me is through pictures.

386
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,360
 So he gave me a picture that I would like to share with you.

387
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,360
 And of course, we always test, you know, what is being said

388
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,200
 and, you know, how this resonates with you.

389
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,840
 I leave with the Holy Spirit.

390
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:05,160
 And so the picture that I got was that this whole auditorium,

391
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,560
 as we are full now, everybody here,

392
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,600
 there were barriers in front of you.

393
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,160
 Do you remember during COVID, you would go into the restaurant

394
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,600
 and there were the plastic barriers?

395
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,720
 You know, you would sit and, you know,

396
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,080
 the person in front of you that you were having lunch

397
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,040
 or dinner or breakfast with, there's a barrier

398
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,360
 and then there's you. It's transparent,

399
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,080
 but there was still something between you.

400
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,520
 Do we remember that?

401
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,600
 Or have we chosen to put that away

402
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,600
 and never think about it again?

403
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,320
 Well, the picture I had was that this room was full

404
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,920
 of people with barriers, these transparent barriers.

405
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:44,920
 And these transparent barriers were between them and God.

406
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,360
 Now they thought they knew God.

407
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,960
 They thought that they had a relationship and they do,

408
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,040
 but there is a barrier.

409
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:58,040
 And what God was saying, to remove the barrier

410
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,640
 so that you do not hold back.

411
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,240
 There is nothing between you and God.

412
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,080
 Some of us feel that there are things

413
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:10,600
 that we cannot talk about or say to God.

414
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,440
 That's not true.

415
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,000
 And I felt that God really wanted to impress upon us

416
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,400
 as we enter into a new year in 2025.

417
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,560
 And if you're part of the Vine,

418
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,600
 as we enter into this new season of,

419
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,080
 what does it mean to go and take action for God?

420
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,400
 We have to have the relationship with God

421
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,320
 where there are no barriers and that we can go to Him

422
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,640
 with everything that we have.

423
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,000
 And so as I thought about some different areas

424
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,960
 that I believe in this room, those watching,

425
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:50,000
 are struggling with that are real barriers for you.

426
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,360
 And so I wanna mention a few of them

427
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,720
 and maybe that's something that resonates with you.

428
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,920
 But I would say, as I was praying earlier,

429
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,280
 thinking about how do I lead this response?

430
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,120
 What does it look like?

431
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,480
 I haven't scripted this.

432
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,480
 So how do I lead this?

433
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,120
 I felt that God was saying, do you know what?

434
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,640
 Don't hold back as a message

435
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,900
 for every single one of you in this room.

436
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,600
 Every single one of you.

437
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,840
 And so we all can respond.

438
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,080
 But I also felt that God wanted to share

439
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,480
 a couple of specific things.

440
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,800
 And the reason why He wants to do that

441
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:31,800
 is to show you specifically, individually,

442
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,240
 how real God is and how much He knows your situation.

443
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:41,800
 Because it's pretty general, right?

444
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,000
 Don't hold back.

445
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:49,880
 So as I share these different specific areas,

446
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,560
 then if that relates to you,

447
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,760
 then we're gonna be praying for you.

448
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,260
 We'd love to pray for you.

449
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:00,120
 And again, I believe that the Holy Spirit

450
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,720
 in the picture that I saw,

451
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,440
 He was actually just removing all the barriers.

452
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,000
 It wasn't difficult to remove those barriers.

453
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,960
 You know, you just unplugged it

454
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,840
 and it was out the restaurant.

455
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,720
 You know, for God, this is not,

456
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,000
 He removes barriers by the power of His Holy Spirit.

457
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,640
 And that is what He wants to do.

458
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:24,640
 So we enter 2025 with nothing in the way

459
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,360
 of our relationship with God.

460
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,920
 So a couple of things I just wanna call out.

461
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,880
 (pages rustling)

462
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:40,520
 So in the room, there are those that are struggling

463
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,840
 in a specific relationship.

464
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,200
 You're in a relationship and you have not talked

465
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,140
 to God about it at all.

466
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:51,360
 Because you're afraid of what God will say.

467
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,080
 It's almost like you have this assumption

468
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,600
 that He's not gonna be happy about it.

469
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,020
 And so therefore, you're not talking to Him about it,

470
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,400
 where actually, more than anything,

471
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,160
 He wants to talk to you about it.

472
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,960
 He wants you to know what it is

473
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,720
 to be in relationship with Him.

474
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,120
 And to do that, not to be afraid,

475
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,160
 not to hold the guilt by withholding this.

476
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:18,440
 So I encourage you, don't hold back, talk to God.

477
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:23,640
 In this room as well,

478
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,400
 (pages rustling)

479
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:32,400
 there is a struggle with identity.

480
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:38,400
 You don't wanna talk to God about who you are,

481
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,320
 an identity that you're holding onto,

482
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,320
 because you're so afraid of the judgment.

483
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,700
 You're so afraid of it.

484
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:51,440
 I can feel that judgment sitting on you.

485
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,000
 You feel you can't talk about this

486
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 because it's something that you've hidden for so long.

487
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,440
 And yet God would say to you, "I see you.

488
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,680
 "Talk to me, don't hold back."

489
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:09,440
 Often our identities are wrapped in what other people think.

490
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,840
 But actually, God is saying,

491
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,840
 "The number one person that you should think about

492
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:21,640
 "how they think about you is God," person and divine.

493
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:22,920
 Divine.

494
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,520
 So don't hold back.

495
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,440
 I sensed also that in the room,

496
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:33,440
 there was pressure from lots of different,

497
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,160
 probably family, I would say, but also maybe friends.

498
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,640
 Pressure that is building up pressure within you,

499
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,200
 and you're feeling also pressure about being a Christian.

500
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,680
 You're feeling the pressure of how you need to perform

501
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,940
 for your family, for other people, and for God.

502
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,580
 And God would say to you,

503
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:57,580
 "I do not expect you to perform in any way.

504
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:02,820
 "I just want you to have the relationship with me.

505
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,260
 "Come to me, don't hold back."

506
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:09,580
 You're so afraid that you're not doing the right things

507
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,460
 of what it means to follow God.

508
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,580
 You're actually not even talking to God about those things.

509
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,500
 And he would say, "Talk to me."

510
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,940
 I think that's the strongest thing that I'm getting

511
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:22,100
 as I'm standing here.

512
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:27,100
 It's like, God is desperate for you to talk to him

513
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:31,660
 because we don't.

514
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:36,540
 We are afraid, we're so afraid.

515
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:39,900
 We have these assumptions and these judgments

516
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:44,780
 that we've already made or other people have made.

517
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,060
 There's enough in the world,

518
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,460
 there's enough societal pressure.

519
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,900
 We don't need God to put that on us as well.

520
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:53,020
 And he's saying to us, "Do not be my people

521
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:56,500
 "who feels that they cannot talk to me about things."

522
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,500
 Because when you don't do that, you're building up walls

523
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,740
 and there's barriers.

524
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:04,700
 And God wants to remove the barriers so that you're free.

525
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,860
 When you know that you can go to God with anything,

526
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:11,260
 in the emotions that you're holding, in your anger,

527
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:15,180
 in the questions that you still don't know,

528
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,420
 have not had answered.

529
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:20,260
 If you know you can still go to God

530
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:24,380
 because he's there for you 24/7,

531
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:27,900
 your life will look a lot different.

532
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:31,460
 Imagine if you didn't hold back in that way.

533
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:38,460
 And so I'd like us to take a step of courage,

534
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,300
 a step of faith.

535
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:45,220
 The sisters spoke out, the woman reached out.

536
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:50,460
 I'm asking you that as you enter 2025,

537
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:55,660
 that if you want to enter where you choose

538
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:59,460
 not to hold back from God,

539
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:04,060
 I would ask you to stand right now.

540
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:08,020
 And maybe something that I spoke specifically

541
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,940
 has stirred in your heart.

542
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:14,860
 But I felt strongly for us as a church

543
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:17,820
 and for those that maybe you're leaving Hong Kong

544
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,620
 and you're going somewhere else,

545
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:22,860
 there's a reason why you're in the service right now

546
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,620
 to hear a word from God that tells you directly,

547
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,700
 do not hold back.

548
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:31,460
 God is all powerful.

549
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:36,220
 And so I'm gonna pray for us.

550
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,980
 And the picture that I got, I believe is prophetic.

551
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,020
 I believe in the power of the Holy Spirit

552
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,220
 that is moving amongst us.

553
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:46,620
 I believe the questions we can hold are fine.

554
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:50,380
 There is nothing that we've done, that we've said,

555
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:54,660
 or that we think that will separate us from who God is

556
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,340
 and the love he has for us.

557
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,100
 We sang about it earlier.

558
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,940
 There was a strong sense that God bringing love

559
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:03,620
 to this place as Andrew spoke to us.

560
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:07,340
 And I believe in this picture is prophetic

561
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:12,340
 because those barriers, they absolutely were removed

562
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:17,420
 and they were gone, gone completely.

563
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,220
 And that is what we will pray now.

564
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,580
 You know yourself individually

565
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,700
 what those obstacles are in your life

566
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:28,180
 that hold you back from being completely open with God.

567
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,580
 You know what they are.

568
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,540
 You can talk to God about what that is.

569
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,700
 And whenever you feel like,

570
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:37,620
 ah, I feel like there's barrier again,

571
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,100
 then remember these words, don't hold back

572
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,740
 because that's not me speaking.

573
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:46,060
 That's God encouraging us to be a people

574
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,580
 who doesn't hold back.

575
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:53,140
 So Father, I wanna pray and ask for your Holy Spirit

576
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:56,220
 to move in this place right now.

577
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,740
 Everybody that has stood,

578
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,300
 for whatever reason they have stood,

579
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,820
 they are asking that you would empower them

580
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:09,340
 to step into 2025 and that they would not hold back.

581
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:15,900
 Father, we're praying that you would remove all barriers

582
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:20,500
 that stop them having that open conversation,

583
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,500
 that open relationship.

584
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:27,900
 Remove them God, remove them in the name of Jesus.

585
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,660
 Where there has been those words,

586
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,220
 those words that Andrew spoke,

587
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,900
 that's coming through so strong,

588
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,700
 words that have been spoken over you.

589
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,820
 They have hurt you so deeply

590
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,860
 that actually the barrier that you've put up

591
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:45,860
 is because you feel that God has let you down.

592
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:49,460
 It's not fair is what you would say.

593
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:53,020
 And so God, I pray that barrier be gone

594
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,700
 in the name of Jesus.

595
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:58,220
 Where there is fear and guilt

596
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:01,140
 and where there is this sense of judgment,

597
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,860
 be gone in the name of Jesus.

598
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:07,500
 And whatever else we carry in the obstacles

599
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,420
 by the power of the Holy Spirit,

600
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,660
 they are gone in the name of Jesus.

601
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:14,300
 And we enter into the new year

602
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:17,860
 with nothing separating us.

603
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:22,100
 We enter into the new year knowing that we have faith,

604
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:25,060
 we wholeheartedly trust.

605
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,700
 And in the moments that we don't,

606
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:30,460
 we ask and say, God help us to have more faith.

607
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:34,380
 And Father, we pray for the hope

608
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:37,500
 that we live in knowing that our future

609
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,300
 is in the now and not yet,

610
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,860
 in the coming of Jesus.

611
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:47,500
 And the love that absolutely drives

612
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:52,500
 who you are and everything about our relationship with you.

613
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:56,980
 We choose God not to hold back.

614
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:59,500
 And we thank you for the work of the Holy Spirit

615
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,820
 in this place right now.

616
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:10,220
 And so we're going to respond in worship.

617
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:13,100
 This also might be a time where God wants to speak

618
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:16,180
 to you specifically about those obstacles.

619
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,540
 And it's simply a saying,

620
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:21,060
 God, I don't wanna hold back.

621
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:21,900
 That's it.

622
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,140
 That's all you have to do.

623
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,660
 The Holy Spirit does the rest.

624
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,580
 God does the rest.

625
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,420
 You don't have to worry about,

626
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,380
 well, what does this look like tomorrow?

627
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,460
 This is now.

628
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:34,220
 The Holy Spirit is here working

629
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:39,220
 and releasing us to go out into 2025,

630
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,900
 where we do not hold back.

631
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,380
