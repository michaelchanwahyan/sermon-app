[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300]   Good morning, church.
[00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.900]   How are we today?
[00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:04.740]   >> Great.
[00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.460]   >> Good, good to see you guys.
[00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:07.300]   Very good morning.
[00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.020]   If you're in the overflow, good morning.
[00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.780]   Hello to you as well.
[00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.260]   And if you're joining us online,
[00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.940]   it's good to have you guys with us too.
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.140]   Excuse, I'm a little bit still like congested.
[00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.420]   I also had sausage McMuffin for breakfast this morning,
[00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.740]   so you know, good life choices I'm making.
[00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.980]   But again, always honored and excited
[00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.900]   to be sharing God's word this morning.
[00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.500]   You know, it's June 8th, we're halfway through 2025 already.
[00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.500]   Our taxes were due last week in case you forgot, right?
[00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.140]   You still got some time, I guess.
[00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.660]   But you know, it's about these times of the year, right?
[00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.460]   We take a look back and we take stock
[00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.580]   and we start to think about,
[00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.540]   oh, how the year's been going so far
[00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.500]   and how we view it to go in the six months
[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.640]   that's ahead of us, right?
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.820]   And when I think about what's been happening
[00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.780]   in the Sunday services and the life of this church
[00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.860]   on Sunday at least, it's been really amazing
[00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.620]   to see God at work in this body of Christ,
[00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.340]   in this community, right?
[00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.340]   There've been so many moments where
[00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.020]   because we've made decisions to lean in
[00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.940]   and be obedient to how the Holy Spirit has been guiding us,
[00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.140]   right, we've had the privilege of seeing Him at work
[00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.940]   in some really cool ways.
[00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.460]   Right, we've been talking about exploring the uncharted
[00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.500]   and God has been revealing through us,
[00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.740]   through the Holy Spirit, lots of cool things, right?
[00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.860]   And one of the most encouraging things I've seen
[00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.940]   is when we surrender ourselves to the Holy Spirit
[00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.980]   and just let Him take over what He wants to do,
[00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.060]   especially in this time, right?
[00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.180]   You remember a few months ago,
[00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.800]   we had a time where we didn't even go into the message
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.540]   and we just continued to preach,
[00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.580]   we just, I mean, we just continued to pray
[00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.540]   and worship and minister to each other, right?
[00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.140]   These spontaneous responses of praise,
[00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.420]   these spontaneous responses of worship
[00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.140]   and celebrating in each other's joys,
[00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.460]   but also walking with each other in the burdens.
[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.620]   And of course, one of the most beautiful things
[00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.180]   that I've seen, that we've seen,
[00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.860]   is that when we've called upon the church
[00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.440]   to pray for each other.
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.580]   So the moments when we stood up,
[00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.420]   if you need prayer, open up your hands
[00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.780]   and just to see the entire body of Christ
[00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.740]   surrounding those who need prayer
[00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.900]   and praying over them, interceding for them,
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.740]   speaking on them, speaking for them
[00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.820]   on behalf of the pains and the needs
[00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.540]   and the feeling at that time.
[00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.600]   And it just reminds me that this
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.900]   is what the church was truly meant for.
[00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.940]   And today, as we close out our series on the Holy Spirit,
[00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.460]   we're gonna be talking about the gifts of the Spirit
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.940]   and the fruit of the Spirit.
[00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.340]   And as we talk about the gifts and the fruit,
[00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.220]   I want us to keep focusing on the body of Christ,
[00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.420]   on the church.
[00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.980]   Now, this might be a different perspective
[00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.260]   than what we normally might think,
[00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.580]   because a lot of the time,
[00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.180]   when we're talking about these things,
[00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.020]   we want to take a more sort of personal approach to it.
[00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.580]   We start asking ourselves the question,
[00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.900]   well, what is my gift, right?
[00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.540]   How am I bearing fruit?
[00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.160]   And yes, there is a personal element to these things.
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.480]   We'll talk about that in a minute.
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.580]   However, I think that if we think gifts and fruit
[00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.180]   are just about you or just about us as individuals,
[00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.320]   then we've missed the point completely.
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.340]   That's something Justin said a couple weeks ago.
[00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.600]   It was super important, right?
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.900]   He said that we shouldn't be like a stopping gate
[00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.120]   of the Holy Spirit, right?
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.380]   But he was calling us to be more like conduits
[00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.780]   and allow the Holy Spirit to work through us,
[00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.220]   to flow through us.
[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.740]   And this is exactly what the gifts
[00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.500]   and the fruit is all about.
[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.560]   In other words, the Holy Spirit does not give you gifts
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.020]   and fruit for your personal benefit.
[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.300]   The Holy Spirit doesn't give you gifts and fruit
[00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.740]   to make you look good, right?
[00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.780]   The Holy Spirit doesn't empower us with wisdom
[00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.180]   so that people will look up to you and say,
[00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.200]   wow, this person is so insightful, so full of knowledge.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.020]   The Holy Spirit does not give you healing
[00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.060]   so that people can start looking to you
[00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.500]   to make them healthy of their sickness and diseases,
[00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.300]   infirmities, evil spirits, whatever it is, right?
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.020]   The Holy Spirit doesn't give us patience and kindness
[00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.440]   so that people will say, wow,
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.360]   this is what a good, virtuous person looks like.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.800]   No.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.880]   The gifts and the fruit are given to us
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.080]   so that the whole entire church,
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.960]   the entire body of Christ can come together
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.240]   and say, praise the Lord.
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.280]   The gifts and the fruit being made known among us
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.920]   so people can say, this is what it looks like
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.840]   when a group of people are worshiping in spirit
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.680]   and in truth.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.680]   The fruit and the gifts and the fruit are given to us
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.320]   so that people can truly say,
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.920]   this is God's word being revealed
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.960]   and lived out in this kingdom.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.240]   This is the kingdom of heaven on earth.
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.000]   The gifts and the fruit are given to us
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.280]   so those of us who are tired of our sin
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.280]   can truly come to a safe place
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.560]   where conviction and confession and repentance
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.740]   is embraced in our community.
[00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.000]   In other words, it's not about you.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.800]   Now, I know this sounds a bit harsh,
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.400]   but we really need to be careful
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.160]   when we come to the gifts and the fruit
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.480]   so we take the right approach.
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.760]   Because when we look at the world,
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.200]   the worldly focus, right,
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.220]   it's so focused on making life about us.
[00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.600]   The world is really good at putting people up on pedestals,
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.400]   glorifying individuals for their gifts and their talents.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.300]   Right, and as a result,
[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.320]   we have this sort of weird celebrity culture
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.840]   where people just do so, there's such effort and motivation
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.160]   for people just to do something, to go viral, become famous
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.520]   so people can look up to them in some sort of way.
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.240]   There are people out there with followers on Instagram,
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.660]   more than entire countries.
[00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.320]   If you go to see some of these celebrities,
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.440]   there's like hundreds of millions of followers,
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.960]   more than big countries combined.
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.280]   Right, something that's totally not cool one day,
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.580]   right, just takes one person of influence to do something
[00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.320]   and then everybody wants a piece of that action.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.720]   Right, we spend time, money, effort going to shows
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.600]   and concerts for our favorite music, artists and bands.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.580]   I'm not saying don't go to those things,
[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.820]   I'm just saying be careful.
[00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.580]   Because when we lift up people so much
[00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.060]   and look at their talent so much,
[00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.000]   we sometimes even casually call them,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.320]   oh, these people are like our idols.
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.180]   But what does the Bible say about idols, Church?
[00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.000]   Now, I'm sounding like a potty pooper here, okay.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.540]   You're like, "Ellison, where's your funny story
[00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:37.380]   "for this message?"
[00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.140]   Okay, I don't have one today, I'm sorry, okay.
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.780]   Well, what I'm saying is, I've been saying it,
[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.660]   we need to be really, really careful
[00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.660]   not to let that sort of thinking seep in
[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.420]   to the body of Christ.
[00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.580]   Because when it comes to things like the gifts
[00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.020]   and the fruit of the Spirit,
[00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.780]   especially when we're talking about the gifts in the Church,
[00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.220]   we too can very easily find ourselves lifting up people
[00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.840]   who we see as gifted,
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.940]   rather than lifting up the name of Jesus.
[00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.300]   And instead for the Church benefiting
[00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.100]   for the gifts and the fruits,
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.160]   all the benefits and all the recognition
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.720]   goes to certain individuals, certain gifts, certain people.
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.500]   Right, we've even developed this weird like,
[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.340]   celebrity pastor and celebrity worship leader subculture
[00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.060]   that exists in this thing that we call Christianity.
[00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:30.380]   Where honestly, sometimes it's really hard to say,
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:31.620]   are we lifting up Jesus' name
[00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:33.220]   or are we lifting up this person's name?
[00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.520]   We're like, who are we actually praising here?
[00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.060]   >> Check that one out.
[00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:39.980]   >> Thank you, Tony.
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.420]   [audience applauding]
[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.780]   But the Bible has a very different perspective.
[00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.660]   Right, let's look at 1 Corinthians 12 together.
[00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.700]   There are different kind of gifts,
[00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:55.060]   but the same Spirit distributes them.
[00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:58.380]   There are different kinds of service, but the same Lord.
[00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.180]   There are different kinds of working,
[00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.080]   but in all of them and in everyone,
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.380]   it is the same God at work.
[00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.540]   Now to each one, the manifestation is given for the,
[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.100]   let's say those last two words together,
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.400]   for the common good.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.900]   Right, this is beautiful theological truth
[00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.520]   that Paul is declaring with these words.
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.960]   But the point being made is that the gifts,
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.320]   that everyone's gifts are different.
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.380]   But it doesn't mean that one is considered
[00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.900]   to be better than the other.
[00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:29.740]   Why?
[00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:31.220]   Well, precisely, like we've been saying,
[00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.940]   the gifts are given to us, not for you,
[00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:38.020]   for us as individuals, but for the sake of unity,
[00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:41.060]   for the sake of the common good.
[00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:43.940]   Right, in fact, the way that these gifts are given
[00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:48.140]   reflect the unity that we see in the God that we worship,
[00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:51.260]   the Father and Son of the Holy Spirit.
[00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:52.940]   Right, look how Paul phrases the passage.
[00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:56.580]   There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit.
[00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.900]   Different kinds of service, but the same Lord.
[00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:01.780]   It's in everyone, it's different,
[00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:05.000]   but it's the same God at work.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.980]   Holy Spirit, Lord Jesus, Father God,
[00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.700]   all working in unity together to give us the gifts
[00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.180]   so that the church can also reflect
[00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.940]   and display the same unity that we see
[00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:19.000]   in Yahweh that we worship.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.900]   Time and time and time again,
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.860]   the Bible gives a very clear message.
[00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:25.500]   So I'll say it again, church.
[00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.300]   It's not about you, it's not about us.
[00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:32.980]   Now again, that's not to say that we cannot honor
[00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.420]   and recognize people at all.
[00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.740]   Right, they are indeed people who are recognized
[00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:40.700]   for the amazing things that they have done.
[00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:44.140]   And we need to give honor and credit where credit is due.
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.060]   There's people that I look up to in my life
[00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.740]   and I think very highly about.
[00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.420]   People who I think would be really cool
[00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:52.260]   to be like that one day.
[00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.140]   People I've met within this community.
[00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:55.820]   I mean, Tony voiced up just now,
[00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:59.580]   but when I'm Tony's age and I'm half as effortlessly cool
[00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:02.980]   as Tony is, I know I've made it in life.
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:05.980]   Tony is a hero of mine.
[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.660]   I have Instagram, I scroll through Instagram,
[00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:09.860]   I follow certain people,
[00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:12.580]   I'm inspired by the things that they do.
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:15.220]   And even within this community,
[00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.780]   apart from the obvious things that you see on the stage,
[00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:21.540]   if you were to get to know the people around you,
[00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:23.260]   you would know that there is a group
[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:27.440]   of really incredibly gifted people in this room.
[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.020]   On a staff level, on the volunteers,
[00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:34.100]   we have the best worship team in town, facts.
[00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.860]   I don't care where at church you're from,
[00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:39.740]   we have the best worship team in town, facts.
[00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:42.980]   We have some of the best preaching and teaching in town,
[00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:44.740]   facts, these are just facts.
[00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.180]   You can come at me if you want, whatever, okay.
[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.700]   But the people around us,
[00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.180]   the community that makes up this church,
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.980]   you'll see that the Holy Spirit has given all kinds of gifts
[00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:57.860]   to all kinds of people.
[00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:00.360]   If we look at the scripture, Paul says it like this.
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.980]   To one, there's given through the Spirit
[00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.660]   a message of wisdom.
[00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:05.780]   To another, a message of knowledge
[00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:07.540]   by means of the same Spirit.
[00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:09.720]   To another, faith in the same Spirit.
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:13.100]   To another, gifts of healing by that one Spirit.
[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.060]   To another, miraculous powers.
[00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.580]   To another, prophecy.
[00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:18.620]   To another, distinguishing Spirits.
[00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:21.020]   To another, speaking in different kinds of tongues.
[00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:24.340]   And to another, the interpretation of tongues.
[00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:26.740]   There's several other places where we can find
[00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.580]   a list of spiritual gifts, right.
[00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:30.340]   This is not an exhaustive list,
[00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:32.860]   and we don't have time to go through each and every single
[00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:35.860]   of these ones specifically today,
[00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:38.300]   but there are a couple of things I want us to notice
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:40.420]   as we look through things like this.
[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:42.840]   Firstly is this, they are given to us,
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:46.040]   they are given to us through the Spirit.
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:51.520]   You don't earn these gifts by being extra super holy, right.
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.260]   You can't buy them with money.
[00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.260]   These gifts are God's way of working through us,
[00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.660]   equipping us, encouraging us,
[00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:03.900]   using us for the sake of His kingdom and His glory.
[00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:06.660]   Right, they are God's idea.
[00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:11.660]   They are a blessing from God, and God loves giving us gifts.
[00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:13.300]   Bible tells us specifically that God
[00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:16.060]   is the best giver of gifts,
[00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:18.940]   and that every good and perfect gift
[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:22.380]   comes from our loving Father in Heaven.
[00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:26.140]   So they're given to us, it's a gift, we don't earn it.
[00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:29.280]   And also as you see, there are many of them.
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.160]   It's a long list, and like I said, it's not the only list.
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.620]   There's a variety of gifts and functions,
[00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:39.180]   and that's a good thing, that's the beautiful thing.
[00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:42.320]   So therefore, your gift in the Holy Spirit,
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:44.760]   it's not your supernatural, not your superpower
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.140]   made for everybody to look at you.
[00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:52.140]   Your gift is your part in the body of Christ.
[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:55.340]   This means that unless you're using your gift
[00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:58.340]   to serve the Lord, to serve the community of Christ,
[00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.940]   to serve the body of Christ,
[00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:05.640]   the church cannot be all that God meant for it to be.
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:10.060]   Paul will say it like this in Romans 12.
[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:13.700]   For just as each of us has one body with many members,
[00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:16.860]   and these members do not all have the same function,
[00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:20.300]   so in Christ, though many, form one body,
[00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.780]   and each member belongs to the others.
[00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:26.640]   We have different gifts according to the grace given to us.
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.420]   If your gift is prophesying,
[00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:32.160]   then prophesy in accordance with your faith.
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.700]   If it's serving, then serve.
[00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:35.140]   If it's teaching, then teach.
[00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:37.380]   If it's to encourage, then give encouragement.
[00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:39.420]   If it's giving, then give generously.
[00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:41.740]   If it's to lead, do it diligently.
[00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:44.600]   If it's to show mercy, do it cheerfully.
[00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:48.940]   Everybody needs to pitch in
[00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:52.460]   because every single person in this room,
[00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:55.020]   the Bible tells us, has a gift,
[00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:58.060]   and therefore you have a role to play.
[00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:00.760]   Again, this is important to keep in mind
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.220]   because the danger is,
[00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.740]   especially when it comes to spiritual gifts,
[00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:08.420]   we start to see some gifts as better than the others,
[00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:09.620]   which means that some people think
[00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.900]   that they're more important than they actually are,
[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:13.540]   and some people end up thinking
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:16.380]   they underestimate the crucial part
[00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:18.840]   that they are to play in God's kingdom.
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:22.260]   So for example, what's happening right here,
[00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.060]   people being on the stage, speaking, teaching,
[00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:27.140]   singing, whatever it is,
[00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:28.780]   to people all throughout the day,
[00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:30.740]   this is a gift that's often lifted up
[00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:32.880]   and seen as highly important.
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:36.020]   But what about the gift of serving?
[00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:39.300]   What about the people that held the signs
[00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:41.100]   that served you by greeting you
[00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.340]   on the way up to the auditorium this morning?
[00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.460]   What about the team of hosts
[00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:48.620]   that passed from the offering buckets just now?
[00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:50.580]   What about the communion we're about to take later
[00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:53.300]   that people had to come in at 7 a.m. this morning
[00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:54.780]   to tear up the pieces of bread,
[00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:56.100]   to fill up the little cups,
[00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:58.580]   just so that we can have communion later?
[00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:02.040]   Did it cross your mind that our greeters
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:05.820]   and hosts and volunteers play just as critical a part
[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:07.940]   in the body of Christ than the preacher
[00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.620]   or the worship team when it comes to our Sunday services?
[00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.460]   And I'm just talking about Sunday services here.
[00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:16.260]   Without people who are willing to use the gifts
[00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:17.740]   of serving the church,
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:20.340]   none of this would be possible, guys, none.
[00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:22.860]   There would be no production team,
[00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:24.340]   the band would be one or two people,
[00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:26.340]   there would be no kids and youth ministry,
[00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:29.020]   this whole place would be in chaos.
[00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:32.860]   But God, in His infinite wisdom,
[00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:34.980]   in His perfect knowledge of His children,
[00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:38.340]   in His generosity, He looks at a group like us,
[00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.380]   and then through the Holy Spirit,
[00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:43.700]   He distributes gifts and expects everyone
[00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:47.000]   to use their gifts and play their part,
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.860]   so that the whole church can function healthily.
[00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:53.620]   This is what He's talking about.
[00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.620]   Again, let's go back to Scripture.
[00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:57.660]   God has put the body together
[00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:01.940]   so that there should be no division in the body,
[00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:06.180]   but all the parts have equal concern for each other.
[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:09.440]   If one part suffers, every part suffers with it.
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:13.620]   If one part is honored, every part rejoices with it.
[00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:16.500]   You see, from a worldly perspective,
[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:20.180]   when we get gifts, when we give gifts or get gifts,
[00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:22.100]   it is something quite personal,
[00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.940]   and you get it with that person in mind.
[00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:25.660]   Well, hopefully you spare some thought,
[00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:27.420]   that's a nice thing to do,
[00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:29.300]   to think about that person and get them a gift,
[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.680]   birthday, anniversaries, graduations.
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.540]   You think about the need
[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:36.140]   and you get something tailored for that person.
[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:38.300]   And then when that person receives a gift,
[00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.860]   there is no expectation to share it.
[00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:42.060]   I mean, you wouldn't get, you know,
[00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:44.360]   if I bought Nathan a new pair of shoes,
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.200]   I would say something like,
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.640]   "Okay, hey, you know, those new Jordans are pretty cool,
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:48.820]   "but you have to let me wear them
[00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:50.580]   "on Mondays and Wednesdays, okay?"
[00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:52.000]   Apart from the fact they wouldn't fit,
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.720]   it doesn't make sense, that's not how gifts work.
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:17:00.220]   But when it comes to spiritual gifts,
[00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.820]   the perspective is different.
[00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.940]   So yes, the personal element is still there.
[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:08.860]   Again, not everyone has the same gift,
[00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:12.540]   which means when God looks at you as his child,
[00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:15.700]   as the person who he knitted together in his mother's womb,
[00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.620]   your God who knows the amount of hairs on your head,
[00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:21.700]   he saw you and he gave you a gift specifically
[00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:24.460]   through the Holy Spirit with you in mind,
[00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:27.620]   with his wisdom, with his love, with his grace.
[00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:29.500]   And when we receive this gift from God, right,
[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:31.900]   there is a sense of closeness and intimacy
[00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.740]   that we feel with the Father
[00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:36.240]   and he draws us closer to him.
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:39.740]   The thing is, after we receive that,
[00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:42.260]   they are then meant to be shared.
[00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.540]   These gifts are designed for us to use
[00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:47.220]   to help those around us.
[00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:50.620]   For example, healing is a gift.
[00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:52.100]   But I mean, there's only so much healing
[00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:54.300]   you can do on yourself, right?
[00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.580]   And then God gives you the gift of healing
[00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:59.360]   so that you can have mercy to those around you
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.100]   who are in need.
[00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:02.780]   He gives you the gift of faith
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:04.780]   so that when you see someone struggling
[00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:07.020]   in their season of life, you can come alongside them,
[00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:09.460]   say, I will pray with you, I will walk with you,
[00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:10.780]   let's do this together.
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:12.460]   That's the gift of faith.
[00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:17.340]   All these gifts that we get only make sense
[00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:19.920]   when they're shared amongst the church.
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:23.620]   So if you find yourself with these gifts,
[00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:26.020]   the question we should be asking ourselves is not,
[00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.740]   how is this gift gonna benefit me?
[00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:31.340]   That's worldly, fleshly thinking.
[00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:33.780]   That's a mistake that dude made when he said to Peter,
[00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.740]   and if he could buy the gift that he saw Peter had
[00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:39.740]   with money, but what was his response?
[00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:42.180]   May your money perish with you
[00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:45.560]   because you thought you could buy the gift of God with money.
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:49.700]   You have no part or share in this ministry
[00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:53.380]   because your heart is not right before God.
[00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:57.020]   So let me remind us again,
[00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:01.740]   these gifts of the Spirit are given for the common good.
[00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.880]   You see what I'm beginning,
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.120]   you understand what I'm saying now?
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.260]   That it's not about you.
[00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:10.020]   It's not for one person to stand out at the star,
[00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:12.140]   but these gifts are given to us to highlight
[00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:16.060]   just how much God wants us to serve
[00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:18.620]   and to need each other.
[00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:22.820]   So this presents a question and a challenge to all of us.
[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:25.900]   What is our gift?
[00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:27.220]   And once you discover your gift,
[00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:30.540]   how are you using it to serve the body of Christ,
[00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:32.840]   to serve the Lord, to serve the church?
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:37.860]   Because like I said, everyone has a role to play,
[00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:39.260]   and I'll just say it plainly,
[00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:42.580]   showing up on a Sunday is not a spiritual gift.
[00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:45.340]   Right?
[00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:46.180]   It's not.
[00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:49.300]   But do you know your part?
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:50.380]   Are you playing your part?
[00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:52.100]   Listen, okay, everybody is welcome here.
[00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:55.400]   If you wanna just keep coming, we will never turn you away.
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:59.820]   We will always, you will always be welcome here.
[00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:02.820]   However, if you've been here a minute
[00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:06.020]   and your plan is just to keep coming to church on Sunday
[00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:09.340]   and nothing else, you're really missing out
[00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:12.300]   on the full picture of what it means
[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:15.340]   to be part of a body of Christ,
[00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:19.900]   to be a Christian, to be a follower of Jesus.
[00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.080]   Right, and this isn't a guilt trip
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:24.220]   'cause we need volunteers for JCA and VBS, all right?
[00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:27.000]   I'm not, I'm just saying what the Bible is teaching us,
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.220]   okay, it's not.
[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:32.200]   So if you don't know the question,
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:35.880]   you know, how do I find my spiritual gift?
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.120]   Again, it's a good question,
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:38.780]   and we can talk about this all day.
[00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:42.940]   Let me just give a few practical pointers in this direction.
[00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:46.880]   First of all, okay, don't treat it like an enneagram
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.320]   or a disc or a Myers-Briggs,
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.940]   one of those personality tests, that kind of stuff, okay?
[00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:54.220]   Your spiritual gift is not a personality test, all right?
[00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:57.120]   I mean, there are online tools that might be useful,
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.940]   but I wouldn't even start there necessarily.
[00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:02.740]   The first step to finding out your part
[00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:07.740]   and your gift in the body of Christ is to seek God first.
[00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:09.960]   Seek first the kingdom and all these other things
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.960]   will then be given to you.
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.960]   Right, this means reading your Bible,
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.900]   this means prayer and fasting,
[00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.500]   this means constant confession and repentance,
[00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.840]   this means developing and nurturing
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:24.280]   your relationship with Jesus.
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.040]   That's the first basic step.
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:29.360]   The second step is this, right?
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:30.800]   When you're following Jesus,
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.800]   when you know that your heart
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:35.600]   and the desires of your heart have been made pure,
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:39.240]   then you ask, ask the Holy Spirit to show you,
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:42.520]   where do you want me to serve?
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:44.700]   What is the gift that you've given me?
[00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:48.760]   What is my part in the body of Christ?
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:51.800]   And scripture tells us that when we do that,
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:56.800]   if we ask anything according to his will, he will hear us.
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:02.620]   One good way to ask is to ask those around you,
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:04.100]   the people that you trust around you,
[00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:05.480]   the other people that you know
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:09.060]   are also in the same journey of following Jesus.
[00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:11.080]   Find a community that you trust,
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:12.940]   talk to people, come along with them and say,
[00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:15.780]   hey, you know, I feel like God has given me a gift
[00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:18.180]   in whatever, do you see that in me?
[00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:20.560]   Or maybe ask one of your leaders at the church
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:22.400]   or whatever, say, I feel like I have the gift of this.
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.280]   Is there something that you've noticed in me
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:25.320]   that you see in me?
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:29.560]   Ask, ask the Lord, ask those around you.
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:33.900]   Thirdly is this, be content.
[00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:38.200]   So you know in the early stages of singing competitions,
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.300]   like Britain's Got Talent and all that kind of stuff,
[00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:43.000]   in the audition stages, there's always these people
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.700]   who show up full of confidence,
[00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:48.720]   thinking they're like the songbird of their generation,
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.040]   but in reality, when they start to sing, right,
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:53.920]   it's not that good, right?
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:54.920]   And you end up with, you know,
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:57.000]   that the Ken dibby dibby doubt you lady, right?
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.580]   Like you think you have this talent and your gift to sing,
[00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:02.920]   but actually that's not your gift.
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:05.000]   And somewhere along the way, there've been disillusion
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.400]   or someone has lied to them.
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.860]   You know, maybe they sang in front of their mom
[00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:10.240]   and the mom's like, oh yeah, yeah, you're really good.
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.840]   You're good at everything, son, okay?
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:14.600]   And you go off, yeah, go do the audition.
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:18.120]   And you find out, actually, that's not what you're good at.
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:23.040]   In the same way, right, the Bible does say ask,
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:26.400]   earnestly ask and desire the gifts.
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.880]   But it also tells us that everything must be done
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:33.080]   so that the church may be built up.
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:37.520]   So whatever the Holy Spirit has decided to bless you with,
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:40.440]   trust Him with that, lean into that.
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.020]   Again, I'm not saying you can't ask, you can't desire,
[00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:45.780]   do those things, the Holy Spirit might choose to work in you
[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:47.240]   in that way at some time.
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:51.980]   But whatever God has given to you, trust Him with that,
[00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:55.500]   lean into that and serve and work out of that
[00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:58.620]   so that when the Spirit is at work in your life,
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:02.940]   He can give you the gift to serve the body of Christ.
[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:07.460]   Now that's a gift of the Spirit, the gifts of the Spirit.
[00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:10.580]   But the Spirit at work in your life
[00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:14.060]   should also grow fruit within you.
[00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:14.900]   Well, what's the difference?
[00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:17.420]   Well, I would say probably that you can look at it like this.
[00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:22.420]   Gifts are normally for certain times and certain seasons
[00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:24.260]   and certain moments.
[00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:26.580]   For example, tongues, again, is described
[00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:28.700]   as one of the spiritual gifts.
[00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.060]   Every now and then, in the worship service at the Vine,
[00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:34.440]   we'll have a gift of tongues and there'll be interpretation
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:37.940]   and the whole church is strengthened and edified
[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:40.380]   by the gift of tongues.
[00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:43.580]   But if that were to happen constantly, every day,
[00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:45.820]   all the time, we wouldn't be able to get on
[00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:47.420]   to anything else.
[00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:51.780]   Healing, again, is certain gifts for certain moments.
[00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:54.100]   Every now and then, we get called to pray
[00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:57.460]   for those who are sick and we see healing take place.
[00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:00.220]   We've seen some very powerful ways the Holy Spirit
[00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:04.220]   has worked and healed people from all sorts of things.
[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:07.900]   But again, there's a certain time and place for that.
[00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:10.940]   That's not to mean that the Holy Spirit can't heal
[00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:12.220]   when we pray.
[00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:15.100]   It just means that the Holy Spirit is choosing not to act
[00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:18.320]   in that way for that particular moment.
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:23.880]   But when it comes to the fruit, the fruit isn't something
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:25.960]   that we see every now and then.
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:29.060]   The fruit of the Spirit is something we constantly
[00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:30.680]   need to be growing in.
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:35.860]   This is why Paul says, "Walk by the Spirit."
[00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:38.260]   The word walk here isn't talking about like a stroll
[00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:41.020]   down the beach or a stroll in the park.
[00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:44.620]   It's talking about how you live your life,
[00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.780]   the choices you make.
[00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:49.740]   And we need to be really careful about this
[00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:52.560]   because again, the consequences are serious.
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:56.380]   Galatians 5, check out what Paul has to say.
[00:25:56.380 --> 00:26:00.060]   Walk by the Spirit and you will not gratify the desires
[00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:01.500]   of the flesh.
[00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:04.140]   For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit
[00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:07.020]   and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh.
[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:10.900]   They are in conflict with each other so that you are not
[00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:13.820]   to do whatever you want.
[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:20.800]   Walk by the Spirit and you will not gratify the desires
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.500]   of the flesh.
[00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:26.180]   It's very clear, Paul's very clear, Scripture's very clear.
[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:27.860]   We felt this too.
[00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:31.060]   There's a constant battle going on inside of us,
[00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:33.700]   outside of us between what the flesh wants
[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:37.340]   and what the Spirit is trying to lead us towards.
[00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:38.900]   And here's the thing, right?
[00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:42.000]   The Bible tells us we can't just do whatever we want
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.420]   and call it freedom.
[00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:47.760]   It's a bit sort of contradictory because if we're being told
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.780]   how to live, right, on one level that sounds more
[00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:53.200]   like a restriction rather than freedom.
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:56.940]   But what does freedom in this case actually look like?
[00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:00.660]   What does freedom in Christ actually look like?
[00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:02.180]   'Cause we talk about freedom a lot.
[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:04.340]   But one of the great benefits of Christianity
[00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:06.860]   and the life in Jesus is freedom.
[00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:09.200]   Again, we sing about it, we preach about it,
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.780]   we proclaim Bible verses about freedom.
[00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:15.140]   Who the Son sets free is free indeed, yes, and amen.
[00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:17.940]   But what are we talking about when we talk about freedom?
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:21.500]   Well, from the worldly, fleshly perspective,
[00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:25.140]   freedom is the ability to say and think and do
[00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:27.980]   and act whatever you like, right?
[00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:30.940]   A life with no limits and no control.
[00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:32.980]   This is how kids think, right?
[00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:35.140]   Kids look up to us, our children look up to us,
[00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:37.140]   and they think, oh, I can't wait 'til I'm an adult
[00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:38.940]   so I can eat ice cream all day,
[00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:41.580]   I can melt my brain with TV, you know,
[00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:44.500]   and I can just buy any toy I want anytime I want, right?
[00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:47.300]   That is how a kid looks at us, right, and see,
[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:50.380]   well, freedom is to be able to do whatever we want
[00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:51.560]   anytime we want.
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:55.900]   But even as adults, right, we tend to look at freedom
[00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:56.780]   in this way.
[00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:01.900]   A life of freedom is if, well, I can live on my own terms.
[00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:04.140]   Right, isn't that what the world approves of?
[00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:05.360]   You deserve it.
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:08.540]   Live life on your own terms, do whatever you want,
[00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:10.740]   be free, don't let anybody hold you down.
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:13.580]   You only live once, right, so come on, just go for it.
[00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:15.380]   Do it, doesn't matter.
[00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:19.380]   Now, life this way might sound appealing.
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:23.460]   The only problem is God's Word tells us
[00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:24.860]   something quite different.
[00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:28.940]   And Scripture warns us that freedom in the flesh
[00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:31.740]   will lead us to some dark places,
[00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:35.380]   places filled with things like sexual immorality,
[00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:39.900]   impurity and debauchery, idolatry, witchcraft,
[00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:44.060]   hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage,
[00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:47.120]   selfish ambition, dissensions, factions,
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.340]   and envy, drunkenness, orgies, and the like.
[00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:54.160]   I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:57.380]   will not inherit the kingdom of God.
[00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:59.880]   When you read through that list,
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:02.400]   you know what it sounds like to me?
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.080]   It sounds like chaos and disorder.
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:08.860]   Right, that sounds like everyone out for themselves,
[00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:11.060]   not caring about those around them.
[00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:16.740]   That list sounds like darkness and hatred and evil.
[00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:18.600]   It's the road to destruction
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:21.760]   and eternal separation from God.
[00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:25.560]   Freedom in the flesh is not true freedom.
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:31.260]   Firstly, it goes against who you were created to be.
[00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:34.380]   Right, because you were created to be a human being
[00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:37.740]   that glorifies himself or herself.
[00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:42.220]   You were created to be an image bearer of God.
[00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:45.660]   This means that you feel your sense and your purpose,
[00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:48.080]   not when you're out doing whatever you want,
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:51.340]   but when your life is fully obedient
[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:53.700]   to what Jesus has called you to.
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.500]   That is when you feel most alive.
[00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:57.420]   That is when you're gonna feel most free.
[00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:59.700]   That is when you're gonna realize what your purpose,
[00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:03.000]   your destiny, whatever word you want to use in life is.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:09.020]   Second thing is this, you end up in a terrible place.
[00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:12.620]   Paul says it clearly, that those who live like this
[00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:14.940]   will not inherit the kingdom of God.
[00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:17.500]   You will have no part in what God's trying to do
[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:20.620]   in this life or the next.
[00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:24.300]   In other words, you are separated from God now
[00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:26.320]   and for all eternity.
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:31.500]   And free living that leads to chaos and separation from God
[00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.660]   is not freedom at all.
[00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:37.060]   Remember what Pastor Andrew said
[00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:38.820]   at the beginning of this series?
[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:43.120]   That the Holy Spirit is what brings order out of chaos.
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.980]   And this is what he wants to do
[00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:48.540]   in the body of Christ in our lives.
[00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:49.860]   And Paul is about to give us
[00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:52.620]   one of the most beautiful examples
[00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:55.980]   of what a life of order in the Holy Spirit looks like.
[00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:58.860]   I would say that this is one of the most beautiful pictures
[00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:02.340]   of order and of peace and of the way God wants us to live
[00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:04.260]   outside of Genesis 1.
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:06.700]   Genesis 1, we have Eden and it's perfect.
[00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:10.940]   This is an echo of what God has talked to us about
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:11.780]   in Genesis 1.
[00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:13.240]   Listen to what the Bible says.
[00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:19.340]   But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,
[00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:23.860]   patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
[00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:26.140]   gentleness, and self-control.
[00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:30.340]   Against such things there is no law.
[00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:35.460]   Doesn't this sound a lot more like peace and order?
[00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:40.460]   Doesn't this sound like the things we want to chase in life?
[00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:43.660]   Isn't this what you hope you've been created for?
[00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:48.340]   Now, there is an important detail to note.
[00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:52.060]   And this is important because this verse is so well known.
[00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:54.420]   Sometimes as Christians when it comes to this,
[00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:57.740]   we like to do like a little stock index exchange
[00:31:57.740 --> 00:31:59.020]   on this passage.
[00:31:59.020 --> 00:31:59.980]   And we begin to think like,
[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:02.500]   oh well, I wasn't very kind today,
[00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:04.460]   but I did have peace about it.
[00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:08.100]   Or, well, I didn't so much self-control,
[00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:10.280]   but there was a lot of joy.
[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:13.860]   Don't do this, okay?
[00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:15.420]   Doesn't make sense.
[00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:18.220]   The fruit of the Spirit is not your stock portfolio.
[00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:21.500]   If you have lots of gains in one,
[00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:23.420]   it doesn't cover the losses in the other.
[00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:25.060]   Do you know what I'm saying?
[00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:28.740]   Can you really be faithful without being patient?
[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:31.900]   Is there real joy without having peace?
[00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:35.220]   There's a simple thing, you might already know this,
[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:36.180]   I'm gonna remind us.
[00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:38.980]   It's not the fruits of the Spirit,
[00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:43.980]   it's the fruit, singular, of the Spirit.
[00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:45.340]   If you've not heard that before,
[00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:47.020]   write it down in your margins, okay?
[00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:50.700]   The fruit of the Spirit.
[00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:53.140]   And if we're gonna grow in the fruit,
[00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:54.620]   if we're gonna walk by the Spirit,
[00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:56.900]   then we're gonna have to dedicate
[00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:00.920]   every part of ourselves in this journey.
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:03.940]   And again, it's not an easy one.
[00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:07.740]   The true Christian life,
[00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:11.260]   if we're really to follow Jesus with everything we have,
[00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:13.360]   it's not the easy path to choose.
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:15.900]   It's the narrow path.
[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:19.460]   Because like we said, your spirit and your flesh
[00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:22.900]   are constantly gonna be at conflict with each other.
[00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.660]   There isn't a version of following Jesus
[00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:27.560]   where we just get to coast and sail off into the sunset,
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:30.500]   not giving a thought to how we're actually supposed
[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:32.160]   to live our lives.
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:35.660]   No, but it's a life of discipline.
[00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:40.020]   Paul calls it, it's a training up for godliness.
[00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:42.700]   Fruit takes time and effort to grow, right?
[00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:45.100]   You can't just plonk a tree in some soil
[00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:47.020]   and just expect it to do its thing.
[00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:49.520]   It takes nurturing, it takes watering,
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:51.580]   it takes nutrients, it takes protection
[00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:53.340]   from the elements and other insects,
[00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:56.420]   it takes pruning and grafting and all that kind of stuff.
[00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:58.400]   It just doesn't happen automatically.
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:02.140]   Which is why, in your Christian life,
[00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:04.980]   it's always gonna be about choosing God's way
[00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:06.700]   instead of your way.
[00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:11.260]   Your old self, with its attraction to chaos and sin,
[00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:13.580]   full of passion and the desires of the flesh,
[00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:15.380]   is always gonna try and draw you back
[00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:17.140]   to that place of chaos.
[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:20.860]   The enemy and the devil and its minions
[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:22.740]   and the enemy of this world is always trying
[00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:26.200]   to use temptation to draw you back into that place
[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:28.740]   of separation from God, of living life
[00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:31.540]   without the Holy Spirit.
[00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:34.320]   This is why we've been saying,
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:39.160]   we need to deal with sin seriously.
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:41.480]   And when we made the decision to follow Jesus,
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:45.200]   it means also identifying with him in death,
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:47.080]   which means that our sinful desires,
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:48.560]   the thing we used to follow in this world,
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:51.960]   have been crucified to the cross with Jesus.
[00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:54.920]   There is no space for that in our walk
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:56.440]   with the Holy Spirit now.
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:35:00.960]   Okay, again, take a deep breath,
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.960]   'cause it sounds like a lot of pressure.
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:07.520]   The good news is that you don't,
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:11.320]   or even you cannot do this by your own power.
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:14.480]   And that's good news.
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:19.480]   And just as the gifts are from the Holy Spirit,
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:23.440]   the ability to put your flesh to death,
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:26.560]   to grow in the fruit, to walk with the Spirit,
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:29.360]   that is also something that the Holy Spirit
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.140]   has to empower you in.
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:35.120]   Right, it's repeated multiple times in this passage.
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:38.360]   We need to be led by the Spirit.
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:40.640]   We need to walk by the Spirit.
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:42.120]   We need to live by the Spirit.
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:43.920]   We need to keep in step with the Spirit.
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:46.960]   The Spirit is there to guide, to lead, to hold,
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:49.560]   to draw you back, to push you forward,
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:53.320]   to help you live this Christian life.
[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:56.000]   And just like we rely on the Holy Spirit
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.120]   to give us our spiritual gifts,
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:00.540]   in the same way, the Holy Spirit helps us
[00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:03.600]   to live lives that will bear fruit.
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:10.720]   Now again, this is not self-help, okay?
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:13.540]   This isn't about making yourself a better person,
[00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:16.760]   self-improvement, it's not about becoming more virtuous
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:19.040]   so people can look at you a certain way.
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:21.200]   This is about dealing with your sin
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:23.520]   so that you can have a living, working,
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:27.680]   convicting, obedient, life, eternity-changing
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:30.400]   relationship with Jesus.
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:33.700]   And He is the one who helps you through it.
[00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:37.300]   Remain in me, He says, as I also remain in you.
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:39.380]   No branch can bear fruit by itself,
[00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:40.860]   it must remain in the vine,
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:45.660]   neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me.
[00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:50.780]   A life totally reliant and connected to our Savior,
[00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:52.720]   to the Holy, and to the Holy Spirit.
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:57.140]   This is what true freedom looks like.
[00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:04.060]   And when we live this way, it tells us there is no law.
[00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:07.940]   God's never gonna stop you from growing
[00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:09.220]   in the fruit of the Spirit.
[00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:11.220]   No government or authority is ever gonna say,
[00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:12.660]   stop doing these things, right?
[00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:16.700]   These are good, virtuous, amazing things, right?
[00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:19.700]   Nothing will ever stop you from growing in the Spirit.
[00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:21.880]   There is no law against these things.
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:25.420]   And so once you've had the fruit,
[00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:28.540]   you've tasted and seen that the fruit
[00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:31.880]   of the Spirit is good, you will begin living
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:34.140]   in a way that brings true life
[00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:38.860]   to yourself and to those around you.
[00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:41.180]   And as difficult as it may be at time,
[00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:43.820]   you will never want to stop growing in them.
[00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:50.840]   The gifts and the fruit, therefore, go hand in hand.
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:57.000]   You are being called to build up the kingdom of God
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.600]   here on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:03.960]   But you're also being called to live lives of holiness
[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:08.960]   and closeness that reflect God's heart and who he is.
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:12.400]   And God expects both his followers
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:16.480]   to use their gifts and to bear fruit.
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:20.840]   This is Pentecost Sunday, and this is exactly
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:23.240]   what happens on the day of Pentecost
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:26.860]   when the Holy Spirit first fell upon the followers.
[00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:29.520]   This is a beautiful picture of gifts and fruit
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:32.720]   coming together when the early church is first established.
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:36.440]   Acts 2.43 tells us this, that when the Holy Spirit came,
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:40.040]   everybody was filled with awe at the many wonders
[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:43.300]   and signs being performed by the apostles.
[00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:46.680]   These are the spiritual gifts at work, tongues, healing,
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:49.260]   all these things that the apostles began to minister
[00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:51.000]   to other people out of the gifts
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.460]   that the Holy Spirit had given to them.
[00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:55.480]   But then it goes on to tell us this,
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:58.720]   that all the believers together had everything in common.
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.320]   They sold property and possessions
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:02.040]   and gave to anyone in need.
[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:04.480]   They continued to meet together in temple courts,
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:08.360]   broke bread, ate together with glad and sincere hearts,
[00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:11.560]   praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people.
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:14.080]   And the Lord added to the number daily
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:15.720]   those who were being saved.
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:20.380]   This is the fruit of the Spirit beginning to grow.
[00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:24.540]   Gifts and fruit, that's how the Holy Spirit
[00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:29.120]   has always wanted to work, has always been working,
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:32.520]   and how he desires to continue to work today.
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:35.140]   So I'm gonna ask everybody to stand.
[00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:38.040]   If you're able to stand, please join me in standing.
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:40.580]   And through communion right now,
[00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:45.200]   we're gonna respond to what God wants us,
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:47.940]   to however God wants us to respond.
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:51.240]   Our hosts are gonna hand out a piece of bread to you.
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:55.700]   When you get the piece of bread, just hold it in your hand,
[00:39:55.700 --> 00:40:00.020]   because we're gonna take it together in just a moment.
[00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:02.100]   But as you hold the bread,
[00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:06.060]   you know, the bread, the scripture tells us,
[00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:08.500]   is a symbol of the body of Christ
[00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:10.500]   that was given and broken for us,
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:16.320]   that God came down to earth as Jesus
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:19.340]   and chose to serve.
[00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:23.000]   You know, one of the most beautiful pictures of unity
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.040]   we see is Jesus with his disciples.
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:32.600]   And before Jesus shared this meal,
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:34.900]   he got down on his hands and his feet
[00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:37.120]   and washed his disciples' feet,
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:41.820]   showing them that this is what it's like to be a servant.
[00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:43.900]   This is what I'm calling you to.
[00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:47.400]   And so as you hold the bread in your hand,
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:51.580]   have that conversation with the Holy Spirit right now.
[00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:54.980]   Ask him, what is my gift?
[00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:59.980]   And how am I to serve you with what you've gifted me with?
[00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:02.180]   Just hold onto this bread,
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:04.620]   and then we'll take it together in just a minute.
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:08.060]   (gentle music)
[00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:10.640]   (gentle music)
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:40.680]   ♪ Worthy of every song we could ever sing ♪
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:47.440]   ♪ Worthy of all the praise we could ever bring ♪
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:53.680]   ♪ Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe ♪
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:58.680]   ♪ We live for you ♪
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   ♪ Jesus, the name above every other name ♪
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:14.880]   ♪ Jesus, the only one who could ever sing ♪
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:21.140]   ♪ Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe ♪
[00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:23.980]   ♪ We live for you ♪
[00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:33.220]   So Jesus, as we hold this bread in our hands,
[00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:35.660]   firstly, we're thankful, Lord, for your presence
[00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:37.260]   that's always with us.
[00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:41.580]   But we know that as we've given our lives to you,
[00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:44.100]   Lord, there's an expectation even from you
[00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:46.980]   for us to serve you and bring you glory.
[00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:49.900]   And you don't do that in a mean, harsh sort of way, Lord.
[00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:53.220]   You call us and you beckon us towards you
[00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:56.460]   and you gift us so that we can find out, Lord,
[00:42:56.460 --> 00:43:01.100]   this purpose that you put us on this earth for.
[00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:04.500]   And so Jesus, I pray that as we take this bread,
[00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:07.620]   you would reveal or remind it to us,
[00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:09.320]   the gifts that you've given to us.
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:12.420]   And as we take it in unity together,
[00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:15.540]   we'll be reminded of the role that we play in your kingdom,
[00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:19.380]   that we work together as one body for your glory.
[00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:22.700]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:23.540]   Take the bread.
[00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:28.300]   And our hosts are gonna serve you with a cup right now.
[00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:31.060]   And of course, the cup reminds us of the redemption
[00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:34.820]   and the forgiveness of sins that we have in Jesus.
[00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:38.260]   But this is also the juice of a fruit.
[00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:41.260]   And so as you take the cup, as you hold it again
[00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:43.100]   and take it together in just a moment,
[00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:44.980]   just like we did with the bread,
[00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:48.500]   be reminded of the fruit that God is growing in you.
[00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:52.180]   And if it's a time of repentance and confession
[00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:55.180]   that you need to come before the Lord for right now
[00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:59.540]   and tell him, I want this more than anything else,
[00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:01.020]   this is a good time to do that.
[00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:04.420]   And just remind yourself of the fruit
[00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:06.460]   that the Holy Spirit is trying to grow in you.
[00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:09.180]   Again, just hold it for a minute, pray,
[00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:11.700]   and we'll come together and take it
[00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:13.380]   as one body in just a second.
