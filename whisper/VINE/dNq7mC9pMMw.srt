1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
 and welcome to Divine Yuen Long and let me introduce myself. I'm June, I'm one of the

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:10,080
 staff here normally. Well, actually my role is to look after the family and kids ministry

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,480
 and I'm honoured today to share my story with you today. So, when I was young, well actually right

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,320
 now I don't really celebrate my birthdays because it fall on a festive day and people are already

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,360
 having parties and stuff like that. So, I'm happily crashing their birthday, their parties

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,480
 and make it my birthday party and just to have fun and you know celebrate together. But one of the

7
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,760
 reasons why that is because obviously it was a festive day and people are already celebrating,

8
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,560
 but another reason is that it might be because of one of the stories that I had when I was young.

9
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:48,080
 So, when I was young, I'm not a very sociable person. I don't have a lot of friends, I have

10
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:54,720
 very low social skills and so when I was in third grade, I already don't have a lot of friends. So,

11
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:02,160
 I decided this year I'm going to have my first ever birthday party. I'm going to invite the many

12
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,720
 numbers of friends that I have at school and my cousins to come to my place and just have a good

13
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,440
 time. They don't know each other because some were from my home, some were from school, you know,

14
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:17,440
 they were in different parts of my life. But you know, I don't know if they planned it together.

15
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:24,080
 One by one, they started to cancel on me on the day of the birthday party. So, at that time,

16
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:30,480
 I was heartbroken. I just sleep it off pretending nothing has happened. But actually, what I was

17
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:38,240
 feeling was rejection and I didn't know it at that time, but as I grow, I realize that rejection is

18
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:44,160
 everyone's story. No matter you are a few months old or you are 900 years old, it is something that

19
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,440
 we have to go through every day. Maybe you start your rejection getting rejected when you want to

20
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,640
 go to someone's home and your parents said no. Maybe you were rejected because you want to sleep

21
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,920
 at 10 o'clock tonight and your parents said no. Maybe you were rejected when you proposed to

22
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:06,000
 someone, maybe for your visa application. There are many opportunities where we would put ourselves

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,240
 out there to be vulnerable and what we received was a rejection. Some rejections are easy to let

24
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:18,480
 go. Sometimes we can just move on with our life easily. But there are emotions that are hard to

25
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,240
 let go. It's not because those are big incidents, there are big things that it's very hard to let

26
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:31,200
 go. Sometimes they're just tiny things. But when we get rejected, it's not that they are rejecting

27
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:38,880
 the incident itself. It felt like they are rejecting me. Me as a person and my worth and

28
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:46,160
 my worth to be at a certain place. The passage that we're looking at today is about the story

29
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:53,280
 of Jesus being born in Bethlehem. And like the perfect and simplified version of a children's

30
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,440
 nativity play, the details of the Christmas story actually revealed God's heart for us.

31
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:06,960
 How is that connected to my story of rejection? When the angels and the hosts all celebrate and

32
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:13,200
 sing together when Jesus was born, how can it connect that to my story of rejection?

33
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:20,320
 So let's have a look at today's scripture together. It's from Luke chapter 2, verse 1 to 5.

34
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:29,360
 In those days, Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman

35
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:36,160
 world. That was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria. And everyone

36
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:43,120
 went to their own town to register. So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to

37
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:50,320
 Judea to Bethlehem, the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David.

38
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:58,720
 The story begins by setting the time, character, and location. Luke not only describes the birth

39
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:05,920
 of Jesus, but also connects that with a historical event. The Roman Empire was ruling over Israel,

40
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:12,400
 and that with one degree, the whole world, meaning the whole Roman Empire, had to pack their bags and

41
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:19,520
 go and return to where they belonged to. So regardless of their social status or what was

42
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:25,360
 going on with their life, they all had to go. So Joseph and Mary set off to their journey,

43
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,960
 and the journey described in the passage was not a short one. It would have taken approximately

44
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,400
 three weeks. So because if you look at it in the map, it would be a straight line from Nazareth to

45
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,000
 Bethlehem. But however, they couldn't go through Syria. They have to detour a little somewhere. So

46
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:51,440
 that actually took around three weeks. And not only that, the danger and the trouble of traveling

47
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:57,840
 so far was actually really tough for both of them. Well, I got a chance to visit Israel in August,

48
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,840
 and I had experience of hiking, you know, at the outskirt of the desert of Judea, and I actually

49
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:10,000
 hiked with my life, as if actually my life depended on it as I hike, because it was so hot and so

50
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:19,040
 and so difficult and so treacherous. I remember as I normally when I hike, I would follow the

51
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:26,160
 guide very closely, because if I don't, I would get lost. I did not know my way around the world.

52
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:33,280
 But at that time, when I hike, I let go of the guide. I let go of the whole group. I'm just

53
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:39,040
 trying to stay alive. I had my water bottle with me. I'm holding it as if I'm holding my baby,

54
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,760
 and I just tried to keep up and try to stay alive. And actually, the hike was easy,

55
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:51,600
 was hard for young individuals like you and I. But imagine, Mary at that time, she was pregnant,

56
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:58,880
 and had to travel from one place to another. And of course, there were many debates over whether

57
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:05,520
 they start the journey in summer or autumn or winter. And probably most of the time,

58
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,000
 most of the debate, they were leaning towards winter. So they don't have to deal with the

59
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,040
 scorching heat or the temperature. But what they had to deal with was the extreme temperature

60
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:21,520
 differences, what they have to deal with was the rocks and the burglars that were hiding,

61
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,720
 and they were trying to overtake or try to rob the passerbys. And there were lots of dangers along

62
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:35,840
 the way. In addition to their personal pressures, Mary had to carry the burden of being an unwed

63
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:42,160
 woman from the very beginning. Throughout those nine months, she likely to face a lot of gossips

64
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:49,120
 and accusations. They faced disbelief and judgment and rejection from those who doubt the story.

65
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:56,560
 The accumulated stress during those months must have been overwhelming. They might have

66
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,960
 originally hoped for a quiet and private birth, but their plan didn't go expected. In the midst

67
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:09,360
 of all these pressures, they had to travel from Nazareth to Bethlehem, and with Mary physically

68
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,280
 pregnant and unable to hide it. Can you imagine what went through Mary's head?

69
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:22,800
 Maybe she would have thought, "God, didn't you told me the plan? Didn't you get me, you know,

70
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,640
 the Holy Spirit pregnant me with a baby? Isn't it your dream? Give me the dream and vision for me to

71
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:34,960
 carry it for you? Didn't you also set it to your husband that not to be afraid? How can your dream

72
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,640
 and your vision coming down like this, into this mess like this? Aren't you the wonderful God who

73
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,600
 could help me and prepare everything for me that you gave me this vision, and now everything seems

74
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:52,000
 to be a mess? How could this be?" I don't know if you resonate with what Mary had experienced.

75
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,080
 Maybe God has given you a dream or a vision or something to work toward, but in the middle of it,

76
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:04,080
 it gets so messy that you doubt if it's ever going to happen and doubt if God ever had spoken to you

77
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:12,880
 like that. But one of the things that this mess was actually planned by God. We in our limitation

78
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:21,200
 can only see so far, but God with His unlimited, unlimited resource, unlimited vision can see past

79
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:28,400
 our mess. This mess was intended so that we could experience Him. It is not that the mess was

80
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,920
 something out of God's control. It is a mess that was planned so that we could experience God.

81
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:40,720
 So let's keep on looking at the next passage from Luke chapter 2, 6 to 7.

82
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:48,000
 "And while they were there, a time came for her to give birth. And she gave birth to her firstborn

83
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,840
 and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him on a manger, because there was no place for them

84
00:08:53,840 --> 00:09:00,080
 to be in the inn, because there was no place for them in the inn." Having no place is a remarkable

85
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:06,720
 statement. Why was there no place? Did Joseph not book a room in advance? Was there no hotel?

86
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:16,000
 Did he try Airbnb? He should. It's quite useful. However, as we mentioned earlier, Joseph and Mary

87
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,280
 was not going on a trip. They were not traveling. They had to go back to where David, where

88
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:30,240
 Josh Joseph came from, that going back to where he came from. And so it would probably be going

89
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,000
 back to his family, to his relatives, to his uncle and aunt, probably someone that he know.

90
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,800
 And so when they travel back to Bethlehem, they will not go for an inn. They would not go for

91
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,880
 someone they don't know. They would have expected to go back to their family. They would have

92
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:53,360
 expected their family to open up their arms, to embrace them completely, especially for Mary,

93
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,880
 that she has been pregnant and is about to give birth. She would have anticipated a place where

94
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,640
 the family would welcome her in and just give her a place to stay and to give birth in a safe

95
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:11,760
 environment. However, as Joseph going to door to door, asking for a room, and they say no,

96
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:18,000
 it was not because of the only innkeeper that was heartless. It was actually the community

97
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,920
 of where Joseph was from. And to add on to that, they did not just reject two healthy individuals.

98
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:33,600
 They were rejecting a woman who was about to give birth. If there are mothers and fathers in the

99
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:40,800
 room, if you've experienced the hectic and the nervousness of your spouse giving birth,

100
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:48,240
 it would be hard to imagine that when Joseph have to take Mary door to door and all the answers

101
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:54,720
 was a no. No, you cannot stay here. No, even if giving birth is a life and death event,

102
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:01,440
 we will not make room for you. That you have to give birth where animals eat.

103
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:08,000
 The first Christmas is not of a picture perfect one. It was one about rejection.

104
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,200
 The savior of the world was not welcomed at the beginning. No one was willing to make room for

105
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:22,800
 Mary to give birth to Jesus. And his rejection didn't stop there. Time and time again, people

106
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,800
 rejected him. The Jews cast stones at him. People at his hometown tried to throw him off the

107
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:34,240
 cliff. The religious leaders criticized him because he hung out with the wrong people. He hung

108
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:41,920
 out with sinners and with people of the margins. His own disciples who followed him, who saw all

109
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:47,440
 his great acts, who had been loved by Jesus, one self-sold him out and the other refused to

110
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:54,960
 acknowledge him, to know him. His friends, his families, and religious leaders all rejected him.

111
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:08,160
 Even ourselves, before we started to accept Jesus, we ourselves have rejected him.

112
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:16,800
 We did not regard him as our savior. We try to fix our lives with our own ways, hurting others

113
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:24,000
 and ourselves along the way. Even now, when we have become Christians, we will fall into

114
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,040
 rejecting him when we kept him at bay, hiding from him, not acknowledging his sovereignty over us.

115
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:40,160
 Jesus fully understands the pain of being rejected, the hurt of not being recognized or heard,

116
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:46,800
 the isolation, the shame of not being included. He fully understands it, and that's why I know

117
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:53,600
 that he can fully understand me. I'm an only child, and from a young age, I learned my social

118
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,360
 skills through observation. But instead of learning how to make friends, my mind started

119
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,960
 to collect evidence of why people wouldn't want to be friends with me. My parents at that time

120
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:10,800
 were busy with work, and communication or affirmation was not their priority. And so,

121
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:17,200
 all these have created a wall between me and people. I could think of a million ways or a

122
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,240
 million thoughts about me, why people wouldn't hang out with me or give me that opportunity.

123
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:29,760
 In my head, there were reasons why I'm not loved. In order not to be rejected,

124
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:36,960
 I reject other people. I start to collect evidence of why people wouldn't want to include me. So,

125
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:41,600
 before I go for that position, or I try to reach out to those people, or I try to

126
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:47,120
 join in that activity, I would think of reasons why I shouldn't do that, and I say, "Jun,

127
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,600
 you cannot do that. You are not accepted. You will not be loved. Let's stay where you are."

128
00:13:52,400 --> 00:14:00,560
 And so, with all these experiences and rejections, a rejection at myself and a rejection at other

129
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:07,600
 people, I put that with my experience with my God. I project what I've experienced to how God

130
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:14,000
 would have loved me as well. I know that God loves everyone unconditionally, but then, but then.

131
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,840
 I know that God will love me, but how could He love me if I have all these faults? I know God

132
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:26,560
 would love me, but He would love the good part of me. Let me fix my fault first. Let me fix my

133
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:33,120
 failures first. He would love this good part of me, and the parts that I have rejected myself,

134
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:40,560
 I'm just going to hide. I'm just going to stay where I am. And so, for the longest time, I do

135
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:48,000
 not, I did not experience the love of God because of how I've experienced my love in this world.

136
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:55,360
 I find that as I've rejected myself, I have rejected others' love for me and God's love for me.

137
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:04,000
 And because of rejection, I've isolated myself and carried the burden of always living on edge

138
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:12,480
 in the fear of more rejection. It felt like I'm walking on a tightrope. I'm longing to reach to

139
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:21,280
 the other side, to make friends, to be connected, to have that opportunity. But I'm also carrying

140
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:28,640
 this heavy burden of the fear of being rejected, of the fear that actually what I rejected myself

141
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:33,200
 is going to be used against me. And I've walked on this tightrope for the longest time.

142
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,920
 But Jesus understood all of that.

143
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:46,880
 Jesus understood the fear and burden caused by rejection because He has been rejected.

144
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:52,480
 He understands my defense mechanism because He had lived in this world,

145
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:59,280
 and He understands my limitation as a human. Jesus showed me through the story of His messy

146
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:05,360
 birth that He is not looking for a grand entrance to get all the glory and all the love from people.

147
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:11,680
 He is willing to be born in a smelly, disease-ridden place,

148
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:19,120
 showing me that He is willing to accept me no matter how dark and rotten I feel I am.

149
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:28,240
 I've learned that the first step to be healed from the wounds of rejection is acceptance.

150
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:36,080
 I have to accept that I am fully loved by God. To accept that with my flaws and all,

151
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:42,000
 I am worthy of love. And it is a decision I have to make before I feel anything. It's not that,

152
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,600
 "Oh, I feel the love of Jesus so I know that I'm fully accepted." If that is the case,

153
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,320
 then I will be going around collecting evidence. "Oh, today I received this so Jesus loves me,

154
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,840
 but today I don't have that, so Jesus doesn't love me." And I will be comparing,

155
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:01,520
 and I'll be collecting evidence. I will never be filled because I'm looking at this realm,

156
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:07,920
 and I try to find that if I'm still worth it or not. So in order to be fully accepted,

157
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,720
 I need to make a decision to go, "Hey, I decided that no matter what happens,

158
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:19,040
 no matter what I see, I accept that Jesus loves me unconditionally. He loves me as a person.

159
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:24,560
 He loves who I am, the person that He has made. He knows that I am worth it."

160
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,800
 And so that is the first step for me to know that I am accepted.

161
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:36,880
 We can sing the songs of boundless love a million times, and it would only carry meaning if we could

162
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:43,360
 accept that the deep, the depth, and the width of His love on each and every one of us. There is no

163
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:49,600
 flaws and no brokenness and no imperfections that can separate His love for you and for me.

164
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:55,840
 Every time a sneaky, intrusive thought would come in to tell you that there are reasons for you not

165
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,320
 to be loved, there are reasons for you not to be accepted, but you've got to make a decision

166
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,840
 and let the Holy Spirit to lead you, to guide you to say, "But this is not true.

167
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:11,120
 This is not what the Bible says. This is not what God's love looks like."

168
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:17,120
 And so with that thought, I began the journey of my restoration

169
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:26,400
 because I'm accepted in Christ, fully accepted. I have the courage to show my authentic self to

170
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:33,200
 people around me. I allow them to see my flaws, my mistakes, and my imperfections,

171
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:39,360
 knowing that since the Most High has accepted me, I can have no fear.

172
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:47,280
 Even though they can still reject me, I am always fully known and fully loved.

173
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:53,840
 You are fully known. All your things that you feel you're good at, all the things that you feel

174
00:18:53,840 --> 00:19:01,040
 you're not good at or not enough, you are fully known and fully loved. This love is not

175
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:06,880
 because of how good you are. It is because of how deep His love for you is.

176
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:16,000
 So as I open myself to my community, and specifically to community in Christ,

177
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,760
 they show me that this love actually exists in this world. They show me that not because they

178
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,960
 are able to do that in person, but because each and every one of them has received the love of God,

179
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,960
 the grace of God, and they are extending it to the people around them.

180
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:40,960
 They don't make use of my mistakes as a reason to reject me, but actually they've stayed by me.

181
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:49,200
 And even though I was about to run away. And I've seen this in this community. I've seen people walk

182
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,680
 the extra mile. I've seen people going out of their comfort zone to make friends. And I've got

183
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:01,920
 to say, to reach out and make friends or to be known is a very risky thing, because you are putting

184
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:08,800
 yourself out there being vulnerable. What if people say no when I say hi? What if people just turn

185
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:15,440
 their shoulders? What if when I try to say, want to join in their lunch, they would reject me?

186
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:22,400
 But remember, because you're always fully known, you will always be accepted in Christ's community.

187
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:29,760
 You are also accepted and welcome if you want to stay on my stage. It's okay.

188
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:42,800
 So, with that, I would love to extend my message to you to tell you that God loves you very much.

189
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,800
 And I would like every one of you to stand up and just to receive the prayer.

190
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,760
 And would the band please come up as well.
