2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Imagine with me for a moment, a church.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 This is not a church in the singular, on its own and distinct,

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 but a church in the plural, united across a nation, joined in purpose,

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 focused on building up God's kingdom, one life at a time.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 It is a church that has at the heart of its DNA,

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 the grand narrative of the redemptive story of Jesus Christ,

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 and that celebrates in the freedom and grace that such a story brings.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 This church is not constricted by the walls of a building,

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 but actively engaged in the community it is planted in,

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 desiring for God's kingdom to take root and bear fruit in local soil.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 A church that sees salvation as holistic,

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 transforming God's people for God's work,

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 and equipping a generation to represent God's heart

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 to the poor, the weak, the oppressed, and the persecuted.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Imagine this church committed to seeing the family as integral

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 to all that it's called to be and do,

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 involving intentional, committed, and authentic relationships across all levels.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 It is the sort of place where both the young and the old feel cared for,

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 supported and equipped.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 A church where people of all backgrounds and traditions come to feel at home,

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 a cultural mosaic that honors and embraces a richness in diversity

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 that marks us as the body of Christ.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 It is a church that is willing to innovate and express faith creatively,

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 reflecting the boundless limits of God's creativity as glory to Him.

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 A place where people gather, hungry for the presence of God,

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 and passionate to see this invade all aspects of their lives,

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 where they seek to develop an intelligent, spiritual faith,

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 rooted in God's Word and driven with prayer.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 A church that does not make its Sunday services the exclamation mark of its existence,

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 but instead the comma in its ongoing sentence,

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 a time of service, love, and engagement

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 that inspires and emboldens all equally for the conversation that lies ahead.

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 A church that cares, disciples, rebuilds, renews.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 This is our city.

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 This is our church.

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 This is our home.

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Good morning everyone. How are you doing?

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 It's one week to Christmas and you see the weather, it's finally right.

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 We're finally in the right kind of weather, right?

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 Yeah, okay. Some of you enjoy it, I can see a few of you.

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 The others are like, "Oh, it's too cold, it's too cold."

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 So if you feel it's too cold today, I hope you would enjoy the embrace of God in the house here today.

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 All right, why don't we stand? Let's stand.

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 And all of you standing in the back, are you gonna like come and grab a seat?

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Oh, okay. Anyway, we love you very much.

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 But we're here to worship Jesus today. I'm so excited you're all here.

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 We're gonna pray into this.

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Like, "Oh, come all you faithful," right? Why don't we pray?

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Father, we welcome your presence in this house today, Lord God.

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 We are so excited that we get together as a church after a week apart.

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 And God, we just pray that today as we sing to you, as we worship you,

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 I pray that our focus will be solely fixed on you, Jesus.

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 There's so much we brought here with us today.

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 But God, today as we celebrate the season of Christmas, we want to be reminded once again, Lord God,

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 we want our hearts to be turned to you.

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 So come, Lord, I pray that you would grab attention here in this house today.

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Lord, let this time we will sing as we sing to you, Jesus.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Let we just spend time with you, focus on you.

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Let us lay down everything else before you.

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 God, we're here for you, and we're ready for you, Lord.

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000

00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 It is the night of our dear Savior's birth.

106
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 Long lay the world in sin and error pining

107
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 till he appeared and the soul felt his word.

108
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:58,000

 Oh, night, oh, night divine.

 Truly, truly he taught us to love one another.

117
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 His law is love and his gospel is peace.

118
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 Chain he should break for the slave is our brother.

119
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 And in his name all oppression shall cease its guide.

120

 Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we.

121

 It's a Christmas song.

137
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 But it sings about God's goodness to us and his love

138
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 towards us.

139
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 What better way did he show us that than when he came.

 Highly favored, anointed.

180
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Fill with your power all the glory in Jesus' name.

181
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 And should this life bring suffering, Lord, I will remember.

182
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 What Calvary has bought for me, both now and forever.

183
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 God, you're so good.

184
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 God, you're so good.

185
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 God, you're so good.

186
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 God, you're so good.

187
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 You're so good to me.

188
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 God, you're so good.

189
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 God, you're so good.

190
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 God, you're so good.

191
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 You're so good to me.

192
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 I am blessed.

193
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 I am blessed.

194
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 I am called.

195
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 I am healed.

196
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 I am whole.

197
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 I am saved in Jesus' name.

198
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Highly favored, anointed.

199
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 Fill with your power all the glory in Jesus' name.

200
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 I am blessed.

201
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 I am called.

202
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 I am healed.

203
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 I am whole.

204
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 I am saved in Jesus' name.

205
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 Highly favored, anointed.

206
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 Fill with your power all the glory in Jesus' name.

207
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 Last time, God, you're so good.

208
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 God, you're so good.

209
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 It's a lot.

210
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 God, you're so good.

211
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 God, you're so good.

212
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 You're so good to me.

213
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 I'm just wondering as we were singing, when we say these words

214
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 or when we sing these words, God is good, you're so good to me.

215
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 I just want to do a survey here in this room.

216
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 You can open your eyes right now.

217
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 If these words, God is good or God is good to me,

218
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 if that means something to you personally,

219
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 can I have your hands raised all across this room?

220
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 All right.

221
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 Okay, let's keep your hand up there.

222
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 Let's keep your hand up there.

223
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 So this is personal to you, I assume, right?

224
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 Because you said that means something to me personally.

225
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 If that's the truth, then what I want to do is we're going to sing

226
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 God is good one more time, and I want you to mean it like this is

227
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 personal to me.

228
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 God, you're just so good to me, to me.

229
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 I love you, God, because you're so good to me,

230
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 and I'm here to sing this praise to you.

231
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 I'm here to worship you today because you are good.

232
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 Can we do this, church?

233
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 Can we do this one more time?

234
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 Let's do this.

235
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 Let's worship him all across this house.

236
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 Come on, church.

237
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 Let's give it up this place.

238
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 Let's do it.

239
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 Let's sing this, church.

240
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 God, you're so good.

241
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 God, you're so good.

242
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 God, you're so good.

243
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 You're so good to me.

244
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 God, you're so good.

245
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 God, you're so good.

246
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 God, you're so good.

247
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 God, you're so good.

248
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 You're so good to me.

249
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 God, you're so good.

250
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 God, you're so good.

251
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 God, you're so good.

252
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 You're so good to me.

253
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 God, I thank you.

254
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 You're so good, and your goodness has nothing to do with us.

255
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 Your goodness has nothing to do with how good we are.

256
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 Your goodness has nothing to do with how much we've done to earn it.

257
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 God, you're just so good for who you are, and we praise you for that.

258
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 We love you, God.

259
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 We worship you today because you are just so good.

260
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 With or without us, you are good forever.

261
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Yesterday, today, you are the same.

262
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 You are just that very, very good God, and we praise you, Lord.

263
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 You are so good that when we are not good enough, you are not here to punish us,

264
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 but you send your only son to die for us on the cross.

265
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 So, God, forever, you deserve our praise.

266
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 You deserve our worship, Lord God, and we're here to give you that praise and worship, Lord.

267
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 We praise you.

268
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 We thank you, Jesus.

269
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 We love you.

270
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 In your name we pray, and everybody say, "Amen."

271
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 All right.

272
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 Let's give it up to God, all right?

273
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 Hallelujah.

274
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 All right, now, we could be seated, but if you were here in the last couple of weeks,

275
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 you know that this is Advent, and you see these beautiful candles in front of the stage.

276
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 Our worship has not ended yet.

277
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 While we're seated, we are going to continue to worship God with something called liturgy.

278
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 That is something that has been passed down for years or centuries in the church.

279
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 So what we're going to do is every week we're reading some scriptures.

280
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 Someone is going to come up and lead us in a moment, and we have these candles that represent

281
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 hope, love, peace, and joy, and we're lighting it each week.

282
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 So this week we have Deborah coming to lead us to read the liturgy, and also we'll be praying in a moment.

283
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 So thank you, Deborah.

284
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 Jesus said, "I am the light of the world.

285
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 The one who follows me will not walk in darkness, but have the light of life."

286
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 We'll light this candle as a sign of the coming light of Christ.

287
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 [Lighting the candle]

288
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 We're praying for the fire of the Holy Spirit.

289
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 Like I sometimes need to be shaken up before the fire could be released.

290
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 Okay.

291
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 Ah, it's coming.

292
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 Thank you for your prayer.

293
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 Hallelujah.

294
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 Why don't we continue.

295
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 It is too small a thing for you to be my servant to restore the tribes of Jacob and bring back those of Israel I have kept.

296
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 I will also make you a light for the Gentiles, that my salvation may reach to the ends of the earth.

297
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 Come, Lord Jesus, our light and life.

298
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 Until that day, let us walk in the light of the Lord.

299
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 Why don't we pray together, and thank you, Deborah.

300
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 God, we thank you so much because you are that light, because you are here to bring light to us.

301
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 So, God, I just pray as we are entering into this season of Christmas, God, I just pray that if there's still darkness in us,

302
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 we pray that you would release your light in those areas of our lives.

303
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 And may we continue to put our focus on you each day as we go about life.

304
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 And in Jesus' name we pray.

305
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 Amen.

306
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 Amen.

307
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 Thank you.

308
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 So, right now, we just want to say hello to some of us here who come for the very first time.

309
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 If this is the first time you come and join a service, we would love to say hello to you.

310
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 You could just let us know where you are, and we would love to give you a warm welcome.

311
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 Hi.

312
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 Yeah.

313
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 And you could also scan this QR code on the screen, and there's a very short form just to leave some basic information with us,

314
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 and we will stay in touch with you.

315
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 So, the code is there.

316
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 And today we are very happy because we have some special friends joining us.

317
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 They came all the way from the United States or Hawaii.

318
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 It's the YWAM team.

319
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 They're here to lead our children today in K4C.

320
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 So, why don't we also stretch out our hands to pray for our children.

321
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 God, we thank you for children.

322
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Thank you.

323
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 They remind us so many things.

324
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 They remind us of simple faith and a lot of things in our lives.

325
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 But, God, today we want to pray for them.

326
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 We want to bless them that they will continue to encounter you at K4C.

327
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 I pray for the team.

328
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 I pray for our children.

329
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 I pray for a wonderful time for them today in Jesus' name.

330
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 Amen.

331
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 All right, parents, you know where to go.

332
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 Zero to two at the back, three to five, or six to 12 over there on that side.

333
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 If you're here staying here, why don't you turn to your neighbors and just share a few things with them.

334
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 How's your week so far?

335
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 Like, let's have a chat with someone.

 Awesome, awesome.

344
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 Totally feeling the season so far, huh?

345
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 Great.

346
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 As usual, we have a couple of announcements for you.

347
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 And we'll start with this coming Tuesday.

348
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 We have a prayer meeting.

349
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 Actually, it's a monthly prayer meeting.

350
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 We're having it every month on one of the Tuesdays.

351
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 And it's in person.

352
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 So it will happen here.

353
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 The slide is coming up in the back.

354
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 It starts at 8 p.m.

355
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 I almost wanted to say a.m., but we start at 8 p.m.

356
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 So grab dinner and then come join us to pray, not just for ourselves or our church, but also pray for the community around us or the city we're in.

357
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 And then on the 25th, that's next -- what do you call it?

358
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 Not next Monday.

359
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 Do you call it next Monday?

360
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 Anyway, okay.

361
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 You know next Sunday we have the Christmas Eve service?

362
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 But then on the 25th, like we've said before, we have the Christmas service.

363
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 So 9.30 and 11.30 a.m. as usual.

364
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 We'll see you there.

365
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 We love to see you there.

366
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 And after service, we have the cookie feast.

367
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 And, yeah, so anybody else you can bake or you love cookies?

368
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 No, none of you?

369
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 I don't believe it.

370
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 I know you're all secret cookies lovers.

371
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 Or, you know, we don't have to just eat cookies.

372
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 You can bring in whatever, like from bakery, whatever pastries, whatever you love, we can bring and share.

373
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 It's the spirit of the season to really share.

374
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 Nobody should spend Christmas alone.

375
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 Amen?

376
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 Yes.

377
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 Okay, now enough feasting.

378
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 I have something else to talk to you about.

379
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 After feasting, after this whole season, in January, every year at the Vine, we do a churchwide annual fast.

380
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 That is next year or next month.

381
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 We start in January on the 8th all the way until 28th.

382
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 It's about 21 days.

383
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 And if you are asking the question, oh, why are we fasting?

384
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 I do want to tell you that, you know, fasting has been something that Christians have been doing for centuries.

385
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 You know, Jesus taught his disciples.

386
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 When he taught his disciples, Jesus didn't say, "If you fast."

387
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 Jesus says, "When you fast."

388
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 It means he assumes his disciples are doing it on a regular basis.

389
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 And if you're not doing that on a regular basis, it's okay.

390
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 We still love you.

391
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 Jesus still loves you.

392
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 But it's also a very great spiritual practice for us to start or to try.

393
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 And don't worry.

394
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 It doesn't mean you're not going to eat for 21 days.

395
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 It's not like that.

396
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 There are many, many different ways to fast.

397
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 Complete or full fast is just one of the many ways.

398
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 Some people choose a partial fast.

399
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 Somebody does something like, what do you call it, a Daniel fast.

400
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 For 21 days, they have a certain diet.

401
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 They avoid certain things.

402
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 So the main thing, it's not about what you eat or what you don't eat.

403
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 It's about refocusing on God.

404
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 It's about, you know, putting your focus less on yourself, less on what you want,

405
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 less on what you need, but put your focus on God and say,

406
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 "God, I want to humble myself before you.

407
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 I want to tune in so that I can listen to your voice even more.

408
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 And we want to worship you even more."

409
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 And we're not just doing it as individuals.

410
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 We're doing it as a church.

411
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 We see stories after stories in the Bible when God's people join together in a fast.

412
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 God will speak to them.

413
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 God will do amazing things in them.

414
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 And at the beginning of the year, that's what we want to do.

415
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 We say, "God, we want to dedicate this whole year to you."

416
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 And this is a posture.

417
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 We want to come into a time of fasting to seek you together.

418
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 And again, food is just one of the many things you can fast.

419
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 Nowadays, there are so many things that are fighting for attention,

420
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 that are stealing our attention from God.

421
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 And maybe perhaps you know what those things are for you,

422
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 and those are the things that you can lay down for 21 days for Jesus.

423
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 Social media has been one of the very popular options recently.

424
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 I'm not saying that you have to do it, but that's just one of the examples that I can give you.

425
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 And so as we are feasting in the next couple of weeks,

426
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 you can spend some time in your quiet time.

427
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 "God, what would you like me to fast in January?"

428
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 That's a good time to think about it as well.

429
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 In the next couple of weeks, we'll give you more updates about this.

430
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 Are you good? Okay.

431
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 Yeah? Hungry? That's okay.

432
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 Yeah, let's go and eat a feast before we start the fasting.

433
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 But yeah, so now we're going to continue our worship with our offering.

434
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 As volunteers, our welcome team are passing down the buckets.

435
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 If you're using cash or checks, you may grab one of those envelopes on the seat,

436
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 and you can write on them so you could get the tax receipt.

437
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 Or if you're using any digital means, they're all on the wall.

438
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 QR code, scan it.

439
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 We all are very used to it nowadays.

440
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 It's such a beautiful time in Christmas, remembering when we give,

441
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 when we're thinking what we can offer God,

442
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 that we remember God has offered us his one and only son here to come on earth,

443
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 to go through all the mess, right?

444
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 We're having this sermon series called "Christmas,"

445
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 and we're going to be going through all the mess, going through all the trouble,

446
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 and to die for us on the cross, a very horrible death,

447
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 so that we could be with him, so that we can experience his generosity.

448
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 So that's what this season is all about.

449
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 So let's respond to that kind of generosity in our worship, in our offering.

450
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 Why don't we pray together?

451
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 Father, we thank you for your generosity, your ultimate generosity.

452
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 You gave your one and only son.

453
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 God, we know we can never outgive you, and we celebrate that.

454
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 We celebrate the fact that we have a good, good father, a generous father.

455
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 We know everything we need in our life, you already knew before we even asked.

456
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 So God, today, as we come here, this is not just an act of generosity.

457
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 This is an act of faith, knowing that as we put in these resources,

458
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 as we give them back to you, as we put these in the buckets

459
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 or through online or whatever way, God, we know, first of all,

460
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 you will continue to be our provider.

461
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 And we also know that you are going to multiply these resources

462
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 to bless so many other people around us.

463
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 So God, we just pray your kingdom come.

464
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 We pray that you will continue to grow that kingdom on earth

465
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 through our small partnership with you.

466
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 God, we thank you, we love you.

467
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

468
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 Now, I am so excited to welcome to the stage our friend June.

469
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 She is going to bring the message to us today.

470
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 And where do you want me to put this?

471
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 It's here, it'll be fine.

472
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 Why don't we stretch out our hands and let's pray for June.

473
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 God, we realize in the last couple of weeks as we talk about this Christmas,

474
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 a lot of us, we are also sharing the mess in our lives as well.

475
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 But Father, we know in our stories, in the story of the Bible,

476
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 we saw how you always act and work in our midst.

477
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 And so, yeah, Father, we just pray that today this mess we are sharing

478
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 will become a message in our lives.

479
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 We just pray you would release your word in and through June

480
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 and to bless our hearts to change our lives.

481
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

482
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 Thank you, Chapman.

483
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 Welcome to Divine Yuen Long and let me introduce myself.

484
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 I'm June. I'm one of the staff here.

485
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 Normally, well, actually my role is to look after the family and kids ministry.

486
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 And I'm honored today to share my story with you today.

487
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 So, when I was young, well, actually right now,

488
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 I don't really celebrate my birthdays because it fall on a festive day.

489
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 And people are already having parties and stuff like that.

490
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 So, I'm happily crashing their parties and make it my birthday party.

491
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 And just to have fun and, you know, celebrate together.

492
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 But one of the reasons why that is because, obviously,

493
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 it was a festive day and people are already celebrating.

494
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 But another reason is that it might be because of one of the stories

495
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 that I had when I was young.

496
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 So, when I was young, I'm not a very sociable person.

497
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 I don't have a lot of friends. I have very low social skills.

498
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 And so, when I was in third grade, I already don't have a lot of friends.

499
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 So, I decided this year I'm going to have my first ever birthday party.

500
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 I'm going to invite the many numbers of friends that I have at school

501
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 and my cousins to come to my place and just have a good time.

502
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 They don't know each other because some were from my home,

503
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 some were from school, you know, they were in different parts of my life.

504
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 But, you know, I don't know if they planned it together.

505
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 One by one, they started to cancel on me on the day of the birthday party.

506
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 So, at that time, I was heartbroken.

507
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 I just sleep it off pretending nothing has happened.

508
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 But actually, what I was feeling was rejection.

509
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 And I didn't know it at that time.

510
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 But as I grow, I realize that rejection is everyone's story.

511
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 No matter you are a few months old or you are 900 years old,

512
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 it is something that we have to go through every day.

513
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 Maybe you start your rejection getting rejected

514
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 when you want to go to someone's home and your parents said no.

515
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 Maybe you were rejected because you want to sleep at 10 o'clock tonight

516
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 and your parents said no.

517
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 Maybe you were rejected when you proposed to someone,

518
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 maybe for your visa application.

519
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 There are many opportunities where we would put ourselves out there

520
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 to be vulnerable and what we received was a rejection.

521
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 Some rejections are easy to let go.

522
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 Sometimes we can just move on with our life easily.

523
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 But there are emotions that are hard to let go.

524
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 It's not because those are big incidents,

525
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 those are big things that it's very hard to let go.

526
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 Sometimes they are just tiny things.

527
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 But when we get rejected,

528
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 it's not that they are rejecting the incident itself.

529
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 It felt like they are rejecting me.

530
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 Me as a person and my worth and my worth to be at a certain place.

531
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 The passage that we are looking at today

532
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 is about the story of Jesus being born in Bethlehem.

533
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 Unlike the perfect and simplified version of a children's nativity play,

534
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 the details of the Christmas story actually revealed God's heart for us.

535
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 How is that connected to my story of rejection?

536
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 When the angels and the hosts all celebrate and sing together

537
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 when Jesus was born,

538
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 how can it connect that to my story of rejection?

539
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 So let's have a look at today's scripture together.

540
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 It's from Luke 2, verse 1-5.

541
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 In those days, Caesar Augustus issued a decree

542
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world.

543
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 That was the first census that took place

544
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 while Quirinius was governor of Syria.

545
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 And everyone went to their own town to register.

546
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea

547
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 to Bethlehem, the town of David,

548
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 because he belonged to the house and line of David.

549
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 The story begins by setting the time, character, and location.

550
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 Luke not only describes the birth of Jesus,

551
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 but also connects that with a historical event.

552
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 The Roman Empire was ruling over Israel,

553
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 and that with one degree, the whole world,

554
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 meaning the whole Roman Empire,

555
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 had to pack their bags and go and return to where they belonged to.

556
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 So regardless of their social status

557
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 or what was going on with their life, they all had to go.

558
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 So Joseph and Mary set off to their journey,

559
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 and the journey described in the passage was not a short one.

560
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 It would have taken approximately three weeks.

561
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 So because if you look at it in the map,

562
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 it would be a straight line from Nazareth to Bethlehem.

563
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 But however, they couldn't go through Syria.

564
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 They had to detour a little somewhere.

565
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 So that actually took around three weeks.

566
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 And not only that, the danger and the trouble of traveling so far

567
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 was actually really tough for both of them.

568
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 Well, I got a chance to visit Israel in August,

569
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 and I had experience of hiking, you know,

570
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 at the outskirt of the desert of Judea,

571
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 and I actually hiked with my life,

572
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 as if actually my life depended on it as I hiked,

573
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 because it was so hard and so difficult and so treacherous.

574
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 I remember as I-- normally when I hike,

575
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 I would follow the guide very closely,

576
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 because if I don't, I would get lost.

577
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 I would not know my way around the world.

578
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 But at that time, when I hike, I let go of the guide.

579
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
 I let go of the whole group.

580
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 I'm just trying to stay alive.

581
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 I had my water bottle with me.

582
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 I'm holding it as if I'm holding my baby,

583
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 and I just try to keep up and try to stay alive.

584
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 And actually the hike was easy--

585
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 was hard for young individuals like you and I.

586
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 But imagine, Mary at that time, she was pregnant,

587
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 and had to travel from one place to another.

588
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
 And of course, there were many debates

589
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 over whether they start their journey in summer or winter.

590
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 And probably most of the time, most of the debate,

591
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
 they were leaning towards winter.

592
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 So they don't have to deal with the scorching heat

593
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 or the temperature, but what they had to deal with

594
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 was the extreme temperature differences,

595
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 what they had to deal with was the rocks and the burglars

596
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 that were hiding and they were trying to overtake

597
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 or try to rob the passerbys.

598
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 And there were lots of dangers along the way.

599
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 In addition to their personal pressures,

600
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 Mary had to carry the burden of being an unwed woman

601
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 from the very beginning.

602
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
 Throughout those nine months,

603
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 she likely to face a lot of gossips and accusations.

604
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 They faced disbelief and judgment and rejection

605
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
 from those who doubt the story.

606
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 The accumulated stress during those months

607
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 must have been overwhelming.

608
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 They might have originally hoped for a quiet and private birth,

609
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 but their plan didn't go expected.

610
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
 In the midst of all these pressures,

611
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 they had to travel from Nazareth to Bethlehem

612
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 and with Mary physically pregnant and unable to hide it.

613
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 Can you imagine what went through Mary's head?

614
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 Maybe she would have thought,

615
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 "God, didn't you told me the plan?

616
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
 "Didn't you get me, you know, the Holy Spirit,

617
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 "pregnant me with a baby?

618
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 "Isn't it your dream?

619
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
 "Give me the dream and vision for me to carry it for you?

620
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
 "Didn't you also said it to your husband

621
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 "that not to be afraid?

622
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
 "How can your dream and your vision coming down like this,

623
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 "into this mess like this?

624
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 "Aren't you the wonderful God who could help me

625
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
 "and prepare everything for me that you gave me this vision

626
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 "and now everything seems to be a mess?

627
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
 "How could this be?"

628
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 I don't know if you resonate with what Mary had experienced.

629
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 Maybe God has given you a dream or a vision

630
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
 or something to work toward,

631
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 but in the middle of it, it gets so messy

632
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 that you doubt if it ever going to happen

633
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
 and doubt if God ever had spoken to you like that.

634
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 But one of the things that this mess

635
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
 was actually planned by God.

636
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
 We in our limitation can only see so far,

637
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
 but God with his unlimited resource,

638
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
 unlimited vision can see past our mess.

639
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 This mess was intended so that we could experience him.

640
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
 It is not that the mess was something out of God's control.

641
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,000
 It is a mess that was planned so that we could experience God.

642
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
 So let's keep on looking at the next passage.

643
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 From Luke chapter 2, 6 to 7.

644
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 "And while they were there, a time came for her to give birth.

645
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
 "And she gave birth to her firstborn

646
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
 "and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him on a manger,

647
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
 "because there was no place for them to be in the inn,

648
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 "because there was no place for them in the inn."

649
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 Having no place is a remarkable statement.

650
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 Why was there no place?

651
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 Did Joseph not book a room in advance?

652
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 Was there no hotel?

653
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 Did he try Airbnb?

654
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 He should. It's quite useful.

655
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
 However, as we mentioned earlier,

656
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 Joseph and Mary was not going on a trip.

657
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
 They were not travelling.

658
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,000
 They had to go back to where Josh Joseph came from,

659
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
 that going back to where he came from.

660
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
 And so it would probably be going back to his family,

661
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
 to his relatives, to his uncle and aunt,

662
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
 probably someone that he know.

663
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
 And so when they travelled back to Bethlehem,

664
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 they would not go for an inn.

665
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 They would not go for someone they don't know.

666
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 They would have expected to go back to their family.

667
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
 They would have expected their family to open up their arms,

668
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
 to embrace them completely,

669
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
 especially for Mary,

670
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
 that she has been pregnant and is about to give birth.

671
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
 She would have anticipated a place

672
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
 where the family would welcome her in

673
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
 and just give her a place to stay

674
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
 and to give birth in a safe environment.

675
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
 However, as Joseph going door to door,

676
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
 asking for a room and they say no,

677
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
 it was not because of the only innkeeper that was heartless.

678
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,000
 It was actually the community of where Joseph was from.

679
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
 And to add on to that,

680
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,000
 they did not just reject two healthy individuals.

681
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:42,000
 They were rejecting a woman who was about to give birth.

682
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 If there are mothers and fathers in the room,

683
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
 if you've experienced the hectic and the nervousness

684
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
 of your spouse giving birth,

685
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
 it would be hard to imagine

686
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
 that when Joseph had to take Mary door to door

687
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
 and all the answers was a no.

688
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
 No, you cannot stay here.

689
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,000
 No, even if giving birth is a life and death event,

690
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 we will not make room for you.

691
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
 That you have to give birth where animals eat.

692
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:18,000
 The first Christmas is not of a picture perfect one.

693
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
 It was one about rejection.

694
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:26,000
 The saviour of the world was not welcomed at the beginning.

695
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,000
 No one was willing to make room for Mary to give birth to Jesus.

696
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
 And his rejection didn't stop there.

697
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
 Time and time again, people rejected him.

698
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
 The Jews cast stones at him.

699
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
 The Christians at him.

700
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
 People at his hometown tried to throw him off the cliff.

701
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
 The religious leaders criticized him

702
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
 because he hung out with the wrong people.

703
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,000
 He hung out with sinners and with people of the margins.

704
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
 His own disciples who followed him,

705
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
 who saw all his great acts,

706
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
 who had been loved by Jesus,

707
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
 one self-sought him out

708
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
 and the other refused to acknowledge him, to know him.

709
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:10,000
 His friends, his family and religious leaders all rejected him.

710
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
 Even ourselves.

711
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,000
 Before we started to accept Jesus,

712
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
 we ourselves have rejected him.

713
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
 We did not regard him as our saviour.

714
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
 We tried to fix our lives with our own ways,

715
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,000
 hurting others and ourselves along the way.

716
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
 Even now, when we have become Christians,

717
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:38,000
 we will fall into rejecting him when we kept him at bay,

718
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,000
 hiding from him, not acknowledging his sovereignty over us.

719
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,000
 Jesus fully understands the pain of being rejected,

720
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
 the hurt of not being recognized or heard,

721
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
 the isolation, the shame of not being included.

722
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
 He fully understands it.

723
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
 And that's why I know that he can fully understand me.

724
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
 I'm an only child and from a young age,

725
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
 I learned my social skills through observation.

726
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
 But instead of learning how to make friends,

727
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
 my mind started to collect evidence

728
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
 of why people wouldn't want to be friends with me.

729
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
 My parents at that time were busy with work

730
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,000
 and communication or affirmation was not their priority.

731
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
 And so all these have created a wall between me and people.

732
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
 I could think of a million ways or a million thoughts about me

733
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
 why people wouldn't hang out with me or give me that opportunity.

734
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:38,000
 In my head, there were reasons why I'm not loved.

735
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:43,000
 In order not to be rejected, I reject other people.

736
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,000
 I start to collect evidence of why people wouldn't want to include me.

737
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,000
 So before I go for that position or I try to reach out to those people

738
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
 or I try to join in that activity,

739
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
 I would think of reasons why I shouldn't do that.

740
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
 And I say, "Jun, you cannot do that.

741
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
 You are not accepted. You will not be loved.

742
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
 Let's stay where you are."

743
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,000
 And so with all these experiences and rejections,

744
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
 a rejection at myself and rejection at other people,

745
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
 I put that with my experience with my God.

746
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
 I project what I've experienced to how God would have loved me as well.

747
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
 I know that God loves everyone unconditionally, but then...

748
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
 But then...

749
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,000
 I know that God would love me, but how could He love me if I have all these faults?

750
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:34,000
 I know God would love me, but He would love the good part of me.

751
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
 Let me fix my fault first.

752
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
 Let me fix my failures first.

753
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
 He would love this good part of me.

754
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,000
 And the parts that I have rejected myself, I'm just going to hide.

755
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
 I'm just going to stay where I am.

756
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:54,000
 And so for the longest time, I did not experience the love of God.

757
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:00,000
 Because of how I've experienced my love in this world.

758
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
 I find that as I've rejected myself,

759
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:08,000
 I have rejected others' love for me and God's love for me.

760
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
 And because of rejection, I've isolated myself

761
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:16,000
 and carried the burden of always living on edge

762
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
 in the fear of more rejection.

763
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
 It felt like I'm walking on a tightrope.

764
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
 I'm longing to reach to the other side,

765
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,000
 to make friends, to be connected, to have that opportunity.

766
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:36,000
 But I'm also carrying this heavy burden of the fear of being rejected,

767
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:42,000
 of the fear that actually what I rejected myself is going to be used against me.

768
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
 And I've walked on this tightrope for the longest time.

769
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,000
 But Jesus understood all of that.

770
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:55,000
 Jesus understood the fear and burden caused by rejection

771
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
 because He has been rejected.

772
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,000
 He understands my defense mechanism because He had lived in this world

773
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
 and He understands my limitation as a human.

774
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,000
 Jesus showed me through the story of His messy birth

775
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
 that He is not looking for a grand entrance

776
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
 to get all the glory and all the love from people.

777
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:22,000
 He is willing to be born in a smelly, disease-ridden place,

778
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
 showing me that He is willing to accept me,

779
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:30,000
 no matter how dark and rotten I feel I am.

780
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:37,000
 I've learned that the first step to be healed from the wounds of rejection

781
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
 is acceptance.

782
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:45,000
 I have to accept that I am fully loved by God.

783
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,000
 To accept that with my flaws and all, I am worthy of love.

784
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
 And it is a decision I have to make before I feel anything.

785
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:57,000
 It's not that, "Oh, I feel the love of Jesus so I know that I'm fully accepted."

786
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
 If that is the case, then I will be going around collecting evidence.

787
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
 "Oh, today I received this so Jesus loves me,

788
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
 but today I don't have that so Jesus doesn't love me."

789
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
 And I will be comparing and I will be collecting evidence.

790
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,000
 I will never be filled because I'm looking at this realm

791
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
 and I try to find that if I'm still worth it or not.

792
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,000
 So in order to be fully accepted, I need to make a decision to go,

793
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
 "Hey, I decided that no matter what happens, no matter what I see,

794
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
 I accept that Jesus loves me unconditionally.

795
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
 He loves me as a person. He loves who I am, the person that He has made.

796
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
 He knows that I am worth it."

797
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:41,000
 And so that is the first step for me to know that I am accepted.

798
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
 We can sing the songs of boundless love a million times

799
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:49,000
 and it would only carry meaning if we could accept that the deep,

800
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
 the depth and the width of His love on each and every one of us.

801
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,000
 There is no flaws and no brokenness and no imperfections

802
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,000
 that can separate His love for you and for me.

803
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,000
 Every time a sneaky, intrusive thought would come in to tell you that

804
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
 there are reasons for you not to be loved,

805
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
 there are reasons for you not to be accepted,

806
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,000
 but you've got to make a decision and let the Holy Spirit to lead you,

807
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,000
 to guide you to say, "But this is not true.

808
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
 This is not what the Bible says.

809
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
 This is not what God's love looks like."

810
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:29,000
 And so with that thought, I began the journey of my restoration.

811
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,000
 Because I'm accepted in Christ, fully accepted,

812
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:39,000
 I have the courage to show my authentic self to people around me.

813
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:44,000
 I allow them to see my flaws, my mistakes and my imperfections,

814
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:51,000
 knowing that since the Most High has accepted me, I can have no fear.

815
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:59,000
 Even though they can still reject me, I am always fully known and fully loved.

816
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
 You are fully known.

817
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
 All your things that you feel you're good at,

818
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
 all the things that you feel you're not good at or not enough,

819
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
 you are fully known and fully loved.

820
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,000
 This love is not because of how good you are.

821
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:21,000
 It is because of how deep His love for you is.

822
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,000
 So as I open myself to my community,

823
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
 and specifically to community in Christ,

824
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,000
 they show me that this love actually exists in this world.

825
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,000
 They show me that not because they are able to do that in person,

826
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,000
 but because each and every one of them has received the love of God,

827
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:47,000
 the grace of God, and they are extending it to the people around them.

828
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
 They don't make use of my mistakes as a reason to reject me,

829
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
 but actually they've stayed by me,

830
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,000
 and even though I was about to run away.

831
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
 And I've seen this in this community.

832
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
 I've seen people walk the extra mile.

833
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:07,000
 I've seen people going out of their comfort zone to make friends.

834
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,000
 And I've got to say, to reach out and make friends or to be known

835
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:16,000
 is a very risky thing, because you are putting yourself out there, being vulnerable.

836
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
 What if people say no when I say hi?

837
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
 What if people just turn their shoulders?

838
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:28,000
 What if when I try to say I want to join in their lunch, they would reject me?

839
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
 But remember, because you are always fully known,

840
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:37,000
 you will always be accepted in Christ's community.

841
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,000
 You are also accepted and welcome if you want to sit at my stage.

842
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
 It's okay.

843
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:51,000
 So with that, I would love to extend my message to you

844
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
 to tell you that God loves you very much.

845
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:58,000
 And I would like every one of you to stand up and just to receive the prayer.

846
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:12,000
 And would the band please come up as well.

847
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
 Today we talked about Jesus' unconditional love for each and every one of us.

848
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:22,000
 We've talked about how he understands us in our pain of rejection

849
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:33,000
 and wounds that we have created because of the way we have experienced this world.

850
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:45,000
 We've shared about in the midst of all this messiness, God sees and understands.

851
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,000
 And he loves you.

852
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,000
 And I would like everyone to close their eyes.

853
00:57:53,000 --> 00:58:03,000
 Maybe there are questions that you have in your mind about, you question about his love for you.

854
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:09,000
 Maybe there are experiences in your past that has caused pain,

855
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,000
 but you have hid it and you have suppressed it.

856
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:19,000
 Maybe times that you've been rejected so much that you wouldn't want to come out

857
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:28,000
 and the world seems very unsafe for you because you don't know if you'll be rejected or not.

858
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:34,000
 If you are struggling with that, if your friends are struggling with that,

859
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
 I would like you to open up your hands.

860
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,000
 I would like to pray for you.

861
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:48,000
 If you long for healing from rejection, I would like to encourage you.

862
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:54,000
 Allow yourself to be accepted.

863
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:59,000
 You are safe in God's perfect love.

864
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:05,000
 There is no judgment, no condemnation.

865
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:13,000
 You are free to be yourself in God's love.

866
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:24,000
 It is when we are truly ourselves before him that our wounds can begin to heal.

867
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:29,000
 So come before him just as you are.

868
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:41,000
 Open up your hands as a sign of receiving this love.

869
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,000
 And I would like every one of you to be part of that.

870
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,000
 If you are ready to pray for other people,

871
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:54,000
 I would like you to put your hands on their shoulder and just to pray for them.

872
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:59,000
 Pray for them to receive and experience God's boundless love for them,

873
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:06,000
 to experience God's healing for them.

874
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:12,000
 So if you want to pray for other people, you can open your eyes and put your hands on

875
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,000
 those that have opened up their hands.

 Thank you, Father.

01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,000
 We receive your love.

883
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:05,000
 We receive your unconditional acceptance and love and healing.

884
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:12,000
 May what you have planted in our heart today grow and prosper.

885
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:18,000
 May we walk out this room knowing that wherever we are,

886
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:25,000
 however we might feel about ourselves, you always love us.
