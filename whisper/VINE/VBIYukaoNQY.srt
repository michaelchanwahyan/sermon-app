1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 And Father, we want to walk open-handedly before you.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Lord, we recognize everything we have comes from you.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 And so we worship you by letting go of the things that you've blessed us with to bless others

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 in that other-centered love that we were speaking about last week.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 Lord, may our tithes and our offerings not just bless this community,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 but overflow to the other communities and missions organizations and NGOs that we support as a church body.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 We thank you for this, in Jesus' name.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Everyone says, "Amen." Amen.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 All right, well, as you give, why don't you turn around, say hi to somebody,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 welcome them to the Vine, get to know them, say, "Hey, who are you?

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 You seem like a nice person. Be friendly."

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Awesome.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Well, very much welcome to the Vine.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 My name is Andrew. I'm one of the pastors here.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 And I'm so glad that you're here at the 11 o'clock service with us.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 If you're joining us again online from wherever you are around the world,

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 we're grateful that you're also with us, and we're so glad that you're a part of this community too.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 We recognize that over our Christmas period, there have been a lot of new people at the Vine.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Maybe you're guests that have been welcomed by family members to be with us today.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Maybe you're visiting Hong Kong. You're here for the holidays.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Or maybe you've just moved to our city, and you're looking for a new community of faith,

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 and you've shown up today, and you're a part of this for the first time.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 So whether you're a guest with us, whether you're here for the very first time, and you're new to the city,

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 maybe you could just put your hand up and wave it at me, and that's just a way for us to welcome you.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Welcome, guys. Great to have you with us. Welcome here as well.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Anyone on this side of the room in the upper house as well?

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Yes, welcome to you. Anybody online? Yes, I can see you in Alaska waving at us.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 That's a lie, but anyway.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 We're so glad if you are new, and we're grateful that you're with us.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Right after the service, we have a Connect Hub.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 That's a bunch of our most friendliest people that we can find who are going to be in the lobby right outside straight after the service,

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 and they would love to get to know you.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 The Vine is a relatively large church over the three services that we have here.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 We don't want you to feel anonymous or get lost, and so right after the service, you can connect with Carly and her team.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 They'll be wearing lanyards, and so you'll be able to spot them just as you come into the second floor of you in the upper house.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 You can come down the stairs straight after the service, and we would love to meet you there.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 For the rest of us, this is your normal church community.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 We're so glad that you're back and with us.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 Maybe you were traveling over Christmas, and you're back for the new year.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 We're glad that you are home.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 We're excited about what's happening over the next number of weeks here.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 We're going to be starting a brand-new sermon series starting next Sunday, the first Sunday of 2025, called "How We Begin."

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 We're sensing strongly as a leadership here at The Vine that 2025 is going to be a new season of action for us,

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 where we take the gospel of Jesus Christ into our city more than perhaps we've ever done before in our church history.

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 We have been telling you that 2024 was all about a year of intimacy.

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 It was about Christ calling us into intimacy with Him, but we said at the beginning of this year that God doesn't just call us into intimacy for our own benefit,

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 but it's always to transform us, to send us out into the community that He's placed around us.

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 2025 is going to be a year of action for us, and we want to call you at the start of the year, just four Sundays in the lead-up to Chinese New Year,

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 how we begin this process of moving outwards.

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 We're going to look at the life of Samuel and David in the Old Testament,

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 because they went through significant transition seasons of intimacy into action.

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 We're going to have a look at how they transitioned and how they made that jump into the new season.

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 What did they do to prepare themselves?

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 We're going to take that teaching and apply it to us as we begin 2025.

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 That's going to be the next four weeks. Really excited about that for you.

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Then starting on January 6 all the way to the 26th of January, we're doing our annual 21-day fast here at The Vine,

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 where we call you as part of our community to join us in fasting in the first 21 days of giving up something to spend more time with Jesus.

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Fasting can take many different forms, and over those 21 days, a lot of people here at The Vine will fast food,

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 and they'll fast perhaps one meal a day.

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Rather than the normal three meals, they'll fast one meal, and in the time that's created in that,

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 spend that time in prayer and intimacy with Jesus.

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 Maybe they'll fast particular types of food throughout the month.

63
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 A lot of our people fast social media during those 21 days,

64
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 because that gives them a lot of time back in their lives to then spend with Jesus.

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 The whole point of doing a fast is to give up something that's sacrificial to you.

66
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 If you fast something that you don't enjoy doing, that's not a fast.

67
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 That's just weirdness.

68
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 So, you have to give up something that you love to do, something that you want to do,

69
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 and in that place, you connect with Jesus in the time that is created.

70
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 A fast is not a diet.

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 We're not calling you to 21 days of dieting.

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 We're calling you to 21 days of connecting with Jesus in the New Year.

73
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 Does that sound good?

74
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 We'll tell you a little bit more about it next week,

75
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 but for now, we want to encourage you just to begin to pray and begin to ask the Lord what is it that He's asking you to potentially fast for 21 days

76
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 to get more time back in your life to connect with Him.

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 One of the important things that we do during those 21 days is every single day,

78
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 we send out a devotional that has been written by a member of our church community.

79
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 So, one of you has written one of those devotions, and we send it out every single day of those 21 days.

80
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 We send it to your email inbox.

81
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 This is not a plug to sign up to our mailing list, but that's how the devotional comes.

82
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 It comes from our mailing list.

83
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 So, if you're not on our mailing list, you won't get those devotionals over those 21 days.

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 So, to sign up for our mailing list, you can scan the QR code on the screen right now or the QR code that's in front of your seat.

85
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 And on there, you will be able to see a link that says sign up to our mailing list.

86
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 So, give us your email, and that way, over those 21 days, from the 6th to the 26th,

87
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 you'll get a daily devotional written by a congregation member

88
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 that's all designed to bless you in this journey of beginning the new season that the Lord is calling us into.

89
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Does that sound good?

90
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 Oh my goodness.

91
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 No, that sounds terrible, Andrew.

92
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 Does that sound good?

93
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 All right, awesome.

94
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Well, I'm excited.

95
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 We've got Carla Roscoe sharing the word with us today.

96
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Can we give Carla a round of applause as she comes?

97
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Yes.

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Carla and I, color coordinated in beige.

99
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 Beige, brown, I don't know what it is.

100
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 It's cool.

101
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 I don't know what color it is.

102
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Anyway, I'm going to pray for you.

103
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 Can we stretch out our hands and let's pray for Carla.

104
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 Father, we are so grateful for this woman of God who, Lord, over something 20 plus years has served this community with her and her family.

105
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 Lord, we're deeply grateful for just the gifts and the skills and the heart that sits on her,

106
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 the anointing that you have given her, Lord, the prophetic edge that you've placed upon her.

107
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 And Lord, as we come to your word today, we recognize that there's so much that we are still longing to change and renew of ourselves as we move from 2024 to 2025.

108
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 And I pray that Carla's word today would be a significant shifting moment for many of us.

109
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 And we thank you for this in Jesus name.

110
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 Everyone says, Amen.

111
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Early in December, Andrew asked me, "Are you free to preach on the 29th of December?"

112
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 And I was like, "Sure."

113
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 And then he said, "And you can preach on whatever you want."

114
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 And I was like, "Yes! I can preach about this. I can preach about that."

115
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 And then I thought, "Well, maybe I should actually pray and ask God, 'Is there anything specific you would like me to bring on the last Sunday of 2024?'"

116
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 And so as I began praying for our time together and for what to share, I sensed that God impressed upon me three words.

117
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Three words that I believe are important to us as a church and also for us individually.

118
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 So if you're visiting here and this is, you know, you're passing through Hong Kong or for whatever reason you find yourself right now in the Vine at this service, or if you're watching online, then this message is also for you.

119
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 We don't believe in coincidences.

120
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 And again, as I sensed around how to bring this message, I felt that it was important that it was something that we leaned into that would encourage us.

121
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 And that words, these three words God was asking of all of us.

122
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 So those three words are, "Don't hold back."

123
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 As I was chatting with a friend a while ago, they were struggling with something and I asked them, "Well, have you asked God about this?"

124
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 Their response was, "No."

125
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 Which kind of surprised me.

126
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 But as we were talking more, it was clear that there was already an assumption about how God would respond, so they didn't ask.

127
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 Does anybody relate?

128
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 Recently I was talking to a colleague and she mentioned casually how sometimes it's actually hard to talk to God about areas of your life because you're not quite sure what he's going to say.

129
00:09:47,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 And again, I was surprised, but then I thought, "Actually, there's probably areas in my life too that I may not always bring to God and how easy it is to hold back."

130
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 So when these three words came through strongly about to share with you today, I felt that this was something that God was saying very specifically to us today about how we are to enter 2025.

131
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 And that we are to enter 2025 without holding back.

132
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 "Don't hold back," is what God would say to us this morning.

133
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 So, we'll be looking at two examples in scriptures of not holding back.

134
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 And through incredible acts of courage and conviction, we see that God moves in surprising ways that dramatically change trajectory of lives and serve as important examples to us today.

135
00:10:46,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 And my prayer really is as we open scripture and as we allow the Holy Spirit to speak to us, is that we would learn we cannot assume to know what God thinks on all things because that often causes us to hold back.

136
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 When we choose to hold back, we miss out.

137
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 If we choose not to hold back, we will experience a depth in our relationship with God as well as freedom.

138
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 And that is what God desires for us as we enter 2025.

139
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 So, our first story is found in the Old Testament, is in the book of Numbers.

140
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 It's one of my favorite stories.

141
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 It's the story of five sisters who with great courage and humility choose not to hold back even when holding back would appear to be the right thing to do.

142
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 So, we pick up the story from chapter 27.

143
00:11:50,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 And the context is Moses is distributing land to the families of the Israelites for when they enter the promised land.

144
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 Land which according to the law would pass from father to son for generations to come.

145
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 The daughters of Zelophehad, son of Hepha, the son of Gilead, the son of Micah, the son of Manasseh, belonged to the clans of Manasseh son of Joseph.

146
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 The names of the daughters were Marla, Noah, Hogla, Milcah, and Tirzah.

147
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 They came forward and stood before Moses, Elizah the priest, the leaders, and the whole assembly at the entrance to the tent of meeting and said,

148
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 "Our father died in the wilderness. He was not among Korah's followers who banded together against the Lord, but he died for his own sin and left no sons.

149
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 Why should our father's name disappear from his clan because he had no son?

150
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 Give us property among our father's relatives."

151
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 So Moses brought their case before the Lord.

152
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 The Lord said to him, "What Zelophehad's daughters are saying is right.

153
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 You must certainly give them property as an inheritance among their father's relatives and give their father's inheritance to them."

154
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 What's interesting about their story is that it holds a prominent place in scripture.

155
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 It's mentioned five times throughout the book of Numbers, Joshua, and 1 Chronicles.

156
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 So we have to see this as an important incident that the biblical authors want us to take note of.

157
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 See as well, the daughters are all named.

158
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 Again, highly unusual, amplifying this story and the women as important and their actions not to be ignored.

159
00:13:51,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 The daughters of Zelophehad challenged property laws in ancient Israel, which said that only sons could inherit land.

160
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 They chose to approach Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the leaders of the whole assembly.

161
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 Now that is a lot of people right there, and people of power and influence.

162
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 And so no doubt quite intimidating to the sisters.

163
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 But they do so out of a concern for their families and for the name of their father.

164
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 Why should our father's name disappear from his clan because he had no son?

165
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 So they made this request despite the risk.

166
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 Possibly being ostracized from within their own extended family.

167
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 Imagine what their uncles would be thinking who were due to inherit the land, and with that a lot of money.

168
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 It would have put the sisters potentially in a very vulnerable position because they would have controlled what to do with the land.

169
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 They could have asked the sisters to work the land as slaves.

170
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 They could have asked them to leave the land.

171
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 And possibly within their own broader community, they would face ridicule and even rebuke from their spiritual leaders.

172
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 Because after all, this was Torah law.

173
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 So why did they take the risk and not hold back?

174
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 I believe the sisters understood something about what it means to walk in faith with the promises of God.

175
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 The promises of Yahweh.

176
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 They knew they were entering the promised land, and with it the promise of God's provision for their future.

177
00:15:51,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 The law, however, would leave them not only in a vulnerable position, but without land.

178
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 Their father's name would be no more.

179
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 Zelophehad and his family would be forgotten and would not inherit the promised land,

180
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 not inherit promises of God through no fault of their own.

181
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 And that stirs them to speak out.

182
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 I wonder at their courage.

183
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 But I'm also inspired.

184
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 I'm inspired because of how much they trusted God would act justly and ultimately fulfill his promises to provide.

185
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 So let's pause for a moment and ask ourselves,

186
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 honestly, how much do we really trust God?

187
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 Where is our faith in God's promises?

188
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 Or as Andrew reminded us during the Advent season, our wholehearted trust.

189
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 Do we trust God enough to speak up about the things that unsettle us?

190
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 Enough to bring our big questions or our fears, our frustrations and disappointments to God?

191
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Do we trust him enough not to hold back?

192
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 As the sisters go to Moses, we see Moses respond in a way that should be a lesson for us all,

193
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 especially for those of us who are in this room now watching online,

194
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 where you are holding any position of authority or influence or have power over another.

195
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 Remember, Moses was a spiritual leader of the people, revered and respected, and he knew the law.

196
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 He wrote the law inspired by God.

197
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 And yet he chose to go to God first with this request.

198
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 Why? He could have just said, "No, it's the law. The law is the law."

199
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 I believe this tells us something very special about the relationship that Moses had with God.

200
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 He knew God more than anyone else.

201
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 Moses earned the title, "Friend of God."

202
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 Exodus 33 tells us, "The Lord would speak to Moses face to face as one speaks to a friend."

203
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 I can therefore imagine there was a deep conviction within Moses about the sisters' request

204
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 because he knew God, Yahweh, God of justice, always on the side of the poor and the vulnerable.

205
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 And that stirred Moses in his own humility to bring their case to God, even though he had the law.

206
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 May we always be willing to go to God.

207
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 God first whenever we are unsure of something, and not just assume that we know it all or that we have it right,

208
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 or even assume that somebody else does.

209
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 May we not be afraid to question when something feels unjust.

210
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 Remember the gaps Andrew spoke about at the start of Advent?

211
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 The gaps that the Apostle Paul wrote about in his letter to the Corinthians.

212
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 "I know in part."

213
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 Even the learned Apostle Paul, he did not claim to know everything, and nor should we.

214
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 I also believe this passage teaches us something hugely profound about God and our relationship with Him.

215
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 The laws of the Torah were given by God, but I don't believe for a moment that God accidentally got this law wrong, a mistake.

216
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 Oops, didn't think about that. No.

217
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 But rather God knew the laws could not possibly cover every situation and every evolving circumstances,

218
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 and wanted His people to be responsible to seek wisdom from the principles within God's law.

219
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 He didn't want them just to follow a law for the sake of it without fully understanding God's heart behind the law.

220
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 Not to hold back from being willing to approach God for guidance and wisdom.

221
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 God, don't mishear me, God is the same yesterday, today, and forever.

222
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 But rather we understand God's heart and His character when we are facing those challenging situations that we wrestle with.

223
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 Why do you think Jesus got so angry with the Pharisees? Because of the way that they practiced the law and missed completely the heart of God.

224
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 Ultimately in this account, we see the faith and the courage of five sisters not to hold back.

225
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 And that brought the fulfillment of God's promises and the literal promised land.

226
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 So we cannot assume to know everything God is saying or doing with our own limited knowledge.

227
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 Who God is and what He is doing is so much more than we can possibly fully comprehend.

228
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 We cannot put God in our neat little boxes that suit us.

229
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 But rather we work in our relationship so that we can work with knowing God more.

230
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 And then we can fully comprehend what it means to not hold back because we trust Him, because we call Him friend.

231
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 We are far less likely to make decisions based on what we think we know when we are willing to seek God in prayer first.

232
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 Our second example of not holding back is found in the Gospel of Mark.

233
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 And it's the retelling of Jesus encountering a woman who's been sick for many years whilst on the way to heal a child.

234
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 We pick up the story in Mark.

235
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 A large crowd followed and pressed around him. And a woman was there who'd been subject to bleeding for 12 years.

236
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 She'd suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had.

237
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 Yet instead of getting better, she grew worse.

238
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak.

239
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 Because she thought, "If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed."

240
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering.

241
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him.

242
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 He turned around in the crowd and asked, "Who touched my clothes?"

243
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 "You see the people crowding against you?" his disciples answered. "And yet you can ask who touched me?"

244
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it.

245
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and trembling with fear, told him the whole truth.

246
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 And he said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace. Be free from your suffering."

247
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 I love that Jesus makes a point of stopping and acknowledging this suffering woman after he had healed her.

248
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 And that the writer captures the raw details of her suffering.

249
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 Imagine her life before her encounter with Jesus.

250
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 We don't know a lot about her, but we do know she'd suffered physically, economically, and socially.

251
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 Mark Hite writes this when he says, "She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better, she grew worse."

252
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 According to Jewish law, she would have been considered ceremoniously unclean, which meant for 12 years she would have been enforced in social and religious isolation.

253
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 Imagine her life if she hadn't held back and not touched, Jesus wrote.

254
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 The ongoing suffering, the ongoing hopelessness.

255
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 Then imagine her life after her encounter with Jesus, after she did not hold back.

256
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 Now you could say, "Well, she had nothing to lose by reaching out to Jesus," but actually that's not true.

257
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 She carried a lot of shame in her condition.

258
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 She experienced so far disappointment after disappointment after disappointment.

259
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 She would have been setting herself up for disappointment again if she was not healed.

260
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 Plus the public humiliation.

261
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 She wasn't even allowed to touch another person, otherwise they would be considered ritually unclean.

262
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 So the crowd could have turned against her.

263
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 But she took the risk.

264
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 With faith and courage, she didn't hold back.

265
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 Rather, she literally reached out and touched Jesus and was healed.

266
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 And I wonder if maybe there are some of us today that hold back.

267
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 Because we too believe we have something to lose.

268
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 Maybe you've prayed and prayed and yet to receive an answer or to see change.

269
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 Maybe you have experienced rejection, humiliation, and you're afraid to talk about it.

270
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 Let alone come to God and ask in prayer.

271
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 The woman teaches us that even in our darkest places of shame, fear, disappointment,

272
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 by taking the courage to reach out, she was met with love, compassion, and restoration.

273
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 And we can too.

274
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 Imagine your life if you choose not to hold back.

275
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 So why do we hold back?

276
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 What are some of the obstacles that we face that keep us from truly surrendering to God?

277
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 Shame, societal pressure, faulty beliefs about who God is, complacency, fear, to name a few.

278
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 And I'm sure that there are many other reasons that you would have for holding back.

279
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 I also know that sometimes our prayers are not answered in the way we had hoped.

280
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 And for some of us, the very real sense of disappointment holds us back from being truly honest with God.

281
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 We might think we're being honest, but truly being honest with Him.

282
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 You see, the reality is our world is broken.

283
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 And there is pain and suffering all around us and in our lives.

284
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 But in the midst of this, we have to be able to go to God with our pain

285
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 and trust that we can be completely honest with Him.

286
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 Think of Job.

287
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 The suffering he went through, the death of loved ones, financial ruin, betrayal, physical sickness.

288
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 And through it all, he did not hold back his feelings and his sufferings from God.

289
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 He asked a lot of questions.

290
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 But in the end, whilst in the suffering, and when there was no change in his circumstances,

291
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 there was a shift in his relationship and understanding of God.

292
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 Now we often look at the story of Job, and we immediately know how it ends.

293
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 But don't forget that right in the midst of his understanding of who God truly is,

294
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 he was in the midst of his suffering.

295
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 And I don't think for a moment it was easy for Job to forget all of the suffering,

296
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 to forget the loss of his wife, to forget the loss of his children,

297
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 and all the pain that he had gone through.

298
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 So in this place, he comes to be able to say,

299
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 "My ears had heard of you, but now my eyes have seen you,"

300
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 as he experienced true realization of who God was.

301
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 When we don't hold back, even in our pain, and with our unanswered questions,

302
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 even in the midst of our suffering,

303
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 there is a deep sense of peace and comfort in who God is

304
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 that builds our faith, that builds our trust, and brings us peace.

305
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 And as we remain in this place of being in the now but not yet,

306
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 as we are in the present, as we are waiting in the hope we have

307
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 of the life we will have when Jesus returns,

308
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 in that place, we don't want to hold back.

309
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 So as I was praying about, "Well, how do we respond to that?

310
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 How does a room full of people, those watching online,

311
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 how do you respond to a message? What do you do with that?

312
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 And God, what are you saying to us?"

313
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 And God gave me a picture, and God sometimes speaks to me in pictures.

314
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 He speaks in many different ways, through Scripture and through various different ways,

315
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 and one of them for me is through pictures.

316
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 So He gave me a picture that I would like to share with you.

317
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 And of course, we always test what is being said and how this resonates with you.

318
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 I leave with the Holy Spirit.

319
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 And so the picture that I got was that this whole auditorium, as we are full now,

320
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 everybody here, there were barriers in front of you.

321
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 Do you remember during COVID, you would go into the restaurant,

322
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 and there were the plastic barriers?

323
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 You would sit, and the person in front of you that you were having lunch or dinner or breakfast with,

324
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 there's a barrier, and then there's you.

325
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 It's transparent, but there was still something between you.

326
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 Do we remember that?

327
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 Or have we chosen to put that away and never think about it again?

328
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 Well, the picture I had was that this room was full of people with barriers,

329
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 these transparent barriers, and these transparent barriers were between them and God.

330
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 Now, they thought they knew God.

331
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 They thought that they had a relationship, and they do, but there is a barrier.

332
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 And what God was saying, to remove the barrier so that you do not hold back.

333
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 There is nothing between you and God.

334
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 Some of us feel that there are things that we cannot talk about or say to God.

335
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 That's not true.

336
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 And I felt that God really wanted to impress upon us as we enter into a new year in 2025,

337
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 and if you're part of the Vine, as we enter into this new season of,

338
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 what does it mean to go and take action for God?

339
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 We have to have the relationship with God where there are no barriers,

340
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 and that we can go to Him with everything that we have.

341
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 And so as I thought about some different areas that I believe in this room,

342
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 those watching, are struggling with that are real barriers for you.

343
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 And so I want to mention a few of them, and maybe it's something that resonates with you,

344
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 but I would say, you know, as I was praying earlier, thinking about how do I lead this response?

345
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 What does it look like? I haven't scripted this.

346
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 So how do I lead this?

347
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 I felt that God was saying, "Do you know what?

348
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 Don't hold back as a message for every single one of you in this room.

349
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 Every single one of you."

350
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 And so we all can respond.

351
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 But I also felt that God wanted to share a couple of specific things,

352
00:32:53,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 and the reason why He wants to do that is to show you specifically, individually,

353
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 how real God is and how much He knows your situation.

354
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 Because it's pretty general, right?

355
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 Don't hold back.

356
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 So as I share these different specific areas,

357
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 and, you know, if that relates to you, then we're going to be praying for you.

358
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 We'd love to pray for you.

359
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 And again, I believe that the Holy Spirit, in the picture that I saw,

360
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 He was actually just removing all the barriers.

361
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 It wasn't difficult to remove those barriers.

362
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 You know, you just unplugged it, and it was out the restaurant.

363
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 You know, for God, this is not--He removes barriers by the power of His Holy Spirit,

364
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 and that is what He wants to do.

365
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 So we enter 2025 with nothing in the way of our relationship with God.

366
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 So a couple of things I just want to call out.

367
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 So in the room, there are those that are struggling in a specific relationship.

368
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 You're in a relationship, and you have not talked to God about it at all

369
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 because you're afraid of what God will say.

370
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 It's almost like you have this assumption that He's not going to be happy about it,

371
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 and so therefore you're not talking to Him about it,

372
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 where actually, more than anything, He wants to talk to you about it.

373
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 He wants you to know what it is to be in relationship with Him,

374
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 and to do that, not to be afraid, not to hold the guilt by withholding this.

375
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 So I encourage you, don't hold back. Talk to God.

376
00:34:50,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 In this room as well, there is a struggle with identity.

377
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 You don't want to talk to God about who you are, an identity that you're holding onto,

378
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 because you're so afraid of the judgment. You're so afraid of it.

379
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 I can feel that judgment sitting on you.

380
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 You feel you can't talk about this because it's something that you've hidden for so long,

381
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 and yet God would say to you, "I see you. Talk to me. Don't hold back."

382
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 Often our identities are wrapped in what other people think.
