[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680]   A couple of Saturdays ago, I was having lunch with some friends,
[00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.280]   and we were talking about our weekend plans.
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.800]   One of my friends said, "I get really bad Sunday blues,"
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.800]   and explained that each week, as Sunday goes on,
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.520]   she gets more and more anxious about the work week ahead.
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.360]   She asked, "Have you heard of Sunday blues? It's a real thing."
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.280]   I hadn't, so I looked into it,
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.680]   and I learned that it's also called the "Sunday Scaries."
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.080]   My Google search took me to the Urban Dictionary,
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.920]   which is this crowdsourced online dictionary for slang or cool words,
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.720]   and it defines Sunday blues as,
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.400]   "When it is Sunday, you have school the next day,"
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.000]   presumably defined by a student.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.120]   There was a hyperlink on the word "Sunday,"
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.520]   and I thought, "Why does Sunday need defining?"
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.640]   So I clicked on it, and it defines Sunday this way.
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.480]   "The last day of the weekend, and is usually ruined
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.600]   because of the thought of another dreaded Monday."
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.000]   Then Monday was hyperlinked,
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.240]   and it calls Monday the most dreaded day of the week.
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.920]   A study done in the USA revealed that out of 1,000 people,
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.680]   more than 8 in 10 people feel more anxious on Sundays
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.880]   in anticipation of Mondays.
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.480]   And of these people, 95%, which is pretty much everyone,
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.360]   says it is related to work stress.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.280]   So this means about 8 in 10 of you who are watching this live
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.960]   or watching it on Sunday,
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.920]   you are feeling some level of anxiety about tomorrow.
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.960]   And the stress isn't just felt by those who don't like work.
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.920]   Even people who love their work reported a sense of anxiety.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.000]   Some said it's caused by expectations on their performance
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.560]   or caused by the high workload.
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.200]   Some are stressed by a relationship with their coworkers.
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.520]   Even worse, some worry whether they will lose their jobs.
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.920]   And we know that this worry has just been worse by the pandemic.
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.800]   Maybe you can relate to some of this.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.360]   We know as well that for some of you,
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.680]   you want to be employed, but you aren't.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.320]   And that is a huge source of stress in itself.
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.600]   It's important for you to know that God cares about this so much.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.520]   The Bible has a lot to say about God's heart towards work
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.080]   and the purpose and meaning of work.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.800]   You know, we spend so much of our time at work.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.520]   We spend actually about half our waking hours at work.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.360]   And God wants to be part of your work.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.920]   Because if God is only relevant to you in the 10% of your life
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.000]   when you engage with church everywhere or community group,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.120]   but then absent from the 90% of what you do,
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.920]   then we live a very limited and compartmentalized faith.
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.200]   God is active in everything, in all areas of our life.
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:03.160]   And work is one key area where God wants to meet you and empower you for.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.640]   What's really exciting for us here at The Vine
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.440]   is that this really is what the river is all about.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.000]   The River Vision is about everyone being empowered to encounter God
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.480]   in all aspects of our life, in everything that we do,
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.200]   every day of our lives, Monday through to Sunday.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.960]   River is about growing our personal relationship with God
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.240]   and being missional in the places where God puts us,
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:34.040]   where we are pouring out our talents, our gifts, our energy and time.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.480]   This is why I am excited to announce to you today
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:45.760]   that we are launching a faith and work ministry called the Work Life Ministry.
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.520]   I'll tell you in a moment some of the plans we have for this ministry.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:55.520]   But first, let's take a kind of high level overview of what God thinks about work.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.240]   Is work even God's idea?
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.640]   If it is, why do we have these Sunday blues, these Sunday scaries?
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.560]   And what's the purpose of work?
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.680]   So let's define what we mean by work.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.920]   When I talk about work, what I mean is energy that is purposefully used,
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.440]   whether it is physical or mental, whether it is paid or unpaid,
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.920]   to meet the needs of yourself, others or creation.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.760]   So that applies to those of us who have a paid job,
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:34.560]   but it also applies to those who are involved in any unpaid or volunteer work.
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.040]   The energy spent here at the Vine volunteering,
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.080]   that is indeed included in what we're talking about today, too.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.960]   It also applies to parenting, whether you're a full time stay at home mom or dad,
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.240]   or you have a job on top of parenting.
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:55.200]   Studying is also work, so it applies to students, too.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.880]   And to understand what God says about work,
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.240]   let's start at the very first verse of the Bible.
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:10.720]   Genesis 1.1 says, "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth."
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.320]   So the Bible begins with God at work,
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:18.640]   with him using his energy purposefully to create, to bring about the whole creation.
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.320]   And we know that God works to create humankind,
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.400]   create us and to create relationship with us.
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.040]   He works to give us everything so that we can flourish.
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.480]   Later on the sixth day, Genesis 1.31 says this,
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.760]   "God saw all that he had made, and it was very good."
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.200]   It was like on the sixth day, God took a step back,
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:49.040]   reviewed his own work and thought, "This is not bad. Good job."
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.400]   There's a sense that his work brought him contentment,
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.720]   fulfillment, joy and satisfaction even.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.920]   Then on the seventh day, God stopped and rested.
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:06.920]   So God himself limits himself to six days of work and one day of rest.
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.520]   So there's a limit and a rhythm to working and resting that we are called to observe.
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.600]   We can't just keep going, Alison.
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.720]   And because God created us in his image, imago dei,
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.960]   which means we are called to reflect God, we are therefore called to work.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.560]   We are actually designed to work.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:30.720]   Work is in God's original design and we aren't meant to be doing nothing.
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.040]   God designed work so that as we work in partnership with him,
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:41.400]   we feel that sense of fulfillment, satisfaction and we flourish.
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:47.120]   So what is our work meant to achieve? What is it meant to be for?
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:53.360]   Genesis 1.28 says this, "Be fruitful and increase in number.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.920]   Fill the earth and subdue it.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.360]   Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.800]   and over every creature that moves on the ground."
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.320]   So we are called to have dominion, to govern under God's authority.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:13.480]   These are words actually that describe how kings in the Old Testament are meant to govern.
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:19.120]   So we are mandated to act as kings over creation.
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.320]   We are expected to manage creation, to develop, to progress it,
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:27.040]   to care for it and to sustain creation.
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.040]   Then in Genesis 2.15 it says that,
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:37.880]   "The Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and take care of it."
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:42.040]   So we are also called to serve humbly, to work with diligence,
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:49.280]   to work hard so that we protect, we guard and we keep what God has already started.
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:54.720]   The word work in Hebrew is related to the worship of God.
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.160]   So if we put these two things together,
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:02.960]   what that means is that we are called to define the world we find ourselves in,
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:09.400]   our culture, our society, to take the goodness of it, to keep it, sustain it
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:14.320]   and to also shape it into what God would want it to be.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:21.560]   We are called to be diligent in our work, in what we do and also to care for people.
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:27.280]   And so God invites us to work as a steward of his creation, to bring about God's shalom.
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:31.320]   The shalom that means God's goodness, his peace, his wholeness,
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.840]   his flourishing in all areas of our lives.
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:41.360]   That includes ourselves, our relationship with others and in also what we do.
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:47.720]   So in work terms, what God has charged us to do through our products and services that we produce
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:54.960]   is that we serve others and we contribute towards the flourishing of his people, of his creation.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:09:00.800]   And we do that out of a worshipful heart towards God.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:06.120]   So God speaks about both the nature of work and the action of work.
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:11.160]   And what this means is that what we do matters, how we work matters.
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:16.680]   The way we do it matters, in the task that we do and how we treat others matter
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:22.160]   because it is meant to contribute to that flourishing.
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:27.120]   In this way, good work has both extrinsic and intrinsic value.
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:32.440]   It has extrinsic value because it brings some value to something or someone else
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:39.640]   and it has intrinsic value because work is good in and of itself.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.760]   That sounds amazing, doesn't it?
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:48.320]   It's important to know that that is God's design and his heart for work.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.320]   But we know in reality, work isn't quite like that.
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:55.000]   Work isn't always a complete source of fulfillment and joy
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.720]   because if it is, we wouldn't have those Sunday scaries.
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.320]   So why is that?
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.040]   Well, we know that the fall happened.
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:07.720]   Adam and Eve wanted to be like God and to know both good and evil.
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:13.040]   So they took things into their own hands, rebelled and sinned.
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:17.600]   And what this means is that Adam and Eve's sin brings punishment from God
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.840]   and this punishment is felt everywhere and has an impact
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:28.240]   on the most fundamental areas of their lives, including their work.
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.760]   The ground that they were called to take care of and steward
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.320]   will now produce thorns and thistles.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:40.320]   Work after the fall becomes more difficult, more challenging.
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.880]   It becomes a place of struggle as well as a place of joy
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:50.520]   and that's where the stress, where the anxiety comes from.
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:54.040]   And it's not only the work itself that becomes hard.
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.160]   Our own sinfulness means that we are prone to making work
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:01.920]   into something that God doesn't intend for it to be.
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.760]   Instead of seeing work as an avenue of service, of worship to God,
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:12.520]   we sometimes turn work into something that is purely for our own selfish good.
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:16.520]   Perhaps we wish that we can avoid work altogether
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:21.080]   or we can crave the wealth, the power, the status that a job gives us
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.560]   and we run after those things.
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:26.400]   The thing is those things in itself are not a bad thing.
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.280]   A good job brings money for us.
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:32.840]   It provides for our needs and for the needs of those who are dependent on us.
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.320]   It is a way actually that God provides for us.
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.400]   It's good and it's God ordained,
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:43.120]   but it becomes an idol if we use those things for our own advantage,
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:47.920]   maybe to fill our own worth or we base our identity on the wealth,
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.840]   on the power, on the status.
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:55.440]   Or if we choose a profession that we think is far more respectable.
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:01.320]   If as a parent you forced your children to choose certain professions over others,
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.960]   not because you think it is better suited to them,
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:08.320]   but because you think that that profession brings better stability
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:12.080]   or brings the family a higher status, it brings in more money,
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:17.320]   then we've taken God out of the equation of work.
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:23.840]   Idols in our heart ultimately don't fulfill and can leave us feeling hopeless.
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:28.560]   So it's very important to know that work itself is not the curse.
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:36.200]   It is the curse that came from the disobedience that caused work to be difficult.
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.760]   But God didn't leave us in that mess.
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:43.560]   God's intention all along is that his kingdom would come.
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:48.960]   We pray that in the Lord's prayer that Pastor Louise talked about a few weeks ago.
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:53.560]   The Lord's prayer teaches us to pray these words.
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:13:01.680]   "Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven."
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:06.640]   This kingdom of God is the claim that God is the world's one true God,
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.360]   the one God who would reign and rule in a new way,
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:14.120]   that he would undo all the sin and the mess that we are in,
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:19.560]   that he would save us, rescue us, and undo all injustice in the world.
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.880]   It would bring peace to every part of our world.
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:25.360]   There would be no more hardship in what we do.
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:29.960]   That would be gone and there will be peace in our hearts.
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:33.360]   Shalom would be restored.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:37.680]   And we see in the Old Testament that God chose a special group of people,
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:41.840]   the Israelites, to bring about this shalom.
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:49.120]   He chose them that through them the whole creation would experience this shalom.
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:53.520]   However, we know that they rebelled and sinned against God too,
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:59.400]   just like Adam and Eve, and this shalom didn't fully return to earth through them.
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:06.480]   So Jesus came to us and Jesus himself says that this kingdom of God had begun in him.
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:10.440]   Jesus says this shalom would come back through him.
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.800]   And what's really fascinating is that Jesus says that through him,
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:18.680]   life would be restored to what it was like before the fall.
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:22.520]   There would be an ease to life, to all that we do, to our work,
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:27.280]   just like the times before the ground was cursed.
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:30.640]   But Jesus didn't leave us with a finished kingdom.
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.280]   He didn't come and fix everything, did he?
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:36.880]   He died on the cross and his followers were left thinking,
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:42.760]   "Well, what about this kingdom? We don't quite see it."
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:46.920]   But what Jesus did through his death and resurrection
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:51.080]   was that Jesus opened up a way for us to partner with God
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:57.080]   so that us and God together, we would bring this shalom.
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:02.560]   And just as the nation Israel was chosen, we are all now the chosen people.
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:06.520]   We are chosen to bring about the kingdom of God.
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:10.560]   And one practical way God invites us to bring this about
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:14.640]   is through whatever area of influence he places us in.
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:20.040]   And work is one of those areas.
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:23.840]   In a crazy way, as we are empowered by the Holy Spirit,
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.600]   God is saying, God says to you, "You know, when you go to work,
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:31.680]   when you do your work, what I want to do is that through you,
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:35.720]   through your work, you bring my peace, you bring my shalom,
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.640]   my mercy, my justice to earth, to your team, to your company,
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.280]   to Hong Kong or wherever you're watching this,
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:46.160]   so that as you do that, you flourish, those around you flourish,
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:53.800]   your company flourishes and our city flourishes, creation flourishes again."
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:57.960]   That's a tremendous calling that every Christian has,
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:01.520]   that God would trust us and task each of us to do that,
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:09.000]   to bring his kingdom, his flourishing to the world.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.320]   The thing is, this isn't going to happen if we go to work
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:15.280]   and we keep God out of our work box.
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.960]   If we leave God at church on a Sunday,
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:23.080]   if when you finish watching today, you say, "See you next Sunday, God."
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:28.400]   This can only happen if we allow him space to be with us on a Monday
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.200]   when we go to work.
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:36.640]   When we make room for God in our work and ask for him to be with us at work,
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:40.400]   he will absolutely do that and meet us there.
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.560]   And whenever God meets us, he molds us, he shapes us
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:46.480]   so that we look more and more like him.
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:52.920]   And when we do that, we flourish and then we can bring that flourishing about.
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:58.080]   Work then is a significant context for communion with God
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.360]   in that God is with us when we work
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:03.480]   and work is a vehicle for growing our relationship,
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:10.280]   growing in our intimacy with God, growing in our obedience and faith.
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:13.720]   What I mean by growing in obedience is that if we take Adam and Eve
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:17.320]   and their first test in the Garden of Eden as an example,
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:20.840]   they were tested with whether they will trust God,
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:22.760]   trust what God said to them.
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:27.480]   The serpent tested them and said, "Did God really say,
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.240]   'This is not good for you.'"
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:34.440]   You know, the challenges that you face at work are actually challenges
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:38.440]   for growth in your relationship with God.
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:42.080]   Because if you are tested at work, if you're at work and you're thinking,
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:45.000]   "Should I do this? Is this okay? Is this ethical?
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.800]   How should I respond to this difficult person?"
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:52.040]   Ask for God's help and God will absolutely show you the way.
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.920]   What that means is that we then have a choice.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:58.720]   We then have to choose whether we will choose his way or our own way,
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:02.960]   whether we will choose obedience or rebellion.
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:06.240]   And God wants to guide you and empower you in your work.
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:09.760]   He also wants to show you how he has gifted you,
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.440]   what talents and gifts he's given you,
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:15.880]   and he wants to strengthen you in your weakness.
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:21.120]   In this sense, work can contribute to our sanctification.
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:26.000]   And when seen in this way, work actually becomes an essential component
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.920]   of our spiritual growth and formation.
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:35.040]   You may not have thought about work in this way before, but it is true.
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:38.840]   Work is spiritual formation.
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:43.400]   Work is a place where we get to learn to partner with God's will and purposes,
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:49.760]   where we get to work out our faith with fear and trembling.
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:55.080]   Cardinal Wyszynski, a Catholic bishop, said this,
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:19:01.480]   "Work is a sacrificial surrender to God at his bidding and direction.
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:06.320]   To accept work in all readiness, to guide it toward the heavenly Father,
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:09.800]   is to express oneself with one's whole soul,
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:15.840]   a soul that is full of trust and loving prayer."
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.280]   So just like we saw from Genesis 1,
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:23.720]   he says that the central purpose of work is to cooperate with God.
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:26.720]   Christians who work with this purpose in mind
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:30.080]   are expressing their love and trust in God,
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:34.680]   using all that God has given them as a means of worshipping him.
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:40.440]   Our workstation then becomes our worship station.
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:43.080]   And Eugene Peterson, the late American author
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:46.600]   who wrote the Message version of the Bibles, says this,
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.920]   "I'm prepared to contend that the primary location
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:55.520]   for spiritual formation is the workplace."
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:59.720]   So what does this mean for us now?
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:03.600]   This is an invitation from God to us.
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:09.840]   God is inviting us to offer our work with a heart full of trust and love
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:15.200]   and offer it back up to him as a sacrificial surrender.
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:20.160]   This is about an all-of-life discipleship.
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:24.280]   Our faith is meant to be lived out in all areas of our lives,
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:27.360]   outside of these walls, especially in our work.
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:30.200]   And we shouldn't be surprised if God takes us to places
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.960]   where there is hopelessness or even chaos,
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.320]   whether that means helping someone in our jobs,
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:39.840]   helping someone with their finances, in their education, in their job search,
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:42.360]   or if someone needs legal assistance.
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:48.120]   We can bring hope to these people through our work.
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:51.600]   When we each do that, we become that single drop.
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.600]   We usher in the kingdom of God.
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.920]   We are the ones who bring hope, bring love, bring this renewal,
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:01.840]   flourishing and transformation to our city.
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:07.320]   This is exciting and gives meaning and purpose to our lives.
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:11.200]   This is why we are launching the Work Life Ministry.
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.800]   So let me tell you about a few things that we have planned.
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:18.160]   We would love for you to join us in some of these things.
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.160]   First, you've already heard it mentioned earlier today
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:25.840]   that we are launching monthly online Lunch and Meet calls.
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:29.520]   It's starting next Wednesday, the 24th of March.
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.840]   The aim of these times is to explore together,
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:34.520]   how can we practically apply what God says,
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.720]   everything we've heard about today and more,
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.360]   how do we apply that in our lives?
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:42.840]   What does that really look like in real life?
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:44.920]   So once a month over a lunch break,
[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:47.240]   we will hear work-related testimony,
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:50.080]   a little bit about what the Bible says about that topic,
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:52.200]   and then we'll have some time to talk about
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.720]   how we can do that in our lives.
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:58.360]   Next Wednesday, our launch of our Lunch and Meet,
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.960]   we have one of our congregation members, Alison Chan,
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:04.360]   who is the leader in the e-commerce and retail industry,
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:08.960]   sharing her journey of how she discovered God's purpose for her in her work
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:13.800]   and how she seeks to honor God in her work.
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:18.000]   So that is this coming Wednesday, join us.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.880]   We also care hugely about those who want to work but are not employed.
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:26.920]   So we are hosting a one-off unemployment support group
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:31.080]   on Thursday, the 29th of April.
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:34.120]   If this is you, this is an opportunity for you to share
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:37.320]   any challenges or struggles you are facing,
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:40.720]   be it on a practical or emotional level.
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:45.800]   We know that it is a loss, and this will also give us an opportunity
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:48.280]   to listen, to come alongside you
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:52.920]   and hear how we can support you through this time.
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:56.560]   So these are the two things that are happening now.
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.320]   To tell you a few things that are happening later in the year,
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:05.880]   just very quickly, we are organizing a one-day joint church event
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.160]   on faith and work in October.
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:13.760]   We're also looking at running a short-term community group on work.
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:18.600]   So stay tuned for more details on these things.
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:22.240]   It's also on my heart to gather people from the same industry,
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.960]   say we can get together those people in finance,
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:28.480]   or in creative, in whatever industry, we can get together.
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:34.520]   And this time, we really want to hear from you what you think is best.
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:38.280]   This could be a chance where you meet other Christians in the same profession,
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:42.280]   or it could be a chance to talk about industry-specific things,
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.880]   and a chance to pray for you and anoint you.
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.520]   So I welcome your input.
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:50.000]   Please tell me what you think would be best and most beneficial
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.520]   for fellow Christians.
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.280]   I would also love to hear your stories.
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:58.760]   What's your experience as a Christian in your workplace?
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:02.160]   I'd love to hear from you too, especially if you are already engaged
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:05.760]   in some faith and work activity in your workplace.
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:10.400]   Is there anything we can do, that I can do to support you?
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.520]   The way to get in touch is on the toolkit.
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.960]   My contact details are on the toolkit.
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:20.840]   So let me tell you about the Connect Faith and Work toolkit
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.960]   that we are launching today.
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:27.360]   These are some immediate first steps that you can take.
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:32.400]   Under the action step, I point you towards a website.
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:35.640]   We've only covered a tiny bit about what the Bible says about work.
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:38.280]   So if that is something you would like to learn more about,
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:44.640]   this website, theologyofwork.org, would be a great place to start.
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:47.680]   We would also love for you to start building spiritual communities
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:49.800]   or spiritual friendships at work.
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:52.600]   Even if you don't meet at work physically,
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.440]   but you meet somewhere else, spiritual friendships
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:57.160]   with whom you can discuss your experiences at work
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:01.480]   is a great way to think through how you can follow Jesus in your workplace,
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.600]   especially if you're feeling isolated or lonely in your work,
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:07.200]   as Pastor Andrew prayed today.
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.400]   Do consider starting that.
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:14.640]   You can also dive into some daily devotions about work.
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.200]   There are some suggestions on the toolkit,
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:23.880]   some devotions on the YouVersionBible app or on bible.com.
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.440]   Then in the Going Deeper section,
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.960]   specifically for those who do want to host a group
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:32.000]   that explores the intersection between faith and work,
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.560]   be it at work or in a community group,
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:40.000]   there are five different resources that we have mentioned there.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.840]   So that's what's in the toolkit.
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.240]   That's gone live.
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:45.240]   Check it out.
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:50.400]   Lastly, I'd love to share a little bit about my own journey with work.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:54.000]   In my own work over the years, I've been in Christian ministry.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.200]   I've worked in the business sector.
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:01.640]   I grew up in Hong Kong, so my roots are here in Hong Kong.
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.160]   I love Hong Kong.
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:07.080]   And then I went to the UK for high school, university,
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:10.360]   and started my working life in London.
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:16.760]   I was really settled and had no plans of moving back to Hong Kong.
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:21.360]   And then in 2016, as I was working on setting up my own business in London,
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:25.480]   I heard God say completely unexpectedly,
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:31.360]   "Lay down London life. I'm calling you back to Hong Kong."
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:34.960]   Not only did I feel called to lay down my work,
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.720]   a business that I thought God had directed me towards,
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:41.640]   but the call was to lay down my friends, my church, my community,
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:46.480]   my whole adult life that I had known.
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:50.240]   It was honestly one of the few things that God had asked me to do in my life
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.480]   that I didn't know how to say yes.
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:55.520]   It felt so big and so overwhelming
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:27:00.000]   that I didn't know if I had the strength to do it.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.600]   I did manage to move back, and I moved back with no plans whatsoever.
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:07.080]   I didn't know why God asked me to move back,
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:11.480]   apart from helping to take care of my parents, who are in Hong Kong.
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:15.080]   It was terrifying.
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:17.920]   But fast forward to five years to today,
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:22.000]   I am honestly humbled and honoured that I am part of this amazing church,
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.960]   an amazing team, and never did I dream that I would have the opportunity
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:29.240]   to be launching our work-life ministry
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:34.920]   and to be talking to you about something I am so passionate about.
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:37.960]   What I'm really looking forward to is to wrestle
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:39.920]   through those work challenges together,
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:43.720]   to celebrate the victories together.
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:46.160]   And even though work can be challenging,
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.480]   I know God is with you in your work.
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:53.240]   God will be found in your work if you make room for Him.
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:56.160]   My heart is to come alongside you
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:59.960]   so that you can be that powerful single drop
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:04.280]   in your office, in your workstation, in your home, in your school.
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:07.640]   God has a purpose for you, and I can't wait
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:09.800]   to see how each of us will flourish
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:14.680]   and what God will do in our city when we work this way.
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:17.000]   That's the hope that God has for us
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.760]   and the hope that I have for all of us.
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:23.480]   This is audacious. It's exciting.
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:27.360]   So yes, even as I invite you to join in on this ministry,
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:30.920]   I really would like to pray for us that we would each in our hearts
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:34.960]   individually respond to this call of God
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:38.720]   to make room for Him, to surrender our whole lives,
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:43.040]   our whole work, and to partner with Him in our work.
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:47.000]   So let me pray.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.040]   Father, we thank you for this tremendous call,
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.880]   this tremendous invitation that you would trust us
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:58.320]   to bring about your kingdom, to bring about your flourishing
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:03.360]   to the people around us, to our work, to our city.
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:08.080]   And God, I pray that we would respond now to you.
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:12.360]   We would respond with that heart full of love and trust.
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:15.720]   But I pray for those especially perhaps who do have a fear,
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:20.720]   who do worry that, "Can I really let go? Can I really trust God?"
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:25.480]   I pray, God, you will show them your goodness.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:28.600]   We pray again for those who are feeling isolated.
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:32.120]   If that's in the work, we pray, God, that you will bring
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:39.960]   those communities, those special people to them.
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:43.920]   We pray for anyone, you know, if they do need to come to you
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:51.160]   and repent of making work something that you didn't mean it to be.
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:56.160]   And we pray for anyone who perhaps does feel really burnt out at work,
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.080]   does feel tired.
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:04.280]   God, may your spirit come, rest on them, and refresh them.
[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:09.680]   And lastly, we pray a blessing on each of your work.
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:14.000]   We pray that God would anoint you as you go to work.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.680]   And so now let's take some time to respond to God.
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:23.160]   Just really take some time to connect with God during this worship song.
