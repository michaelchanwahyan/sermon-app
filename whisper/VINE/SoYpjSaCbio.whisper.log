[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760]   How are you, you well?
[00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.440]   We're finishing our series in Psalm 23 today,
[00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.640]   and I'm super excited about that.
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.640]   If you've been coming to the Vine for the last few weeks,
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.120]   hopefully this has been an encouraging series for you.
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.320]   And we're finishing on a note of great encouragement.
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.680]   I just absolutely love the way
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.560]   that David finishes off the Psalm,
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.760]   'cause the Psalm's been pretty challenging.
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.680]   And if you've been coming here over the last few weeks,
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.840]   you would've noticed that David uses metaphor and imagery
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.520]   to shake up the status quo, to challenge us deeply
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.400]   on how we understand God, and also how we are to live
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.760]   in this world around us.
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.000]   And there's been some weeks over this series
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.520]   where there's been a pretty deep uprooting
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.680]   and a pretty strong move of the Spirit
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.440]   to shake the dust off of us and get us into a place
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.520]   where we can really walk with God.
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.560]   But then David gets to the end of the Psalm,
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.680]   and he wants to finish on a note of encouragement,
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.840]   a note of life, a note of inspiration and love.
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.240]   And that's really what's on my heart for all of us here
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.120]   this morning online in this room.
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.120]   I want you to know one really critical thing.
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.320]   And that is that God is pursuing you right now.
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.360]   That He loves you so much
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.960]   that He is never gonna give up on you.
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.400]   That He is pursuing you, chasing you down,
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.400]   hunting you down, wanting to be with you,
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.360]   wanting to shape and form you into the person that He has,
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.000]   and that He will do everything possible
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.120]   to make His goodness be known to you,
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.600]   to make His love be known to you.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.160]   And I don't know how you're feeling today.
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.160]   I don't know how you are coming into this room,
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.320]   coming into this moment.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.400]   Some of you have had amazing weeks.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.040]   Some of you have had challenging weeks.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.880]   Some of you are in a season of great inspiration right now.
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.800]   Other of you are in seasons of difficulty and trial.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.400]   And a number of you have been coming forward
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.120]   and sharing some of those trials with us.
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.320]   And we're with you as a church community.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.480]   Whatever is going on in your life right now,
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.560]   God is pursuing you.
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.080]   He loves you so much.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.800]   And He wants you to know what is on His heart for you.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.480]   And He will do whatever it takes
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.520]   to make His heart manifest and known to you.
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.440]   I wanna share a little story about that
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.560]   and how I've experienced that a little bit in my life
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.440]   as we start our time together today.
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.920]   Back in 2003, which seems a long time ago,
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.200]   almost 20 years ago,
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.120]   I went to the Hillsong Conference in Sydney, Australia.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.800]   And I don't know if you've ever been
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.920]   to the Hillsong Conference or a conference like it,
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.920]   but in 2003, the Hillsong Conference was 30,000 people.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.120]   They had 30,000 people signed up for this conference.
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.160]   The venue that was hosting the conference
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.040]   only sat 15,000 people.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.240]   So every single main session,
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.480]   they had to run it twice to get everybody in that session.
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.140]   So literally, they would get everybody into this room,
[00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.560]   all 15,000 people in the room.
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.400]   They would do the whole main session.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.360]   Then immediately the 15,000 people would leave
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.360]   and a new 15,000 people would come in
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.440]   and they would do that whole session all over again
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.840]   with the new 15,000 people.
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.320]   And that would happen throughout the whole conference.
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.520]   So when you signed up for the conference that year,
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.480]   you were given a little ticket that said,
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.780]   you're gonna go to the first part of that session
[00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.240]   or you're gonna go to the second part.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.320]   You'd get the ticket and that's how you would know
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.080]   which session you were going to go into.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.000]   Now in 2003, about 50 of us from the Vine
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.240]   went to the conference together.
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.480]   We traveled together.
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.760]   We got all the tickets for the same sessions together.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.740]   It was an amazing experience.
[00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:31.760]   But on one afternoon,
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.680]   on the Thursday afternoon of the conference,
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.360]   I couldn't make the session
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.880]   that our whole team was gonna be attending.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.920]   So I had to go to the alternate session
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.360]   of that particular time.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.760]   So I went to the main desk and I said,
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.160]   "Look, can I exchange my ticket?"
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.080]   They're like, "Yes, you can."
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.000]   And they gave me a ticket for that other session.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Now, this was a brand new 15,000 people that I had not seen
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.920]   'cause I was in the other sessions
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.840]   and in that track for the whole conference up to that point.
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.200]   But I remember, I'm an extrovert, right?
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.720]   And I love being around people,
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.200]   but I was super excited to go to a session
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.200]   at the conference completely on my own.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.900]   Not having to be a leader of the 50 people from the Vine
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.040]   that was at the conference,
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.220]   not having to think about anything.
[00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.080]   I could just go myself, worship the Lord, be left alone.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.560]   No one would know me, completely anonymous.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.200]   I was super excited about it.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.040]   So I get into the main session,
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.280]   15,000 people that I've never seen before
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.440]   and the worship starts.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.640]   And again, if you've never been in an experience
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.600]   where 15,000 people are gathering to worship Jesus,
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.320]   it is amazing.
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.600]   And so we start worshiping and my arms are up in the air
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.720]   like they are here at the Vine every week
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.120]   and I'm just worshiping away.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.880]   And as soon as I start to worship,
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.760]   God gives me a word, a prophetic word
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.000]   for the young lady standing in front of me.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   And he says this, "Andrew, you need to tell
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.680]   the young lady standing in front of you
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.800]   that her husband really does love her."
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.720]   Uh-oh.
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.360]   Now, let me explain something.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.560]   When I sometimes get these kinds of words,
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.880]   if they are like about a relationship with a woman
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:04.780]   or something like that,
[00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.560]   I would normally take my wife, Christine,
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.260]   and I would say, "Hey, Chris, I've got this word
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.840]   for this young lady in front of us.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.040]   Would you deliver that word?"
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.040]   And it would be Chris that would pass on that word.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.920]   But I was on my own, no one else was there.
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.400]   And I'm worshiping away and God is relentless.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.080]   He's like, "Andrew, you need to tell the young lady
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.600]   in front of you that her husband
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.800]   really does actually love her."
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.760]   And I'm thinking to myself, what if she's not even married?
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.800]   And as she's worshiping away,
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.480]   I'm trying to look for a wedding ring on her finger,
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.200]   which is really creepy.
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.240]   That's kind of creepy.
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.560]   Then I'm sort of like looking at this
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.760]   and there's no wedding ring on her finger.
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.600]   And I'm thinking to myself,
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.240]   this would be the most embarrassing thing.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.400]   Could you imagine me leaning forward,
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.920]   tapping her on the shoulder and saying,
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.400]   "Excuse me, we don't know each other,
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.920]   but I'm a pastor from Hong Kong.
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.200]   And I just want you to know that the Lord
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.320]   has a word for you and that your husband
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.780]   really does love you."
[00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.560]   I'm not married.
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.000]   Have a great conference.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.720]   So I'm worshiping and God is saying,
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.280]   "You gotta give this word."
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.120]   And here's what I say to God.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.720]   I say, "God, I'm not a prophet.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.640]   I'm not a prophet.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.200]   Like I'm a pastor, I'm not a prophet.
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.800]   That's not a, that's not something that,
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.320]   that gift that I walk in.
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.600]   That's not something that I generally do.
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.760]   I'm not a prophet.
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.520]   Just find someone else."
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.560]   And so I carry on worshiping, slightly guilty,
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.440]   but carrying on worshiping.
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.440]   And God's got such a sense of humor, hasn't he?
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.720]   So as I continue to worship, guess what God does?
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.600]   He then gives me a word for the guy standing on my right,
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.880]   right next to me.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.680]   And he says, "Oh, Pastor Andrew,
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.720]   you need to tell the guy on your right,
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.240]   you know, he's a pastor of a church.
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.760]   And you need to tell him that I'm about to pour out
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.240]   my spirit on his church like never before.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.680]   In fact, it's gonna be like an Ezekiel 42 moment.
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.160]   Like the river of God is gonna flow out of the sanctuary
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.360]   into his town.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.200]   And it's gonna be a revival of the spirit of God happening.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.800]   You need to tell this pastor that I'm about to move
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.720]   like a river in his church by my spirit.
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.680]   And I'm feeling this whole thing in me.
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.320]   And I'm wondering, I don't even know if he's a pastor.
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.480]   And so as I'm worshiping, I'm sneaking glances at him
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.520]   to see maybe he looks like a pastor.
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.840]   I don't know what a pastor looks like.
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.240]   But as I'm looking at this guy,
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.000]   he doesn't look anything like a pastor, okay?
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.480]   He actually looked like somebody
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.880]   in the Hell's Angel Motorcycle Club, okay?
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.400]   He had a leather jacket on, he had a big beer belly,
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.980]   he had like a big bushy beard.
[00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.520]   This guy did not look like what I thought maybe pastors,
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.920]   I don't know, whatever looked like.
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.880]   But I'm kind of sneaking glances at him.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.520]   He's worshiping away, but he's suddenly realizing
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.040]   that the weird guy next to him is keeping looking at him.
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.440]   So he starts sneaking glances at me,
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.920]   sneaking glances at him.
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.000]   And as he's like sneaking glances at me,
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.800]   he starts to turn towards me.
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.680]   I start to turn towards him.
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.940]   And as we lock eyes together, and this is a true story,
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.880]   we lock eyes together, we turn to each other
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.800]   and we spontaneously hug.
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.000]   (congregation laughing)
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.680]   You know, like a man hug.
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.420]   You know, like, "Oh!"
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.120]   (congregation laughing)
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.880]   "Don't know, this guy, never spoken to him."
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.760]   We're like hugging, right?
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:11.920]   And this is the moment,
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.480]   like my mouth is uncomfortably close to his ear, right?
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.320]   This is the moment where I could go,
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.560]   "Hey, buddy, I just wanna pass on a word,
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.920]   "maybe blah, blah, blah, you know,
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.560]   "Ezekiel 42, the river of God through your church."
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.400]   But I don't.
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.120]   And here's what I say, as I'm literally hugging this guy,
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.100]   "God, I'm not a prophet.
[00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.820]   "I don't move with the gift of prophecy.
[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.760]   "That's not a gift that I generally have."
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.440]   And we embrace and then we let go
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.680]   and we both carry on worshiping
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.320]   as if nothing had happened at all.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.680]   (congregation laughing)
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.520]   Well, that night, I get back to the hotel
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.040]   and I meet up with the rest of the Vine crew
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.160]   and I share with them the story.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.000]   I'm like, "Oh, it's so funny."
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.160]   I was on my own and I had this word for this girl,
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.160]   you know, about her husband
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.440]   and this guy next to me about his church, you know?
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.960]   And I'm like, "I'm not a prophet,
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.040]   "so I just freaked out and I didn't say anything."
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.400]   And they're like, "Andrew, come on."
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.600]   And they're like, "Look, if you ever meet these guys,
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.840]   "ever again in the whole conference,
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.380]   "you have to tell them the words.
[00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.560]   "Promise us that you'll tell them the words."
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.400]   And I thought to myself,
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.000]   there's 30,000 people at this conference.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.640]   There's 15,000 people in a stream that I'm not even in
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:15.480]   and I'm not supposed to be in that.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.080]   And I'm like, "Yeah, sure, sure.
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.320]   "If I see them again, I'll totally tell them the word."
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:23.060]   Thinking I'm never going to see them again in my life, right?
[00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.120]   That night, I go to sleep
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.220]   and as I'm praying before I go to sleep,
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:28.960]   I say to God, "God, look, honestly,
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:29.980]   "if you give me the opportunity
[00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:31.300]   "to meet those two people again,
[00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:35.060]   "I will promise you I will share those words with them."
[00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.600]   Well, the next morning, Friday morning,
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.800]   I'm in the first session with all of us at the Vine.
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.400]   We're there and just before the session starts,
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.840]   I'm standing up and I'm scanning the 15,000 people
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.840]   in the auditorium.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.740]   Now, I don't really remember what the young lady looked like
[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:51.800]   but I remember what the Hell's Angel guy looked like, right?
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.900]   So I'm looking around trying to find Mr. Beard Guy
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.560]   with the leather jacket, right?
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.520]   And as I'm looking around, I kind of scan around
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.340]   and I get to and I notice suddenly,
[00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:05.620]   he's standing at the end of the row, staring right at me.
[00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.940]   He's literally standing at the end of the row
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.500]   and he's staring at me and he eyes me
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.140]   and he kind of like does a little nod
[00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.300]   and he starts to shimmy down the row
[00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.140]   whilst everybody else is like moving out the way, right?
[00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:18.980]   Shimmying down the row right towards me
[00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:21.940]   and he gets right up to me and before I can say anything,
[00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:24.220]   he goes this, he goes, "Mate," he's Australian, right?
[00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.940]   So, okay, I won't do the accent but anyway, he goes,
[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.420]   he goes, "Yeah, yeah, yeah."
[00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:32.460]   Damien, the Aussie's like, "Please don't, mate, don't,
[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.580]   don't do the Aussie accent."
[00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:40.000]   I think I'm pretty good at it but anyway, we'll leave it.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.580]   He's like, "Mate," he's like, "You probably
[00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.020]   don't remember me," and I'm like,
[00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:45.420]   (laughing)
[00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:46.580]   kind of remember you.
[00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.100]   He's like, "You probably don't remember me
[00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.700]   but we were sitting together
[00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.200]   at the main conference yesterday
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.940]   and I went to bed last night
[00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:55.900]   and God gave me a word for you
[00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:57.380]   and God gave me a word for you
[00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.500]   and I promised God that if I ever saw you
[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.180]   in the conference again, I'd give you that word."
[00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:03.140]   And I'm like, "Dude, what is the word?"
[00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.980]   And he said, "God wants you to know that you're a prophet."
[00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.540]   (congregation laughing)
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:09.580]   Can you believe it?
[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:12.140]   He's like, "God wants you to know that you're a prophet
[00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:15.340]   and that you should operate with the gift of prophecy."
[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.140]   And I'm like, "Dude, sit down
[00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:20.540]   'cause I got a word for you," right?
[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:21.740]   And I said, "You won't believe this
[00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.380]   but I had a word for you in our service yesterday
[00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.460]   in the session and I said to God,
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:27.580]   "I'm not a prophet."
[00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:28.700]   And he's like, "Well, what's the word?"
[00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:29.980]   And I said, "Okay, well, the word is this."
[00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:33.380]   And I started to kind of speak Ezekiel 42 over him.
[00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:36.440]   And I'm like, "God wants to move a spiritual revival
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.380]   in your church where it's like a river
[00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:39.960]   will flow out of your church."
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.460]   And he starts weeping and weeping.
[00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:44.340]   And I've never seen a guy like that
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:45.860]   just weeping and weeping.
[00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.820]   And he goes, "Man, you would have no idea."
[00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.540]   He said, "I'm a pastor of a small church
[00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.180]   about an hour and a half north of Sydney."
[00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.140]   And he said, "We've just purchased a building
[00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:57.820]   in the center of our little town
[00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.300]   and we've just built our little sanctuary."
[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:04.140]   And he said, "Two weeks ago, our sanctuary is on a site
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.660]   that's over the main water pipe of the town.
[00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:09.100]   And two weeks ago, the water pipe burst
[00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:11.060]   and flooded our new church
[00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:14.420]   and all of the equipment inside was ruined."
[00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.460]   And he said, "It was like the worst experience
[00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:17.660]   that we've ever had."
[00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:19.140]   And I came to this conference going,
[00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.460]   "God, I need to know what future there is
[00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:23.860]   and we've lost all of our money and the equipment."
[00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:26.180]   And he said, "Now you've come and told me
[00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:29.140]   that this is a metaphor, a symbol,
[00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.260]   that there's a revival that's about to happen in my church.
[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.300]   The water is gonna run out of our sanctuary
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:34.620]   like the spirit of God into our town."
[00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:37.540]   And he's like laughing and he's crying and I'm crying.
[00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:38.380]   And I'm thinking to myself,
[00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:43.060]   how amazing is God that he would do something like that?
[00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:44.620]   And I never saw the woman again.
[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:47.220]   And I pray and believe that somebody else more faithful
[00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.220]   than I am gave her that word.
[00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:50.840]   And she understood that about her husband.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:53.820]   But isn't it amazing that God besieges us?
[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:55.660]   Like really pursues us.
[00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:58.260]   Like can orchestrate something out of 30,000 people
[00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.580]   so that I got to know something about myself
[00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:03.580]   that I needed to know that was on God's spirit for me.
[00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:07.620]   And that word has sustained me in 20 years of ministry.
[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.220]   One of the things that I say to my staff now
[00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:12.580]   is I have two anointings, a shepherd and a prophet.
[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:14.740]   Whereas back in 2003, I never would have said that.
[00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:16.860]   I needed something in my spirit
[00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.340]   to begin that part of my ministry development.
[00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:23.260]   This man needed something and God had both in his heart.
[00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.660]   And you need to know that God will pursue you.
[00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:30.180]   He loves you so much that he will orchestrate crazy things.
[00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.460]   And sometimes it'll happen in moments like that
[00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:34.220]   where it's a prophetic crazy thing.
[00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:37.380]   But other times he'll speak to you out of a movie.
[00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:38.540]   He'll speak to you out of a conversation
[00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:40.580]   with a friend over coffee.
[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:42.860]   He'll speak to you because you're studying God's word.
[00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:46.180]   He'll come in a moment and it will come out of the blue
[00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:48.460]   or it'll be a conversation or something like that.
[00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.180]   And suddenly you'll know that God
[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.140]   is trying to connect the dots for you.
[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.620]   Sometimes it will happen sitting in a service like this.
[00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:56.620]   Sometimes it will happen sitting in a boardroom
[00:13:56.620 --> 00:14:01.060]   when you never expected, but he is pursuing you.
[00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:04.820]   And as David finishes Psalm 23
[00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:09.020]   with all this incredible imagery that he's given to us,
[00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:14.020]   he's like, I need them to know that God is pursuing.
[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:18.160]   I wanna read you this from Psalm 23, verse six.
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.860]   Here's what David finishes the Psalm with.
[00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:24.420]   "Surely goodness and love will follow me
[00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:26.220]   "all the days of my life.
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:30.420]   "And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever."
[00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:33.020]   And I think David would say it this way also.
[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:36.700]   "Surely goodness and love will follow you
[00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:38.700]   "all the days of your life.
[00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:42.880]   "And you will also dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.440]   "Surely goodness and love will follow us
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.160]   "all of the days of our lives.
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:51.560]   "And we together will dwell in the house of the Lord forever."
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.680]   What a promise.
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:55.480]   And I want you to see how he starts this.
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:58.060]   He uses the most emphatic word
[00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:00.700]   that he uses throughout the whole of all of the verses.
[00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:02.680]   He starts with surely.
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:06.320]   Now this word surely, it's not often used in scripture
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.960]   and David doesn't use it in many other places,
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:12.360]   but he puts it here because surely literally translated
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:15.320]   means beyond a shadow of doubt.
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.480]   And he wants to start and say,
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.520]   I want you to know something about God.
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:20.560]   I want you to know something that God does
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.480]   that I have absolutely no doubt about,
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:23.920]   absolutely none at all.
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.560]   In fact, I will take this to the bank.
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.980]   I know for sure and for certain
[00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:31.560]   that these activities are what God does surely
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:34.080]   without a shadow of a doubt, he starts.
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.400]   And then at the end of the first verse
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.280]   or end of the first sentence, he then says this,
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.000]   "All the days of my life."
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.920]   He bookends the activity
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.160]   that he's about to tell them about with this,
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.160]   I have no doubt about it
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.960]   and that it happens every single day of my life.
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:52.040]   All the days of my life, the good days and the bad days,
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:55.120]   the days when I feel spiritual, the days when I'm in sin,
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.600]   the days when I'm doing something I shouldn't be doing,
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.640]   the days when I feel like I'm right in line with God,
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:02.680]   when I was young, when I'm old, it doesn't matter.
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:03.960]   Every single day of my life.
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.160]   Why is David saying that?
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.080]   'Cause he's about to tell us something
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:10.600]   that he has no doubt about that's not connected to him.
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.580]   All the days of my life,
[00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:14.800]   because it's not actually about me.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.280]   Like what he's about to say is actually about God.
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:21.280]   And he goes, "I know emphatically without a doubt
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:24.560]   that God does these things every single day of my life,
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:26.920]   whether I feel it, whether I know it,
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:30.240]   whether I acknowledge it, He's still doing it."
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:33.400]   And he wants to almost tell his people the same thing.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.360]   And I kind of feel my spirit today
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.640]   to wanna try and communicate this to you.
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:39.560]   No matter what is happening in your life,
[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:44.320]   these two things God is doing for you.
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.040]   What are the two things?
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:50.120]   He says, "Goodness and love will follow me."
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:55.200]   Goodness and love, your goodness and love.
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.840]   David brings these two things together
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.240]   'cause it's really important that they come together.
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.640]   Let me explain quickly both.
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.620]   Goodness is the Hebrew word lob,
[00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:09.440]   and it literally means abundant blessing or lavish benefit.
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.800]   But when it's used predominantly in the Old Testament,
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:16.000]   it's used to speak about God's character and His nature.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.280]   It's an attribute of God.
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:21.680]   And in particular, it's talking about God's holiness.
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.640]   When we say God is good, what we're doing is
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:25.960]   we're actually making a statement
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.000]   about His character and His nature.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.520]   We're saying that He is holy.
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.400]   He is set apart.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.840]   When we say God is good, we're defining something about Him.
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.140]   And here's what we're defining.
[00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:39.020]   We're defining that there's no evil in Him.
[00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:40.240]   There's no harm in Him.
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.500]   There's no anger in Him.
[00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:42.720]   There's no malice in Him.
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.800]   He's good and faithful and trustworthy
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.600]   that we can actually rely on Him.
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:51.120]   What we're saying when we declare that God is good
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.160]   is that He is different to us.
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.400]   The actual phrase of it actually has in mind
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.040]   Genesis 1 and 2, Adam and Eve in the garden.
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:03.280]   They got to experience the goodness of God
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:06.640]   before Genesis 3, when sin came into the world.
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:09.200]   In Genesis 1 and 2, God sets up the world
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.040]   as it was intended to be.
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:14.100]   The way it was supposed to be, shalom and peace.
[00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:16.520]   And God came and communed with Adam and Eve
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.480]   in the coolness of the night in the garden,
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:21.200]   and they could feel His shalom, His peace.
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.680]   That's His goodness.
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.780]   His goodness is the declaration
[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:26.960]   that this is the way the world should be.
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:30.960]   His holiness, His goodness, His intention for the world.
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:33.000]   And what happened was in Genesis 3,
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.680]   everything now has been tainted by sin.
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.840]   Everything now, humanity and creation,
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.980]   now lives in the opposite of that.
[00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:42.520]   So when we say God is good,
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:44.360]   we're actually making a declaration,
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.320]   actually a prophetic statement,
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.800]   that God is different from this thing.
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:52.040]   This thing that's tarnished and hurting and broken.
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:56.080]   His goodness sets apart from that.
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.200]   Now this is really important, church,
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.740]   because very often when we as Christians understand
[00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.680]   or use the term goodness,
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:07.040]   we normally connect it to something happening in our lives.
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:09.260]   Let me be honest about this.
[00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:12.140]   We often will say, God is good, I got my promotion.
[00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:15.360]   Or we'll say, God is good,
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.440]   my relationships are going well right now.
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:20.420]   God is good, I made a lot of money this month on sales.
[00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:22.920]   God is good because my health is good.
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:26.240]   In other words, we define God's goodness
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:29.100]   by something that's happening for benefit in our lives.
[00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:30.160]   Are you with me?
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.600]   We gotta be really careful.
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.760]   That's not what David is setting up here.
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:36.360]   This is why we actually can say that phrase,
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.660]   God is good, all the time.
[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:41.240]   The cheesiest Christian phrase ever.
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.680]   I remember growing up, hearing that phrase,
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.560]   thinking to myself, I can't say that
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:48.040]   because there's so much in my life that doesn't feel good.
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:50.000]   There's so much in my life that's broken.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.160]   There's so much in my life that's pain.
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:52.520]   How can I say God is good all the time
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.640]   'cause I don't feel it?
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.800]   And David's saying, it's not about what you feel,
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.280]   it's about who God is.
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.760]   God can be good all the time
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:01.280]   because his goodness is not related
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.360]   to whether you feel like he's being good.
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:04.880]   His goodness is not related
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.000]   to whether there's some benefit
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.120]   that's happening in your life.
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:10.760]   He's just plainly set apart as good.
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:13.400]   So a few weeks ago, when I told you
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:17.280]   that I spent those six hours by my father's deathbed,
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.840]   the worst six hours of my life,
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:22.300]   the most horrible, darkest valley I've ever been in,
[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:24.200]   God was still good in that moment.
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.740]   When my wife and I discovered
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:29.460]   we couldn't have our own biological children.
[00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.460]   When I discovered that I was infertile
[00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:33.140]   and unable to father children
[00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:36.280]   and my dreams for being a biological father
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:39.220]   were torn to shreds, God was still good.
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:43.280]   When that man had that thing happen in his church
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:44.860]   and the pipe burst and everything flooded
[00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:48.180]   and all his equipment was ruined, God was still good.
[00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:50.020]   Because when we say God is good,
[00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:52.140]   we're defining an attribute of him
[00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:54.300]   rather than our experience of it.
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:56.100]   We may not always feel he's good.
[00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.460]   We may not always know that he's good
[00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:01.220]   and tangibly we might feel like the opposite is true.
[00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:03.220]   And David's saying, you need to understand
[00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:06.000]   his goodness is absolutely separated
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.260]   from your experience.
[00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:09.280]   Are you with me?
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.980]   Now, if that was all he was saying,
[00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:13.980]   that would be kind of weird
[00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:17.220]   because that's kind of like some theological concept
[00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:19.220]   and how does that then become a reality for us?
[00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:22.260]   That's why he says, goodness and love.
[00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:26.260]   Love here is the Hebrew word chesed.
[00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.580]   And chesed means literally,
[00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:32.860]   it means loving kindness or loving faithfulness.
[00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:37.120]   See, the chesed of God is the idea of his grace
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:41.220]   and his forgiveness and his unfailing love to humanity.
[00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:44.600]   This word was first used and described about God
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.140]   at Mount Sinai, where God comes down
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.400]   to a newly freed people out of their slavery.
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.920]   And God says, I need to define for you who I am
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.920]   and I need you to understand who you are.
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.700]   I will write this day, say,
[00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:58.320]   I am covenanting my love to you.
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.520]   I will never leave you.
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.800]   I will never forsake you.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:02.400]   I'll never remove my love from you.
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.720]   It is my chesed.
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:06.280]   It is loving kindness, loving faithfulness.
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:09.600]   You can absolutely bank on it and it will forgive all sin.
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.640]   It will remove you from your pressures.
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.280]   It will take you into a better life.
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:15.280]   It'll bring you into relationship with me.
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:19.280]   See, his goodness is true, but without his love,
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:22.120]   we will be naturally separated from his holiness.
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:26.680]   It's his chesed that brings us into his goodness.
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:27.800]   Are you with me, church?
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:29.440]   'Cause you can't get into that goodness
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:30.440]   'cause you're separated from it.
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:33.160]   Sin taints you from the goodness of God.
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.960]   So it's goodness and love,
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:37.840]   because the love is the thing that purchase for you
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:41.160]   your ability to be restored in relationship with him.
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.560]   And he's saying, do you see this?
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:47.560]   See, it's my goodness that leads you to repentance.
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:52.080]   It is my love that restores you out of your brokenness.
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:55.620]   It's my goodness that is like the prodigal son
[00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:58.440]   picking himself up from the muck of the pigsty
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:01.160]   and saying, surely it was better in my father's house.
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.800]   It's love, that's the father picking up his robe
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:04.640]   and running in the field
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.960]   to embrace the returning protocol.
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.000]   These two things must sit together.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.960]   God's goodness that's separate from our experience
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:16.220]   and his love that defines our experience in him.
[00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:20.720]   Goodness and love must come together.
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.320]   Is this helpful?
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:25.160]   Now, this is the bit that blows my mind.
[00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:29.280]   Then David says, these two things will follow me.
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:33.120]   The attributes of God's goodness, his holiness,
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:36.240]   his purity, his set apartness, and his love
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.520]   that forgives me and restores me and renews me
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.400]   and brings me back into relationship with him.
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:43.040]   These two things will follow after me.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.840]   The word follow there is the Hebrew word radap,
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:47.980]   and it literally means to chase, to be pursued,
[00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:49.360]   to be hunted down.
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:52.080]   It's imagery of a hunter hunting something.
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.680]   And I know that imagery is a bit strange
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.440]   'cause God's not out to kill us, right?
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.120]   But he is out to find us.
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.760]   He's out to sort us out.
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:02.080]   He leaves the 99 and goes and picks up that one sheep.
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.200]   He tells a pastor from Hong Kong
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:06.440]   about some crazy Ezekiel 42 thing
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.440]   so that a pastor north of Sydney
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:10.120]   can know that everything's gonna be all right.
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:14.040]   He's a God who hunts us, pursues us, and has a word for us
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:16.320]   'cause he wants goodness and love to be with us.
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.440]   It's following, pursuing after us.
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:20.780]   Whatever's going on in your life right now,
[00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:23.080]   God is pursuing and he's after you.
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.600]   And I just love this 'cause it blows my mind
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:29.640]   because this seems to contradict everything
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:33.000]   that David has been telling us so far in the Psalm.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.600]   Because in the imagery of the first four verses,
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:39.080]   it was about God as a shepherd and us following him,
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.400]   wasn't it?
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.240]   It was about God being out front
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.640]   and we as his sheep follow after him.
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:47.720]   And he provides and he protects and he guides us.
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:50.760]   And he spent four verses trying to help us understand
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.440]   that we have a leader, but that we need to follow him,
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:55.320]   that he's walking ahead of us
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.160]   and we need to follow in his footsteps
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.880]   and that he'll take us to green pastures,
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.560]   he'll take us to dark valleys, he'll restore our soul,
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.680]   but only if we follow after him.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.380]   So is David now contradicting himself
[00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:09.040]   when he says God is following after us?
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:13.760]   Actually, David's not contradicting himself.
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:17.040]   He's actually completing the picture.
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.180]   He's saying, here's the amazing thing about God.
[00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:21.520]   Not only do you have a shepherd who's ahead of you
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.200]   that you're supposed to follow, but as you follow him,
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:27.360]   he then comes on your rear guard and he follows you.
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:31.280]   He's following you with his goodness, his purity,
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:34.560]   his holiness, his set apartness, and his love,
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:37.200]   which perches you back into a relationship with him
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.480]   so that you can know goodness and purity and hope again.
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:42.840]   And he, as you follow him, he's following you
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:45.320]   and you follow him and he's following you.
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.200]   And it's like this perfect picture
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:50.500]   of what it means to be surrounded by the love of a God
[00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:53.460]   who doesn't give up on you.
[00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:54.780]   And I love this, it blows my mind
[00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:57.420]   that right at the end of the Psalm,
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:59.100]   he wants to complete this idea
[00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:01.020]   that you are surrounded by God.
[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:02.900]   If you wanna be a non-anxious presence
[00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:05.500]   in the chaos of this world, you need to understand
[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:06.460]   that you're not just got a God
[00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:07.660]   that you're supposed to follow
[00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:09.220]   and wondering what's going on behind you,
[00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:11.180]   you've got a God who surrounds you.
[00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:14.220]   I pulled all this together
[00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:16.540]   in a kind of a funky, very basic diagram.
[00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:18.080]   Let me show you this basic diagram
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.120]   that I came up with this week.
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:20.120]   There you go.
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:23.640]   There's you in the middle and you're following God.
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.240]   God is leading your life.
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:27.480]   And in that, we saw in the first four verses,
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:29.880]   provision, protection, and guidance,
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.880]   but also God is pursuing your life
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:36.440]   with goodness and mercy and loving kindness.
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:38.440]   And David's saying, if you see all of this,
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:41.720]   this is Psalm 23, verses one all the way to six.
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:42.880]   If you see this,
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.920]   then you will be that non-anxious presence.
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.000]   You will be like, oh man,
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.440]   I've got a God who's all around me.
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.120]   I've got a God who's in front of me and behind me.
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:50.800]   And guess what he says in verse four.
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:52.960]   He says, when you go through the valley of the shadow death,
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.720]   I am with you.
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:57.000]   So I got one who's, I got a God who's in front of me.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.240]   I got a God who's behind me
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:00.760]   and I got a God who's right alongside of me.
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:02.280]   Like he's everywhere.
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.400]   And when I get my head around the reality
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:08.640]   that I exist in the bubble of God's goodness
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:13.000]   and protection and mercy and kindness and love,
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.840]   I can begin to say, bring it on.
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:18.400]   Like what can happen?
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.400]   Like I will fear no evil.
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.480]   I will be released from my anxiety.
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.760]   I will find myself in a place where yes,
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:26.040]   stuff may still happen.
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:27.320]   Things might go wrong.
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.120]   There might be those hospital bed moments.
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:31.040]   There might be the destruction of the sanctuary
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:32.100]   by a burst water pipe.
[00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.080]   Those stuff's gonna happen in life.
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:37.320]   But my starting point, my middle point and my end point
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:40.160]   is that I have Jesus who is the Alpha and the Omega.
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.840]   If he's in front of me and he's behind me,
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:43.640]   he's got everything else sorted out in the middle
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.080]   and I can go, ah.
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:49.400]   And when I go, ah,
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:53.600]   everybody else around me goes, huh?
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:56.040]   (congregation laughing)
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:28:01.040]   And in that, in that, we get to share the gospel.
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:04.400]   But if we don't believe this,
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:07.920]   then when the storms come and the rains come
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:10.720]   and the hospital bed happens and the burst pipes happen,
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.800]   what testimony are we bringing to a world
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.720]   that desperately needs one?
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:19.360]   How are we actually saying anything about who Jesus is?
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.720]   If we're being pushed around and tossed back and forth
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:23.280]   by every wave of everything.
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:26.720]   Now there's something beautiful
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.520]   about what David's trying to communicate to us here.
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.200]   That there's another way to live.
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.640]   Not only that, there's another place to live.
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.200]   Notice what he says right at the end.
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:38.440]   I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:42.800]   The word dwell here means to be rooted down,
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:46.880]   to set down, to rest down, to put roots in.
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.920]   It's the idea of making a home.
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:52.080]   And it's really interesting 'cause he says, I make a home.
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:53.920]   And it's translated here in English,
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:55.800]   in the house of the Lord.
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.400]   The house, whenever we hear the phrase,
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:00.520]   the house of the Lord, we always think of church.
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:01.920]   Because in the Old Testament,
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:03.840]   when that phrase is generally used, the house of the Lord,
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.400]   it was meaning the temple.
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:08.360]   In fact, the temple was known as the house of the Lord.
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:11.200]   But what you have to understand as David is writing Psalm 23,
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:14.600]   the temple's not built for another 15 years or so.
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:17.400]   It's actually his son that will build the temple, not him.
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.080]   So when he says here, the house of the Lord,
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.880]   he's actually not thinking about the temple
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.080]   or some building.
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:25.440]   In fact, the Hebrew word means the dwelling place.
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.640]   So you can understand like this,
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.600]   David is literally finishing the Psalm like this.
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:32.840]   I will dwell in the dwelling place of the Lord.
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.760]   And where is the dwelling place of the Lord?
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:36.000]   He's just told us.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.840]   It's in front of us, it's with us,
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.880]   it's behind us, it's all around us.
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:43.080]   I will put my roots down in the presence of God.
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:45.400]   Presence of God is not defined to a church service.
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:46.800]   It's not defined to a building.
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:47.880]   It's not defined to anything.
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.880]   I can find the presence of God,
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:53.280]   His dwelling place in my boardroom, in my classroom,
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:55.560]   in my relationships, in my home,
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.840]   and yes, hopefully in my church.
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:02.000]   He's basically saying God is everywhere with us
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.520]   if we follow Him and have the belief,
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:06.300]   surely, without a doubt,
[00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:08.120]   that He's following us with forgiveness
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:09.680]   and mercy and His holiness.
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:11.040]   When He's protecting us,
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.380]   we can find His dwelling place
[00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:17.840]   wherever it is that we find ourselves.
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:21.240]   We dwell in His dwelling place.
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:24.080]   It's not until the New Testament that we get the idea
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.280]   that Jesus becomes the dwelling place,
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:29.080]   that Jesus decides to come down to us,
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:32.440]   take on humanity in its beautiful, most purest form,
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:36.080]   fully God, fully human, tabernacling, being one.
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:37.040]   And we look to Jesus.
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:37.880]   This is why Jesus says,
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:39.480]   "If you are weary and burdened, come to me
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.700]   and I'll give you rest."
[00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:42.860]   Rest, our home, the presence of God,
[00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:46.440]   is not defined to a certain areas of the world.
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:50.200]   This world is His dwelling place.
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:52.840]   And so when you're in your businesses
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.820]   and you're doing your work and you're in your homes
[00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:59.740]   and you're living your life, God's as much there.
[00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:03.460]   That is as much His house as this place
[00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:04.800]   for 90 minutes on a Sunday.
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:09.480]   And he's saying, David's saying, "I will dwell.
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:13.880]   I'll put my roots down everywhere where God is
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:17.920]   because where He is, I'm at home."
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:22.260]   That's Psalm 23.
[00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:24.800]   That's what it means to be a non-anxious presence
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:26.240]   in the carelessness world.
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:27.560]   I've got like one minute left.
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:29.280]   Here's what I'm gonna do for you.
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:31.340]   'Cause this is the last of the series.
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:33.660]   I'm gonna pull together, we've done this for six weeks.
[00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:35.940]   I'm gonna pull together on one slide,
[00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:39.320]   all six things that define what it means
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:40.840]   to be a non-anxious presence.
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:42.620]   Now, they're gonna come up one by one.
[00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:44.080]   Don't take a photo too early.
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:48.280]   But when we get to the end of it,
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.400]   I highly recommend you take a photo of it.
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:53.000]   Like honestly, 'cause I wanna say this before I finish.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.400]   This sermon series is not about some teaching on a Sunday
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.360]   and some feeling in a room.
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.520]   If you really want to walk this out,
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:03.360]   I truly believe God wants you to be a non-anxious presence
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:05.680]   in your workplace, in your family, wherever it is.
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:08.160]   Then you need to take this slide in a moment
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:11.760]   and you need to actually put your own work into it.
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.560]   What does this mean for me?
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:15.640]   How do I live this out now?
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:18.320]   How do I put steps to what we've been hearing each week?
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:19.600]   I've heard some great things,
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:21.880]   but what does that truly mean for me?
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:24.640]   And in our community groups that we have here at the Vine,
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:25.920]   in your friendship groups,
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.800]   in your own personal devotional time,
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:31.560]   to take these six things and ask the hard questions
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:35.440]   between you and God and allow Him to change you.
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.440]   So here are the things.
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:39.520]   Here's my summary of Psalm 23
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:41.840]   and all that we've been doing.
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:43.440]   This is what it means to be a non-anxious presence.
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:46.000]   We need to have the courage to let go
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.400]   of our tendency to take control of our world
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.480]   and invite God to be God again.
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:51.880]   That's Psalm 46, 10.
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:53.960]   That was six weeks ago
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:56.200]   when we started the series with Psalm 46.
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:58.680]   We need to walk in the conviction that in God,
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.320]   we have everything we truly need
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:02.360]   and we lack no good thing.
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:05.680]   That was the first week of our Psalm 23.
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:09.080]   We need to stop thinking of God as the GPS of our lives
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:11.400]   and accept that He is calling us to follow Him
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:14.040]   wherever He desires to lead us.
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:15.440]   Verses two and three.
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:18.280]   We need to remember that sometimes the path God leads us on
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:21.280]   purposely takes us through a darkened valley
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:23.000]   to reveal to us part of His nature
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.720]   we could not discover in any other place.
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.000]   Verse four.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.960]   We need to understand that true community
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:32.040]   is birthed in the labor pains of reconciliation and love.
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:34.720]   And the restoration of our broken relationships
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.600]   is central to our flourishing.
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:37.520]   Verse five.
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:40.000]   And finally today, we need to rest in the knowledge
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.280]   that God always pursues us with His goodness and His love
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:46.400]   and invites us to find our home in His presence
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.880]   amid the chaos of this world.
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:49.160]   Take a photo of that.
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:57.400]   But don't just take a photo of it.
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:00.120]   My prayer for you as we finish the series
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:02.400]   is that that will be life to you,
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:05.200]   that you'll refer to that many times throughout your life,
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:08.360]   that Psalm 23 will continue to be a guide to you
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:10.840]   as you find yourself more and more at peace with Him.
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:11.760]   Would you stand with me?
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:12.960]   And I wanna pray for us.
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:21.680]   Father, we just are so grateful.
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:25.480]   So grateful for our community together.
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:28.040]   We're so grateful for this Psalm
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:31.880]   that has powerfully shaken us, challenged us,
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:34.400]   encouraged us, inspired us.
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:36.640]   Father, we're thankful that you are present
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:38.480]   in this moment, in this room with us.
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:41.800]   I wanna encourage you
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:45.920]   as we finish our time together in this series.
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:46.760]   As a leadership here,
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:51.320]   we want to now seal this work that God is going to do,
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:52.520]   has done through the series,
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:54.680]   but is going to do as we progress.
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:56.640]   And we wanna, as a leadership,
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:58.720]   sort of speak that over you,
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:03.080]   sort of conceal in you a promise of Scripture.
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:04.000]   And so in a moment,
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.040]   Emma's gonna sing a Scripture over you.
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:09.480]   And it will be one that's familiar to you.
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:11.180]   I wanna encourage you not to sing.
[00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:15.160]   And I want you just to allow Emma and the team
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:17.720]   to declare something over you from Scripture.
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:19.920]   And as they do that,
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:24.440]   I want you just to receive this promise.
[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:26.800]   Because this promise really summarizes so much
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:29.880]   of a God who pursues us and hunts us down,
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:32.600]   who loves us and is good.
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:34.680]   And a God that's here for you right now,
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:36.240]   whatever is going on in your life.
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:38.040]   So can I encourage you, if you're comfortable,
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.360]   just to open your hands,
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:42.960]   just to quieten your spirit.
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:44.680]   If you're online right now, same for you.
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:47.040]   Just open your hands, quieten your spirit down.
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:50.200]   Resist the temptation to sing.
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:55.760]   And allow us to pray over you with song.
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:59.760]   And I pray that this will be a great blessing to you.
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:02.340]   (gentle music)
[00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:05.700]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
