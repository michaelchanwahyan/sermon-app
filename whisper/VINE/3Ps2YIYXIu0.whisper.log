[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.340]   Amen. Hey church, I know that we're not in the same room. I know that we're not in
[00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.860]   even perhaps in the same district right now, but I feel such a strong connection
[00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.740]   with us together as the Spirit is here moving powerfully amongst us and so
[00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.020]   grateful for our worship team and for all they do, our production team that do
[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.180]   everything behind the scenes to be able to put this on. You're being able to be
[00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.980]   ministered by the Holy Spirit right now through all this technology because we
[00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.420]   have men and women that have volunteered and are serving hard here at the Vine
[00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.980]   and I'm just super grateful for them. I'm grateful for you and I'm grateful for
[00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.100]   what we're about to do. We're gonna continue our series in Dreaming again
[00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.900]   and today we're looking at the topic of victory in battle. Victory in battle and
[00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.220]   I don't know about you but I'm sure if you're anything like me you've been
[00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.900]   going through some battles. We've all been facing crazy battles in the last
[00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.340]   three years but I wonder whether we really know what it is that we need to
[00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.900]   be equipped for in the battles we face and today I want to give you some tools,
[00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.300]   some tips, some practical theology for you to be able to handle whatever battles
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.380]   that you might be facing right now. A few years ago I was able to actually live
[00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:15.140]   out one of my long-held dreams. For about 10 years I had this dream in my heart
[00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.100]   that I wanted to dive deeper into the realities of social injustices in the
[00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.780]   world around us. I had a passion from God for a theology of justice to understand
[00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.620]   what it was on God's heart to see justice come in this world, to see heaven
[00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.900]   come to earth. I was passionate about looking into a variety of
[00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.340]   social justice issues and the one that kind of drew me in deepest was the issue
[00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.620]   of human trafficking. This is a work that we do here at The Vine through our
[00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.300]   STOP ministry as part of Branches of Hope and it was something that was
[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.680]   really a burden on my heart for many years. I had this dream and the
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.740]   dream was this. I was praying to God and I was saying, "God I would love the
[00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.260]   opportunity to travel around Asia and witness for myself the realities of
[00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.020]   human trafficking, the realities of that issue and the injustice of that issue
[00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.580]   and to see how you, God, are at work amongst various NGOs and different
[00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.740]   people to bring freedom and liberation for those that are trapped in slavery."
[00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.140]   This was my dream and just a few years ago my dream came into reality. An NGO
[00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.100]   reached out to me based in Thailand and they say, "Hey we'd love to fly you into
[00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.140]   Bangkok and we'd love to spend a week with you and show you the work that we
[00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.060]   do." I was super excited about this. This was an NGO that focused on the
[00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.540]   realities of slavery and human trafficking and so I flew into Bangkok
[00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.340]   and I got to spend a week with them. The first couple of days it was
[00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.020]   basically spent in classrooms, various different classrooms, listening to women
[00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:49.380]   who had been liberated from the sex slave trade in Bangkok. I'll never
[00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.100]   forget sitting in those classrooms, listening to these stories,
[00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.220]   listening to the horrendous horrors that had been brought against these women. A
[00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.340]   lot of them trafficked from villages on the outskirts of Thailand,
[00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:09.420]   trafficked into Bangkok to work in sexual slavery. The stories were
[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.860]   just overwhelming but also in those stories came this incredible idea, this
[00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.180]   incredible testimony of God's goodness. The way that God worked in these women's
[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.180]   lives, the way that God saved them, redeemed them, restored them. How many of
[00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.860]   them were still going through a process of healing but God was at work in that
[00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.660]   process. I remember sitting in that classroom thinking, "This is exactly why
[00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.700]   I want to lean into these justice issues. This is why I kind of burn with a
[00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.180]   passion for this. I want to see God come and do all this great victory in
[00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.460]   people's lives." Well after a couple of days of being in the classroom, listening
[00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.000]   to these women, we then had an opportunity to actually go into the
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.220]   field if you will, as itself, the field in Bangkok. And so we were
[00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.940]   going to spend a day actually in a particular street, which I'm not going to
[00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.840]   name, but a particular street in Bangkok that is famous for lots of bars and for
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.860]   the fact that there is all these sexual acts that happen inside those bars. And
[00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.860]   we were going to, in pairs, walk up and down this street for a couple of hours.
[00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.380]   It was only probably about 500 meters or long or so. And we're going to walk up and
[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:21.220]   down and pray and do some spiritual warfare as we're in the very place where,
[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.820]   according to the NGO, about a thousand women in that moment were being used for
[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.180]   sex, were being purchased for sex. Now the street itself was perhaps not how you
[00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.620]   think it might look. The street itself seemed very innocent. It was filled with
[00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.460]   bars. There was lots of pop music and music blaring. There were lots of people
[00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.740]   standing around. There were waiters and waitresses who looked very normal, who
[00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.260]   had a little menu in their hands. It almost felt like there was a bunch of
[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.300]   sports bars up this street. To be honest with you, it felt a little bit like a
[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.100]   cross between L'Encoi Fung and Las Vegas, kind of brought together. Lots of glitz,
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.540]   lots of sound. It felt perfectly normal in some ways. Didn't seem very strange at
[00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:07.160]   all. And as we were beginning to walk up this street and as I began to reflect on
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.100]   the realities of what was happening beyond the facade, I was overcome
[00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:17.860]   immediately with a spiritual oppression that I had never felt before. I suddenly
[00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:25.020]   felt this blackness on me. It was like a weight upon my spirit. There was a
[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.980]   darkness that suddenly shrouded around me. I had never experienced a sense of
[00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.420]   evil in all of my years of pastoring and all of the time that I'd been working in
[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:40.100]   the church and doing things that I do. This was the first time I had felt the
[00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:46.700]   presence of evil to such a degree as this. It was completely overwhelming. It
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.980]   was like that heavy blackness, a pressure on my chest. I almost felt like I was
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:55.420]   having like a heart attack as I was walking up this street. I could feel the
[00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:01.140]   enemy and I could feel demonic forces all around me as I was walking. And if
[00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.980]   I'm honest with you, I was completely petrified. I was completely overwhelmed. I
[00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:11.060]   realized in that moment I was actually totally out of my depth. It was funny,
[00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.980]   just a few days ago, sitting in that classroom, I felt like I was that social
[00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:19.100]   justice warrior who was gonna do all this great stuff for God. And now that I
[00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:24.900]   was standing in the place of evil itself, I was overwhelmed by how insignificant I
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:32.580]   was, how powerless I felt in comparison to the demonic forces that were around.
[00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:37.820]   And I quickly realized something, that I had started this dream with this feeling
[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.980]   of like, if God is for me, who can be against me? I can do all things in
[00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:46.700]   Christ who strengthens me. And that immediately became, I am out of my depth.
[00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:53.380]   I am ill-prepared and not ready for the realities of the battle that I
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:58.140]   needed to face. And this was the thing, you see, I thought because the dream had
[00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.860]   come from God, that therefore everything was gonna be okay. Everything was gonna
[00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.980]   be kind of easy. Everything would kind of work out. If God's for it, of course it's
[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:11.860]   gonna work out. I hadn't realized that actually because the dream was from God,
[00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:17.460]   I was gonna have to face some battles in relation to that dream. I didn't realize
[00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:23.260]   that that dream was going to actually lead me to a place of abject evil and I
[00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:32.860]   was gonna have to face a battle simply because God had given me a dream. If
[00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.980]   you're a Christian watching this right now, and if God has given you a dream, you
[00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:42.520]   need to know that at some point you're gonna have to face a battle because of
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:48.220]   that dream. There is no version of being a Christian that is worthy of carrying
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:54.060]   the name Jesus that doesn't at some point have to then face the realities of
[00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:58.820]   the spiritual evenness and darkness that there is in this world. There is no
[00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:02.620]   version of Christianity. If you really want to take your faith seriously, that's
[00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:07.620]   not gonna at some point lead you in the battle with demonic forces. The enemy
[00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:12.340]   doesn't give much at all to the Christian who's a Christian by name and
[00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:17.900]   not by action. But if you seriously want to take up the battle, to take up the
[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:22.660]   courage to actually walk out the kingdom of God on earth, if you're saying, "I want
[00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:26.660]   to partner with God to see his heaven come to earth. I want to partner with God
[00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:31.740]   in doing something that pushes back the spiritual dynamics in this world." If
[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:35.780]   you're saying that your dream that God has given you is something of God's
[00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:41.660]   kingdom, that dream will lead you into some battles. You know, here's the reality
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:47.160]   you see. Our dreams specifically are all about building God's kingdom. That's why
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:51.420]   God gives you dreams. And you know, we would be remiss here at The Vine if we
[00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:55.620]   were to start a series in January on "It's Time to Dream Again" and tell you
[00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:01.060]   all to start dreaming if we didn't prepare you, equip you for the reality of
[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:05.760]   what those dreams are gonna bring you into. Because God's dreams are about the
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:11.140]   building of his kingdom. And God's kingdom is always gonna be opposed. Now
[00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:15.840]   we know this. We know that Christ himself said, "I will build my church and
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.620]   the gates of hell will not prevail against it." We know ultimately in the
[00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:23.300]   death and resurrection of Jesus that Christ has the victory. We don't walk
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:27.600]   into a place of abject fear and terror because we know ultimately God has the
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:32.740]   victory. Absolutely. But here's the reality. The reality is the dreams that
[00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:36.820]   God puts in our hearts, puts in our lives, will lead us into a place where we're
[00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:40.860]   going to come up against some of those spiritual forces that are opposing the
[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:44.900]   work of God's kingdom. And although we have victory, we have to be equipped to
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:49.140]   face those battles. If we're not equipped to face them, we're gonna find ourselves
[00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:55.260]   very quickly struggling to overcome that. And what you need to understand is this.
[00:09:55.260 --> 00:10:01.660]   Some of the seasons that are the darkest and most evil sensing in our lives are
[00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:06.580]   actually the seasons where what is coming is the greatest fruit for the
[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:10.540]   kingdom of God. You need to hear this church. Some of the seasons where we feel
[00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:15.100]   most oppressed, the seasons where we feel like what we're trying to do doesn't
[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:18.700]   seem to be going anywhere, the seasons where it feels like the enemy is
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:22.960]   attacking us and against us, the reason he's doing that is because he knows the
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:27.700]   fruit that is gonna come if we persevere through those battles. The fruit that is
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:32.420]   gonna come because you see the enemy is not bothered where there's no fruit, but
[00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:37.100]   where the fruit is, then we have to accept the reality that the enemy will
[00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:44.900]   also be there. But I want to encourage you with this. God is on our side. And
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:49.180]   today I want to open up this message to help you to understand both the battle
[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:55.540]   you're gonna face, yes, but also the God who is fighting that battle for you. Some
[00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:59.140]   of you watching this right now, you're in a spiritual battle and you know it.
[00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:03.040]   Perhaps you feel a little bit like me on that street in Bangkok. You can sense the
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:08.460]   heaviness of spiritual oppression around you, darkness that is around you. If
[00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.420]   that's how you're feeling today, I want to start by giving you both an
[00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:16.860]   encouragement and a warning. Let me start with the warning. God only wants you to
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:21.900]   fight the battles that his dreams lead you into. Some of you right now, you're
[00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:25.660]   feeling overwhelmed and stressed. You're feeling a darkness around you because
[00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:29.380]   you're actually fighting a battle that God did not call you to fight. You're
[00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:33.180]   fighting a battle that his dreams did not lead you into. You see, there's always
[00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:37.620]   gonna be a grace to fight the battles that the dreams God has given you leads
[00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:41.820]   you into. But the reality is, so often we end up fighting somebody else's battle,
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:45.180]   fighting somebody else's battle for their dream that God hasn't actually
[00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:50.020]   graced us or equipped us to fight. The first thing we need to do is actually
[00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:55.260]   discern whether the battle that we're in is in relation to our dreams. Because if
[00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:59.260]   it is, doesn't mean it will be easy, but if it is, and here's the encouragement, if
[00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:03.100]   it is, then we know that God will be fighting that battle with us. We know
[00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:07.340]   that God will be equipping us in that battle. We know that that battle, even
[00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:10.640]   though it'll have its challenges, even though there may be some pain associated
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:13.940]   with it, even though there may be fear and anxiety and we may feel the pressure
[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:19.220]   of that battle, we know that God wins that war. We know that he is the victor.
[00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:24.020]   So you need to discern the battle. Some of you are fighting battles that you
[00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:27.900]   should not be fighting right now and you're wondering why you're overwhelmed.
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:33.660]   May you be encouraged that if the battle is in relation to the dream, then God
[00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:39.020]   will equip you for the battle you're gonna face. Let me also say this, and this
[00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:44.380]   is really important. While it is true that God's dreams will always lead us
[00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:51.260]   into spiritual battles, not every difficulty we face in life is the result
[00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:55.740]   of something the enemy is doing. You have to be really careful not to look for a
[00:12:55.740 --> 00:13:00.900]   devil under every difficulty. I want to say this straight up to us. Some of you
[00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:04.900]   watching this right now, you're fighting a battle and you think that that battle
[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:08.500]   is actually the result of some enemy strategy, but here's the reality. That
[00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:12.860]   battle is simply there because you've made some poor life choices. There's no
[00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:17.020]   devil under that difficulty. Sometimes we actually end up blaming the devil for
[00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:20.980]   our own lack of maturity. Some of you are struggling right now and you're
[00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:24.820]   struggling simply because you're making poor life choices. And it's easy at that
[00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:29.500]   time to blame some enemy and some spiritual strategy against you, when the
[00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:32.780]   reality is you just need to mature a little bit. You need to start making some
[00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:36.100]   better life choices. You need to start being obedient to the things that God's calling
[00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:41.500]   you to be in. Don't blame the devil for your lack of maturity. Sometimes the only
[00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:46.340]   victory you actually need is to take responsibility for the actions and
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:50.980]   behavior that you're doing, rather than think you're a victim under some enemy
[00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:56.860]   strategies. That's the truth, church. And I want to encourage you to take ownership
[00:13:56.860 --> 00:14:00.700]   for the reality of your actions in your life. That's not what we're talking about
[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:04.620]   today. What I'm talking about today is the battles that come because of the
[00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:08.340]   dreams God has given us. Not the battles that come because we make poor choices
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:12.660]   or we're in sin. The battles that come because of the dreams. Are you with me,
[00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:16.780]   church? Are you still following this? I want to take us into a passage of the
[00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:19.980]   scripture that I believe is going to open up some important questions for us.
[00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:23.940]   What do these battles look like? Why do we have to fight these battles? And more
[00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:28.020]   importantly, what are the weapons in which we are going to be able to fight
[00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:31.660]   those battles? That's what I want to lead us into. And I'm going to do it by
[00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:35.720]   reading a passage from the Old Testament, from the book of Judges. And it's a
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:40.100]   passage where Gideon has to take the Israelite army and fight a battle
[00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:44.580]   against the Midianites. Now at this time in Israel's history, this is before they
[00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:48.860]   became a monarchy, at this time they're a confederacy of 12 tribes. And Gideon
[00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:54.340]   has been raised up as the judge, the leader over the 12 tribes of Israel. And
[00:14:54.340 --> 00:15:00.420]   in this moment, God is calling him to lead Israel into battle. Now this battle
[00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:03.900]   was not something that Gideon was expecting. This battle was very
[00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:08.580]   overwhelming for him, but it was a battle in the result of the dream that
[00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:12.300]   was on Gideon's heart. God had been speaking to Gideon about all the things
[00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:16.900]   that were ahead for him and ahead for Israel, and this battle was a direct
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:21.860]   result from the reality of what God had been saying to Gideon and Israel. I want
[00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:26.580]   to show you what happens here. This is Judges chapter 7, starting in verse 1.
[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:31.420]   Is everybody okay? Are you connected to this? I hope so. Put down that phone. Take all
[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:35.940]   that distraction away. Remember, poor life choices. Okay, got you. I got you. I got
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:41.860]   you. All right. Judges 7, verse 1 says this, "Early in the morning, Jerob Baal,"
[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:47.220]   that is Gideon, "and all of his men camped at the spring of Harod. The camp of
[00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:52.700]   Midian was north of them in the valley near the hill of Moreh. The Lord said to
[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:56.700]   Gideon this, 'You have too many men for me to deliver to Midian, to deliver
[00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:01.700]   Midian into their hands. In order that Israel may not boast against me that her
[00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:07.260]   strength has saved her, announce now to the people, 'Anyone who trembles with fear
[00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:17.460]   may turn back and leave Mount Gilead.' So 22,000 men left, while 10,000 remained."
[00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:23.780]   All right, I want you to put yourself in Gideon's shoes right here. Israel, they're
[00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:27.580]   camped over this valley, and in the valley below them is the Midianite army,
[00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:31.500]   the army that God's called them to attack. Now, the scholars, it doesn't say
[00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:34.500]   specifically in these verses, but over the next couple of chapters, scholars
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:37.700]   basically have worked out that there was probably about a hundred and thirty-five
[00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:43.340]   thousand men in the Midianite army. We know that there was 32,000 in the
[00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:48.940]   Israelite army. They are way outnumbered by their enemy, so much so that you can
[00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:52.260]   imagine Gideon standing on this mountaintop, looking down on that valley,
[00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:58.180]   seeing the mass of the army down there, looking at his army of 32,000, comparing
[00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:03.420]   it to an army of 135,000, and you can imagine him being completely overwhelmed.
[00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:07.860]   Well, in that moment, the Lord brings not a word of encouragement to him. Listen to
[00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:12.300]   this again. He says this, he says, "You have too many men for me to deliver Midian
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:16.820]   into their hands." Too many? You can imagine Gideon here saying, "Hang on, whoa, whoa,
[00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:19.900]   whoa, what do you mean too many? I was thinking the exact opposite of that,
[00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:26.000]   actually, God. I was like, I do not have enough men to do this." See, here's the
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.920]   first point we need to realize. With all of the battles that our dreams lead us
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:35.800]   into, this is the pure reality. We are not to fight God's battles with man's
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:40.760]   strategies and weapons. If we do that, we will come up short every single time.
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:46.660]   Here's Gideon going, "I do not have enough men. In my strategy, in my way of
[00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:51.740]   thinking, this cannot work." God shows up and says, "You got too many. You got too
[00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:55.780]   many because I'm about to do something in you that's gonna change everything
[00:17:55.780 --> 00:18:00.020]   for you." In fact, he says it here in the passage. He says, "You have too many
[00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:04.100]   because if you go and fight them now with the size of your army as it is, and
[00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:07.860]   if you get victory, you're immediately gonna think it's because of your own
[00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:12.660]   resource, because it's of your own strength, because you're so great." He's
[00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:17.260]   like, "I don't want any pride to get into your camp." And here's the second thing
[00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:22.020]   that we need to know about dreams and battles. It's this, that the battles God
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:26.500]   leads you in are not for your glory, they're for His. The reason why God leads
[00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:31.300]   you in a battle is so that He can show you His power and His glory. And He
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:35.300]   basically says to Gideon, "If you go now with the army the way it is, man, you're
[00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:39.420]   gonna think that you won that battle for yourself. That's not the way it works. I'm
[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:44.700]   actually gonna strip down your army to its bare bones so you could never boast
[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:48.740]   that this is in your resources, this is in your strength, and you'll only be able
[00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:55.860]   to go, 'God did it amongst us.'" So God decides to strip down the army. How does
[00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:59.940]   He do it? Well, He actually takes a buried law that was actually in the law of
[00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:03.940]   Deuteronomy, and He brings it out. He says to Gideon, "Say this to your army. If
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:08.740]   anyone is fearful, they can leave." There was actually a thing in the law where
[00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:11.100]   they could do that. I think that's the most ridiculous law that there is in
[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:13.780]   Deuteronomy. But anyway, can you imagine how frustrating that would have been for
[00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:17.140]   Gideon? I can't believe that law is there. But that law was there, and that could
[00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:21.380]   happen. And so Gideon goes to the army, and he says, "If any of you are afraid of
[00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:26.580]   the 135,000 Midianites down there that are way outnumbering us, you can go home."
[00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:33.020]   22,000 of them went home out of 32,000. Only 10,000 left. And Gideon feels this
[00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:39.060]   way. Here's how Gideon feels. He feels that fear has crippled his army. But God
[00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:43.740]   did not see it that way. God saw it completely opposite. God did not see that
[00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:48.900]   fear had crippled the army. God had seen that He had purged fear from His army.
[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:55.900]   Come on, church. He had purged fear from them. That 22,000 of them left, but 10,000 men
[00:19:55.900 --> 00:20:00.340]   remained who were declaring, "I'm not afraid." Who were declaring, "I can do
[00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:04.180]   this." 10,000 of them remained. And I think this is amazing that God would see it
[00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:08.020]   completely opposite to how we would see it. If I was Gideon, I'd be like, "My
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:12.220]   resources are depleted, God." And God says, "I've stripped away the resources that
[00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:16.820]   would have taken you to defeat. And I've only left in you the resources that I
[00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:23.100]   want you to have." Here's the reality. When we sense fear, we are always
[00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:28.420]   more likely to turn to our resources more than to our God. That's the reality.
[00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:33.860]   When we feel this fear, we turn towards our resources more than we are to our
[00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:37.700]   God. And God wants to say, "No, I'm gonna strip this away for you." God's basically
[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:45.260]   saying, "Less in this instance is more." Oh, we don't like this church. We do not like
[00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:48.300]   this in the modern church, particularly not the modern charismatic church like
[00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:54.100]   the Vine. No, no. We think more is more. We think bigger numbers are better. We think
[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:57.940]   of a ministry has more people, it's more blessed. We think of a church has more
[00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:01.700]   services, that church must be more blessed. We think of a church has more
[00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:06.180]   money in its bank accounts, it's a proof of God's blessing. God's economy doesn't
[00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:10.500]   always work that way. And here God basically says this, "No, if your resources
[00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:14.820]   become your God, I will strip those resources away from you." Why? Because I
[00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:20.740]   want you in a place of dependency and need on me. Why? Because the dreams I've
[00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:25.420]   given you will bring you into battles that will reveal my power and my glory,
[00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:29.820]   not your great resources and your strength. You see, this is so important.
[00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:36.060]   God does not need our great resources for his great victories. Come on, church. He
[00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:41.700]   doesn't need our great bank accounts, our great skill sets, our great abilities for
[00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:48.140]   his great victories. He's about to strip away the resources from Gideon. In fact,
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:51.180]   he doesn't just stop at 10,000. We haven't got time to look at it today, but
[00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:53.900]   he takes him to this water and they do this funky thing with the water, and out
[00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:59.900]   of that he takes another 9,700 away and leaves them only with 300 people. 300
[00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:04.660]   people left out of an army of 32,000. I mean, he is stripping this down. Why?
[00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:10.580]   Because he does not want pride and resources to be the things that gain the
[00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:15.900]   victory. We have to understand it. Let me say it this way. If our victories
[00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:23.500]   give us a sense of our own self-reliance and our own pride in our resources or in
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:28.340]   our abilities, then our victories are actually more dangerous to us than our
[00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:33.900]   defeats. Come on, church. Our victories become more dangerous to us than
[00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:37.380]   actually our defeats, because if we think those victories are because we've done
[00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:40.260]   some great stuff, because we got some great resources, because we got some
[00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:44.660]   great ability, then we're gonna find pride in ourselves, and God diminishes
[00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:50.020]   when pride increases. God strips away the resources from Gideon to basically put
[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:55.460]   him in a place where he's desperately in need, and trust me, the poor boy is. I
[00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:59.940]   know some of you watching this right now, your big prayer right now is, "God, give me
[00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:04.640]   the resources, because I'm so overwhelmed," when perhaps what God's word to you in
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:11.540]   this season is this. You have all the resource you need. Me. It's the only thing
[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:15.340]   you need to get through the battle that's ahead. I want to show you what
[00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:17.900]   takes place next for Gideon. You guys enjoying this? You getting this? You
[00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:23.740]   tracking with this? I hope so. Let me continue here in verse 9. "During the
[00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:28.580]   night, the Lord said to Gideon this, 'Get up, go down against the camp, because I'm
[00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:34.220]   going to give it into your hands. If you are afraid to attack, go down to the camp
[00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:39.980]   with your servant, Purah, and listen to what they are saying. Afterwards, you will
[00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:46.300]   be encouraged to attack the camp.'" This is so cool. God has already stripped fear
[00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:51.220]   out of the army, but he hasn't stripped fear yet out of Gideon. See, Gideon didn't
[00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:54.700]   have the option to flee away. I think if Gideon had, he would have been like, "Great,
[00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:58.660]   see you later." You know, I think Gideon would have been home already with
[00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:02.940]   the 22,000. He didn't have that option as the leader, and God understood that. You
[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:07.700]   see, God didn't worry about Gideon's fear. He knew Gideon was still carrying that
[00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:11.720]   fear. So he comes to him, he says, "Look, if you're still feeling fear, I get it." See,
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:15.920]   this is the beautiful thing. God is merciful and tender-hearted here towards
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:19.500]   Gideon. He doesn't tell him off for his fear. He doesn't slap him around and say,
[00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:22.980]   "Come on, just be brave. You know, you shouldn't have fear. Fear is a
[00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:27.300]   sin." He doesn't do that at all. He says, "Look, if you're still feeling fear, I get
[00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:31.860]   it. Just trust me. Come with me now. Take one of your servants, go down to the camp,
[00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:36.220]   open your ears, because I'm about to encourage you in such a way that you
[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:40.700]   will know that you have the victory." See, some of you just need to realize that
[00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:44.180]   you're in a battle right now, but actually the tender-heartedness of God
[00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:48.180]   is towards you. I was filled with fear on that street in Bangkok. So much fear
[00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:52.420]   that I wanted to flee in the other direction. God's tenderness is always
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:57.380]   there for us in the battles that we face, and if you need that, ask for that today.
[00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:01.800]   So what is it that happens when Gideon goes down to the army? Let's pick this up
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:07.380]   again in verse 13. Gideon arrived just as a man was telling his friend a dream.
[00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:12.100]   Here we go. "I had a dream," he was saying. "A round loaf of barley bread came
[00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:17.020]   tumbling into the Midianite camp. It struck the tent with such force that the
[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:22.620]   tent overturned and collapsed. His friend responded, 'This can be nothing other
[00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:28.220]   than the sword of Gideon's son of Josiah the Israelite. God has given the
[00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:33.020]   Midianites and the whole camp into his hand.'" It's amazing how God orchestrates
[00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:38.300]   this. At the very moment that this person who had received a dream from God that
[00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:42.060]   the Midianites would be defeated, shares that dream with his buddy, and as his
[00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:46.020]   dream, as his buddy interprets that dream, Gideon just happens to be standing
[00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:50.220]   nearby. And Gideon hears this and immediately understands what God is
[00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:55.060]   doing. You see, the barley loaf here in the dream is important. Barley loaves
[00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:59.180]   were loaves that were only ever eaten by the poor. In fact, Midianites would have
[00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:04.060]   used barley loaves to feed the dogs and the animals of the camp. Never would they
[00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:08.260]   have given that to the people. The people would eat of a different type of bread, a
[00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:12.580]   higher quality bread. And in this dream, they see a barley loaf, the very thing
[00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:16.540]   that they despised and would give to the animals, they see that rolled down and
[00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:20.820]   flattened one of their tents. They understand, or sorry, at least Gideon
[00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:24.940]   understands with this idea of the barley loaf, that what God is saying is this, "The
[00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:28.580]   things that are the weakest, the things that are despised, the things that are
[00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:32.860]   thrown away to the dogs, I can use those things to bring my victory. The weak
[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:35.860]   things, the things that we reject, the things that we don't think have strength,
[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:39.740]   the things that we don't think could ever do anything, it's the barley loaves of
[00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:44.820]   the kingdom of God that actually sees God's victory. It's when we are weak that
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:48.300]   we are actually strong. It's when we actually don't have those abilities,
[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:52.180]   don't have the strength, that God actually comes through. The barley loaves
[00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:56.980]   of God's kingdom are the things that bring the victory." And so this was so
[00:26:56.980 --> 00:27:00.660]   encouraging, I think, for Gideon. So encouraging, in fact, that look what he
[00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:05.940]   says in verse 15, "When Gideon heard this dream and its interpretation, he
[00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:09.900]   worshipped God. He returned to the camp of Israel and he called this out." Listen,
[00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:15.420]   "Get up! The Lord has given the Midianite camp into our hands." I love this.
[00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:19.540]   "Gideon has gone from a place of fear," remember the Lord said to him, "If you're
[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:22.580]   feeling fear, go down to the camp." He went down to the camp, so he was feeling
[00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:27.500]   fear. "He's gone from a place of fear to a place of worship in a moment." Why?
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:32.420]   Because he knows through this dream that God has given him the victory. So much so
[00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:36.620]   that he goes back to the camp, he wakes everybody up, and he says and he declares
[00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:40.060]   prophetically before them, "God has given this army into our hands." There may be
[00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:46.820]   only 300 of us, we were 32,000, but God has given it to us in his hands. I love
[00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:50.660]   this. That Gideon would realize that as soon as he had an understanding of the
[00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:55.340]   victory, he went into worship. Before he did anything, before they fought any
[00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:58.300]   battle, before they went down to the battlefield, before they did anything
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:03.220]   that happens next, he started in that place of worship. He knew that the
[00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:08.020]   proclamation of victory before God was the essential first thing before he
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:11.180]   picked up any weapon. You need to know this if you're watching this right now,
[00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:16.340]   that your primary posture is that of a worshiper. In spiritual warfare, your
[00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:21.420]   primary posture is not of an army or a soldier in battle. Your primary posture
[00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:26.540]   is to be a worshiper. Your focus is to be on God. And he turns to God and he
[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:30.100]   worships him, and he says, "I give you all the glory for the victory that's about to
[00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:37.300]   happen," because he knows that God is at work. When we turn to God in worship first,
[00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:43.940]   then we find ourselves in the right place for the battle that is ahead. Some
[00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:48.940]   of you, that's just a simple word in season for you, worship is the starting
[00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:54.900]   point. As we proclaim this beauty of who God is, we find ourselves in that place.
[00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:58.620]   We know in Christ Jesus, through his death and resurrection, that we have the
[00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:05.540]   victory. And we declare in worship that victory right now. I want to encourage
[00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:09.960]   you with this. Do not wait until things turn out positively in your life to give
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:15.500]   God glory. Come on church, do not wait until things turn out positively in your
[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:20.140]   life to give God glory. Don't wait until the sea has parted and you're standing
[00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:25.340]   on dry ground to declare that God can part the sea. Don't
[00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:29.340]   get all the resources together before you're willing to stand before God and
[00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:34.980]   say, "Here I am, send me." God is looking for a people who will shout before the
[00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:39.420]   first brick falls. He's looking for a people who know that the victory is
[00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:44.860]   theirs before they even stand up to face the battle. That is the cry of God on his
[00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:52.980]   people. Barley loaves, just like you and I. Weak, despised, overwhelmed, not good. As we
[00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:58.940]   turn to worship him, we find ourselves equipped for the battle ahead. Are you
[00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:01.780]   guys still with this? Everyone's still tracking with this? You can't tell me you
[00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:05.380]   are, but I'm gonna keep asking you just to kind of shake you up a bit.
[00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:10.060]   Now the question is, how do they do this battle? I mean 300 men,
[00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:17.020]   135,000, 450 to 1 odds. Let me show you this from verse 16.
[00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:22.260]   "Dividing the 300 men into three companies of a hundred each, he placed
[00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:27.380]   the trumpets, he placed trumpets and empty jars in their hands of all of them
[00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:32.700]   with torches inside. 'Watch me,' he said to them, 'follow my lead. When I get to the
[00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:37.900]   edge of the camp, do exactly as I do. When I and all who are with me blow our
[00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:42.820]   trumpets, then from all around the camp blow yours and shout, 'For the Lord and
[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:47.980]   for Gideon!' Gideon and the hundred men with him reached the edge of the camp at
[00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:52.060]   the beginning of the middle watch, just after they had changed the guard. They
[00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:57.300]   blew their trumpets, broke or smashed their jars that were in their hands. The
[00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:02.540]   three companies blew their trumpets and smashed the jars. Grasping the torches in
[00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:07.020]   their left hands and holding in their right hands the trumpets they were to
[00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:12.580]   blow, they shouted, 'A sword for the Lord and for Gideon!' While each man held his
[00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:18.100]   position around the camp, all the Midianites ran crying out as they fled.
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:22.820]   When the 300 trumpets sounded, the Lord caused the men throughout the
[00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:30.420]   Midianite camp to turn on each other with their swords." I love this. So here's
[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:35.020]   the 300, here's Gideon equipping them and this is where we see that God's battles
[00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:40.540]   are won not by man's strategies or man's efforts but by God's. He never once in
[00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:46.300]   this narrative gives them any weapon that we would have chosen. No swords, no
[00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:51.580]   chariots, no horses, nothing like that. Instead, in fact, actually what God does
[00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:56.340]   is leads Gideon to give three things only in their hands. First of all a
[00:31:56.340 --> 00:32:02.280]   trumpet, then a clay pot and then a torch. And the torch itself was hidden under
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:06.600]   the clay pot. So there is basically a trumpet in one hand, a torch with this
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:11.600]   clay pot over it in the other. And here's the crazy instructions. When I say go,
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:17.700]   blow the horns, smash that clay pot, hold out the lamp and scream on the top of
[00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:21.220]   your head. And that's exactly what they did. And we see in the passage here that
[00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:27.140]   the Midianites are so confused, so overwhelmed by fear that they start to
[00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:31.420]   attack each other. That there's such chaos in the darkness by the sound that
[00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:34.240]   they're hearing and the torches that they're seeing surrounding them that
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:39.220]   they think the 300 people are 300,000 people. And they start to panic and
[00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:42.300]   they're attacking everybody running around the camp. "Oh that must be somebody
[00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:44.620]   from the Israelites. That must be somebody from the Israelites." And they start
[00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:50.060]   killing each other. The Israelites don't even move. Never pick up a sword, never
[00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:54.680]   grab a chariot, never cut anyone down. They literally just stand there and let
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:59.380]   the Midianites kill themselves. You need to know the battles that you are going
[00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:03.260]   to face are not battles that you fight, they're battles that God will fight for
[00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:09.500]   you. But there's still a position you are to take. And I want to talk about, and
[00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:14.460]   this is the question right, what are the weapons that God is going to give us to
[00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:18.540]   enable us to face every battle that's going to come across us as we live out
[00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:22.580]   our dreams? What are those weapons? Well they're the three things. The first
[00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:29.100]   weapon is the trumpet. The trumpet that is used to blast the sound. Your trumpet
[00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:32.500]   is your worship. We've already talked a little bit about this but I want to just
[00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:37.660]   emphasize this again. The first thing we do is we worship. I remember as I was
[00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:42.020]   walking down that street in Bangkok, as I was feeling that oppression, as the fear
[00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:45.820]   rose up inside of me and I wanted to run in the other direction, I began to pray
[00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:49.780]   in tongues. That's a spiritual gift that God's given me. Maybe that's one that's
[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:53.580]   been given to you, maybe it's not. But for me that was a gift that I could use in
[00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:57.660]   that moment. I started to pray in tongues. Why? Because I realized I was
[00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:02.900]   insignificant. I realized that I was way out of my depth. I realized that I was
[00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:07.300]   overwhelmed by the demonic forces that were around me and I realized that if I
[00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:12.000]   focused on the enemy, fear would increase. You need to hear this church. See what
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.980]   the enemy wants you to do in a battle is focus on him. He wants you to turn your
[00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:21.180]   eyes and to look at him so that your fear would increase. As I began to pray
[00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:25.420]   in tongues on that street, I began to feel a peace come upon me. Why? Because I
[00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:29.100]   wasn't focused on the demonic forces around me all of a sudden. I was focused
[00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:34.060]   on God. This is why the psalmist is right. I lift up my eyes to the mountains. Where
[00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:39.180]   does my help come from? It comes from Zion, the maker of heaven and earth. If
[00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:43.460]   you're in a spiritual battle right now, the worst thing you can do is focus on
[00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:48.420]   the spiritual battle you're in. The best thing you can do is turn your eyes up
[00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:53.300]   and focus on God. You keep your eyes on him, guess what? The enemy will not
[00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:59.660]   overwhelm you with fear. When you focus on him, perfect love casts out fear. I
[00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:05.740]   want to encourage you church, you start by blowing the trumpet, blowing your
[00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:12.420]   worship before him, exclaiming your need for him, his glory, his wonder, his might
[00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:17.580]   and he will come and fight the battles for you. The second thing that you need
[00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:23.820]   is to smash your clay pot, to smash your clay pot. This is to deal with your
[00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:26.900]   self-reliance and pride. We've been seeing this as a theme throughout the
[00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:31.140]   message today and it's something I want to emphasize once more again. The light
[00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:36.780]   that they had was under these clay pots and Gideon said, "Smash those clay pots so
[00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:41.140]   the light can be shown." I want you to know that many of us, myself included, we
[00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:46.100]   hide the light of Christ under the clay pots of our self-reliance and pride. The
[00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:49.840]   things that we think we can do, the things that we think about, the great
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:53.540]   strength that we think is in us, the fact that we think that we are the best
[00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:57.620]   people in the world to go and fight the battles. God, that pride and that thing,
[00:35:57.620 --> 00:36:04.280]   that self-reliance is a clay pot that actually covers up, it hides the light of
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:09.920]   Christ in us. When we think we're great, the light of Christ dims. When we
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:15.180]   realise that it's God that's great and not us, we allow that light to shine.
[00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:20.540]   Church, some of us need to smash the clay pots that are hiding the light of
[00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:25.500]   Christ in our lives. In fact, Paul writing years later would actually say
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:30.460]   something very similar. In 2 Corinthians 4, writing to the church, trying to
[00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:35.500]   challenge them in the dreams that they had, he says this from verse 6, "For God
[00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:41.340]   who said, 'Let light shine out of darkness,' he made this light shine in our hearts
[00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:45.420]   to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.
[00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:52.700]   But we have this light, this treasure in jars of clay to show us that the all-
[00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:57.500]   surpassing power is not from us, but is from God. Oh, we are hard-pressed on every
[00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:01.620]   side, but we're not crushed. We are perplexed, but not in despair. We are
[00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:06.180]   persecuted, but we are not abandoned, struck down, but not destroyed. Oh no, we
[00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:12.140]   always carry around in our body the death of Jesus so that the life of Jesus
[00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:16.100]   may also be revealed through our bodies." Paul is saying to the church, "We're
[00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:22.540]   fragile. We're little jars of clay and in our brokenness, as we realize that
[00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:26.820]   we're not strong, that we haven't got it all together, but in our brokenness, the
[00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:32.220]   power of God, the glory of God, the light of God can be shown in the world. His
[00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:37.460]   light shining forth out of our brokenness. The best thing we can do to
[00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:41.660]   fight the spiritual battles that we're in is to deal with the things that hide
[00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:45.060]   the light of Christ in our lives. Deal with our pride. Deal with our
[00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:49.420]   self-reliance. Come before the Lord. Ask Him to show us if that is affecting the
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:52.980]   battle we're in. Some of you just are needing or thinking you need more
[00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:56.820]   resources. Some of you are doubling down in your gifts and your strength, thinking
[00:37:56.820 --> 00:38:01.420]   that that will get you through it, when actually you need to realize that it is
[00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:09.100]   your brokenness, the smashed jar of clay, the fragility of the human life that
[00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:16.460]   enables the power of Christ to be seen. For when we are weak, He then is strong
[00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:21.900]   on our behalf." As I was walking down that street in Bangkok, as I was so
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:25.700]   overwhelmed, I remember at the start of the walk thinking this. I remember
[00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:29.420]   judging all of the men that I could see going into those bars, men that I knew
[00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:32.460]   were going in there to pay for sex. I remember thinking to myself, "I'm a
[00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:36.220]   Christian. I would never do anything like that." By the time I got about halfway
[00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:41.980]   down that road, the spiritual oppression was so heavy that I realized that I was
[00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:46.060]   just one or two decisions away from ending up entering into one of those
[00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:51.620]   bars and purchasing sex. I realized that as a fragile male man, that I was also
[00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:56.940]   seduced by temptation. That I could very easily make the same mistakes that the
[00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:01.060]   people around me. That I wasn't better. I wasn't more perfect. I wasn't anything else. I
[00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:06.260]   realized that I was broken and it was my pride that would come before a fall. It
[00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:10.620]   would be my pride that would end up leading me into a place of seduction if
[00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:14.820]   I wasn't careful. I had to come before the Lord and smash that clay pot. I
[00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:19.740]   had to come before the Lord and say, "God, I am so sorry because I realize I'm just
[00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:23.660]   as weak as these men walking into that room right now. The only thing that's
[00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:29.820]   stopping me from doing that is your grace. It's your love. It's the light that
[00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:35.220]   you have given me. I'm not perfect or better than them. I just have you." And
[00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:41.260]   some of you just need to realize that that's your scenario right now. You need
[00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:45.300]   to come before the Lord again. Give him your life and your heart and say, "God, I
[00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:50.060]   only have you and I realize I'm just a decision or two away from doing something
[00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:55.700]   that I would regret for a lifetime. Father, would you come with your grace?"
[00:39:55.700 --> 00:40:01.700]   The third and final thing as we go back to that passage in Judges chapter 7 is
[00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:05.580]   of course the light that then comes. As they smash that clay pot and they put
[00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:11.140]   that light up, that is the light of Christ that is in you. The one thing that
[00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:16.540]   shines in the darkness is not again us. It is Christ's light in and through us.
[00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:21.460]   Our testimony, our gospel that sits within us, the beauty and the wonder of
[00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:26.220]   our own salvation and the restoration of our own lives, of the hope that we carry
[00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:30.660]   in Christ Jesus and the message that we have that brings that hope into the
[00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:34.980]   world. Those are the things that shines God's light. We're not to shine the light
[00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:40.900]   of the vine, church. We're not to shine the light even of our Christianity.
[00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:46.260]   We're to shine the light of Jesus in Jesus alone. It's his beauty, his wonder,
[00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:50.700]   his power, his majesty that shines in the darkness. I want you to know this.
[00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:57.500]   The enemy is thrown into confusion through the light of Christ. The enemy is shown
[00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:03.500]   for who he truly is, not in our light, but in the light of Jesus. We have an amazing
[00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:08.740]   God that fights on our behalf. So are you facing some battles right now?
[00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:13.060]   Your dreams will bring you into those battles. Are you facing some spiritual
[00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:20.220]   oppression in your life? Blow your trumpet, smash your pots, and hold out
[00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:25.780]   your light, the light that sits in you with Jesus. And you don't even need to
[00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:29.980]   pick up a weapon of war. You don't even need to get into that battlefield. God
[00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:35.980]   will fight the battle for you as you take up your position on the edge of
[00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:41.980]   that battlefield. Not running away, not like the 22,000, not even like those 10,000,
[00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:48.340]   but the 300 who have just equipped with those weapons of warfare that God has
[00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:52.140]   given them. I want to encourage you as I close with one final passage. It's from
[00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:57.900]   2 Chronicles, and God is speaking here to the army of Israelite as they're facing
[00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:01.820]   another battle that's through them. Let me read this over us, and I believe that
[00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:06.220]   this passage alone is why some of you have tuned in today. This passage right
[00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:09.940]   here alone is why some of you need to watch this and perhaps watch it again.
[00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:17.460]   Listen to this as we read from verse 17. "You will not have to fight this battle."
[00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:22.700]   Come on church, let me say that again one more time. "You will not have to fight
[00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:28.660]   this battle. Take up your positions. Stand firm and see the deliverance the Lord
[00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:34.860]   will give you, O Judah and Jerusalem. Do not be afraid. Do not be discouraged. Get
[00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:41.780]   out and face them tomorrow, and the Lord will be with you. You will not have to
[00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:45.060]   fight this battle." That's a word and season for some of you. What the Lord
[00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:49.940]   does say though is this, "Take up your position. Take up your position. Stand
[00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:54.860]   there. Go out there tomorrow and face the battle you're in, but not in your
[00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:59.060]   strength, not with your weapons, not with man's strategies, not with all the
[00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:03.340]   resources that you think you need, but simply with the trumpet of worship that
[00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:08.300]   declares God is good, simply with the smashing of our sin and the clay pots
[00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:12.940]   that hide the light of Christ, and holding forth that light as we take up
[00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:20.420]   our positions with courage. God fights the battle." And I want you to know that
[00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:24.780]   that's what we're doing here at The Vine in many ways. I want to just thank the
[00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:28.740]   men and women that work in branches of hope and with STOP. We have this
[00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:32.900]   incredible organisation here at The Vine that is on the front lines of fighting
[00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:37.540]   back human trafficking here in Hong Kong, and they do so every week, and it's a
[00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:41.940]   discouraging work. It's a hard work. There are battles they're facing, but they've
[00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:47.160]   taken up their positions with courage. You yourself are being called by God in
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:51.500]   this hour to take up the positions. Remember, the positions that His dreams
[00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:56.540]   have led you into. Not the positions of somebody else's dreams, but the ones that
[00:43:56.540 --> 00:44:02.580]   God has brought you to. In that place, God will fight the battle for you. Take
[00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:08.380]   courage, my church. Fight with weapons that are not man's weapons, but with the
[00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:12.180]   weapons that have been put in you through the power and the anointing of
[00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:16.220]   Christ Jesus. I want to pray for every single one of us where this is important
[00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:19.820]   to you today, where you're resonating with this. Let me pray a word of
[00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:24.820]   encouragement over you. Father, we just are so grateful as we take this moment
[00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:29.180]   across the homes of Hong Kong and around the world, as we think about the
[00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:34.400]   spiritual battles that are right now here before us. Lord, we take up our
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:38.320]   trumpets. Father, I want to pray that worship would be released in homes
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:44.700]   right in this moment. Father, I pray that prayer and worship is the sound that
[00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:49.140]   brings the enemy into confusion. I want to pray for a releasing of worship in
[00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:54.180]   every home right now, in the name of Jesus. I want to pray for the smashing
[00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:58.620]   of clay pots. Lord, we bring you our sin. We bring you our pride. We bring you the
[00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:03.300]   things that cover your light in our lives. Lord, we smash them in the name of
[00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:09.380]   Jesus right now. Lord, would you give us your spirit again to stand against the
[00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:13.820]   sin that is in our lives. Lord, help us to take responsibility for our choices.
[00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:19.020]   Lord, help us to realise, Father, that we are those broken jars of clay,
[00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:24.780]   desperately in need of your grace. Would you fill us, Lord, with your grace. And
[00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:28.420]   Lord, we pray for your light, your light to shine through every single person
[00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:34.660]   watching, your light of your gospel, of your hope, of your power, of your wisdom.
[00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:39.380]   Lord, we hold forth the light of Christ, no matter the storm that we might find
[00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:45.580]   us in. Lord, we will not hide that light in Hong Kong's hour of need in this time
[00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:51.260]   in our city. May we shine forward now with the weapons that you've given us,
[00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:57.740]   and may we do this for your glory. And we pray this in Jesus' name. Everyone says,
[00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:02.060]   "Amen." We're gonna go into a moment of worship, and if you're watching this
[00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:05.380]   right now, and if there's a battle going on in your life right now, and you're
[00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:08.620]   thinking, "This is a battle I need help for," I want to encourage you in the chat
[00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:12.420]   right now. Put your battle in there. Let us know what spiritual things are going
[00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:16.060]   on, what battles you're fighting, what battles you're facing. Our team are
[00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:20.120]   right ready right now to pray for you now, or pray for you at five o'clock. Log
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:23.820]   in there, have somebody come around you and pray for you at that time. Let's do
[00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:29.220]   this work together. We're not alone. We're the 300, the barley loaves of God's
[00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:33.540]   kingdom, fighting God's battles. Let's do it together, and let's worship now as a
[00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:36.340]   community.
