[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720]   Hey, it's so good to see you.
[00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.560]   I don't know why I just pulled my sleeves up because it's actually kind of cold, but
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.560]   I'm ready.
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.400]   I hope you guys are.
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:20.120]   So when I graduated from seminary, I ended up going to Germany and I was in a church,
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:26.360]   I was a youth pastor, young adults pastor, and I became part of the leadership team.
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:32.760]   So as a leadership team, after a few years, we decided that we are going to go to a leadership
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:39.280]   conference to be inspired and to also take some time as a leadership team to discuss
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.720]   some of the direction and vision of the church.
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:49.260]   And so here I was at this conference, all these amazing speakers, and after like three
[00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:57.880]   sessions or so, I remember sitting in the big hall against the wall and just really
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:07.220]   feeling out of place, really feeling that I don't belong.
[00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.600]   But I didn't know why I was feeling this way.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.280]   And it wasn't until the evening when the evening speaker shared and spoke that it dawned on
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.380]   me what was going on.
[00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.020]   So in the evening, the speaker was talking about some of the challenges, some of the
[00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.580]   struggles that he was facing and that he was going through.
[00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.260]   But he also talked about how God was meeting him, how God was with him and how he brought
[00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:43.140]   him through these challenges and how it was so inspiring.
[00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.220]   And then it dawned on me, the reason why I had felt so out of place was because the other
[00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.180]   speakers, they all spoke from a place of success.
[00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.300]   Everything they did turned into gold, so to speak.
[00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.680]   Everything they did worked out perfectly.
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.960]   And I was like, that is not my life.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.500]   Not everything that I do is working out perfectly.
[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.200]   Now, don't get me wrong, my youth and young adults ministry was going okay, but there
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.860]   were some real challenges that were going on there as well.
[00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:21.760]   What I needed was to hear from someone who has gone through this stuff, who God met in
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:29.820]   the midst of that and who knew how to work and walk through that with faith, with courage.
[00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.200]   And so that's what was going on.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.800]   And then once I heard this message, I suddenly didn't feel so much more out of place.
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.820]   And I'm sure, or I'm very confident, most of us here feel the same way.
[00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.620]   What's actually helpful for us is not that people talk about all their one victory to
[00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.740]   the next victory to the next victory and their life is just this upward projective of going
[00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.180]   up.
[00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.460]   But what we need is people who authentically share their lives, their joys.
[00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.900]   Of course, that's inspiring, that's beautiful.
[00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:08.180]   But also their struggles and how God meets them in the midst of that and helps them to
[00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.180]   walk through that.
[00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.360]   That's what I need to hear.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.420]   And I believe that that's what we need to hear because our lives, there are challenges,
[00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.220]   there are struggles, there's also victories and joys.
[00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:24.420]   But we need to hear from people who have gone through stuff and who've made it through or
[00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.760]   who've encountered God in the midst of it.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.160]   And so I'm excited today because we're going to look at scripture.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:42.080]   And scripture, it doesn't just portray people or characters that have perfect lives.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:49.600]   As a matter of fact, if you read the Bible, you see there's a lot of very messy families,
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.840]   super messy families.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.400]   But God works in and through them.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.560]   And one of those peoples is Joseph.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.960]   And so today I'm really excited.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:08.960]   We are going to start a sermon series that we've titled "The Story of Joseph," where
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.680]   we're going to look at his life.
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:18.040]   And Joseph, he had some very extreme lows, some very painful, some very difficult experiences.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.400]   But he also had some great success.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.760]   So it wasn't just struggle, but he also had some great success.
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.080]   And we're going to look at the highs and lows and how Joseph walks through this with faith
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.400]   and with courage and how God meets him in all parts of his life journey.
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.720]   I believe that God wants to speak to us through the life of Joseph.
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:49.720]   And as I was preparing the sermon series, I really sensed that God wants to build a
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:56.760]   stronger and more resilient and more courageous faith into our hearts, into our lives.
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.920]   And I don't know about you, but I want that.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.320]   I want a stronger faith.
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.560]   I want to be more resilient when stuff happens that's not the way I pictured or when doing
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.280]   what's right doesn't seem to be paying off.
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.880]   I want a faith that's strong enough to get through whatever it is that is going on.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:25.360]   And so last year as a church, a lot of our focus has been that Jesus is healer.
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.840]   And we're always going to focus on that.
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:34.840]   We're the divine church because Jesus continues his healing work.
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:42.040]   But part of the healing journey is also growing, maturing.
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:48.640]   And so I believe that the series is especially an invitation for a more mature faith, for
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:57.320]   growing big people, which is the vision of divine church, for us to attain the full measure
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.320]   of the fullness of Christ.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.160]   I think I got that a little bit wrong, but let me get it 100% right.
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.880]   Attaining the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:05.880]   There we go.
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.120]   That's what Paul says to the Ephesian Christians, because that's what God wants to do with us.
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:17.400]   He wants to make us mature followers of Jesus who reflect his character more fully and fully.
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.960]   And I believe that through the story of Joseph, that God wants to speak to us and start working
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.120]   that into our lives.
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.920]   So I'm excited about that.
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.960]   Now, before we go into the specific passage for today, I do want to do a little bit more
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.800]   background work with you.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.240]   Most of the time we don't do that in as much detail, but today I felt like I need to set
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.280]   really the backdrop of the story of Joseph and what that story is located in the book
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.280]   of Genesis.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:49.560]   So we're on the book of Genesis, which is the beginning of the first book in the Bible.
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.880]   It's a book of origins.
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.600]   And this book can be broken down at many different ways, but I just chose a simple structure
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.000]   and a threefold structure.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.480]   So it's up here.
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:06.440]   There is a prehistory, there's a patriarchal narratives, and then there's a story of Joseph.
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.560]   Let me tell you about each of them a little bit.
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.680]   So the prehistory is about creation.
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.360]   It's about the fall.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.040]   It's about humanity made in the image of God.
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:31.120]   But it's also about evil and evil progressing, but a loving God not giving up on his creation.
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.220]   So that's the first 11 chapters.
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:38.880]   Then there's the patriarchal narratives.
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:45.080]   And this is really where God starts his rescue mission of what was lost in the Garden of
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:55.280]   Eden, where God is at work of restoring and redeeming a humanity, a world that has experienced
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:00.400]   the fall, where sin has taken its effect and he wants to restore relationships between
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:05.960]   us and God, relationships between us and others, a relationship between us and creation, and
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.640]   relationship even to ourselves.
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:19.080]   And so this redemptive narrative starts with a covenant that God makes with Abraham.
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:25.520]   And in this covenant, he promises them land, descendants, and blessing.
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:30.360]   So he promised Abraham the land of Canaan.
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:34.920]   He promised Abraham that he will have numerous descendants, that he will be a father of a
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:36.680]   great nation.
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:44.420]   And he promises that his people, his ancestors, will be a great blessing to all nations.
[00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:49.200]   And so God sets aside this group of people because he wants them to be an alternative
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.480]   community.
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:55.440]   He wants them to reflect his character, his justice, his holiness, and how they relate
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.380]   to each other and how they relate to the rest of the world.
[00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:05.640]   And so this promise or this rescue mission is set in motion through this covenant with
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.080]   Abraham.
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.720]   Then Abraham passes this covenant on to, or God passes this covenant on to Isaac, his
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:12.720]   son.
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:17.640]   And then Isaac passes on this covenant and this promise to Jacob.
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:21.880]   And Jacob is the father of Joseph.
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.320]   And this is where we get in the third part of the story.
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:33.980]   Now we refer to it as a story of Joseph, but really it is a story about Jacob's family.
[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:39.880]   Jacob had 12 sons, one daughter that we know of, maybe more, but we only know of one.
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:46.780]   But the 12 sons, they start caring for this covenant promise that God has made with Abraham.
[00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:54.100]   And actually, the 12 sons become the, so to speak, founding fathers of the nation, later
[00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:57.380]   on nation of Israel.
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.100]   And so this covenant gets carried forward.
[00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:08.300]   And in the Joseph story, we see that what God has promised, which at first seems so
[00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:14.100]   unlikely that there will be many descendants, that that is now starting to unfold.
[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:19.900]   And we also see in the story that God's purposes, God's plan, God's word will come to pass.
[00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.060]   You know what he sets out to do, he accomplishes.
[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:26.100]   Now within the narrative, there's always this challenge and this tension.
[00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.100]   Will this happen?
[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:31.620]   Will God's promise come to fruition?
[00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:36.300]   And then there is a lot of opposition, but we see that it does.
[00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:43.500]   So that is the book of Genesis and, you know, in the threefold structure of what's going
[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:44.500]   on.
[00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:49.940]   And then the story of Joseph takes place as part of this redemptive, grand narrative of
[00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:51.500]   the Bible.
[00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:56.900]   Now, I also think that it's important, not only that we have this over, you actually
[00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:02.180]   think we need to give you an overview of the story of Joseph, because when every week,
[00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:05.660]   when we look at different parts of Joseph's story, we actually always have to keep the
[00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:11.220]   whole story in mind so that we understand what's going on.
[00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:12.780]   We have to have the whole picture in mind.
[00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:16.820]   So I'm going to quickly narrate the whole story of Joseph.
[00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:21.200]   And by the way, it's only chapter 37 to 50 in the Bible.
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:27.620]   So I'm just going to start reading right now, maybe like in an hour, we're going to be done.
[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:31.980]   No, I'm going to do it quicker, hopefully.
[00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:37.220]   So here's the story of Joseph in a nutshell.
[00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:42.260]   Jacob loves Joseph more than he loves the other brothers.
[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:43.500]   It's his favorite.
[00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.860]   He gives them a special robe.
[00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:49.660]   The brothers are extremely jealous of the father's love, so they decide that they are
[00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.700]   going to kill him.
[00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:55.700]   But instead of killing him, they end up selling him into slavery.
[00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:58.820]   And then through the slavery, he's brought to Egypt.
[00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.460]   In Egypt, he ends up in Potiphar's house.
[00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:05.300]   He's actually quite successful in Potiphar's house.
[00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:11.460]   But then Potiphar's wife accuses him of attempting to rape her.
[00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:12.780]   And so then he's thrown in prison.
[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:17.060]   So just when you thought that Joseph's life might be getting better, it actually gets
[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.460]   worse.
[00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:28.140]   And in prison, he meets two people from the court of Pharaoh, the cupbearer and the baker.
[00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:31.820]   And he interprets dreams for them.
[00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:36.620]   And he asks the cupbearer to not forget him once he is restored back to Pharaoh, which
[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:40.300]   is part of his dream interpretation, which comes to pass.
[00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:46.860]   But the cupbearer forgets, and another couple of years pass until Pharaoh has a dream that
[00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:50.580]   nobody knows how to interpret.
[00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:53.660]   And so he remembers.
[00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:56.500]   He remembers that there was this guy in prison.
[00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:00.620]   And so they bring Joseph to Pharaoh, and Pharaoh interprets the dream of Joseph that there
[00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:07.140]   will be seven years of plenty and abundance, and then a seven-year famine.
[00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:11.420]   And he also comes up with a plan of what they can do, and Pharaoh sees that the spirit of
[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:15.180]   God is in Joseph, is with Joseph.
[00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.500]   And so he puts him in charge.
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:24.820]   He's second in charge of Egypt to implement a plan to not only save Egypt, but then also
[00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:29.540]   to actually save the region, the whole region, from starvation.
[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:37.060]   And so then Jacob and his sons, the sons are sent to Egypt because they need grain, they
[00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:40.940]   need food, because they have none in Israel.
[00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:47.660]   And so he finds himself suddenly confronted with his brothers who sold him into slavery.
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.420]   But they don't recognize him, and he tests them.
[00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:51.060]   He ends up forgiving them.
[00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:57.540]   He brings the whole family to Egypt, and the family is safe and secure and makes it through
[00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:58.540]   the famine.
[00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:05.180]   And the promise of God, the covenant promise, is carried forward.
[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:10.580]   And even the famine cannot stop the promise of God.
[00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:12.700]   So that's the quick version.
[00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:20.420]   I hope that was quick enough, better than reading.
[00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:23.980]   But there is, at the end, there's a verse that I think is important for understanding
[00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:24.980]   the whole.
[00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:31.980]   So Jacob dies, and then his sons start freaking out again that Joseph is going to retaliate,
[00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:34.380]   even though he already has forgiven them.
[00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:36.140]   And so they ask him to be his servant.
[00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:39.100]   And this is, I want to read this verse.
[00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:42.260]   If you've been in church, you might have heard this before.
[00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:48.580]   Genesis 50 verse 20 says this, "You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to
[00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:56.860]   accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives."
[00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:03.540]   So God was working through all the evil, all the horrible things that were happening, and
[00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:11.820]   he brought about his purposes for Joseph, for his family, and he brought out good.
[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:19.300]   You know, God's purposes, God's plans, they cannot be stopped.
[00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:25.140]   He will accomplish what he sets out to accomplish in our lives.
[00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:28.220]   But anyhow, let's actually get to our passage for today.
[00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:29.220]   Does that sound good?
[00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:30.820]   Yes, let's do it.
[00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:36.540]   All right, Genesis 37 verse 2, here we go.
[00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:39.740]   This is the account of Jacob's family line.
[00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:44.580]   Joseph a young man of 17 was tending the flocks with his brothers, the sons of Bila and the
[00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:50.660]   sons of Silpa, his father's wives, and he brought their father a bad report about them.
[00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:54.020]   All right, Joseph is 17 years old.
[00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:57.620]   A little bit background story.
[00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:59.420]   Jacob has four wives.
[00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:09.900]   There is Leah, Rachel, which are his main wives, and then there are Bila and Silpa,
[00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.740]   who are basically the maids of Leah and Rachel.
[00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:18.460]   And so Jacob right now is with his half-brothers in the field, and there might be a little
[00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:22.900]   bit of a hint that his father also has sent them there to spy on his brothers, and he
[00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:24.980]   brings a bad report about them.
[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:30.860]   Now, I don't know about you, but as kids or even nowadays, when somebody just tells on
[00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:35.500]   someone that usually doesn't go across well.
[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:38.980]   You're not making friends, especially if you're telling on your older brother, right?
[00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:42.380]   So he's not making friends, but let's continue what happens next.
[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:43.380]   So verse 3.
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:48.620]   "Now Israel loved Joseph more than any of his other sons, because he had been born to
[00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:54.380]   him in his old age, and he made an ornate robe for him.
[00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:59.500]   His brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them.
[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:06.640]   They hated him and could not speak a kind word to him."
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:13.580]   So Joseph, he publicly expresses his favoritism for his son by giving him this ornate robe.
[00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:17.300]   Now the Hebrew word for this robe is actually not that clear.
[00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:22.220]   It can mean ornate robe, it can mean long-sleeved robe.
[00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:28.140]   And what that basically means is, this is like the robe of a prince.
[00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:36.840]   Now Jacob's family work is livestock and working in fields.
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:42.740]   So if you have a robe like that, you're not the one who most of the time works there.
[00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:47.580]   So he's basically treating Joseph like a prince.
[00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:59.340]   Now as parents, especially if you have multiple children, not just one child, it's easy to
[00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:03.140]   more easily get along with one of your children than maybe over other children.
[00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:04.380]   You know, if we're just honest, right?
[00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:08.620]   Because we have different temperament, they have different personality, maybe even it's
[00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:13.020]   the gender, maybe you can just more easily relate to the same gender or something like
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:14.460]   that.
[00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:17.820]   And so that's quite a natural thing.
[00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:23.100]   But what becomes a problem is when this maybe natural ease that you can navigate with one
[00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:29.480]   child when that turns into favoritism.
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:33.980]   And favoritism is actually sin.
[00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.940]   The Bible actually refers to favoritism as sin.
[00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:38.180]   When we show favoritism, you know, somebody else.
[00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:42.580]   But John Lennox, he's an apologist, like somebody who defends the Christian faith.
[00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:46.220]   He's also a mathematician, a professor in Oxford.
[00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:47.940]   And he defines favoritism in this way.
[00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:53.540]   He says, "Favoritism involves preferential treatment of some over others, particularly
[00:18:53.540 --> 00:19:00.260]   in relations that should be equal."
[00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:05.700]   And then James, Jesus' brother, he says this in James 2.1.
[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:10.260]   He says, "My brothers and sisters, believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ must not
[00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.140]   show favoritism."
[00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:16.660]   He's actually talking to the church where some of the people were showing favoritism
[00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:18.260]   to the rich over the poor.
[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.860]   And he's saying, "Nuh-uh.
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:22.900]   Should treat nobody with favoritism.
[00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:24.860]   Should all be treated equal."
[00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:29.140]   And that same truth applies whether it's in family, whether it's in the church, whether
[00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:32.420]   it's in your workplace.
[00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:36.060]   That's what God desires of us.
[00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:39.980]   And so many parents, they put forth an effort.
[00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:44.220]   If they have two children, they put forth an effort of not showing favoritism to the
[00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:47.580]   child that they may be more easily related to.
[00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.420]   And that's awesome, and that honors God.
[00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:52.780]   But Joseph is not one of those parents.
[00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:54.340]   He just shows the favoritism.
[00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:58.660]   He just publicly expresses it.
[00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:04.980]   And it ends up leading his brothers to have this deep hatred and resentment because they're
[00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:08.920]   not as loved as Joseph is.
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:11.920]   They want that same love, but they're not getting it.
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:15.780]   And so we're told that they're not able, they hated him, and he could not speak a kind word
[00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:16.780]   to him.
[00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:21.300]   Now, I don't know if you've ever had this experience.
[00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:27.180]   Maybe it's in your family, maybe it's in a workplace where you step into the room and
[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:30.380]   somebody's just hating on you.
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:32.900]   Everything you do, they have a negative word to say about you.
[00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:36.140]   Everything you do in their eyes sucks.
[00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:38.500]   And they let you know.
[00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:46.380]   Or I don't know if this was a thing back in that time where they rolled their eyes.
[00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:52.500]   Or maybe they just sneer at you, or they do that whole sound.
[00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:58.820]   Isn't that a beautiful sound when somebody else makes that sound to you?
[00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:03.380]   I remember when I first came to Hong Kong, and I was unaware of how stuff works, I got
[00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:06.940]   a lot of...
[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:07.940]   I don't know what that means.
[00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:10.780]   I was like, "Why are people making a sound?"
[00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:11.780]   And I don't know what I did.
[00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:18.180]   Now, it doesn't happen anymore, so I must have learned to avoid that sound.
[00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:20.140]   But that's like Cold War, right?
[00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:24.300]   You're stepping into a room and your brothers are just hating on you.
[00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:27.540]   Man, it's horrible.
[00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:29.140]   What a horrible environment.
[00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:36.660]   And I think we all, in different ways, whether it's at workplace, in family, or whether it's
[00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:43.580]   ourselves even doing it, have experienced the negative effects of favoritism.
[00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:47.940]   Maybe we didn't get the love that we should have gotten.
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:55.740]   Maybe we were unfairly treated, that one person always gets a promotion, always gets the boss's
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:58.420]   attention, but we don't.
[00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:02.620]   Or maybe we're the ones who are doing it, who are showing the favoritism.
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:08.740]   Because we're not always just the recipients of things, we also have issues ourselves and
[00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:09.740]   do that as well.
[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:12.980]   And as I was praying over this message, I did...
[00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:16.980]   There's a couple of things with that that I sensed that I just want to say at this point.
[00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:21.740]   One of them was, I do believe that we need to examine ourselves.
[00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:28.020]   Is there favoritism that you are showing to someone where you shouldn't do it?
[00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:33.660]   And if you are, whether it's in your family, whether it's at work, whether it's with your
[00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:37.540]   students, actually, we need to repent.
[00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:39.260]   We need to ask God for forgiveness for that.
[00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:42.300]   We need to start living differently.
[00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:45.420]   Because when we do that, it just creates a mess.
[00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:49.100]   And it just hurts people, and it doesn't honor God.
[00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:51.300]   So that was the first thing.
[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:57.660]   The second thing that I was sensing was that some of us weren't shown the love that actually
[00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:01.740]   we were meant to be loved, especially from our parents, from our mother, from our father.
[00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:09.300]   And I just have this overwhelming sense of God's love for you.
[00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:11.340]   That He loves you.
[00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:13.780]   He sees you.
[00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:17.060]   And He wants you to know that love.
[00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:21.260]   Now, interesting, earlier when Chapman was servicing, he was talking about basically
[00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:29.620]   Romans 5.5, where it talks about the Holy Spirit pouring God's love into our hearts.
[00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:35.460]   And I believe that the Spirit of God, if you have not received the love that you were meant
[00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:43.140]   to receive, God wants to pour His Spirit, His love into your hearts.
[00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:45.820]   That you know you are loved, you are worthy.
[00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:47.300]   He does see you.
[00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:49.540]   You have not been overlooked.
[00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:57.860]   And He wants you to know that.
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:06.380]   So favoritism brings hurt and pain into people's lives, and it soured the relationship between
[00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:09.260]   Joseph and his brothers.
[00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:14.420]   The brothers projected, even though the father was showing favoritism, but the brothers projected
[00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:17.780]   their hatred and their anger on Joseph.
[00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:20.380]   You see, with favoritism, there is no winner.
[00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:22.820]   Everyone's a loser.
[00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:29.300]   Because Jacob loved Joseph more, but by loving him more, he put him in a really difficult
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:34.460]   spot because it destroyed the relationship with his brothers.
[00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:38.220]   The brothers suffered because they didn't get the love they were meant to have.
[00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:42.260]   It's just a mess, and it really just shows how sin works itself out in our lives, in
[00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:44.800]   our families, in our workplaces.
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:48.620]   So there is no winner.
[00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:53.620]   But let's continue to see how the story unfolds.
[00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:57.660]   Genesis, or continue in verse 5, Genesis 37.
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:03.620]   It says this, "Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him
[00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:04.620]   all the more.
[00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:08.660]   He said to them, 'Listen to this dream I had.
[00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:14.780]   We were binding sheaves of corn out in the field when suddenly my sheave rose and stood
[00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:21.880]   upright while your sheaves gathered around mine and bowed down to it.'
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:25.120]   His brothers said to him, 'Do you intend to reign over us?
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.340]   Will you actually rule us?'
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:32.280]   And they hated him all the more because of his dream and what he had said."
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:38.520]   Now just, I mean, even by the way I read it, you already kind of sense the ridiculousness
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:39.520]   of this.
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:42.440]   But just imagine you're sharing a dream, "Hey guys!
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.440]   Hey church, I had a dream!
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:48.960]   And it was me, and it was this sheave, and it stood up to all my sheaves, and all of
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.920]   your sheaves started bowing down to me.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:53.760]   Isn't that a great dream?
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:26:01.280]   Yay, everybody loves me!"
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:06.720]   You know, I don't know who would ever think this is a good idea to share that dream.
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:11.200]   And so they hate him more, and they even respond to it, they understand what it means.
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.440]   They respond, "Do you intend to reign over us?
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:14.920]   Will you actually rule us?"
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:18.360]   You know, they actually ask that question.
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:26.400]   And it just further escalates that hatred and the tension between the family.
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:31.440]   Now I really just wonder, because Joseph is actually about to tell the next dream.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:35.520]   So you get this, you tell the first dream, and you have this reaction.
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:42.120]   I wonder how in the world can you not realize what's going on and tell the next dream?
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:45.000]   Like seriously, like really, it's like baffling.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.480]   Like why would you tell the next dream?
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:51.040]   You know, if the first one's already like this, and your brothers respond.
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:54.160]   And I mean there's, you know, three, I think three possibilities.
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:58.360]   One of them is he's just oblivious to it, and he just lacks social skills.
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:03.520]   You know, the other one is that he's so excited about what God has spoken to him.
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:08.840]   That all of that enthusiasm, you know, he shares it, but in that enthusiasm he is not
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.600]   aware of how that impacts the brothers.
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:15.200]   Or there's some pride, and he's rubbing it in.
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.440]   He's enjoying it.
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:22.720]   You know, he's pushing, you know, as siblings you know how to push a button from your family
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:25.760]   members to get them upset, so maybe he's pushing a button.
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.520]   But in the end we actually don't know.
[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:30.040]   The Bible doesn't tell us what Joseph was thinking.
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:32.800]   It just tells us that he told the dreams.
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:38.800]   So let's look at the second dream that he shares.
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:43.240]   Continuing in verse 9 it says, "Then he had another dream, and he told it to his brothers.
[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:44.800]   'Listen,' he said.
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:50.580]   'I had another dream, and this time the sun and the moon and the eleven stars were bowing
[00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:53.240]   down to me.'
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:58.280]   When he told his father as well as his brothers, his father rebuked him and said, 'What is
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.640]   this dream you had?
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:05.840]   Will your mother and I, your brothers, actually come and bow down to the ground before you?'
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:10.440]   So his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind."
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:16.720]   Now I think at the very least we can say that Joseph lacked wisdom in sharing this dream
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:19.840]   in the way that he did, or maturity.
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:25.120]   But we see here now his father who loves him.
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.720]   He's his father's favorite, and his father rebukes him.
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.000]   He says, "What are you thinking, man?"
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:38.840]   Well, it's interesting in verse 11 there's a little afterthought, and it says this, "But
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:42.300]   his father kept the matter in mind."
[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:49.080]   So it seems like he doesn't outright disregard what Joseph says.
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:50.880]   And his brothers, they react with jealousy.
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.760]   "But his father kept this matter in mind."
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:57.240]   It reminds me of Mary when she ponders some of the things that the angel told her.
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.240]   So he's pondering these things.
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:06.040]   I think we're meant as listeners or readers also meant to ponder, what's about this dream
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:08.560]   from Joseph?
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:13.040]   But we're going to actually continue the story next week.
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:15.560]   Pastor Chapman, you're preaching next week, right?
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:16.560]   Yes, okay, good.
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:18.240]   So he's preaching next week.
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:21.680]   We're going to, at this point in time, we've had three things happen.
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:24.560]   We had him tell on his brothers.
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:26.040]   So he's like a telltale, right?
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.520]   He's telling on his brothers.
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:35.320]   He got the robe, and then he shared his dreams.
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:37.440]   So we're at almost a breaking point, right?
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.240]   And a tension in this narrative.
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:42.360]   Stuff is about to escalate, and we're going to look at it next week.
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:47.480]   But what I want to do with you, I want to at this point in time ask the question, what
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:53.680]   God might be saying to us through this story?
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:56.000]   And so here it goes.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.120]   Every person has a story.
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:07.320]   Every person has a family background, a history, every one of us.
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:13.120]   And if the Bible would only include family stories of ideal families who do beautiful
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:23.560]   things, who turn into incredible men and women of God, I think we would be very discouraged.
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:25.920]   Because our lives are not that way.
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:29.400]   Our families are messy.
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:33.640]   Not just the ones we grew up in, but our own ones as well.
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:39.480]   Because there is brokenness, there's sin, there's offense, there's hurt, there's pain.
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:48.480]   And I'm so grateful that God's Word does this real talk in Scripture.
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:59.680]   Because of that, we get to see that God works even in broken families' lives.
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:06.120]   And that having a messy family doesn't exclude you from the work that God wants to do in
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:08.760]   your life.
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:15.280]   And it doesn't exclude you from the work that God can do to change your life so that you
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:19.320]   don't perpetuate maybe what's been done to you.
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:23.600]   Because we carry things ourselves with us.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:27.440]   You know, that is good news.
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:32.240]   God is a God of messy people and messy families.
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:38.720]   Now, the Bible describes family life as it truly is.
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:45.800]   Messy and filled with strained relationships, dysfunction, favoritism, envy, and pride.
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:49.280]   I should say also good stuff, I didn't put this in here.
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:51.680]   Also good things, right?
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:59.000]   Yet it also speaks over God who understands your family background.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:06.880]   And can work in and through the messiness to fulfill his purposes in your life and in
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:10.260]   your family's life.
[00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:13.820]   So how do we connect with God about this?
[00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:16.300]   About ourselves, about our family?
[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:17.800]   What do we do?
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:23.360]   Well, I want to share a story from my father.
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:26.680]   So I brought a photo, which is scarily old.
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:34.280]   All right, this is my family, 1999, we're in the 90s.
[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:38.720]   And so this is my brother Mark, my mom Mary, so my mom's American, my father Heinz, like
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:42.960]   Heinz Ketchup, he's German, my sister Ruth, and there's me.
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:45.540]   I think you know my name.
[00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:52.800]   And my father, he grew up post-World War II in Germany, just a little bit less than three
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:53.800]   years after that.
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:56.360]   He grew up in ruins.
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:33:01.800]   Just like the Germans bombed other cities and completely flat bombed things, well, the
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.480]   Allies did that to Germany as well.
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:06.800]   So he grew up in Frankfurt and was pretty much bombed down.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:11.200]   So he grew up in ruins, he played in ruins, he thought it was normal.
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:15.360]   His family struggled to put food on the table.
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:21.240]   Every day there was a question, where will the food come this day?
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:26.160]   And he had an unhappy childhood.
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:29.080]   But his childhood doesn't have to do with the ruins, it doesn't have to do with not
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:30.240]   having much food.
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:35.640]   It had to do with his relationship with his father, my grandfather.
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:43.680]   Because his father himself had not an easy childhood, and so there's this generational
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:44.680]   sin.
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:54.960]   I was passed down of anger, and my father was like the rod that got the lightning.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:34:01.560]   But the anger was targeted towards, he experienced emotional and physical abuse.
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:09.240]   And I'm not going to share too much, also don't want to trigger people too much, because
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:13.160]   I know that some of you have gone through extremely difficult things yourself.
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:18.280]   But one of the stories he recounts often, or recounted often, he passed away quite a
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:26.160]   while ago, is that while the family was eating together, he was not allowed to eat with the
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:27.160]   family.
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:36.640]   They made him eat outside on his own to let him know that something was wrong with him,
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:42.000]   that he was not really part of the family, that he was being punished.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.080]   And so he had to eat on his own.
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:47.920]   Just think of it as a child.
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:52.680]   If you're told that there's something so wrong with you, that you're not even allowed to
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:56.320]   eat with your family.
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.640]   You know, but that's real life.
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:34:59.640]   That's family life.
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:00.960]   Family life is messy.
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.600]   There's brokenness.
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:11.040]   So when he married my mom, he didn't want to repeat that cycle of anger that was so
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:16.920]   destructive that made his childhood so difficult, where he doesn't have a positive memory of
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:17.920]   his childhood.
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:25.560]   He didn't want to repeat that.
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:31.120]   The way he did that was through his relationship with Jesus.
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:38.360]   Because he invited Jesus into his life, and he asked God to meet him, and to provide for
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:44.680]   him, and to help him not to repeat that, because there was also something there in him, in
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:45.680]   my father.
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:54.680]   And so even though he didn't have a loving father, and he never experienced that from
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:36:02.400]   a human father, he was a loving father to me and my siblings.
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:11.680]   And it was because of the love of our heavenly father that he was able to break the cycle
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:17.640]   of anger, and of emotional, and of physical abuse.
[00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:19.600]   Now I don't want to pretend my father was perfect.
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:20.600]   He was not.
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:26.160]   You know, just like every family, I have some stuff to work through, too, right?
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:32.520]   Because I don't want to hold him up as just what I said the Bible does not do.
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:38.400]   But he was a loving father, and he did not abuse us emotionally or physically.
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:40.960]   And so praise God.
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:49.160]   What an incredible testimony to that where you begin in life does not have to determine
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:51.440]   where you end up in life.
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:55.920]   Because if you invite God into your life, he can change the trajectory of your life,
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:37:00.080]   where you do not have to repeat, you do not have to continue in the patterns that were
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:03.680]   set by your parents.
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:11.240]   And he can break the power of sin and of brokenness in your life, and he can set you on a different
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:19.400]   trajectory.
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:25.400]   So God works in and through your life, no matter what your family background is, if
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:29.400]   you are surrendered to him.
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:34.420]   So if you did not receive the love that you were meant to love, if that was your starting
[00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:40.540]   point in life, that does not determine that that's where your life needs to finish.
[00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:42.840]   Because God can pour out his love.
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:45.460]   He can show you his love, the Father's love.
[00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:51.080]   He can place other people in your life that can show you love that you did not receive.
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:38:02.120]   And so God, he's inviting us, all of us, people with broken lives, people with messy families,
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:07.360]   messy backgrounds, to surrender to him and to ask him to come to our lives and break
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:10.840]   these patterns that cause so much pain.
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:18.160]   I want to invite the worship team to come up.
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:25.720]   Don't think that your less than perfect family situation will keep God from moving and working
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:28.520]   in your life.
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:35.840]   And when God works in your life, what he starts, he will bring to completion.
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:41.400]   Just like we see with a covenant promise, what he promised to Abraham, he is bringing
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:42.400]   to completion.
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:43.840]   He will move forward.
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:45.800]   God's purpose is God's plan in your life.
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:52.880]   It cannot be stopped when you live a life in relationship with him.
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:39:01.900]   And so I just want to do something very simple at the outset of the story of Joseph.
[00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:09.000]   I want to invite you, if you're like, "I need change in my life.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:14.520]   I don't want to repeat what my father has done, what my mother has done.
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:18.280]   I don't want to repeat that pattern."
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:22.480]   You can stretch out your hand as a symbol of saying, "Jesus, I want to surrender my
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:23.920]   life to you.
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:28.280]   I want to surrender this situation to you because I need you to come into this situation
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:30.160]   and I need you to meet me.
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:35.000]   I need you to provide for me because I don't want to continue.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.160]   I need change, Lord.
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:39.320]   I need something to change.
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:41.400]   I need your love to work in my life.
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:42.400]   I need hope."
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:54.880]   So I want to invite you to stand all right now.
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:58.720]   God changed my father's life.
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:03.080]   God changed Joseph's life, as we're going to see throughout the series.
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:11.880]   God has changed my life and he for sure can change your life.
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:16.720]   You know, whatever is going on is not the end point of your story.
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:17.720]   God has something new.
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:21.720]   He has something better for you.
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:26.800]   But he's inviting you right now to turn to him, to place your trust in him, to open up
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:30.960]   your life to him and say, "Lord, come into my life, work in my life, move in my life
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:35.680]   by your spirit, by your power because I need change.
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:38.760]   I need you to move, Holy Spirit.
[00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:43.600]   I need to know your love that was not shown to me.
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:48.600]   I need to find healing."
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:53.160]   So if that is you, I want to encourage you to stretch out your hands before you and I
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:57.040]   just want to pray over you right now.
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:04.600]   Jesus, I thank you so much for every single person here.
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:13.800]   Thank you that you are the God who works with messy and messed up people and messy families.
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:19.880]   That our mess is not the end point, but Lord Jesus, that you can come in, that you can
[00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:26.920]   turn chaos, you can turn something that is messy into something beautiful.
[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:31.560]   And Jesus, I thank you for every outstretched hand right now.
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:40.720]   I pray that by your Holy Spirit, you'd fill your people right now.
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:47.160]   That you would fill your people right now with your love, with your hope.
[00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:52.720]   And that as your word says that if anyone is in Christ Jesus, he is a new creation.
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:55.200]   The old is gone, the new has come.
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:58.540]   Lord, we declare this newness right now.
[00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:03.200]   That what this pattern in our families was, what this hurt was, the old is gone, the new
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:05.720]   has come.
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:07.800]   Thank you, Jesus.
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:11.040]   Thank you, Jesus.
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:15.280]   That you are the perfecter of our story.
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:20.600]   That with you, our story takes a turn and it turns beautiful because of who you are.
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:25.900]   Not because of us, not because of perfection, but because of your grace, because of forgiveness,
[00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:26.900]   because of your mercy.
[00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:32.280]   So Holy Spirit, will you pour out your mercy over us right now.
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:43.240]   We say we need you, we long for you, we desperately desire for you to work in our lives.
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:50.220]   And we trust and we believe that something has shifted now.
[00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:56.040]   That this is a fresh start, a new beginning.
[00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:59.600]   Jesus, we give you all the praise.
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:02.480]   So I pray this in the name of Jesus.
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:03.480]   Amen.
[00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:04.640]   Amen.
