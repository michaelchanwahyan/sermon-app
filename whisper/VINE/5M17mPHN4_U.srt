1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
 Well, thank you so much, Alison.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,760
 And I also want to thank the worship team, Waymaker.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,960
 Indeed, he's our waymaker and he continues to work.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,400
 That's actually in line with what we're going to share today, that God has a grand

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,500
 plan and he's constantly working.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:24,040
 So welcome once again and good morning to all of you and all those also watching us

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,040
 over online.

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:33,040
 Well, I will share a bit of my own story just to help us understand that God is indeed having

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,200
 a great and grand plan for each and every one of us.

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,440
 So by now you would recognize that I do have some Singapore accent.

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,640
 Well, I'm actually born and bred here in Hong Kong.

12
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,160
 I studied in local universities.

13
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,440
 I worked in one of the most busy hospitals here in Hong Kong for 10 years until I really

14
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,840
 got stuck professionally.

15
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:03,400
 I yearned for a breakthrough and we made a very difficult decision, a family of four.

16
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:08,160
 We actually decided to emigrate over to Singapore.

17
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:16,800
 And that was 27 years ago and to be exact, it is 1st of July, 1997.

18
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:25,640
 Whoa, anyway, we did fairly well over there as a family and as well as professionally.

19
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:31,460
 But most significantly was that I actually rededicated my life to Jesus.

20
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:38,720
 And my wife first came to know Jesus as personal Lord and Savior over there.

21
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,480
 So over there we enter into a new reality.

22
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:49,520
 Well, of course, it's a different location, but there's a new reality with a new identity.

23
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:56,200
 Now while we settled fairly well over there by God's grace and divine purposes, we actually

24
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,400
 got a chance to relocate back here to Hong Kong.

25
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:07,200
 So 10 years down the road, we moved back and here we are attending divine worshipping and

26
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,820
 I also got to serve in the Cantonese community as well as in the eldership.

27
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:19,220
 So over the years, as I reflect, God has been graceful and He has a great plan for me.

28
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:23,160
 We just celebrate our 60th birthday.

29
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,480
 Wow, I look too young.

30
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,800
 Yes, Botox works.

31
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:36,760
 Yeah, but I also realized that while the blessing actually extend to over the next generation,

32
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:43,080
 my daughter and my son-in-law, while they were here in the 9/15 service, so they tied

33
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:49,360
 their knots just a few months ago while they also planning to move over to London to start

34
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,280
 a new season.

35
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,680
 So I'm actually quite amazed that how come this wonderful young Chinese gentleman from

36
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:05,920
 Australia got to work here in Hong Kong and met my, well, also quite wonderful daughter.

37
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,280
 But the thing is, God has a grand plan for each and every one of us.

38
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:19,400
 In due time, He reveals His purposes in us and it's actually for us to give thanks to

39
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:26,480
 Him and even to praise Him for what He has done in our life in the past, in the present,

40
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,520
 and that would continue into the future.

41
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:36,800
 But that's what Paul wants to share with the congregation in Ephesians, that while

42
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,280
 indeed God is doing great and wonderful things.

43
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,320
 So let's read the Bible text for today.

44
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,200
 That's in chapter 1.

45
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,760
 Praise be to God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in the heavenly

46
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:58,400
 realms with every single spiritual blessing in Christ.

47
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:05,880
 For He chose us in Him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless.

48
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:15,640
 In love, He predestined us for adoption to sonship through Jesus Christ in accordance

49
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:22,360
 to His pleasure and will, to the praise of His glorious grace.

50
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:28,200
 In Him, we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins in accordance with

51
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:34,080
 the riches of God's grace that He lavished on us.

52
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,480
 With all wisdom and understanding, He made known to us the mystery of His will according

53
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:49,400
 to His goodwill and pleasure, which He purposed in Christ to be put into full effect when

54
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:57,320
 the times reach the fulfillment, to bring unity to all things in Christ for all things

55
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,000
 in heaven and on earth to be under Him.

56
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,520
 In Him, we were also chosen, predestined according to the plan of Him who works out everything

57
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:15,200
 in conformity with the purpose of His will in order that we, the first to put our hope

58
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:20,320
 in Christ, may be for the praise of His glory.

59
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:27,520
 And you also were included in Christ when you heard the gospel of your salvation, when

60
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:35,560
 you believed, you were marked with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit who is the deposit

61
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:44,080
 guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God's possession to the praise

62
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,080
 of His glory.

63
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:51,800
 So you can see purposes, goodwill, plans, all come from God.

64
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,800
 Well, indeed, it is a lengthy passage that really originates from one sentence in the

65
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,680
 original Greek.

66
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,680
 I'll share with you in the next 20 minutes or so three things.

67
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,320
 One, how God or what God has done in Christ.

68
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:17,000
 Number two, we try to find the distinction between in Christ versus Christ in us.

69
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,200
 And lastly, we talk about Christ being the head and that should bring comfort.

70
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:30,360
 Let's come back to verse one, verse 10, which is the core message.

71
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:36,800
 The whole passage is about spiritual blessings planned by the Father, accomplished by the

72
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,360
 Son and applied by the Holy Spirit.

73
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:48,400
 So indeed, it actually says, "Blessed is the God who bless us with every spiritual blessing."

74
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,640
 Heavenly blessings.

75
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,720
 But why a doxology?

76
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,840
 Doxology actually literally means glory.

77
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,080
 Okay, why a doxology up front?

78
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:03,880
 Well, many of us, pre-believers and believers included, wrongly assume that the reality

79
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:09,840
 is the physical world around which we feel, we touch, or we experience.

80
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,320
 Yet, the doxology asserts that the reality is much, much bigger.

81
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:22,960
 It includes God, his actions, and what takes place in Christ and in the heavenly realms.

82
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,920
 We must expand our thinking to do justice to this larger reality.

83
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:35,000
 Because in our contemporary practice, we view ourselves as the primary actor on the stage

84
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,720
 of history.

85
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,920
 But Paul's doxology reminded that God is the primary actor.

86
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:48,200
 Just the other day, a few of the fellow elders went to visit a church member and pray for

87
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,480
 God's healing.

88
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:56,080
 And that is beyond what the doctors may say and mention about his physical reality and

89
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,080
 challenges.

90
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:04,320
 We must see the bigger reality of God's grand plan for this individual and for each and

91
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,840
 every one of us.

92
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,880
 Now paradoxically, I actually worked in the medical line.

93
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:17,240
 And more often than not, I actually would slip into the mode of viewing myself as the

94
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,880
 healer.

95
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,520
 I have neglected the bigger reality.

96
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:29,920
 The bigger reality is that I'm only there to manage or to treat certain medical conditions.

97
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,640
 Ultimately, only God heals.

98
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,760
 And that is the bigger reality.

99
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,640
 In Christ, well, let's zoom in a bit more to the prominent theme in this passage, "In

100
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,640
 Christ."

101
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:53,600
 The expression "In Christ, in the Lord, in Him" appear 164 times in Paul's writing.

102
00:08:53,600 --> 00:09:00,480
 Paul's writing really flows from his understanding of how we are to be connected and unified

103
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,480
 with him.

104
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:08,720
 So we can read from this passage, "We enjoy every spiritual blessing in Christ.

105
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,600
 We are chosen in Him and adopted through Him.

106
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:21,520
 Everything is accomplished in Him as the revelation of the mystery of His will so that God's purpose

107
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,400
 is to unite all things in Him.

108
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:33,800
 We enjoy an inheritance in Him and also we are sealed with the Spirit in Him."

109
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:40,480
 Among all the possible other meanings or translations, let us concentrate on the key understanding

110
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,400
 of "In Christ" in this context.

111
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:48,160
 It's more what we call a location, a location sense.

112
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:55,800
 We think of Christ, the location, as the vast repository or treasury holding the gifts of

113
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,460
 God.

114
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:01,160
 And Christ is the source of all these ritual blessings.

115
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:06,460
 And while we reside in Him, we enjoy all these blessings.

116
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:13,100
 And mind you, our individuality is not lost when we are fully in Christ.

117
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:19,400
 It is not some Eastern religious thought of absorption into the deity.

118
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:27,920
 Rather, Christ and we abide in the unity whereby Christ sets the parameters for life and makes

119
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,640
 available God's provision for life.

120
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,420
 What are the implications of our being in Christ?

121
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:44,260
 When we are in Christ, we are united with Him and participate in His death, resurrection,

122
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,260
 and life.

123
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:52,700
 Now, this interplay of death and life is dynamic and I would say is mind-blogging.

124
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:59,020
 Let me illustrate by citing a not too uncommon scenario, chemotherapy.

125
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,020
 How it works?

126
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:07,060
 Now, the toxic chemotherapy would literally kill the cancer cells and part of it, well,

127
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:12,260
 part of the individual who received the chemotherapy also dies in some extent.

128
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:16,540
 Well, that is how exactly new life begins.

129
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:22,900
 The normal regenerate cell would begin to repopulate and replace all that which was

130
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,220
 lost.

131
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:29,780
 The chemotherapy concept applies to various cancers and many a times the chemotherapy

132
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:34,860
 is actually designed with what we call an intent to cure.

133
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,980
 That means we can cure a person from this disease.

134
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:46,660
 That purposeful death and renewal concept is particularly true for some blood-borne

135
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,540
 cancer or we call it leukemia.

136
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:56,140
 Now, I have this understanding as a personal first-hand experience.

137
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:03,380
 Now, for all of you here, if you do your health check, your blood count, your white cell count

138
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,380
 will be somewhere like 5 to 10.

139
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,660
 That is normal.

140
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:20,180
 My cell count as my leukemia progressed went up to 100, 150 and I panicked.

141
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,220
 I thought about death.

142
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:30,260
 Well, I bite the bullet and go ahead with the chemotherapy and specifically it is what

143
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,620
 we call a targeted therapy.

144
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:42,340
 The day of the treatment, I was so ill, so sick, I literally thought I was going to die.

145
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:49,900
 In fact, my cell count dropped to the level of below 1 on day 1 post-treatment which was

146
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:56,780
 dangerously low to the extent that my oncologist has to stop all the scheduled treatment altogether

147
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:02,700
 so that I will be allowed time to recover for the cell to replenish.

148
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:10,860
 And thereafter, in a sense, I died and I died again as I received multiple causes of the

149
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,260
 same treatment along the way.

150
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,780
 That was almost 7 or 8 years ago.

151
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:27,220
 I lost count but I'm happy to share with all of you that I am treatment-free and I'm disease-free.

152
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:32,580
 New life has crept into my life even as part of me died.

153
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:39,540
 Just remember his death is our death and his life is also our life.

154
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:49,340
 It is in this solidarity achieved by a double identification via the incarnation and faith.

155
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,340
 What it means?

156
00:13:50,340 --> 00:14:02,420
 In incarnation, Christ identifies with us and by faith, we respond and we identify with

157
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,660
 him.

158
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:11,580
 To be in Christ does not mean to be inside Christ as tools are in a box or clothes are

159
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:18,780
 in a closet but rather we are organically united to Christ as a limb is in the body

160
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,980
 or a branch is in the tree.

161
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,260
 We are all familiar with this.

162
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:28,740
 Christ, I am the vine, you are the branches.

163
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:35,100
 If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit.

164
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,200
 You will bear much fruit.

165
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:44,660
 It is this personal relationship with Christ that is the distinctive hallmark of his authentic

166
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,100
 followers.

167
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:54,080
 As we live in Christ, our awareness of the presence of God and of living in Christ becomes

168
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,760
 the keys to all aspects of our life.

169
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,700
 How strange would it be if we are to forget the place that we live?

170
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:08,740
 We lived in different places here in Hong Kong over the 16 years we are back here and

171
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:16,140
 my wife Vivian is superbly efficient in arranging for every time that we move house.

172
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:22,100
 I had the experience of actually for a number of times that I left home in the morning,

173
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:28,540
 went to work, then when I left work I go to a new place, new house altogether.

174
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:33,780
 I just need to be reminded, well, you are to move to a new place.

175
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:42,660
 Well we need to be reminded because for in him we live and move and have our being.

176
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:50,660
 I do want to highlight some important distinction between the notion Christ in us and we in

177
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,620
 Christ.

178
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:58,780
 We often find comfort and indeed we should find the comfort as we embrace that Christ

179
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,580
 is in us.

180
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:05,940
 His presence and his company should be reassuring.

181
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:14,700
 However, when we only emphasise that Christ is in us, there may be a danger that we become

182
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,300
 me-focused.

183
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:25,720
 We try to identify or define reality and Christ would be about one inch tall.

184
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:31,900
 On the other hand, if we realise that we are in Christ or under Christ, he determines reality

185
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:37,020
 and he encompasses all that we are.

186
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:43,820
 Indeed some of us might struggle with too much of a focus that Christ is in us.

187
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:51,820
 Therefore having that danger of Christ almost submitting to our will, our control, as if

188
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:56,980
 Christ is only there to meet our own needs.

189
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:03,780
 On the other hand, if we have a distorted understanding of being in Christ, then we

190
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:08,660
 might think well we need to do nothing more than whatever he has already done.

191
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:15,620
 We take for granted all that he has done for us and we live in a passive way in this world.

192
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:21,860
 Well both dangers are common in the church and perhaps you have experienced one way or

193
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,020
 the other.

194
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,940
 I know I have.

195
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:30,500
 Let me share my story to illustrate the distinction.

196
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,340
 Christ in me or me in Christ.

197
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:37,500
 I mentioned that I decided to move or relocate back here to Hong Kong.

198
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:43,060
 It was largely due to an offer to take up a leading academic position in one of the

199
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:46,420
 local universities.

200
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:53,260
 Personally it is a major career advancement and I really had that dream of leaving a legacy

201
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:57,260
 professionally to be remembered.

202
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,060
 We did not take this offer lightly.

203
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:03,660
 We did all the good things that a good Christian is supposed to do.

204
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:07,300
 We prayed, we discerned, we shared, we waited.

205
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:12,300
 It was quite some time before we finally took up the offer.

206
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:16,460
 I was confident that Christ was in me and with me.

207
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:23,820
 I was also committed that I would bring his presence to the workplace.

208
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:31,460
 But my honest reflection and confession was that the focus was still me.

209
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,900
 Those few years working back in Hong Kong were most challenging.

210
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:40,980
 Not that I didn't anticipate all those challenges in the first place.

211
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:49,460
 As it turned out, probably partly due to my shortcomings, I did not secure the tenural

212
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,460
 position.

213
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,500
 I lost my job.

214
00:18:54,500 --> 00:19:00,740
 I had to leave the prestigious position and the title and I have to journey on in the

215
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:07,380
 private practice setting, starting all over again.

216
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,020
 It's painful.

217
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:14,580
 My dream died.

218
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:21,420
 But then I realized Jesus' dream for me is alive and vibrant.

219
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:25,060
 His dream is alive and vibrant.

220
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:29,500
 I come to understand I am in a bigger than myself reality.

221
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,940
 I am in Christ.

222
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:39,060
 For in him we live and move and have our being.

223
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:44,980
 First and foremost, I would say I'm really proud that I was once part of a team and that

224
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:51,900
 they have since ascended to even greater heights professionally and academically.

225
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:59,500
 But for myself, that I'm in private practice allows me a lot of more time and space to

226
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:04,100
 ponder on, well, how I can serve him better.

227
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:11,460
 And that is not necessarily via my profession nor the title that I bear.

228
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:19,420
 Rather, I am in Christ and therefore he should dictate how best to entrust me in whatever

229
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:23,460
 arena or circumstances.

230
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:28,220
 So I had the inspiration from my wife, who actually finished her seminary studies in

231
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:32,900
 her 50s, and I thought, well, I could do likewise.

232
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:40,180
 So I completed my part-time seminary studies while I was in full-time medical practice.

233
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:45,580
 That was despite the health care challenge of having to go through multiple courses of

234
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:49,020
 chemotherapy.

235
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:57,940
 Studying in the seminary teach me to humble, that there is far more that I do not know

236
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:02,100
 than the very little that I study and got to know.

237
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:08,980
 And that stirred up my yearning to know him more.

238
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:15,940
 On serving, I had the joy of serving the Cantonese community, which again had a humble beginning.

239
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:20,580
 We started as one of the earliest Cantonese-speaking small groups.

240
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,940
 That was 10 years ago.

241
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,020
 We started at home, but it soon burst.

242
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:28,580
 God blessed the community tremendously.

243
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:34,660
 We moved back to the premise in this church building, and it continued to grow into a

244
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,940
 Chinese ministry.

245
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:44,780
 Along the way, we also, this church saw the birth of a Mandarin-speaking community.

246
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:50,340
 Now the very little Mandarin that we picked up when we were attending church in Singapore

247
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:58,500
 became useful and handy because we were able to reach out to others, especially those who

248
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,500
 are Mandarin-speaking.

249
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:06,660
 So, in that sense, God prepared us, or this church, to reach out to others in interesting

250
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,580
 and creative ways.

251
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:17,260
 Of course, I'm also proud and had the privilege to serve with a wonderful bunch of elders

252
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:21,580
 in this church in the past nine years.

253
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:29,700
 Going through firsthand the tremendous ups and downs for this church, we went through

254
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:38,060
 all the trials and triumphs together, including during the social movement period and the

255
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,900
 COVID restriction.

256
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:46,780
 But we are thankful, thankful to you because you gave generously and faithfully through

257
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:50,020
 the difficult times.

258
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:55,940
 And we are so encouraged because you make every single effort to come and worship and

259
00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:00,340
 to gather in this place.

260
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:07,460
 We can testify the great purpose of God, including his seeing us through the tremendous hurdles

261
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:12,700
 of setting up the Yuen Long Church Plant.

262
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:17,620
 Now I'm not recounting all this as Christ in me.

263
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:24,580
 It's not about me, but rather as an individual in this congregation.

264
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:31,860
 I witnessed the hands of God moving amongst us, all of us.

265
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:38,140
 And this is only a mini account of the many good things God is working in this church

266
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:44,460
 through the many of you seated here today to serve and love each other in your small

267
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:55,700
 groups, in your K4C classes, in the language ministries, in the prayer team, in alpha,

268
00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:02,620
 in worship team, in your outreach efforts, in your smile when you meet someone in this

269
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:11,580
 congregation and in your hard work up front or behind the scenes.

270
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:17,060
 There are people who begin to ask me how I would like to serve as I step down from the

271
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:20,380
 eldership board later this year.

272
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,380
 Good question.

273
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,940
 Lots of wrestling.

274
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:26,740
 Well, but I believe the best is yet to be.

275
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:29,500
 Well, no solid answer yet.

276
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:36,860
 However, I will say on behalf of my fellow elders that they are committed to serve all

277
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:42,300
 of you diligently in days and years to come.

278
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:46,700
 But actually each and every one of us should be asking these questions.

279
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:54,780
 How we can best serve our God and how God wants His best for this church and how He

280
00:24:54,780 --> 00:25:00,260
 wants to entrust each and every one of us here.

281
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:08,700
 I do have a glimpse of the possible future for this church, that each congregant here

282
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:19,580
 is called into a community intimately rooted in His Word and in Him and ever ready to reach

283
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,780
 out to others.

284
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:31,180
 Well, after all, God's plan for us remains a mystery but will be revealed in the fulfillment

285
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,500
 of times.

286
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:41,940
 Indeed, verse 10 says, "It would be put into effect when the times reached their fulfillment

287
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:50,220
 to bring unity to all things in heaven and on earth under Christ."

288
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:56,820
 Note that Paul actually expands this use of language to a cosmic scale.

289
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:06,740
 Everything, creation and redemption of the cosmos is to be in Christ, under Christ.

290
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:14,380
 The word translated as "bring unity" is interesting, "grit rith anna kafalio."

291
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,900
 Kafali means the head.

292
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:23,740
 Okay, so we have medical conditions like micro-cavillous, very small brain, with hydro-cavillous,

293
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,740
 water-filled up brain.

294
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:29,140
 But it's a different head we are talking about.

295
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:34,780
 It's the majestic, royal head, Christ in the heavenlies.

296
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:39,740
 So it is significant because it emphasizes on three things.

297
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:44,380
 One, Christ is the head, the ruler.

298
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:51,340
 Christ sums up or brings things to a coherent and meaningful whole.

299
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:59,380
 And number three, Christ restores harmony to a universe that was chaotic because of

300
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,300
 sin.

301
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,140
 So what would be the implication?

302
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:10,100
 Now we have fellowship not only with God but also with one another.

303
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:15,580
 Horizontally, Christ connects God and the church here.

304
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:23,900
 Horizontally, Christ connects all of us, even those who come from diverse social economic

305
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,980
 backgrounds.

306
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:31,500
 Christ is ruling over us.

307
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:37,140
 His fulfillment has begun through his life, death, and resurrection.

308
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:44,940
 He's already Lord of all times, just as redemption is both now, present, and future.

309
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:52,940
 And yet the future has moved into the present and changes how we should live.

310
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:59,060
 I do understand sometimes we doubt because we do not see obvious actions from him.

311
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:03,540
 And then we wrongly assume that God is not active.

312
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:08,220
 Well God is not necessarily public in all his actions.

313
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:14,740
 But surely God does reveal himself in his own time.

314
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:20,080
 He's active in making his purposes in Christ known.

315
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:26,580
 So we almost need a sign that reads, "Slow down, God is at work."

316
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,180
 "Slow down, God is at work."

317
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:39,140
 This should be comforting because Christ is supreme over everything in this world.

318
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:47,340
 This could speak to our fears for the future or worries that we hold for the present.

319
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:52,940
 It should help us freed from the oppression or the opposition that we are facing.

320
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:56,140
 We have Jesus who is head over everything.

321
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:59,140
 Therefore we have peace in our present.

322
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:06,540
 I really love the school motto of my son when he studied in Anglo-Chinese school in Singapore.

323
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:13,260
 The motto is, "The best is yet to be."

324
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:16,860
 The best is yet to be.

325
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:23,660
 As my son-in-law and my daughter about to plan to move to the UK in just two weeks'

326
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:29,900
 time, well my encouragement for them is, "The best is yet to be."

327
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:36,100
 But they are to discover for themselves the bigger reality of God's grand plan in their

328
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,100
 life.

329
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:46,540
 Likewise, young men, young women, and indeed everyone in this congregation, we are assured

330
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:51,700
 and promised that the best is yet to be.

331
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:56,620
 However, for this church, planting a church in Yuen Long or growing in numbers here in

332
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:04,340
 Wan Chai are not by themselves the ultimate fulfillment of God's purposes for the vine.

333
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:13,180
 There is a bigger reality, but His grand plan for this church will continue to unfold.

334
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:19,460
 So I paraphrase the whole prayer in this biblical text by Paul.

335
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:24,820
 I would like to invite all of us to stand so that we may read this prayer together in

336
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:28,820
 a paraphrased manner.

337
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:35,940
 So we shall see on the screen the prayer that I wrote, "How Marvelous God is."

338
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:39,220
 And let us read together.

339
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:45,300
 His Spirit has provided everything needed for life and for the vine.

340
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,940
 For every good thing has been made available in Christ.

341
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:51,300
 We praise such a God.

342
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:57,820
 Right from the first, God has been busy devising a way to draw us home to Himself so that we

343
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:00,780
 may live with Him and for Him.

344
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:04,180
 Through Jesus Christ, He has made us family.

345
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:11,820
 As a result, the vine prays God for the way He freely gave Himself to us in Christ.

346
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:16,740
 In Christ's death, God's abundant care for us is known.

347
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:21,980
 God gave Himself for us to bring us back and make us His people.

348
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,940
 What lavish love He has for us.

349
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:27,220
 We honor you, God.

350
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:34,600
 In His unfathomable wisdom, God has made known His plan and desire to bring all things together

351
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,600
 in Christ.

352
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:41,140
 This includes everything in our world and everything in God's world.

353
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:47,620
 Amazingly, God's plan includes the vine and gives us a share of what He is doing.

354
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:53,380
 For this, the vine prays God for the hope that is ours in Christ.

355
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:58,820
 When we heard about the truth from God and believe the good news about His plan, God

356
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:02,900
 marked us as His own by giving us His Spirit.

357
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:09,060
 The Spirit dwelling in us is a pledge from God that He will complete His plan and that

358
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:12,820
 one day we will truly live with God.

359
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:18,660
 For this, we, the vine, praise you, our God, we do worship you.

360
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:21,540
 May I invite the band?

361
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:26,260
 And I want to challenge all of us while I give you this encouragement.

362
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:31,820
 And in a short moment's time, you're most encouraged to join us in a prayer line as

363
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,980
 you commit yourself.

364
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:45,200
 Number one, we all have a dual identity on earth and in heaven, which is the bigger reality.

365
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:51,260
 You might be from local or you may be from a foreign land.

366
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:58,260
 Dare to believe that you are here in Hong Kong in this season as part of God's grand

367
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:05,500
 plan for Hong Kong and you matter to Him.

368
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:11,660
 You might be born and bred from the ministry of this church or you have moved in from other

369
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:17,420
 congregation to try to settle here in the vine.

370
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:23,860
 Dare to believe that you are part of God's grand plan in this church.

371
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,780
 You matter to us.

372
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:37,300
 Last, allow His comforting presence to rest in you always as indeed He is in you.

373
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:43,300
 But also be mindful that He encompasses all that we are.

374
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:47,580
 We are in Christ and under Christ.

375
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:56,220
 Let Him take lead in your life and that His dream becomes your dream.

376
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:59,660
 Be truly blessed by our blessed, worthy God.

377
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,660
 Amen.

378
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,660
 Amen.

379
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:01,660
 Amen.

380
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:04,080
 (soft music)

381
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,660
 (gentle music)
