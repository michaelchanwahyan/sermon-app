1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:07,000
 Everyone says, "Amen." Hey, can we thank our worship team as always?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Why don't you have a seat? Have a seat.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 [Music]

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Right. Half of you in here know exactly what that's all about.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 The other half of you have no idea what's going on.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 I'm in that second group who has no idea what's going on.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 We're starting an amazing new series here called Blowing Water.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 It's a series that's been birthed and shaped by Pastor Ellison

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 as he's prayed over us as a church and wondered what the summer is going to be like.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 We're so excited that he's here today to open up the series for us.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Can we put our hands together as we welcome Ellison?

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Hi.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Hi, bud.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Let's stretch out our hands and let's pray.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Father, we thank you for Ellison, for Brittany, for Isaiah, for Malachi,

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 for this family that you've blessed this church with for many years now.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Father, thank you for just Ellison's heart, his passion to communicate the gospel

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 in ways that are challenging and yet hopeful,

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 and for the way in which you've put this series on his heart for the summer

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 where we look at the conversations that Jesus had with lots of different types of people.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Father, as he opens up this word, Lord, we pray for that fertile soil in our hearts,

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 that we would hear your word, Lord, that you'd speak to us and shape us and mold us

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 into the people that you desire us to be.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Father, we thank you so much for this, and we pray this in Jesus' name.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Everyone says amen.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Amen. Thank you, Andrew. Thank you, team.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Good morning, everybody.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Good morning to those of you joining us online.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 So, as Andrew said, over the past couple of months, we've been walking through Exodus as a journey.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 We've been visiting Egypt through film, seeing all the sites,

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 and learned about how God has powerfully been moving his people in his rescue plan,

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 out of slavery into freedom.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 If you've missed some of those messages, I encourage you to go back to YouTube,

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 look them up, get caught up so you can start back together with us

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 when we start back later this summer.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 But for the coming weeks, as Andrew said, we're going to be entering into a new series.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 So we're taking a break from Exodus, so you can think of it as like Exodus season one is over.

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 There's a little hiatus. Season two is coming soon.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 But today, we're stepping into our new summer sermon series.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 We're calling this series Blowing Water, as you see in Chou Sui,

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 probably the most Hong Kong title you could give a sermon series.

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 But let me explain to you why.

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Blowing Water is a direct translation for the Cantonese slang phrase, "chou sui."

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 To "chou sui" or to "blow water" means to have a chit-chat or conversation with someone.

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 For example, this morning, as I was stopped by at 7-Eleven, I got caught.

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 I was late to work because the guy was trying to talk to me about my YUU points.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 And we got on this whole thing about, you know,

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 "Li koi yi yong chun ba da tong," and all this kind of stuff.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Link your YUU account to your Octopus card, and you don't have to put out your...

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 It was like a 10-minute conversation about YUU.

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 But yeah, that was a conversation.

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Or maybe when you ride in a taxi or go to the market,

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 whoever it is that you encounter, if you stop for a minute to have a chat,

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 you can say, "Lei tong ga dei chui ha sui," right?

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 Imagine like saliva being blown at your mouth.

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 It's kind of gross, I know, okay?

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 I think that's the idea.

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 But a little while ago, I got a random message from a unknown number.

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 We've all been getting these a lot recently, right?

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 And the way this person started the conversation was,

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 "Hi, hai wo, yong mo shi gan chui ha sui?"

62
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 "Hey, it's me. Do you have time for a chat?"

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Now, my curiosity peaked.

64
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Because most normal people, most normal people would have said to themselves,

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 "Don't know this number, right? Spam, report, block, move on," okay?

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Most normal people.

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 I, however, was on a long bus ride home.

68
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 I had all the time in the world, right?

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 So I decided to engage.

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 I decided to reply to see where this conversation would go.

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 "Oh, hi, sorry. Who are you?"

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 And then the guy replied, "Oh, it's me, Walson. Aunty Chan's son."

73
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 "Oh, yeah, I remember, Walson. Yeah, yeah, yeah. How are you?"

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Right, and so for the next 45 minutes, actually, in fact, for the next couple of weeks,

75
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 it started to get a bit weird, so I stopped, okay?

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 But I pretended to be Jenny, okay?

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 A middle-aged sales lady who recently had her heart broken

78
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 because my pet cat just died.

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 My boyfriend broke up with me. I didn't know what to do with my life, right?

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 And it turned into this really fascinating conversation, okay?

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 If you look through messages, it's weird, okay?

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 But he was trying to be kind this whole time.

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 He was trying to be comforting, a little bit creepy.

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 But I knew where this was heading, right?

85
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 This was heading towards him asking me for money, right?

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 This was a scammer, right?

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 They're trying to use this conversation to build trust,

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 to build a relationship.

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 In the end, they probably asked for money or credit card, something like that.

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 Now, if you look in the news lately, right,

91
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 so many stories about people being duped or tricked, swindled, and convinced

92
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 out of large amounts of money precisely because of conversations

93
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 like the one I had with Walson, right?

94
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 Over $1 billion have been lost through scams, apparently.

95
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 And make me think, why?

96
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 Well, I think it's because conversations are powerful, right?

97
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 We crave connection through conversation.

98
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 In fact, I would say conversations are essential in how we build relationships

99
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 with each other.

100
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 Conversations have the ability to stir our emotions, to comfort us,

101
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 to make us weep, to make us laugh, to motivate us to do good or to do bad.

102
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 And this is why these scams work so well, simply because these people

103
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 are good at conversing, right?

104
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 They're so compelling.

105
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Think back to some conversations you might have had.

106
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 Maybe sadly you've been a victim of one of these scams and you've lost money

107
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 and lost other resources because of this.

108
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 Maybe it's a tough conversation you had with your boss.

109
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 Maybe it was bringing bad news to someone that you loved.

110
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 Or maybe it's staying on the phone with your crush till 3 AM saying,

111
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 "You hang up. No, you hang up. No, you hang up."

112
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 I'm looking at you, Bernice.

113
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 My conversation is this, right?

114
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 The right conversation can leave a deep impact and maybe even change

115
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 our lives altogether.

116
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 Right?

117
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 One of the most memorable, impactful conversations that comes to mind

118
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 was when I called my wife, Brittany, when I called her mom to ask

119
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 for her permission to ask if I could propose to her daughter, right?

120
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 It was through the phone because she lives in the US, but my hands were shaky,

121
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 my palms were setting.

122
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 I remember stumbling over my words, and in the end, she gave me the blessing.

123
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 Now I think about it really quickly for some reason, okay?

124
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 But that conversation has had an impact on my life for the rest of my life.

125
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 So this made me think also, "Well, who is it that's the master of conversation?

126
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Who left people wondering where did this person receive their power, wisdom,

127
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 and authority from every time after talking to them?

128
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Who was the person that could literally set people free from the suffering

129
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 with just the power of his words?"

130
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 This, of course, is Jesus.

131
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 And so over the coming weeks, we're going to be looking at conversations

132
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 Jesus had with different people.

133
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 And as we look at these conversations, hopefully what we will find is some

134
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 new and fresh perspectives.

135
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 We draw out truths and insights you may not have noticed before.

136
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 And I hope that with each conversation we look at, we'll also hear Jesus speak

137
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 to our doubts, our fears, our failings, our sorrows, our setbacks,

138
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 our insecurities, and challenge us to live a life more in line with his purposes.

139
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 At the same time, by examining these dialogues, I hope that we can learn

140
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 to engage in authentic life-altering conversations with those around us

141
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 that lead people and point people to where Jesus is.

142
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 Because one thing's for sure, everyone who spoke with Jesus left forever changed.

143
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 And so when we too are motivated by the love of Jesus, the power of God,

144
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, our conversations too can have the same

145
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 impact as those around us.

146
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 So we're going to start in John 8.

147
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 It says this, "But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.

148
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts where all the people gathered

149
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 around him, and he sat down to teach them.

150
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery.

151
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 They made her stand before the group and said to Jesus, 'Teacher,

152
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 this woman was caught in the act of adultery.

153
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 In the law, Moses commanded us to stone such woman.

154
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 Now what do you say?'"

155
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 They were using this as a trap in order to have a basis for accusing him.

156
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 "But Jesus went down and started to write on the ground with his finger.

157
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them,

158
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 'Let one who is without sin be the first to throw the stone at her.'

159
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground, 'And at this,

160
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 those who heard began to walk away one at a time,

161
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 the older ones first until only Jesus was left.'

162
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 With the woman still standing there, Jesus straightened up and asked her,

163
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 'Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?'

164
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 'No one, sir,' she said. 'Then neither do I condemn you,' Jesus declared.

165
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 'Go now and leave your life of sin.'"

166
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 This is a very well-known story in the New Testament.

167
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 However, if you read it in your Bible, you might see there's a little side note.

168
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 The problem is that in some early manuscripts of what we have as the Scriptures right now,

169
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 this story isn't present in there.

170
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 Scholars think it's a bit out of place. It doesn't fit in with the context before and after.

171
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 Without going into too much detail, though, the general consensus is that

172
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 even if those problems exist, we can still trust that it's an accurate account,

173
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 reliable enough for us to study and to preach on.

174
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 And if you really want to get into asking more questions about the scholarliness of the Ovilette,

175
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 send me an email. I'll forward it to Andrew, and he can tell you all about it, okay?

176
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 So let's go back to the passage and take a deeper look.

177
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 Verse 2, "At dawn, He appeared again in the temple court,

178
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 where all the people were gathered around Him, and He sat down to teach them."

179
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 And often when we think about Jesus' ministry, we think about the things He did.

180
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 The miracles, walking on water, feeding the 5,000, healing the sick, turning water into wine.

181
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 There's a lot going on in the life and activity of Jesus.

182
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 But when we look at the book of John specifically,

183
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 the focus isn't so much on Jesus' actions and His activities, but rather it's Jesus' words.

184
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 Right? Not surprising, since the book of John starts by describing Jesus as "the Word becoming flesh."

185
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 So here we have Jesus sitting in the court, using His words to teach a group of people around Him,

186
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 a common occurrence through the Gospels.

187
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 It tells us all the people were gathered around Him.

188
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 The fact is that Jesus was attracting a crowd of all sorts of people, maybe a bit like this right now.

189
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 This is important to take a note of, because it meant that Jesus' popularity was rising,

190
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 much to the anger, of course, of the religious authorities at the time.

191
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 In fact, by this time in His ministry, there were already people trying to kill Jesus

192
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 because of the things He was saying and teaching.

193
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 He was saying things like, "I am the bread of life that came down from heaven.

194
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 He who comes to me will never go hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty."

195
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 So to them, this was blasphemy.

196
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 How dare Jesus say words like this?

197
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 How dare He claim Himself to be God?

198
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Jesus, however, continued to meet and teach in public in order to declare the truth of who He was,

199
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 who His Father was, what He came here to do, despite the threats that He was receiving.

200
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 One thing that hopefully you will notice throughout the series is that the reason why Jesus was so impactful

201
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 in His conversations He has with people is because He is always fully confident

202
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 and fully obedient in His calling and His identity.

203
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 He never wavers when He's challenged.

204
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 He doesn't back down even if people are threatening Him, even if they're threatening to kill Him.

205
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 At the same time, though, He isn't arrogant or self-righteous.

206
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 He simply stands firm on the foundation of truth.

207
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 So this made me think, "What about the conversations I have with people about Jesus?

208
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 Am I always able to stand firm in my belief of Him as my Savior?"

209
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 It's hard to do sometimes because talking about Jesus and the things He did sounds weird, right?

210
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 Some of the things He did are almost--I mean, they sound unbelievable.

211
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 And so either I avoid talking about Him because I don't want to face those sort of difficult and weird conversations,

212
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 or when I get challenged about it, I start to be shy and I start to waver, change the topic, or something like that.

213
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 Ask yourself this question this morning.

214
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 Is my life, are my convictions built upon the foundation of Jesus?

215
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 Because if they're not, then every time we're challenged about Him,

216
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 every time we are asked a difficult question, we might buckle.

217
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 We might sway to the left or to the right.

218
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 We may give in to people's fears, and that never leaves much room for a good conversation.

219
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 Church, the first challenge this morning is to be confident in our faith

220
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 because if not, our conversations will never display a living faith.

221
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 We cannot communicate something that's not first inside of us.

222
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 Therefore, if we want to have conversations about Jesus, we must be strongly rooted in our love and our belief of Him.

223
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 So Jesus is there.

224
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 He's teaching the crowds when He is dramatically and rudely interrupted.

225
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 It says, "The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery.

226
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 We had her stand before the group and said to Jesus, 'Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery.

227
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 In the law, Moses commanded us to stone such woman.

228
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 Now, what do you say?'"

229
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 Being interrupted is really annoying, right?

230
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 If I was Jesus, I'd be mad.

231
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 Being interrupted, it's just--it's frustrating, it's annoying.

232
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 Maybe if you have young children or toddlers, you understand what I'm saying, right?

233
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 My son, Isaiah, sweetest kid, will not shut up, okay?

234
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 Especially when I'm doing something, okay?

235
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 I could be in the middle of doing nothing, sitting down, you know, minding my own business.

236
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 The moment I try to talk on the phone or I want to talk with Brittany, he starts bombarding me with questions, right?

237
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 "Hey, dada, can elephant roll down hills?"

238
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 "Hey, dada, can you build a long train track with me?"

239
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 "Hey, dada, hey, dada, hey, dada, why didn't you talk to me two minutes ago?"

240
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 Anyway, so here's Jesus teaching when He's suddenly interrupted.

241
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 What's His reaction going to be?

242
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 I think the way Jesus handles Himself here proves some good groundwork for the way we can approach situations like this in our conversations.

243
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 As we're about to discover, even though the situation was loud and tense and complicated, very shocking,

244
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 Jesus stays calm and confident.

245
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 They bring this woman caught in adultery.

246
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 They make her stand before the group.

247
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Now, let's take a sidestep for a moment and just put yourself in the position of this woman.

248
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 Imagine what she must have been feeling.

249
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 Right, firstly, the fact that she was caught in the act of adultery would probably be embarrassing enough.

250
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 Then she's forcibly brought before a group of strangers, publicly shamed with a sin laid bare for everyone to know about what she just did.

251
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 It would have been terrifying.

252
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Imagine that happening to you right now.

253
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 When I read this passage, though, it reminded me of another time when Jesus was teaching and He was interrupted.

254
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 This is almost the same situation but with some big differences.

255
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 A group of men drag a friend in front of Jesus.

256
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 Jesus is teaching in this house when suddenly the roof is ripped open and four friends lower a paralytic man down before the feet of Jesus.

257
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 And he's interrupted again in the middle of His teaching.

258
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 But in this situation, Jesus notices the faith of these men.

259
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 And He heals the paralytic man so he could walk again.

260
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 The motivations of these men was full of hope and full of faith.

261
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 Right, they knew of Jesus' reputation as someone who was kind and compassionate and forgiving.

262
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 And they thought, "If only we bring our friend before Jesus, then He'll be able to heal him."

263
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 But in this situation, the circumstances are almost like same, same but different, right?

264
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 The Pharisees may not have brought this woman, right?

265
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 She might not have been physically sick, but she needed help nonetheless.

266
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 But their motivations in bringing her to Jesus were not to seek for her healing, for her forgiveness.

267
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 It's clear that these men were out for blood.

268
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 I mean, they already announced a death sentence over her.

269
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 They were not interested in redemption.

270
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 They were looking at an opportunity for condemnation.

271
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 But what's even more than this is that actually John tells us this situation was a double-edged sword

272
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 because the Pharisees were really just using this woman to get to Jesus.

273
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 I mean, if this was really about the law and about being zealous about punishing this woman,

274
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 this was something that could actually have been probably handled in private, right?

275
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 They could have brought her in without anybody else around and just dealt with it themselves.

276
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 If this was really addressing about the sin of adultery, then where was the man in this situation?

277
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 Shouldn't he have been brought before the people as well?

278
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 It takes two people to do something like this.

279
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 And so the fact that the man is not presently doing this publicly

280
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 is just further proof that this whole scene was simply a setup.

281
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 The woman was something they were willing to use and to abuse in order to catch Jesus.

282
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 It tells us this very clearly.

283
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 They were using this question as a trap in order to have a basis for accusing him.

284
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 Well, accuse him of what?

285
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Well, from their perspective, they have Jesus perfectly between a rock and a hard place.

286
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 It's because they know of Jesus'--like we said just now,

287
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 he has a reputation for being kind and compassionate and forgiving.

288
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 They were wanting to use this against him.

289
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 They're probably thinking Jesus was going to say something like, "Hey, fellas, okay, okay, come on now.

290
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 You know what I'm about. I'm about peace and love and forgiveness.

291
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 Why don't we just let her go? Let her be free."

292
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 If Jesus had said something like that, then they would have been able to accuse him

293
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 of directly going against God's law, calling him a blasphemer,

294
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 and that he too should be punished with death as well.

295
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 On the other hand, if Jesus had said something like, "Yes, you guys are right.

296
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 This is what the law says. She is condemned to death.

297
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Come on, guys, let's go and stone her,"

298
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 then his reputation for being kind and loving and compassionate would have been ruined.

299
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 And in addition to this, the Pharisees could then accuse him of revolting against the Roman government

300
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 because technically speaking, they were the only ones that were able to hand out death sentences to people.

301
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 But these religious leaders have got it twisted.

302
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 They've missed the point.

303
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 They've taken the ideas of justice and mercy and pitched them against each other as enemies.

304
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 And ironically, they failed to realize that the true definition of justice and mercy

305
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 was standing right before them.

306
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 These religious leaders were carrying the attitude of what Jesus was talking about in Matthew 23,

307
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 where they shut the door of the kingdom of heaven in people's faces.

308
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 They've neglected the more important matters of the law, justice, mercy, and faithfulness.

309
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 And church, this is a reminder this morning for us too.

310
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 The story of the woman probes our own reflexes towards people who do not fit in into our expectations.

311
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 I know, in fact, that there's probably a number of people here who've been through what this woman is going through.

312
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 Maybe not with adultery or something like that, right?

313
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 But what I mean is that during a time of struggling,

314
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 during a time when you were wrestling with your sin and your suffering and your shame,

315
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 and the reaction you got when people found out was not to help you to heal,

316
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 but rather it was shame and condemnation.

317
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 Maybe that's even happened to you here in this community at the Vine.

318
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 And if that's the case, it should break our hearts and it should lead us to do better.

319
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 And church, when we approach those who seem to be lost in sin,

320
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 when we have conversations with those who don't fit our expectations,

321
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 who are struggling with darkness,

322
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 when we're trying to guide people in the journey of exodus out of their slavery into freedom,

323
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 what does our language sound like?

324
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Are we judgmental? Are we self-righteous?

325
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 Are we far too excited when we get an opportunity to point out the speck in someone else's eye

326
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 without looking at the log that is in our own eye?

327
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Because if so, conversations we have with people in this space are never going to be effective.

328
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 So how does Jesus react?

329
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 Well, in true Jesus fashion, it wasn't like anybody expected Him to.

330
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 John continues to tell us this.

331
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 As they were questioning Him and questioning Him and questioning Him,

332
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with His finger.

333
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 Now, I like to think of myself as a good listener.

334
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 Brittany, my wife, however, would probably tell you I'm not.

335
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 One of the reasons she doesn't think I'm a good listener is because it never appears as though I'm listening.

336
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 She could be in the middle of telling me about something, weekend plans,

337
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 something that happened at work, meal prepping, whatever.

338
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 I don't really listen to what she's saying, right?

339
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 But, okay, in the middle of her talking to me, I will often randomly get up and try to go and do something else, right?

340
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 Like maybe clean up a mess with the toys or fix the bookshelf or something like that, okay?

341
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 And because I'm doing something else at the same time, it seems like I'm not listening.

342
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 I reassure, yes, I am actually listening.

343
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 It's just that my mind gets easily distracted and it helps if I'm doing something else whilst listening to her at the same time.

344
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 And it seems as though this is what's happening here.

345
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 They're berating Jesus with questions and it doesn't seem like Jesus is listening at all.

346
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 Instead, he starts doing something completely random.

347
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 They kept on questioning him.

348
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 "Jesus, hello, did you hear us? What are you doing? What do you say? What do you say about this situation?"

349
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 Jesus is unfazed.

350
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 He stays chill. He stays calm.

351
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 He concentrates on what he's writing on the ground.

352
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 And we don't really know. If you read commentaries, there's going to be a bunch of theories.

353
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 What was he actually writing on the ground?

354
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 We don't know, right?

355
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 But the effect it had was providing a pause in a tense moment.

356
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 Jesus stays calm. He pauses. He thinks. And then he speaks.

357
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Right? In the middle of being berated by questions, being attacked, his reaction is not to shout or to yell, to try and put out fire with fire.

358
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 I know often this is my own reaction.

359
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 When the volume gets loud, you try to match it.

360
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 When tempers get flared, you feel like you have to stick up for yourself.

361
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 Many times this happens perhaps in less proud moments of parenting,

362
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 maybe in a heated conversation between you and your spouse or your partner, your parents or work colleagues.

363
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 But think about it this way.

364
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 When was the last time a shouting match led to a good conversation for you?

365
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 When was the last time someone opened up to you after you yelled at them?

366
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 Jesus demonstrates a different model for us to follow.

367
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 He takes on the wisdom of Proverbs.

368
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 A fool gives full vent to a spirit, but a wise man or woman quietly holds it back.

369
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 Church, if we really want to be able to dialogue with each other in this space,

370
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 we must learn to be able to hold our tongue, to keep cool, even when we might be bombarded with accusations and questions.

371
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 Pausing, thinking, and then speaking could be a fundamental way for us to prevent our conversations from going sideways.

372
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 And we learn to speak from a place of calm and peace.

373
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 That might mean practicing a bit of deep breathing.

374
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 In for four, hold for seven, out for eight.

375
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 In for four, hold for seven, out for eight.

376
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 That might mean asking yourself, you know, "How would I like to be talked to if I was in this situation?"

377
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 Sometimes this might even be walking away to clear your head, right, before coming back to the conversation.

378
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 Whatever it is, find the thing that works for you to pause, to think, and then speak.

379
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 Jesus does this perfectly.

380
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 And as a result, he gives the perfect answer to this situation.

381
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 Listen to what he says.

382
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 "When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said, 'Let any of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.'"

383
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 Again, he stooped down and kept writing on the ground.

384
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 If there was a list of top ten mic drop moments in Scripture, right, this would probably be one of them.

385
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 The perfect answer to this situation.

386
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 Why?

387
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 Well, remember, this whole thing was actually a setup in order to catch Jesus, try and catch Jesus saying the wrong thing.

388
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 But this was the perfect answer because, first of all, it didn't deny the law, right?

389
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 He doesn't say, "Don't throw the stone at her," but at the same time, he doesn't say, "What the woman done is okay. Just let her go."

390
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 The fact is, this woman has sinned.

391
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 And there were indeed laws that say that people who have been caught in adultery should be put to death.

392
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 Leviticus 20.10, Deuteronomy 22.22.

393
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 So if we were to paraphrase Jesus' answer, he's saying, "Okay, yeah, go ahead. Judge this woman.

394
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 You can throw a stone at her, but before you do that, judge yourself first."

395
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 What Jesus is able to do with his answer is see right through the motivations of these religious leaders.

396
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 He struck at their hearts, forces them to examine themselves.

397
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 And as self-righteous as these religious leaders were, none of them would have been bold enough to say that they were perfect and without sin.

398
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 And so they're stunned into silence.

399
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 You see, church, a strong answer doesn't have to be loud.

400
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 It doesn't have to be harsh or even forceful.

401
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 Like we said before, all Jesus does is stand firm on the truth.

402
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 All he does is point to the truth.

403
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 He doesn't yell. He doesn't shout. He doesn't bash people with Scripture.

404
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 It's not even a long conversation that Jesus has with these religious leaders.

405
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 He doesn't get drawn into a big, long debate about him.

406
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 It's not a loud, angry exchange, but with some gentle yet powerful words.

407
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 Just like when Jesus calmed the storm on the sea, Jesus brings a calm to this hectic situation.

408
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 And from being a group that were badgering this woman, ready to sentence her to death,

409
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 suddenly they have nothing to say and begin walking away.

410
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 They walked away because they know that they too would be just as guilty of punishment were they to throw a stone at this woman.

411
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 So at this, those who heard began to walk away one at a time,

412
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 the older ones first, until only Jesus was left with the woman standing still there.

413
00:28:52,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 Jesus had escaped the death, saved the woman from death and escaped the trap set for him.

414
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 Every single woman who came for this woman had a change of heart.

415
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 These people had come to shame the woman, to shame Jesus,

416
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 but now they were the ones who had to hang their heads in shame and walk away.

417
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 And after everyone had left, Jesus can finally fully focus on this woman that was being brought before the Pharisees.

418
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 The word "left" here is quite interesting. It's not just "leave."

419
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 Actually, in the Greek, it's actually got a strong connotation of being "abandoned."

420
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 So this woman had now been left alone and abandoned.

421
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 She was useless to the Pharisees now, the plan didn't work, so they left her.

422
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 Everyone else had left her, but not Jesus.

423
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 See, Jesus refuses to abandon her.

424
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 In St. Augustine, he summarizes this scene beautifully when he talks about this passage in Scripture.

425
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 "There in the quiet of the mountain, two were left,

426
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 she standing in the misery of her sin, and he standing in the glory of his mercy."

427
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 You see, it's only when the environment becomes safe and calm

428
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 that Jesus finally gets a chance to have a conversation with this woman.

429
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 And again, it's a short conversation, but it's beautiful and challenging.

430
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 With the threats and distractions out of the way, Jesus is able to commune with her.

431
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 Because he knew that before he needed to communicate anything with her,

432
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 he first needed to commune with her, to look her face to face, to acknowledge her as a person.

433
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 Jesus straightened up and asked her, "Woman, where are they?

434
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 Has no one condemned you?" "No one, sir," she said.

435
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 You see, where the religious leaders treated this woman with shame and condemnation,

436
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 Jesus treats this woman with love and respect.

437
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 When Jesus says "woman," it's not like, "Woman!" You know, it's not like that, okay?

438
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 But it's actually a very—gosh, I'm sorry—it's actually a very courteous way,

439
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 the most kind way he could have addressed her.

440
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 This was Jesus' way of letting her know, "Hey, it's okay.

441
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 Everyone else is gone, but I'm still here.

442
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 You're safe now. I'm here for you."

443
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 This is an important point for us to keep in mind when we're trying to have conversations with people

444
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 about tough things, because if people don't feel safe, they're not going to open up.

445
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 And our role as people who point people towards Jesus, we must be able to create safe environments

446
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 for people to truly able to talk about their struggles, their sin, their fears, their darkness,

447
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 without them thinking that they might be condemned.

448
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 And one great way we can do this is share out of our own brokenness and our own vulnerability,

449
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 because when we do this, we let people know we're just the same.

450
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 Everyone in this room, everyone in this world battles with sin,

451
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 and we all need to bring our sin before Jesus.

452
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 But when we let people see our journey, that's truly one of the best gifts we can give to someone,

453
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 to commune with someone, to get to know them before we try and communicate anything with them,

454
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 to embrace their brokenness and vulnerability, to embrace your own brokenness and vulnerability

455
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 as a point of connection, and as they open up to you, to let them know that they're loved,

456
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 to let them know that they belong.

457
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 This is why Jesus' response is so powerful.

458
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 He says to her, "Then neither do I condemn you," Jesus declared.

459
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 "Go now and leave your life of sin."

460
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 The only person who could have given her the death sentence,

461
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 the only person who have technically picked up a stone to throw at her,

462
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 the person who truly had the authority to condemn her has told her she is not condemned.

463
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 The Pharisees notice the sin and see it as an opportunity to judge and to trap.

464
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 Jesus notices the sin and sees it as an opportunity to love, to forgive, to show mercy,

465
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 to give a new life.

466
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 Now, please don't get me wrong. Jesus is not excusing her sin at all.

467
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 When Jesus says, "Neither do I condemn you," He's not saying, "It's okay. Just go. I don't care."

468
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 No, Jesus wants this woman to help this woman see that the situation was serious.

469
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 She has literally been rescued for imminent death.

470
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 But He also wants her to know that now you are free.

471
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 The sin that held you back, the sin that held you in bondage, no longer has any power over you.

472
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 And now you have a new lease, a new way to live your life.

473
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 You see, what's amazing is that this woman doesn't really know who Jesus is yet.

474
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 She doesn't know that Jesus is on this mission to the cross.

475
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 She doesn't know what this woman doesn't know in that moment that He loved her so much.

476
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 He was going to take on that condemnation that was due for her.

477
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 He was going to sacrifice Himself to death so that she wouldn't have to.

478
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 That's the only way that she could have been forgiven.

479
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 So, yes, Jesus offers forgiveness. Jesus forgives.

480
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 But we must also remember that forgiveness is a costly thing and that we can never treat it lightly.

481
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 Forgiveness came at the cost of Jesus' life, which means that if we are to receive that forgiveness,

482
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 it should also come with a change in our lives.

483
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 Jesus lets this woman know she is loved, sinful yet forgiven.

484
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 Then and only then does the conversation turn towards asking her to change.

485
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 Go now and leave your life of sin.

486
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 It's not just a quaint word. It's not just a cute ending to the story.

487
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 But it's a deep challenge for the woman now to live by.

488
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 It demonstrates the forgiving spirit of Jesus and His firm call to live a transformed life.

489
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 Jesus is telling her that she can start a life anew.

490
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 But the motivation He's doing that is not through shame, guilt, and condemnation.

491
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 It's through the full depth of His love and forgiveness.

492
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 And Scripture doesn't tell us what happened next to this woman.

493
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 But what I like to think is that if she really had been impacted by Jesus in this moment,

494
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 in this short little conversation,

495
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 she probably went on to live a life that was marked forever by His love and His mercy.

496
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 So where does that leave us?

497
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 Well, in this room right now, we too are not perfect people. Far from it, in fact.

498
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 And so therefore, this community needs to be a place where we can put down self-righteousness

499
00:35:53,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 so that we can enter into conversations with each other when we're struggling with sin and darkness.

500
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 And we don't need to yell. We don't need to berate. We don't need to condemn.

501
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 This story proves that often it's the kind, the loving conversations,

502
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 the ones that confidently but gently point people towards Jesus

503
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 that become the most effective ones we can have with others.

504
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 It shows us that when we allow for Jesus to calm the noise and to lead the conversation,

505
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 that's when lives are changed.

506
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 When we make space for God in the conversation, He always, always appears to us.

507
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 So this community needs to be a place where anyone who's struggling with sin

508
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 can become part of the community and be led to the one who can truly heal and forgive.

509
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 And often we might find that as we walk and talk with God to others,

510
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 they too begin to start their own conversations with God.

511
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 God begins to speak to them in ways, amazing ways, that you never could if it was just done by your own power.

512
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 So church, in the coming weeks, as we continue to look at the conversations that Jesus has,

513
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 as we continue to discover how He engages and speaks with people,

514
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 I hope that this would be our starting point.

515
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 May we be a people, may we be a church that speaks truth and love in the darkness

516
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 with the love and mercy of Jesus.

517
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 Would you close your eyes, church? I'm just going to pray for us for a minute.

518
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 This is our hope, this is our goal, to be this kind of church,

519
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 to be the kind of people that have these kind of conversations.

520
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 And perhaps you're in here this morning and you think, "Oh, actually, you know what?

521
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 I've been quite angry lately."

522
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 And even in my own zealousness to bring people to realize who Jesus is,

523
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 maybe perhaps you've realized you've let anger dictate your words.

524
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 You haven't taken the time to pause, to think before speaking out.

525
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 And Jesus is here to remind you, to show you, "I appreciate your heart,

526
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 but maybe it's time to let go of the anger and embrace my approach.

527
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 Take on my mercy and impart that to others.

528
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 Love as I did, and let others know that they are safe,

529
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 that they don't need to fear your judgment when you open your mouth to talk to them."

530
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 Maybe you're in this space and you have used your words to condemn others,

531
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 and you're realizing, "Oh, yeah, those words were hurtful.

532
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 I shouldn't have said those things."

533
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 Just allow the Spirit of God, the mercy of Jesus to wash over you too,

534
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 to help you in your further conversations.

535
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 Maybe you're in this room and you're feeling like that woman,

536
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 and you've been hurt so much.

537
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 Yes, there are things you know that you're ashamed of, perhaps.

538
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 An area of sin, of addiction, of something that had a grip on you,

539
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 and you've tried to talk to people,

540
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 but it's often been met with scorn and scolding.

541
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 You just don't feel safe. You don't feel like, "Oh, you know, if this is the case,

542
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 why should I even bother talking to anybody?"

543
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 If you felt condemnation in this way,

544
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 know this morning that Jesus doesn't condemn you either,

545
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 but He wants to draw you in.

546
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 He too wants to give His mercy and forgiveness to you also.

547
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 And as you encounter the true love of Jesus, His gentle yet strong heart,

548
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 I pray that you would be led out of your freedom,

549
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 the chains that hold you, the bondage of darkness,

550
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 and led into a life with Jesus guiding the way,

551
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 a transformed, a renewed life.

552
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
 And so, Lord, this is our prayer.

553
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 Our words are powerful.

554
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 Conversations are a gift that you've given to us,

555
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 and we can either use it to hurt or to heal.

556
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 And so, Jesus, may the words that come out of our mouth

557
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 be drenched by your Spirit, Lord.

558
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 May the conversations we have about you be full of grace and mercy and wisdom.

559
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 And as we do this, continue to shape and mold us to the people,

560
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 to the community, to the families that we need to be

561
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 to show your love to the world around us.

562
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 We pray in your beautiful name, Lord. Amen.

563
