1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
 Amen.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Amen.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,080
 Hey, earlier I was taking back to my college days, "Shout to the Lord."

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,160
 So it's been quite a while.

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,760
 But that actually was a song where I fell in love with worshiping.

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,400
 And so for me, that was very special.

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,480
 So thank you so much for bringing this to us this morning, you know, to worship God

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,360
 in that way.

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:29,640
 Now talking about university, while I was at university, I had a friend, a great friend,

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,560
 to this day a good friend, who checked in on me.

11
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,400
 He asked, "Tim, how are you doing?"

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,840
 And I was doing okay, la, you know, I was okay.

13
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,840
 And then he, I said, "I'm okay."

14
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,200
 And he's like, "What's wrong?"

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,720
 I was like, "What do you mean, what's wrong?

16
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,720
 I'm okay."

17
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,740
 "No, something's wrong, Tim.

18
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,440
 You should be happy.

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,000
 Jesus was always happy."

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,400
 I was like, kind of caught off guard and thinking, I was like, "No, surely Jesus wasn't always

21
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,400
 happy."

22
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,360
 I was like, "What about when he died on the cross?"

23
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,880
 And so that kind of ended the conversation.

24
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,540
 And we're still friends today, so it didn't end the friendship.

25
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:19,920
 But as I was reflecting on that, there was something in me just saying that I was okay,

26
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,080
 or him perceiving that I was not doing good, where it brought him discomfort.

27
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,120
 He felt like it was not right.

28
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:34,520
 And it's a type of misguided spirituality where you think when you're a Christian, you

29
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,480
 always need to be happy.

30
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,500
 You always need to feel great.

31
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:45,640
 And even if you're not feeling great, you have to pretend like you're feeling great.

32
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:53,360
 And it can also have this toxic faith element where you believe, "If I have faith, then

33
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,360
 I will not suffer.

34
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,480
 I will have no pain.

35
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,200
 I will have no difficulties."

36
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:04,480
 And so that somehow flowed into this conversation.

37
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:13,040
 Now besides misguided spiritualities, actually our culture is not comfortable with pain,

38
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,240
 with suffering, and with grief.

39
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,360
 If you're, I remember in the US, you know, you walk around, you say, "Hey, what's up?

40
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,120
 How's it going?"

41
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,120
 "Great."

42
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,400
 And if you ever actually answer that, "Really, how are you feeling?"

43
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,520
 People are like, "I don't want to hear that, man.

44
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,800
 I just want to hear you're great and I want to move on with my life."

45
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,920
 Right?

46
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,120
 So there is, even within our culture, there is this comfort.

47
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,480
 Don't be a downer.

48
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,220
 Don't rain on my party.

49
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:54,420
 And so we're stuck with these feelings of grief, of pain, of difficulty, of sorrow,

50
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,100
 and we feel like we're not allowed to express them.

51
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,980
 And maybe we even feel shame for them.

52
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,860
 And so then we're not sure, "Can I bring this to my friends?

53
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,220
 Do they even want to hear about this?"

54
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,940
 Or maybe they want to hear about it once, but they don't want to hear about it a second,

55
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,420
 the third, the fourth, the fifth time.

56
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,420
 "Can I bring this to my Christian community?"

57
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:21,300
 Or do they also reflect culture and don't want to hear about it after they prayed about

58
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,940
 it once, they feel like it should be settled?

59
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:28,060
 "Can I bring it to God?

60
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:33,760
 Or is this a part of my life that I need to hide from God because I somehow feel, or my

61
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:41,140
 environment has told me, that I always need to be joyful and feel great and happy, and

62
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:50,940
 then when I struggle, it's a part that God does not want to hear?"

63
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,780
 And this leads us to a lot of times we don't actually know what to do with our pain.

64
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,860
 We don't know what to do with our suffering.

65
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:06,380
 We don't know what to do with our agony, with the things that we're carrying around in our

66
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,580
 hearts.

67
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:16,060
 And I just wonder this morning, who here woke up with tears this morning?

68
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:25,140
 Who went last night as you were laying in bed, was feeling sorrow?

69
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,140
 I think it's quite a few.

70
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:30,620
 I don't think it's just like one, two people.

71
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:35,040
 What sort of pain have you been carrying around?

72
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,940
 Maybe it's even from a long time ago where this is just this thing that just has not

73
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,940
 gone away.

74
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:47,140
 What do we do with that?

75
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,620
 So what I want to do with you this morning is I want to explore with you a question,

76
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,380
 and the question is this.

77
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:58,180
 How can we bring our sorrows and our grief and pain before God?

78
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,860
 What does God's word teach about that?

79
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:05,800
 How are we supposed to process that?

80
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:11,600
 So today we're continuing in our message series, Fresh Encounter.

81
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,680
 We have been looking at fasting, so we're also doing this fast together, which I don't

82
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,000
 know about you, for me this has been very encouraging.

83
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,880
 I love doing that together.

84
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,020
 I feel really strengthened when I get to do this with other people.

85
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,680
 And I've experienced God in a deeper way in the season.

86
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,160
 I hope that is your experience as well.

87
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,520
 Then last week we talked about prayer, and we looked at Jesus, how Jesus encouraged the

88
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,720
 disciples to come and pray.

89
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,560
 And he encouraged the disciples with God's goodness, that we have a loving father who

90
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:53,060
 loves giving good things to the children who ask.

91
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:59,300
 Today our topic is personal worship.

92
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:04,720
 Now one thing that we also want to do during the season is, if you've been in church, some

93
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,880
 of us have been in church for a while, some of us might never have been much in church,

94
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,780
 but if you've been in church for a while, it's easy to get stuck in a rut, like to get

95
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,220
 stuck in routines, how we relate to God.

96
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:20,260
 But God wants to encounter us in fresh ways.

97
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,060
 We don't want to talk about experience from five or ten years ago.

98
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:28,220
 We want to experience Jesus here and now, because he's alive, and he's moving, and he's

99
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,220
 at work.

100
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:39,100
 So as I was thinking about personal worship, now the first thing that didn't come to mind

101
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,540
 was talking about pain and sorrow and grief.

102
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,240
 That's actually the last thing that came to mind.

103
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,540
 But I want to, first of all, I want to share with you a practice that is known as the prayer

104
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,840
 of lament.

105
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,440
 Then afterwards I want to talk a little bit more about why I concluded that, as we're

106
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,520
 talking about personal worship, to talk about the prayer of lament.

107
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,480
 So here's a definition of the prayer of lament.

108
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,200
 A lament is a complaint to God.

109
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:13,240
 Yes, the Bible tells us it is okay to complain to God.

110
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,360
 And it shows us how to do that.

111
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,560
 It's a prayers of lament offer a way to approach God, acknowledge our circumstances, and the

112
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:29,600
 genuine feelings of sadness, grief, frustration, sorrow, and fear that overwhelm and consume

113
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,200
 us.

114
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:44,720
 Lamenting is an act of faith that calls upon God for transformation and redemption.

115
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,800
 Now what does personal worship have to do with lamenting?

116
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:58,880
 Well, for me, personal worship is really bringing all of our lives before all of who God is.

117
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:06,940
 It's bringing all of our, in every facet of our lives, showing our devotion to him.

118
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:13,960
 That means that we also do that in the painful parts of our life, that we show our devotion

119
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:22,160
 to him, that we come before him and bring the sorrows, the pains, the struggling, the

120
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:32,320
 agony to the one who loves us and who can really do something about what we're experiencing.

121
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:38,820
 And I personally find when we engage with God in the most difficult times of our lives,

122
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:44,320
 that it is some of the deepest and most powerful worship there is.

123
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:51,000
 I was earlier moved, I assume you too, when Henriette, you know, you heard what has happened,

124
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,320
 and she's up here and she is leading us in worship.

125
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,320
 Now that's deep worship.

126
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:04,120
 That's not easy worship, but that's deep and real worship.

127
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:11,560
 When our times are tough and we're choosing to become before God with whatever's going

128
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:17,400
 on, that's an act of faith and it's an act of praise.

129
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,700
 So today we are in the book of Psalms.

130
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,640
 Now there is personal laments.

131
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,500
 There's also corporate laments.

132
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,480
 So the Bible actually teaches us how we can engage in this complaining to God.

133
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,000
 So we didn't just come up with that because we felt like it.

134
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,960
 Actually God's word leads us in that and it shows us how we can do that individually,

135
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,260
 but it also shows how we can do that corporately because sometimes there's things as a society,

136
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:48,220
 as a group of people that we are lamenting, that we are crying out to God for.

137
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,200
 But today we're going to look at a personal lament.

138
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:59,400
 We're going to look at Psalm 6 and Psalm 6 is attributed to King David.

139
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:11,520
 Now the Psalms is the prayer and the worship book of Israel, of Jesus, and of the church.

140
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,680
 Jesus actually, when he was on the cross, he prayed a lament.

141
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:22,120
 Psalm 22, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"

142
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,160
 Is a Psalm.

143
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:32,640
 So Jesus was led by the Psalms, even how to bring his agony and his grief and his pain

144
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,240
 to the father.

145
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,400
 And so we're going to see how the Psalm invites us to bring those things that are heavy, where

146
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:44,600
 a lot of times we don't know what to do, to the God and to see how God meets us when we

147
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,380
 do that.

148
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:53,600
 So we're in Psalm 6 and starting in verse 1 it says this, "Lord, do not rebuke me in

149
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,960
 your anger or discipline me in your wrath.

150
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,480
 Have mercy on me, Lord, for I'm faint.

151
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,480
 Heal me.

152
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,640
 Lord, my bones are in agony.

153
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,400
 My soul is in deep anguish.

154
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,000
 How long?

155
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 How long?"

156
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:23,680
 Now often, when we go through painful and difficult things, there's a thought that comes

157
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:30,900
 up in our hearts and minds and we wonder, is somehow God angry at us?

158
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:36,560
 Is he somehow disciplining us or punishing us?

159
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,460
 And we wonder about that.

160
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,960
 I don't know if you've ever thought of that.

161
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:44,280
 I have thought of that as I've gone through painful experiences.

162
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,680
 Is God somehow disciplining me?

163
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,800
 Is there a sin that I need to confess, something that I need to sort out?

164
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,880
 And sometimes there might be, you know, where there's something we need to work out, but

165
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,600
 a lot of times we just don't know.

166
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,280
 And we feel like maybe there's a distance and we're just wondering what's going on.

167
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:05,800
 Well here in the Psalm, David, he doesn't confess any very specific sin.

168
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,640
 He does that in others where he's clear.

169
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,280
 So it seems that David is like, "Lord, I don't know if I did something wrong.

170
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:18,200
 You know, Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath.

171
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,200
 Take this away.

172
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,200
 I can't.

173
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,360
 This burden is too heavy."

174
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,360
 The Psalmist describes the circumstances, "For I am faint.

175
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,200
 My bones are in agony.

176
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,160
 My soul is in deep anguish."

177
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:45,400
 Now, throughout the Psalms, pain and suffering is described as physical suffering and pain.

178
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,160
 But it doesn't mean that it just refers to physical suffering and pain.

179
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:55,560
 Actually a lot of times it's used as a metaphor to also talk about emotional suffering and

180
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,740
 pain.

181
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:03,160
 And so we actually don't know the circumstance that triggered this pain and suffering in

182
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,160
 David's life.

183
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,360
 If it's an illness or if it's something emotional, something else has happened.

184
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,640
 We don't know.

185
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:17,880
 But this is a cry, "I can't take it any longer.

186
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,800
 Do something.

187
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:28,140
 My circumstances, they're weighing me down and they're crushing me.

188
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,600
 How long?

189
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:38,600
 How long?"

190
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:45,760
 Now that's the cry of someone who is at their end of the ropes.

191
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:54,180
 But it is also the cry of someone who is hoping God will act.

192
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:59,780
 So by crying out to God and asking God how long, David is expressing his hope, even if

193
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:07,140
 it is a faint hope, that God can step in and change his circumstances.

194
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:13,140
 So I lament as a complaint to God, as a complaint to the one we believe who can actually do

195
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:19,340
 something about what's going on.

196
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:25,100
 And this element of hope is important because when we cry out, we come to the one who can

197
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,380
 actually help.

198
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:33,780
 We come to the one who can meet us and deliver us, who can show us mercy, who can lift us

199
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:41,740
 out of whatever difficulty it is that we're facing.

200
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:46,900
 So ultimately, this is a plea for God's mercy.

201
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:51,900
 You see it in verse two, "Have mercy on me."

202
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:56,140
 There's an Old Testament professor I like and he comments on this verse.

203
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:06,540
 He says this, "When people in life are against us, we have nothing to turn to but God's generosity,

204
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:10,860
 his grace, his mercy, his love.

205
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,300
 He's the one that delivers us.

206
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,100
 He's the one that meets us.

207
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:19,820
 He's the one that has the power to bring us out, to bring us through, to sustain us when

208
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:28,860
 we are weak, when we have nothing left in our tank.

209
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,180
 Let's continue.

210
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:34,620
 Verse four, "Turn, Lord, and deliver me.

211
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:38,420
 Save me because of your unfailing love.

212
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,860
 Among the dead, no one proclaims your name.

213
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:46,420
 Who praises you from this grave?"

214
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:54,300
 Now the word that's translated as "turn," actually a more literal translation is "return."

215
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,660
 So David is saying, "Return to me, Lord."

216
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,580
 He feels like God has abandoned him.

217
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:02,460
 He feels like he's on his own.

218
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:10,140
 "Return to me."

219
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:19,220
 And he also appeals to God's love, to his unfailing love.

220
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:28,100
 So when we lament, we also call on who God is and who he promises to be.

221
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:36,220
 God promises his covenant people, which is also us as Christians, we're in the new covenant,

222
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:42,860
 that he loves us, that he's with us, that he's faithful.

223
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,580
 And so we call on this, "Lord, you say you're faithful.

224
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,180
 You love us.

225
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:51,660
 Do something.

226
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,300
 Show me that this is real."

227
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,540
 That's what we're saying.

228
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:04,420
 And verse five kind of cracks me up because David is like making an argument why God should

229
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,420
 deliver him.

230
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,140
 He's basically saying, "I'm dead.

231
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,220
 Who can praise you?

232
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,220
 What good is it?

233
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,700
 You're going to lose some praise.

234
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,700
 So keep me alive."

235
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:18,140
 But let's continue in verse six.

236
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:22,220
 "I'm worn out from groaning.

237
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:28,260
 All night long I flood my bed with weeping and drench my couch with tears.

238
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,300
 My eyes grow weak with sorrow.

239
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:37,740
 They fail because of all my foes."

240
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:44,100
 So right now, the psalmist or David is describing just what he's been experiencing.

241
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,260
 It's also part of lamenting.

242
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:51,060
 We describe what we're experiencing, what we're feeling, what's been happening.

243
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:56,460
 And he says that he is worn out from groaning.

244
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,900
 I remember being in Calcutta.

245
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,420
 I volunteered at the home of the dying for Mother Teresa.

246
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:07,340
 It's like 20 years ago.

247
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:13,020
 And this hall was full of people who were in their last stage of their lives.

248
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:20,380
 And then Mother Teresa had organized this space so that people do not die on their own,

249
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:25,540
 but they do die with dignity, that there's somebody with them, somebody caring with them,

250
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:30,580
 somebody who softens their pain.

251
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:37,700
 Now remember when I stepped in there, I mean, the hall was full of groaning.

252
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:42,660
 Just worn out from the suffering of the sickness, the illness.

253
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:49,140
 I also remind of my father when he had cancer and he passed away in 2007.

254
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:56,140
 Just the groaning when the tumors were growing and pushing on nerves.

255
00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:04,380
 So David's saying, "I'm worn out, Lord.

256
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,580
 I got nothing.

257
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,540
 I have nothing.

258
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,540
 I'm an empty."

259
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:18,540
 And then it talks about the weeping and the crying.

260
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,980
 Now I don't know if you've had this experience.

261
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:27,180
 At nighttime, things settle down, we're not as busy, we're not as distracted.

262
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:31,300
 And then the thing comes, the stuff comes up that we're carrying.

263
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,940
 And then the tears start flowing.

264
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,540
 We start weeping.

265
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,220
 I've had that.

266
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:45,720
 I went through a difficult, the most difficult experience of my life, 2017.

267
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,660
 And almost every night, I was weeping.

268
00:19:50,660 --> 00:20:02,540
 Every night, tears were flowing.

269
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,300
 And so we described to God what's going on.

270
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:10,980
 Well, what's amazing when we do that, he's not scared of what we're experiencing.

271
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,860
 He's not scared of what we're feeling.

272
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,540
 He's not scared of our complaint.

273
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,040
 God can handle it.

274
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,300
 He invites us to do that.

275
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,540
 People might get uncomfortable.

276
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:26,900
 God does not get uncomfortable with your pain, with your suffering, with your struggles,

277
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,740
 with whatever's going on.

278
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:33,220
 God is a sympathetic listener.

279
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,900
 He becomes a partner in our suffering.

280
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:42,260
 By lamenting, we move from feeling we are alone to being in dialogue with God about

281
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,820
 what is going on.

282
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:49,200
 So instead of carrying around whatever's going on in ourselves, now we're starting to bring

283
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,200
 it to God.

284
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:55,140
 And that's actually part of the healing process, just being heard.

285
00:20:55,140 --> 00:21:04,620
 Just putting name, naming what we've been experiencing, putting a name to it.

286
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:10,980
 We can trust that God understands our pain, that he understands our suffering.

287
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:15,660
 We can know that because of Jesus.

288
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:21,100
 Pastor Ivan earlier read a scripture, talked about sharing the suffering of Jesus.

289
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:29,460
 Jesus was betrayed by one of his disciples, so he knows betrayal.

290
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:34,780
 He was abandoned by his disciples, where they all just left him.

291
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:40,060
 He was spat on, he was beaten, he was ridiculed.

292
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:47,020
 He was physically ultimately put to death.

293
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:54,300
 So he understands your emotional and your physical suffering, because he has gone through

294
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,340
 it.

295
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,340
 He understands.

296
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:03,020
 A lot of times in some of my experience, I felt nobody understands me.

297
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:07,360
 But God understands you.

298
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:13,580
 And he also went through that, dying on the cross and rising from the dead to lead us

299
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:25,780
 out of the suffering, to turn things around, so that we can experience his healing, his

300
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:30,180
 forgiveness, his new life that he gives.

301
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:33,300
 And this is something that he can give now.

302
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:40,980
 Earlier as we were praying, I had this vision of Jesus walking around this room and laying

303
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:50,700
 hands on people's shoulders, just doing healing work in people's lives, just praying over

304
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,900
 us as a community.

305
00:22:52,900 --> 00:23:03,180
 And so Jesus, he loves releasing his healing and his restoration of people.

306
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:10,380
 There are some things where God's word also promises that they might not get fixed on

307
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:18,300
 this side of our lives, but we have a promise that one day God will set, for those who believe

308
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:22,140
 in him, for those who trust him, he will set everything right, that there will be no more

309
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:25,700
 tears, there will be no more pain, no more suffering.

310
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:29,500
 You can read Revelation 21.

311
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:36,660
 Now there's a Psalm that I came across, interesting enough, it even came up in my personal reading,

312
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,140
 Psalm 56, verse 8.

313
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:41,860
 It says this, "You keep track of all my sorrows.

314
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:45,120
 You have collected all my tears in your bottle.

315
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,500
 You have recorded each one in your book."

316
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:59,300
 God does not miss a single tear that has flowed down your face, not a single one.

317
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:06,540
 That's how attentive he is to you.

318
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:11,980
 In verse 7, it also says, "My eyes grow weak with sorrow."

319
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:19,900
 Now, what this means when the Psalms talk about eyes growing weak, it has to do with

320
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,780
 that they've been looking for God.

321
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:27,960
 They've been waiting on God, but they're growing tired of looking out.

322
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,140
 So it's another called God act.

323
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:37,340
 My eyes are, I can't look much longer.

324
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:42,620
 And then to add injury to suffering, suddenly in verse 7, there's also enemies that pop

325
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:49,140
 up that have smart things to say to us while we're suffering.

326
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:54,400
 Now maybe it's blaming you for what's going on.

327
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,060
 People always try to explain suffering.

328
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:00,000
 You know, and then they try to like find fault somewhere.

329
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,800
 And so a lot of times they put the fault on the person who's going through the suffering.

330
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:11,380
 Maybe it's somebody taking advantage of you while you're suffering, maybe in your job

331
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:16,380
 or elsewhere.

332
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:21,260
 So this just adds, but let's continue reading in verse 8.

333
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:26,740
 It says this, "Away from me, all you who do evil, for the Lord has heard my weeping.

334
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,900
 The Lord has heard my cry for mercy.

335
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,140
 The Lord accepts my prayer.

336
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:34,660
 All my enemies will be overwhelmed with shame and anguish.

337
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:40,400
 They will turn back and suddenly be put to shame."

338
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:47,740
 So suddenly God's unfailing love, this love that David called for in verse 4, breaks into

339
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,340
 the situation.

340
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,340
 David has been hurt.

341
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,340
 God has heard the complaint.

342
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,500
 He has heard the mourning.

343
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,300
 And that changes everything.

344
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,940
 This is a turnaround.

345
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:02,780
 This is a turning point.

346
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:10,140
 Now we don't know how much time has passed between the lamenting and this line.

347
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:14,860
 A lot of times, sometimes God meets us immediately.

348
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:18,280
 Sometimes there's a longer period.

349
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,140
 But don't be discouraged.

350
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:24,240
 Jesus is at work underneath the surface.

351
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,620
 He is working.

352
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,620
 Don't lose hope.

353
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,060
 Hold on.

354
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:33,260
 He's at work in your life.

355
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:38,140
 And then suddenly, you know, his word will break through, his assurance.

356
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,220
 We don't know what happened.

357
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,620
 Did God speak to David?

358
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:45,700
 Did somebody have a word for him, come for him?

359
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:49,660
 Was he encouraged through some of scripture?

360
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:53,260
 We don't know.

361
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:57,860
 Now I've had an experience like that.

362
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:01,780
 I shared earlier that I've gone through a very difficult time.

363
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:07,260
 And I went to, attended a church and was worshiping.

364
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,880
 And I was stuck.

365
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:15,660
 I did not know how to move forward in my life.

366
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:19,540
 My life had come to a sudden halt.

367
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:22,180
 I was hopeless.

368
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:25,160
 I just really did not know what to do.

369
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:30,480
 And I really didn't care even what happened to me at that point.

370
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,820
 And so as I was worshiping, I had a word from Jesus.

371
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,580
 And I've shared this here before.

372
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:42,100
 I'm not finished with you yet.

373
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,540
 But I felt like he was.

374
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,740
 I felt like it was over.

375
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:48,860
 But he said, I'm not finished with you yet.

376
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:52,020
 Now, were all my problems resolved in that moment?

377
00:27:52,020 --> 00:28:00,740
 I still was in the same situation, but I was heard because God had spoken to me, my lamenting

378
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:06,820
 and my crying and in my worshiping him.

379
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:12,540
 And it released hope and courage to move forward.

380
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:18,420
 Suddenly my perspective had changed.

381
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:26,380
 And then God bit by bit turned my life around and just poured his goodness and his love

382
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,700
 on me.

383
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,100
 So this is transformative part.

384
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:34,300
 When we bring our pains, our complaints, our sorrows to God in a prayer of lament, that

385
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:40,820
 God one way or another, at one point or another, that he meets us, that he speaks to us, that

386
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:47,660
 he provides for us what we need to move forward, to know his steadfast love and the circumstances

387
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:58,220
 that we're facing, to know that he is going to see us through.

388
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:02,820
 Now at the beginning of the message, I asked the question, how can we bring our sorrows,

389
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,340
 grief and pain before God?

390
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:13,140
 Well, the Bible gives us the prayers of lament to show us how to do that.

391
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:17,500
 And so we've seen that we can bring our complaints to him.

392
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,780
 And I want to share with you five steps of how can I do it?

393
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,780
 How can I lament?

394
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,380
 What do I do?

395
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,380
 Just very simple.

396
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,680
 And this might be something that you use as you pray.

397
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,500
 This might be something you journal on.

398
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,100
 So can we, yes, thank you.

399
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,420
 So the first one is a lament is addressed to God.

400
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:39,700
 We're talking to God.

401
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:43,180
 The second one is we bring our complaint.

402
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:47,540
 We say what's wrong and what's frustrating.

403
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,540
 We just say it.

404
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,140
 And this is not about being theologically correct.

405
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:53,100
 You just say it.

406
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,000
 You just put it out there.

407
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:02,740
 And then we tell God what we want from him, what we want him to do.

408
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:10,500
 And then we describe your situation of distress, your weeping, your sorrow, your struggling,

409
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,660
 or whatever it is, you just put it out there.

410
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:19,180
 And then we end with a statement of trust, whatever that might be.

411
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:22,860
 Lord, I believe that you still love me.

412
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:25,780
 I believe that you will meet me in this.

413
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:26,780
 I believe it.

414
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:31,000
 We just end with a statement of trust.

415
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,620
 So those are five ways that we see in a psalm that we can lament, that we can pour our hearts

416
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:43,180
 to God and how the Bible teaches us to engage with those deep sorrows and pains that we're

417
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,180
 facing.

418
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:50,340
 And I want to ask the worship team to come up.

419
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:56,900
 And God wants to encounter us in fresh ways, something new.

420
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,580
 That's what the series is about.

421
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:05,340
 And God can do something new in our lives.

422
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:13,420
 And he invites us today to bring to him our sorrow, our grief.

423
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:16,460
 So I want to do a ministry time.

424
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:19,620
 I'll explain what we're going to do.

425
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:23,860
 If you're experiencing something difficult, maybe something that's been going on for a

426
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:29,200
 very long time, it's just still there.

427
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,420
 I want to invite you to stretch out your hand before.

428
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:37,380
 And I want to actually invite everyone to stand.

429
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:42,140
 Maybe it's something, maybe you just spent tears this week, you know, whatever it is,

430
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:45,740
 I want to invite you to stretch out your hands.

431
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:50,780
 And then one thing that God gives us is also community.

432
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:53,900
 I want to invite those in the community.

433
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:59,580
 If you see somebody with your hand stretched out as a sign of God's love, will you just

434
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:03,700
 gently place your hand on their shoulder and just pray over them?

435
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,460
 So we're going to do this.

436
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:13,620
 We're going to pray over each other just for a few minutes, and then we'll go into worship.

437
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,620
 So let's do that right now.

438
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,340
 Let's lift each other up in prayer.

439
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:26,340
