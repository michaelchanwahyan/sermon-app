1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 This is not a church in the singular, on its own and distinct,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 but a church in the plural, united across a nation, joined in purpose,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 focused on building up God's kingdom one life at a time.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 It is a church that has at the heart of its DNA

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 the grand narrative of the redemptive story of Jesus Christ,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 and that celebrates in the freedom and grace that such a story brings.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 This church is not constricted by the walls of a building,

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 but actively engaged in the community it is planted in,

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 desiring for God's kingdom to take root and bear fruit in local soil.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 A church that sees salvation as holistic,

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 transforming God's people for God's work,

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 and equipping a generation to represent God's heart

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 to the poor, the weak, the oppressed and the persecuted.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Imagine this church committed to seeing the family

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 as integral to all that it's called to be and do,

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 involving intentional, committed and authentic relationships across all levels.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 It is the sort of place where both the young and the old

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 feel cared for, supported and equipped.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 A church where people of all backgrounds and traditions

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 come to feel at home, a cultural mosaic,

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 that honours and embraces a richness in diversity

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 that marks us as the body of Christ.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 It is a church that is willing to innovate and express faith creatively,

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 reflecting the boundless limits of God's creativity as glory to Him.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 A place where people gather, hungry for the presence of God,

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 and passionate to see this invade all aspects of their lives.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Where they seek to develop an intelligent, spiritual faith,

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 rooted in God's word and driven with prayer.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 A church that does not make its Sunday services

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 the exclamation mark of its existence,

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 but instead the comma in its ongoing sentence.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 A time of service, love and engagement

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 that inspires and emboldens all equally

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 for the conversation that lies ahead.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 A church that cares, disciples, rebuilds, renews.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 This is our city.

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 This is our church.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 This is our home.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Good morning, everyone.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 Everyone good?

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 God is good.

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 All the time, come on.

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 This old-fashioned thing, come on.

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 God is good.

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 All the time.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 Yes, we should have this, right?

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 Yeah, I hope you guys are feeling good.

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 During our fasting period,

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 we are coming to the third week.

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 I don't know how you're feeling, how your fasting journey.

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 But for myself, today a little bit cold, I feel more hungry.

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 And when I'm hungry, I feel more, I need more spirit,

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 like more energy.

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 I need more spirit, like fill me and really God.

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 And then when I pray, it brings me to a, of course, scripture.

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Let me read for you guys.

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 In Romans 8, you are controlled not by the sinful nature,

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 but by the spirit.

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 If the spirit of God lives in you, if Christ is in you,

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 your body is dead because of sin.

61
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Yes, your spirit is alive because of righteousness.

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 And if the spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 will also give life to your mortal bodies,

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 food his spirit who live in you.

66
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Wow, this one is so touch and encourage me,

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 like my body is also belong to God.

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 When I'm fasting, oh, there's some physical needs,

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 but actually that's a good time to let the spirit

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 to take the control on us.

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 It's talking about living spirit, living body.

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 So when we worship, we should have a living body, right?

73
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Not like a dead person, come on.

74
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 So why don't we stand up?

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 I invite you all like stand up and then let us have a prayer

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 and then let the Holy Spirit lead us to worship, to praise him,

77
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 to lift up not only our spirit.

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Our spirit should within us, but also exactly,

79
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 completely connect with our body.

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 When we worship, we are worshiping our God

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 with our whole heart and whole body.

82
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 Let us pray.

83
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 Father, we thank you for your spirit come.

84
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Thank you for give us this room, this space,

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 this opportunity for us this few weeks.

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 We can really hear your voice, really feel your presence

87
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 and really see your work in us.

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 So Lord, we praise you.

89
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 We lift up our voice and heart to worship you

90
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 so that your spirit will hear and your name be praised

91
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 and be lifted up.

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 We pray that in the name of Jesus.

93
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Amen.

 When we were at the show, I saw a picture.

247
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 There's a train.

248
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 The train's supposed to be running very fast,

249
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 very quick, high speed.

250
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 But I saw that there are lots of things on the cargoes,

251
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 the containers.

252
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 One, two, three, four, five, six,

253
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 many, many of the containers,

254
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 there's a lot of stuff

255
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 that make the train running so slow, struggling.

256
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 And when it arrives, it lands to a station.

257
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 That station, the train can load on

258
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 all that heavy stuff, load it on.

259
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 I sense the Holy Spirit telling us today,

260
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 we are holding too much on the train,

261
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 on the cargoes.

262
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 There may be some hurts, fear, death, a fate.

263
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 There's something happened in our life.

264
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 But nor today, here is the station for us

265
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 to really take this down, release it.

266
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 And then it being alive,

267
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 and then we have room to be filled by the Spirit,

268
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 filled by life.

269
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 And then we can run very fast.

270
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 And then that train can even

271
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 to have more and more passenger to come in,

272
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 to go in, to go far,

273
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 to go to that direction that God leading us to go.

274
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 But nor today, here is the station.

275
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 That station is for us

276
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 to really put these things down, the heavy things down.

277
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 I would like to read one more scripture for you guys.

278
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 It's a few verses after what I read

279
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 in the beginning of service.

280
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 "Now if we are children, then we are hearers.

281
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 We are hearers of God and coherent with Christ.

282
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 If indeed we share in His suffering,

283
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 in order that we may also share in His glory."

284
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 Lord Jesus, we thank you for your suffering.

285
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 And you let us know, you understand us,

286
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 you know us, you feel us, and you're suffering for us.

287
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 And when we receive that,

288
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 when we let you do your work in us,

289
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 we bring you glory.

290
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 It's not by our own strength, but by you.

291
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 Even though we are suffering, we are struggling,

292
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 when you come, when we let it go, when we open,

293
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 when we go to this station today

294
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 to let you do your work in us,

295
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 that glory is for you.

296
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 That glory is for you.

297
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 Glorify you, Lord.

298
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 Lord, may you be with us.

299
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 So that when we are coming to the coming song for the worship,

300
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 you speak to us, you let us know

301
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 how we can really, really low down these things,

302
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 and then to have the room for you to feel us.

304
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,000

 Whatever circumstances we face,

00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 God is constant, God is unchanging, and God is unfailing.

308
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 And his word remains truth.

309
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 It's the standard.

310
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 [music]

311
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 Last week, my dad died,

312
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 and it's been the hardest week of my life.

313
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 And singing these words,

314
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 "Where there was death, you brought life,"

315
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 is so difficult to sing with what has happened.

316
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 But it doesn't change who God is,

317
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 it doesn't change what he does,

318
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 and it doesn't change his word.

319
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 And just because my dad is dead here,

320
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 it doesn't mean that there's no life,

321
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 because he is living in eternity with the Savior.

322
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 And so when we sing these songs and we go through things,

323
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 we may often feel like there's a lie,

324
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 or that God is not consistent,

325
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 or he isn't who he says he is, but he is.

326
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 And what we go through doesn't change or affect the nature of God.

327
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 And so we're going to sing the bridge again.

328
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 And maybe some of you are also mourning.

329
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 Maybe some of you are mourning a family member,

330
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 or you've lost some part of your life that you never thought you would lose.

331
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 But God restores.

332
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 God is a healer.

333
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 God is unchanging.

334
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 And God knows how you are feeling,

335
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 and he is with you in this moment.

336
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 So let's sing the bridge again.

00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 God with us.

00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 God for us.

362
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 Nothing can come against.

363
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 No one can stand between us.

364
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 Holy Spirit, come.

365
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 Holy Spirit, come.

366
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000

00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 to heal us.

368
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 There's no one like you.

369
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 There's no one like you that much, know us that much.

370
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 You know our needs.

371
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 You know our heart.

372
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 You know our suffering.

373
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 You know our loss.

374
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 You know what we need.

375
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 Holy Spirit, come.

376
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 Lord, we thank you for your presence.

377
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 Thank you for giving us that hope.

378
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 You lifted us up when we lost hope.

379
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 You tell us you are hope.

380
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 You give life.

00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 You give hope.

382
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 You give us to see the picture that we are with you,

383
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 and we will with you as well.

384
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 We pray for Harriet.

385
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 We pray for her loss.

386
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 We pray for your presence to heal everyone who needs.

387
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 Lord, may you-- may your hand just touch us,

388
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 by yourself.

389
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 We know that that comforts have to come from you.

390
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 We know that today you are coming to heal everyone of us.

391
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 Thank you for letting us to put down these heavies

392
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 and fill with your hope and love.

393
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 With the courage that you're giving us,

394
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 that's why today we can proclaim we are your children,

395
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 and we have the same hope in the future.

396
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 And now, this is our home.

397
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 You called us to be here because you are with us here.

398
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 Your spirit is with us here.

399
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 We thank you for all your works, and may your will be done.

400
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 We pray that in Jesus' name.

401
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 Everyone says, amen.

402
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 Amen.

403
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 Why don't we give a round of applause to our Father,

404
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 our God, and the Holy Spirit.

405
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 I believe that God is really working something among us.

406
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 Please have a seat.

407
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 I think this is a quite special day today.

408
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 Holy Spirit have special work in us.

409
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 I believe that God is not tend to lead us to something super heavy

410
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 that we cannot stand, but there's some things like here,

411
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 as I mentioned in the prayer, we arrive at a station

412
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 so that we can let God to freely do his work on us.

413
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 So I hope you're ready.

414
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 If not, I pray for you guys.

415
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 God won't push everyone of us to do anything we don't want.

416
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 That's really what we want to touch us and love us.

417
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 So, yeah, wow, wow.

418
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 What a powerful worship.

419
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 I would like to also thank you, everyone, your presence.

420
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 And we want to welcome for those who are the first time to come to join us.

 Like during the fasting period, every morning 6 a.m.,

436
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 we will send out a daily devotion to help us to go through this amazing

437
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 fasting journey together.

00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 So, yeah, please join.

439
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 And this is the time we can pass our children among us to the K4C room.

440
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 So if you have children around you, I invite you to stretch your hand on them

441
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 and then we can pray for them all together.

442
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 Father, we thank you for your love.

443
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 We thank you that Holy Spirit also touched these beautiful children

444
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 so that they know you.

445
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 You said we know you because of your spirit so that we can understand your

446
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 word and understand you.

447

 So your spirit upon them, they enjoy their cars, they enjoy the K4C cars,

 We pray that in Jesus' name, amen, amen.

476
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 Yeah, hello, I'm back.

477
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 Hi, by the way, I am Ivan, one of the pastors of the Vang Yuen Long.

478
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 So welcome again, and yeah, parents already settled.

479
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 So as I mentioned, we are in our month, our January fasting month.

480
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 So this is the third week we are coming into.

481
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 And then next week, technically it's the 21st day.

482
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 And on that day, we will break our fast together, celebrate together.

483
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 We can share how the Holy Spirit works on us individually and actually properly as a church.

484
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 So that's why we have the fasting as church.

485
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 So on that day, 28th January, we will have lunch of course, fast for a 21 days.

486
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 So we decided to have a good lunch all together.

487
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 So you can still fast in the morning, but during the lunchtime, that's the best time for us to connect one another.

488
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 And also we can share life.

489
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 We will set tables there.

490
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 You can have your own food, bring to us so that we can enjoy together the community time.

491
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 Is it good?

492
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 Yes.

493
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 Bring your own lunch.

494
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 And then next week, we will bring our own senior pastor.

495
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 Andrew Gardner, yeah, from Wan Chai.

496
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 Yeah, he will come to speak to us, to have a message to preach.

497
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 So in Cantonese service and also English service.

498
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 So that day, yeah, next week, we can like have the fellowship time all together after the service.

499
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 And yeah, very important.

500
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 It's not just for our own sake, right?

501
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 We enjoy our community time, but also Jesus called us to send his gospel.

502
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 So we regularly will have a program called ALVA.

503
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 That's a very good tool for us to share our faith and also connect people to church.

504
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 So we have a video.

505
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 Why don't we first watch the video, and then I will share a little bit more with you all.

506
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 Having conversations about life, faith, and Jesus is hard.

507
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 And this is interesting, because at some point, everyone wrestles with life's big questions.

508
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 Questions about hope, purpose, meaning, and love.

509
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 Imagine creating a space where people in our community, our friends, neighbors, and coworkers, can come and have conversations in a way that is authentic and unforced.

510
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 Where leaders don't need to have all the answers, and anyone can ask tough questions and share honestly about what they believe.

511
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
 That's what ALVA is all about.

512
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 ALVA started in a church in London years ago with a simple idea to engage friends who might not typically go to church.

513
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 Lives were transformed, and it began to grow all over the world.

514
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 Today, you can find ALVA in schools, coffee shops, church buildings, prisons, and homes.

515
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 And so far, millions of people have experienced ALVA.

516
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 So what is ALVA?

517
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,000
 ALVA is a series of interactive sessions exploring the basics of the Christian faith.

518
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 In each session, you eat food, listen to a talk, and have discussions in small groups.

519
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 Eating food together creates space for people to connect, relax, and build friendships.

520
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 The talks tackle core questions about life and faith from a Christian perspective.

521
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 And the discussion allows people to unpack these ideas without fear of being corrected or judged.

522
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 All of this is done in a fun environment where anyone is welcome.

523
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 It is typically run over 8 to 12 weeks, with a weekend away where there are opportunities to experience worship through music and moments for prayer.

524
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 By running ALVA, you're creating a space where people can connect with each other and connect with God.

525
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 Sign up, get started, run ALVA today.

526
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:00,000
 Yes, sign up, run ALVA together.

527
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,000
 So I want to ask, who has joined ALVA before?

528
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 Wow, you are one of millions.

529
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 So there are millions waiting for us as well.

530
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
 They have not yet joined ALVA.

531
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,000
 So I invite you all to invite your friends.

532
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
 We have won twice ALVA in our church.

533
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,000
 And just a few months ago, we won ALVA right here.

534
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 It's so good, so amazing.

535
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 And there's a lot of space.

536
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 We can invite more people to join.

537
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
 So I invite you guys to invite your friends and family to come.

538
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
 And I saw that there are many hands.

539
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
 So you have joined ALVA, so you can serve ALVA as well.

540
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
 But if for those who haven't joined ALVA before, you also can serve.

541
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,000
 We have a lot of, like, a few different roles to serve ALVA.

542
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,000
 So that's why we have a training on 4 February.

543
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 Then we have a one-off training so that we can equip you all, come together.

544
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 We have one spirit altogether.

545
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 And then we can serve ALVA to bring gospel to our neighborhood.

546
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 And on 21st, the week right after Chinese New Year,

547
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
 there's a good start for us to winning ALVA.

548
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
 So, yeah, enjoy ALVA together, join and win ALVA together.

549
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 So sounds good.

550
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
 And if you would like to scan it later,

551
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:28,000
 our digital signage is always ready for your before and after service.

552
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
 So we can well use of that digital signage as well.

553
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
 And now is the time for us to have our offering.

554
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 So I invite our welcome team to pass around the packet.

555
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,000
 We have a lot of way to serve and worship God.

556
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,000
 We can serve as a church, worship team, production team, K4C.

557
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
 We can serve as bring gospel to other in ALVA.

558
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,000
 We also can serve by the action of giving.

559
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 That's why we always mention offering is part of worship

560
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 because that how we really use our whole to worship God.

561
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:14,000
 And that is a very good opportunity for us to, like from our heart,

562
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 to ask God, ask the Holy Spirit, "Oh, what do you want us to give?"

563
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
 We can give out in different way, different amount,

564
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,000
 in physicality, digitally, and also maybe serving.

565
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
 So why don't we just pray?

566
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
 Yeah, let us pray for our offering altogether.

567
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
 Father, we thank you for giving us this opportunity,

568
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 this great opportunity to contribute to your kingdom.

569
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:47,000
 Yeah, thank you for your spirit to let us know how do we respond.

570
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 We are not asked by anyone, but we are called by you

571
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 so that our giving, our contribution is used by you in your kingdom.

572
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,000
 So Lord, may you use it, receive it, and move us

573
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
 so that we are so thankful to join this in this way,

574
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,000
 to join your work in this city, in your kingdom.

575
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,000
 We are praying in Jesus' name. Amen.

576
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:21,000
 So today we have our lead pastor, Pastor Tim, to give us a message.

577
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:26,000
 So let us welcome Pastor Tim to come to stage.

578
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
 Yeah, why don't we stretch out our hand to pray for Pastor Tim

579
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
 before he gives our message.

580
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:39,000
 Father, we thank you for your ways of your leader to lead us.

581
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 And also you anoint Pastor Tim today to speak to us

582
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
 how we worship you personally.

583
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,000
 And we thank you for how you lead us to worship you properly.

584
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
 But now you open our heart and ear to listen to your words

585
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
 so that we can respond with our action.

586
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
 We pray that in Jesus' name. Amen.

587
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,000
 Hey, earlier I was taking back to my college days,

588
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 Shout to the Lord.

589
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
 So it's been quite a while.

590
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:16,000
 But that actually was a song where I fell in love with worshiping.

591
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
 And for me that was very special.

592
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
 So thank you so much for bringing this to us this morning,

593
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
 you know, to worship God in that way.

594
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
 Now, talking about university, while I was at university,

595
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
 I had a friend, a great friend, even to this day a good friend,

596
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
 who checked in on me.

597
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
 He asked, "Tim, how are you doing?"

598
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
 And I was doing okay, la, you know, it was okay.

599
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
 And then he, I said, "I'm okay."

600
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
 And he's like, "What's wrong?"

601
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
 I was like, "What do you mean what's wrong? I'm okay."

602
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
 "No, something's wrong, Tim. You should be happy.

603
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
 Jesus was always happy."

604
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
 I was like, kind of caught off guard and thinking,

605
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,000
 I was like, "No, surely Jesus wasn't always happy."

606
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
 I was like, "What about when he died on the cross?"

607
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
 And so that kind of ended the conversation.

608
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:11,000
 And we're still friends today, so it didn't end the friendship.

609
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,000
 But as I was reflecting on that,

610
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,000
 there was something in me just saying that I was okay,

611
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
 or him perceiving that I was not doing good,

612
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
 where it brought him discomfort.

613
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
 He felt like it was not right.

614
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,000
 And that's a type of misguided spirituality,

615
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
 where you think when you're a Christian,

616
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
 you always need to be happy.

617
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
 You always need to feel great.

618
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
 And even if you're not feeling great,

619
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,000
 you have to pretend like you're feeling great.

620
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:51,000
 And it can also have this toxic faith element,

621
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
 where you believe, "If I have faith, then I will not suffer.

622
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,000
 I will have no pain. I will have no difficulties."

623
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:04,000
 And so that somehow flowed into this conversation.

624
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,000
 Now, besides misguided spiritualities,

625
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
 actually our culture is not comfortable with pain,

626
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,000
 with suffering, and with grief.

627
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
 I remember in the US, you walk around,

628
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
 you say, "Hey, what's up? How's it going?"

629
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
 "Great!"

630
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
 And if you ever actually answer that,

631
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
 "Really, how are you feeling?"

632
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
 People are like, "I don't want to hear that, man.

633
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
 I just want to hear you're great,

634
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
 and I want to move on with my life."

635
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
 Right?

636
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,000
 So, even within our culture,

637
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
 there is this comfort, "Don't be a downer.

638
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
 Don't rain on my party."

639
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:49,000
 And so we're stuck with these feelings of grief,

640
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:54,000
 of pain, of difficulty, of sorrow.

641
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
 And we feel like we're not allowed to express them,

642
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
 and maybe we even feel shame for them.

643
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
 And so then we're not sure,

644
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
 "Can I bring this to my friends?

645
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
 Do they even want to hear about this?"

646
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
 Or maybe they want to hear about it once,

647
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
 but they don't want to hear about it a second,

648
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
 the third, the fourth, the fifth time.

649
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
 "Can I bring this to my Christian community?"

650
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
 Or do they also reflect culture,

651
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
 and don't want to hear about it

652
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
 after they prayed about it once,

653
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
 they feel like it should be settled?

654
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
 "Can I bring it to God?"

655
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
 Or is this a part of my life

656
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
 that I need to hide from God

657
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
 because I somehow feel,

658
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
 or my environment has told me,

659
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
 that I always need to be joyful

660
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
 and feel great and happy,

661
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
 and then when I struggle,

662
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:50,000
 it's a part that God does not want to hear.

663
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
 And this leads us to,

664
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
 a lot of times we don't actually know

665
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
 what to do with our pain.

666
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
 We don't know what to do with our suffering.

667
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
 We don't know what to do with our agony,

668
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:07,000
 with the things that we're carrying around in our hearts.

669
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
 And I just wonder this morning,

670
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,000
 who here woke up with tears this morning?

671
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,000
 Who went last night as you were laying in bed,

672
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:25,000
 was feeling sorrow?

673
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
 I think it's quite a few.

674
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
 I don't think it's just like one, two people.

675
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
 What sort of pain have you been carrying around?

676
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
 Maybe it's even from a long time ago,

677
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
 where this is just this thing

678
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
 that just has not gone away.

679
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:47,000
 What do we do with that?

680
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
 What I want to do with you this morning is,

681
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
 I want to explore with you a question.

682
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
 And the question is this.

683
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
 How can we bring our sorrows and our grief

684
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
 and pain before God?

685
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
 What does God's word teach about that?

686
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:05,000
 How are we supposed to process that?

687
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
 So today we're continuing in our message series,

688
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
 Fresh Encounter.

689
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
 We have been looking at fasting.

690
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
 So we also are doing this fast together,

691
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
 which I don't know about you,

692
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
 for me this has been very encouraging.

693
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
 I love doing that together.

694
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
 I feel really strengthened

695
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
 when I get to do this with other people.

696
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,000
 And I've experienced God in a deeper way in the season.

697
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
 I hope that is your experience as well.

698
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
 Then last week we talked about prayer.

699
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
 And we looked at Jesus,

700
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
 how Jesus encouraged the disciples to come and pray.

701
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
 And he encouraged the disciples with God's goodness,

702
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,000
 that we have a loving father who loves

703
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
 giving good things to the children who ask.

704
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:59,000
 And today our topic is personal worship.

705
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,000
 Now, one thing that we also want to do during the season is,

706
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
 if you've been in church,

707
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
 some of us have been in church for a while,

708
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
 some of us might never have been much in church.

709
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
 But if you've been in church for a while,

710
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
 it's easy to get stuck in a rut.

711
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
 Like to get stuck in routines, how we relate to God.

712
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,000
 But God wants to encounter us in fresh ways.

713
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
 We don't want to talk about experience from 5 or 10 years ago.

714
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
 We want to experience Jesus here and now.

715
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,000
 Because he's alive and he's moving and he's at work.

716
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:37,000
 So as I was thinking about personal worship,

717
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
 now the first thing that didn't come to mind

718
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,000
 was talking about pain and sorrow and grief.

719
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
 That's actually the last thing that came to mind.

720
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
 But I want to, first of all, I want to share with you a practice

721
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
 that is known as the prayer of lament.

722
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
 And then afterwards I want to talk a little bit more about

723
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,000
 why I concluded that as we're talking about personal worship,

724
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
 to talk about the prayer of lament.

725
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
 So here's a definition of the prayer of lament.

726
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,000
 A lament is a complaint to God.

727
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:13,000
 Yes, the Bible tells us it is okay to complain to God.

728
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
 And it shows us how to do that.

729
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,000
 It's a prayers of lament offer a way to approach God,

730
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
 acknowledge our circumstances,

731
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:28,000
 and the genuine feelings of sadness, grief, frustration, sorrow, and fear

732
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
 that overwhelm and consume us.

733
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
 Lamenting is an act of faith

734
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:44,000
 that calls upon God for transformation and redemption.

735
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:50,000
 Now what does personal worship have to do with lamenting?

736
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,000
 Well, for me, personal worship is really bringing all of our lives

737
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,000
 before all of who God is.

738
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,000
 It's bringing all of our, in every facet of our lives,

739
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:06,000
 showing our devotion to him.

740
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:12,000
 And that means that we also do that in the painful parts of our life,

741
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
 that we show our devotion to him,

742
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:20,000
 that we come before him and bring the sorrows, the pains,

743
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:27,000
 the struggling, the agony to the one who loves us

744
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:32,000
 and who can really do something about what we're experiencing.

745
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
 And I personally find when we engage with God

746
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
 in the most difficult times of our lives,

747
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:44,000
 that it is some of the deepest and most powerful worship there is.

748
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,000
 I was earlier moved, I assume you too, when Henriette,

749
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
 you heard what has happened, and she's up here,

750
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,000
 and she is leading us in worship.

751
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
 Now that's deep worship.

752
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:04,000
 That's not easy worship, but that's deep and real worship.

753
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:10,000
 When our times are tough and we're choosing to come before God

754
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:17,000
 with whatever is going on, that's an act of faith and it's an act of praise.

755
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,000
 Now today we are in the Book of Psalms.

756
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:27,000
 Now there is personal laments, there's also corporate laments.

757
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,000
 So the Bible actually teaches us how we can engage in this complaining to God.

758
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
 So we didn't just come up with that because we felt like it,

759
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
 actually God's Word leads us in that,

760
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
 and it shows us how we can do that individually,

761
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
 but it also shows us how we can do that corporately

762
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
 because sometimes there's things as a society,

763
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
 as a group of people that we are lamenting,

764
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
 that we are crying out to God for.

765
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
 But today we're going to look at a personal lament.

766
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
 We're going to look at Psalm 6.

767
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,000
 And Psalm 6 is attributed to King David.

768
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:06,000
 Now the Psalms is the prayer and the worship book of Israel,

769
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,000
 of Jesus, and of the church.

770
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:16,000
 Jesus actually, when he was on the cross, he prayed a lament.

771
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:21,000
 Psalm 22, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"

772
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
 It's a psalm.

773
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:29,000
 So Jesus was led by the Psalms,

774
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:33,000
 even how to bring his agony and his grief and his pain to the Father.

775
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:39,000
 And so we're going to see how the psalm invites us to bring those things that are heavy,

776
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
 where a lot of times we don't know what to do,

777
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,000
 to the God, and to see how God meets us when we do that.

778
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,000
 So we're in Psalm 6, and starting in verse 1 it says this,

779
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:56,000
 "Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger, or discipline me in your wrath.

780
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,000
 Have mercy on me, Lord, for I am faint.

781
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,000
 Heal me, Lord, my bones are in agony.

782
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
 My soul is in deep anguish.

783
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,000
 How long? How long?

784
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
 How often?

785
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
 How often?

786
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,000
 When we go through painful and difficult things,

787
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,000
 there's a thought that comes up in our hearts and minds,

788
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,000
 and we wonder, "Is somehow God angry at us?

789
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:33,000
 Is he somehow disciplining us or punishing us?"

790
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
 And we wonder about that.

791
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
 I don't know if you've ever thought of that.

792
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
 I have thought of that.

793
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,000
 I have thought of that as I've gone through painful experiences.

794
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
 Is God somehow disciplining me?

795
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,000
 Is there a sin that I need to confess, something that I need to sort out?

796
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,000
 And sometimes there might be, you know, where there's something we need to work out,

797
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
 but a lot of times we just don't know.

798
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,000
 And we feel like maybe there's a distance, and we're just wondering what's going on.

799
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:05,000
 Well, here in the Psalm, David, he doesn't confess any very specific sin.

800
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:09,000
 He does that in others where he's clear.

801
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:14,000
 So it seems that David is like, "Lord, I don't know if I did something wrong.

802
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,000
 Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath.

803
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:23,000
 Take this away. This burden is too heavy."

804
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
 The psalmist describes the circumstances.

805
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,000
 "For I am faint. My bones are in agony.

806
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,000
 My soul is in deep anguish."

807
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:45,000
 Now, throughout the Psalms, pain and suffering is described as physical suffering and pain.

808
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,000
 But it doesn't mean that it just refers to physical suffering and pain.

809
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:57,000
 Actually, a lot of times it's used as a metaphor to also talk about emotional suffering and pain.

810
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:04,000
 And so we actually don't know the circumstance that triggered this pain and suffering in David's life.

811
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:09,000
 If it's an illness or if it's something emotional, something else has happened.

812
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,000
 We don't know.

813
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:17,000
 But this is a cry, "I can't take it any longer.

814
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,000
 Do something.

815
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:27,000
 My circumstances, they're weighing me down and they're crushing me.

816
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:31,000
 How long?

817
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:38,000
 How long?"

818
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:45,000
 Now, that's the cry of someone who is at the end of the ropes.

819
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:53,000
 But it is also the cry of someone who is hoping God will act.

820
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:58,000
 So by crying out to God and asking God how long, David is expressing his hope,

821
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:06,000
 even if it is a faint hope, that God can step in and change his circumstances.

822
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:11,000
 So I lament as a complaint to God, as a complaint to the one we believe

823
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:18,000
 who can actually do something about what's going on.

824
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,000
 And this element of hope is important because when we cry out,

825
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,000
 we come to the one who can actually help.

826
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,000
 We come to the one who can meet us and deliver us,

827
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:40,000
 who can show us mercy, who can lift us out of whatever difficulty it is that we're facing.

828
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:46,000
 Now, ultimately, this is a plea for God's mercy.

829
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:51,000
 You see it in verse 2, "Have mercy on me."

830
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:56,000
 There's an Old Testament professor I like, and he comments on this verse.

831
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,000
 He says this, "When people in life are against us,

832
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:05,000
 we have nothing to turn to but God's generosity,

833
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:10,000
 his grace, his mercy, his love.

834
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
 He's the one that delivers us. He's the one that meets us.

835
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:18,000
 He's the one that has the power to bring us out, to bring us through,

836
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:27,000
 to sustain us when we are weak, when we have nothing left in our tank.

837
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:33,000
 Let's continue. Verse 4, "Turn, Lord, and deliver me.

838
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:37,000
 Save me because of your unfailing love.

839
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,000
 Among the dead, no one proclaims your name.

840
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:45,000
 Who praises you from this grave?"

841
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,000
 Now, the word that's translated as "turn,"

842
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:53,000
 actually a more literal translation is "return."

843
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,000
 So David is saying, "Return to me, Lord."

844
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
 He feels like God has abandoned him.

845
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:03,000
 He feels like he's on his own.

846
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:09,000
 "Return to me."

847
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:19,000
 And he also appeals to God's love, to his unfailing love.

848
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:27,000
 So when we lament, we also call on who God is and who he promises to be.

849
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:33,000
 God promises his covenant people, which is also us as Christians,

850
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:42,000
 we're in the new covenant, that he loves us, that he's with us, that he's faithful.

851
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,000
 And so we call on this, "Lord, you say you're faithful.

852
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:51,000
 You love us. Do something.

853
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:56,000
 Show me that this is real." That's what we're saying.

854
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
 And verse 5 kind of cracks me up,

855
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:05,000
 because David is making an argument why God should deliver him.

856
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:09,000
 He's basically saying, "I'm dead. Who can praise you?

857
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,000
 What good is it? You're going to lose some praise.

858
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,000
 So keep me alive."

859
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
 Let's continue in verse 6.

860
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,000
 "I'm worn out from groaning.

861
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:28,000
 All night long I flood my bed with weeping and drench my couch with tears.

862
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
 My eyes grow weak with sorrow.

863
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:37,000
 They fail because of all my foes."

864
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:44,000
 So right now the psalmist, or David, is describing just what he's been experiencing.

865
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
 It's also part of lamenting.

866
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:51,000
 We describe what we're experiencing, what we're feeling, what's been happening.

867
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:56,000
 And he says that he is worn out from groaning.

868
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,000
 I remember being in Calcutta.

869
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:03,000
 I volunteered at the home of the dying for Mother Teresa.

870
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,000
 It's like 20 years ago.

871
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:13,000
 And this hall was full of people who were in their last stage of their lives.

872
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:20,000
 And Mother Teresa had organized this space so that people do not die on their own,

873
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,000
 that they do die with dignity, that there's somebody with them,

874
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:30,000
 somebody caring for them, somebody who softens their pain.

875
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:37,000
 And I remember when I stepped in there, I mean the hall was full of groaning.

876
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:43,000
 Just worn out from the suffering of the sickness, the illness.

877
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:48,000
 I also am reminded of my father when he had cancer and he passed away in 2007.

878
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:55,000
 Just the groaning when the tumors were growing and pushing on nerves.

879
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:00,000
 So David's saying, "I'm worn out, Lord.

880
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:06,000
 I've got nothing.

881
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,000
 I have nothing.

882
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,000
 I'm an empty."

883
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:18,000
 And then it talks about the weeping and the crying.

884
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,000
 Now I don't know if you've had this experience.

885
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:26,000
 At night time, things settle down, we're not as busy, we're not as distracted.

886
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:31,000
 And then the stuff comes up that we're carrying.

887
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
 And then the tears start flowing.

888
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
 We start weeping.

889
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,000
 I've had that.

890
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:45,000
 I went through a difficult, the most difficult experience of my life, 2017.

891
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:50,000
 And almost every night I was weeping.

892
01:06:50,000 --> 01:07:02,000
 Every night tears were flowing.

893
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,000
 And so we described to God what's going on.

894
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:10,000
 Well, what's amazing when we do that, He's not scared of what we're experiencing.

895
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
 He's not scared of what we're feeling.

896
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
 He's not scared of our complaint.

897
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
 God can handle it.

898
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,000
 He invites us to do that.

899
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
 People might get uncomfortable.

900
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:28,000
 God does not get uncomfortable with your pain, with your suffering, with your struggles, with whatever's going on.

901
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,000
 God is a sympathetic listener.

902
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,000
 He becomes a partner in our suffering.

903
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:44,000
 By lamenting, we move from feeling we are alone to being in dialogue with God about what is going on.

904
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:50,000
 So instead of carrying around whatever is going on in ourselves, now we're starting to bring it to God.

905
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,000
 That's actually part of the healing process, just being heard.

906
01:07:54,000 --> 01:08:04,000
 Just putting name, naming what we've been experiencing, putting a name to it.

907
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:10,000
 And we can trust that God understands our pain, that He understands our suffering.

908
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:15,000
 We can know that because of Jesus.

909
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:21,000
 Pastor Ivan earlier read a scripture, talked about sharing the suffering of Jesus.

910
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:29,000
 Jesus was betrayed by one of His disciples, so He knows betrayal.

911
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:34,000
 He was abandoned by His disciples, where they all just left Him.

912
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:39,000
 He was spat on, He was beaten, He was ridiculed.

913
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:46,000
 He was physically, ultimately put to death.

914
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:55,000
 So He understands your emotional and your physical suffering, because He has gone through it.

915
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,000
 He understands.

916
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:03,000
 A lot of times in some of my experience I felt nobody understands me.

917
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,000
 But God understands you.

918
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:15,000
 But He also went through that, dying on the cross and rising from the dead to lead us out of the suffering.

919
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:30,000
 To turn things around, so that we can experience His healing, His forgiveness, His new life that He gives.

920
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,000
 And this is something that He can give now.

921
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:44,000
 Earlier as we were praying, I had this vision of Jesus walking around this room, laying hands on people's shoulders.

922
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:49,000
 Just doing healing work in people's lives.

923
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:54,000
 Just praying over us as a community.

924
01:09:54,000 --> 01:10:02,000
 So Jesus, He loves releasing His healing and His restoration of people.

925
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:13,000
 And there are some things where God's Word also promises that they might not get fixed on this side of our lives.

926
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:21,000
 But we have a promise that one day God will set, for those who believe in Him, for those who trust Him, He will set everything right.

927
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:26,000
 That there will be no more tears, there will be no more pain, no more suffering.

928
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:31,000
 You can read Revelation 21.

929
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,000
 Now there's a psalm that I came across.

930
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
 Interesting enough, it even came up in my personal reading.

931
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
 Psalm 56, verse 8.

932
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,000
 It says this, "You keep track of all my sorrows.

933
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,000
 You have collected all my tears in your bottle.

934
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,000
 You have recorded each one in your book."

935
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:55,000
 God does not miss a single tear that has flowed down your face.

936
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,000
 Not a single one.

937
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:02,000
 That's how attentive He is to you.

938
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:12,000
 In verse 7 it also says, "My eyes grow weak with sorrow."

939
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:22,000
 Now what this means when the Psalms talk about eyes growing weak, it has to do with that they've been looking for God.

940
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
 They've been waiting on God.

941
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,000
 But they're growing tired of looking out.

942
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,000
 So it's another called God act.

943
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:37,000
 My eyes are, I can't look much longer.

944
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:49,000
 And then to add injury to suffering, suddenly in verse 7, there's also enemies that pop up that have smart things to say to us while we're suffering.

945
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:54,000
 Maybe it's blaming you for what's going on.

946
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,000
 People always try to explain suffering.

947
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,000
 And then they try to find fault somewhere.

948
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:06,000
 And so a lot of times they put the fault on the person who's going through the suffering.

949
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,000
 Maybe it's somebody taking advantage of you while you're suffering.

950
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:16,000
 Maybe in your job or elsewhere.

951
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
 So this just adds.

952
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,000
 But let's continue reading in verse 8.

953
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,000
 It says this, "Away from me, all you who do evil.

954
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
 For the Lord has heard my weeping.

955
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
 The Lord has heard my cry for mercy.

956
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
 The Lord accepts my prayer.

957
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,000
 All my enemies will be overwhelmed with shame and anguish.

958
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:40,000
 They will turn back and suddenly be put to shame."

959
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:48,000
 So suddenly God's unfailing love, this love that David called for in verse 4, breaks into the situation.

960
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
 David has been hurt.

961
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
 God has heard the complaint.

962
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
 He has heard the mourning.

963
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,000
 And that changes everything.

964
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
 This is a turnaround.

965
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,000
 This is a turning point.

966
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:10,000
 Now we don't know how much time has passed between the lamenting and this line.

967
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,000
 A lot of times, sometimes God meets us immediately.

968
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:18,000
 Sometimes there's a longer period.

969
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
 But don't be discouraged.

970
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,000
 Jesus is at work underneath the surface.

971
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
 He is working.

972
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
 Don't lose hope.

973
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
 Hold on.

974
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:33,000
 He's at work in your life.

975
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:38,000
 And then suddenly, you know, His word will break through, His assurance.

976
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
 We don't know what happened.

977
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
 Did God speak to David?

978
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,000
 Did somebody have a word for him, come for him?

979
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:49,000
 Was he encouraged through some of scripture?

980
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:53,000
 We don't know.

981
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,000
 Now I've had an experience like that.

982
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,000
 I shared earlier that I've gone through a very difficult time.

983
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:07,000
 And I went to, attended a church and was worshipping.

984
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
 And I was stuck.

985
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,000
 I did not know how to move forward in my life.

986
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:19,000
 I -- my life had come to a sudden halt.

987
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
 I was hopeless.

988
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,000
 I just really did not know what to do.

989
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:30,000
 And I really didn't care even what happened to me at that point.

990
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:34,000
 And so as I was worshipping, I had a word from Jesus.

991
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
 And I've shared this here before.

992
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:41,000
 I'm not finished with you yet.

993
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
 But I felt like He was.

994
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,000
 I felt like it was over.

995
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
 He said, "I'm not finished with you yet."

996
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,000
 Now, were all my problems resolved in that moment?

997
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,000
 No.

998
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:57,000
 I still was in the same situation, but I was heard.

999
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:06,000
 Because God had spoken to me in my lamenting and my crying and in my worshipping Him.

1000
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:12,000
 And it released hope and courage to move forward.

1001
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:18,000
 Suddenly my perspective had changed.

1002
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:27,000
 And then God bit by bit turned my life around and just poured His goodness and His love on me.

1003
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
 So this is the transformative part.

1004
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:34,000
 When we bring our pains, our complaints, our sorrows to God in a prayer of lament,

1005
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:40,000
 that God, one way or another, at one point or another, that He meets us, that He speaks to us,

1006
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,000
 that He provides for us what we need to move forward,

1007
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:50,000
 to know His steadfast love in the circumstances that we're facing,

1008
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:58,000
 to know that He is going to see us through.

1009
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
 Now, at the beginning of the message, I asked the question,

1010
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:06,000
 "How can we bring our sorrows, grief and pain before God?"

1011
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:13,000
 Well, the Bible gives us the prayers of lament to show us how to do that.

1012
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:17,000
 And so we've seen that we can bring our complaints to Him.

1013
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:23,000
 Now, I want to share with you five steps of how can I do it, how can I lament, what do I do?

1014
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
 Just very simple.

1015
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
 And this might be something that you use as you pray.

1016
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:31,000
 This might be something you journal on.

1017
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:34,000
 So can we -- yes, thank you.

1018
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
 So the first one is a lament is addressed to God.

1019
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,000
 We're talking to God.

1020
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:43,000
 The second one is we bring our complaint.

1021
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:47,000
 We say what's wrong and what's frustrating.

1022
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,000
 We just say it.

1023
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
 And this is not about being theologically correct.

1024
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,000
 You just say it.

1025
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,000
 You just put it out there.

1026
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:02,000
 And then we tell God what we want from Him, what we want Him to do.

1027
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:10,000
 And then we describe your situation of distress, your weeping, your sorrow, your struggling.

1028
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,000
 Whatever it is, you just put it out there.

1029
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:19,000
 And then we end with a statement of trust, whatever that might be.

1030
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:22,000
 "Lord, I believe that You still love me.

1031
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,000
 I believe that You will meet me in this.

1032
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
 I believe it."

1033
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
 We just end with a statement of trust.

1034
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:37,000
 So those are five ways that we see in a psalm that we can lament, that we can pour our hearts to God,

1035
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:43,000
 and how the Bible teaches us to engage with those deep sorrows and pains that we're facing.

1036
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:49,000
 And I want to ask the worship team to come up.

1037
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:56,000
 And God wants to encounter us in fresh ways, something new.

1038
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,000
 That's what the series is about.

1039
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:05,000
 And God can do something new in our lives.

1040
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:13,000
 And He invites us today to bring to Him our sorrow, our grief.

1041
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:17,000
 So I want to do a ministry time.

1042
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
 I'll explain what we're going to do.

1043
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:25,000
 If you're experiencing something difficult, maybe something that's been going on for a very long time,

1044
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:31,000
 it's just still there, I want to invite you to stretch out your hand before.

1045
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:37,000
 I want to actually invite everyone to stand.

1046
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,000
 Maybe it's something, maybe it's just been tears this week.

1047
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:46,000
 Whatever it is, I want to invite you to stretch out your hands.

1048
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:50,000
 And then one thing that God gives us is also community.

1049
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:59,000
 I want to invite those in the community, if you see somebody with your hand stretched out as a sign of God's love,

1050
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:03,000
 will you just gently place your hand on their shoulder and just pray over them?

1051
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
 So we're going to do this.

1052
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:13,000
 We're going to pray over each other just for a few minutes, and then we'll go into worship.

1053
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,000
 So let's do that right now.

1054
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,000
 Let's lift each other up in prayer.
