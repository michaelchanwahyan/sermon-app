1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 focused on building up God's kingdom one life at a time.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 It is a church that has at the heart of its DNA

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 the grand narrative of the redemptive story of Jesus Christ

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 and that celebrates in the freedom and grace that such a story brings.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 This church is not constricted by the walls of a building

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 but actively engaged in the community it is planted in

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 desiring for God's kingdom to take root and bear fruit in local soil.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 A church that sees salvation as holistic

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 transforming God's people for God's work

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 and equipping a generation to represent God's heart

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 to the poor, the weak, the oppressed and the persecuted.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Imagine this church committed to seeing the family as integral

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 to all that it's called to be and do

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 involving intentional, committed and authentic relationships across all levels.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 It is the sort of place where both the young and the old feel cared for

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 supported and equipped.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 A church where people of all backgrounds and traditions

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 come to feel at home.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 A cultural mosaic that honors and embraces a richness in diversity

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 that marks us as the body of Christ.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 It is a church that is willing to innovate and express faith creatively

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 reflecting the boundless limits of God's creativity as glory to Him.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 A place where people gather hungry for the presence of God

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 and passionate to see this invade all aspects of their lives.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Where they seek to develop an intelligent spiritual faith

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 rooted in God's word and driven with prayer.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 A church that does not make its Sunday services

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 the exclamation mark of its existence

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 but instead the comma in its ongoing sentence.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 A time of service, love and engagement

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 that inspires and emboldens all equally for the conversation that lies ahead.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 A church that cares, disciples, rebuilds, renews.

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 This is our city.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 This is our church.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 This is our home.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 Yay! Happy New Year! Good morning everyone!

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Good morning everyone!

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Happy New Year again!

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 We have a group of people there waiting to go and waiting to sit.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 So, but today is the first week, first Sunday of 2024.

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Praise the Lord! Lead us to the new year.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 You know, this morning we finished a live 30th Kennedy service.

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 That's the new, new spirit came to us.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 I believe that that new will come to us in the English service as well.

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 We have a strong sense that God would like to let us to have his new spirit.

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 This is very fresh.

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 He want to refresh us.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 He want to remind us how beautiful and powerful he is.

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 How the spirit can come upon us and lead us to a new page and new life.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 This is very meaningful for the start of the year today.

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 So I would like to invite all of you to stand

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 and then we can have a prayer.

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 This prayer to really to lift up ourselves, our heart to God, to worship him, to praise him today.

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 Let's pray.

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Father, we thank you for this new.

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 You remind us how beautiful it is when our life being renewed.

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 Thank you for leading us today to worship you.

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 Thank you for your spirit.

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Now we open our hearts.

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 We open our hearts to connect with you through worship, through our singing

61
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 and through your presence with us all together.

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 We pray in Jesus name.

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Amen.

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Who's ready to worship God in 2024?

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Anybody?

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 All right, like that's a third of you.

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Okay, we'll try this again.

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 Yeah, let's do that.

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 Let's put our hands together.

71
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 It's coming on the clouds.

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 It's coming on the clouds.

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 Kings and kingdoms will bow down.

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 Every chain will break as broken hearts declare his praise.

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 Who can stop the Lord almighty?

76
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Our God is the lion, the lion of Judah.

77
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 He's warring with power and fighting our battles.

78

 Open up the gates.

85
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 Make way before the king of kings.

86
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 God who comes to save is here to set the captives free.

87
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Who can stop the Lord almighty?

88
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000

 Who makes the sun to rise and brings the earth new life.

132
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 In every beam, Jesus, it is you.

133
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 Who turns the day to night and watches me as I begin to dream.

134
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 Jesus, it is you.

135
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 Who brings me food for my table.

136
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 Who cares for all of my needs.

137
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Who walks the road with me and has grown with me through all that I have been.

00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 Jesus, it is you.

139

 Jesus, it is you.

140
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 So I lift my hands.

141
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 And I bring my soul.

142
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 All of my days, all of my rights, all of my wrongs.

143
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 I offer my life.

144
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 Here and beyond.

145
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 Oh, to the one thing true.

146
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 Jesus, it is you.

147
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 Who brings the light.

148
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 I want to do this again.

149
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Who sees my brokenness and carries me when I am frail and weak.

150
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 Jesus, it is you.

151
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 Who tells the storm to rest when I am overwhelmed and cannot speak.

152
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 Jesus, it is you.

153
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Who wears my guilt on his shoulder.

154
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 Who holds my heart in his hands.

155
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 Who takes my thoughts and fears and hangs them on the arms of Calvary.

156
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 Jesus, it is you.

157

158
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 I lift my hands.

159
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 And I bring my soul.

160
00:13:48,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 All of my days, all of my rights, all of my wrongs.

161
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 I offer my life.

162
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 Here and beyond.

163
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 To the one thing true.

164
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 Jesus, it is you.

165
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 I lift my hands.

166
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 And I bring my soul.

167
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 All of my days, all of my rights, all of my wrongs.

168
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 I offer my life.

169
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 Here and beyond.

170
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 To the one thing true.

171
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 Jesus, it is you.

172
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 To the one thing true.

 Jesus, it is you.

174
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 To the one thing true.

175
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 Jesus.

176
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 To the one thing true.

177
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 Jesus.

178
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 To the one thing true.

179
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Jesus.

180
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 To the one thing true.

181
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 Jesus.

182
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 To the one thing true.

183
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 We praise you.

184
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 To the one thing true.

185
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 Jesus, it is you.

186
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 I lift my hands.

187
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 And I lift my hands.

188
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 I bring my soul.

189
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 All of my days, all of my rights, all of my wrongs.

190
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 I offer my life.

191
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Here and beyond.

192
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 To the one thing true.

193
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 Jesus, it is you.

194
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 I offer my life.

195
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 I offer my life.

196
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 Here and beyond.

197
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 To the one thing true.

198
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Jesus, it is you.

199
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 When we lift up our hands, when we sing, we offer our life.

200
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 Because Jesus is the one himself to offer his life for us first.

201
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 For the first Sunday of the year, first week of the month, this is the best time.

202
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 We all together as a church to take the communion.

203
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 This is a time for us to remember, remember the grace, remember how Jesus sacrificed himself for us.

204
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 So now I invite, welcome him to pass around the bread and the cup all together.

205
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 If you are a follower of Christ, I invite you to take the communion together.

206
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 When you take the bread and the cup, this is a time for us to reflect.

207
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 To reflect how Jesus worked on us in the past, but also at this moment.

208
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 We can take some time, we can pray, we can reflect, we can ask the Holy Spirit to talk to us.

209
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 To see how much grace God gave to us.

210
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 In the Bible, Jesus asked his disciples in the Last Supper, he asked them to do this to remember him.

211
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 He took the bread, broke it, passed it, and he said this is the body he gives us.

212
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 And also the cup, he took it up, he passed it, and he said this is his blood for us to make the new covenant.

213
00:19:51,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 When we remember Jesus to do this, Holy Spirit reminds us, we are not only remembering.

214
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 That action we need to remember, that action behind is how Jesus sacrificed himself for us.

215
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 This morning when we are having a prayer, and the scripture comes to us in Revelation the first chapter.

216
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 It says Jesus is the firstborn of the dead and the ruler of kings of the earth.

217
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 And then following the first scripture is, to him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood.

218
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 And he has made us to be a kingdom and priest to serve his God and Father.

219
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 To him be glory and power forever and ever.

220
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 This is how Jesus through this, through his death and his restoration.

221
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 For us to be part of his kingdom.

222
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 But not only this, not only asking for us to be the people of his kingdom.

223
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 He also asked us, empowered us to be the priest.

224
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 To be the priest on the earth.

225
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 So we took it, we take it, the communion today is a remembrance of Jesus.

226
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 And also what he did for his world, for the world that he bring to us.

227
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 How he through his ministry, he bring the heaven to the earth.

228
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 So now, let us take a breath together.

229
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 (Breath)

230
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 Jesus, thank you for how you sacrifice yourself.

231
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 So that we can be part of your kingdom.

232
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 Thank you for broke your body.

233
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 So that we can through this to go into your kingdom.

234
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 Now we are going to take this cup to be thanks ourselves.

235
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 We commit ourselves to you because you set us free through your blood.

236
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 When we take this, we have the heart of humbling and repentance and confess that.

237
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 What we have done hurts you.

238
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 But now, you forgive us and save us.

239
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 Let us take a cup together.

240
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 (Breath)

241
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 Let's pray.

242
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 Father, thank you for this communion.

243
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 We understand how you love us.

244
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 And that covenant, that new covenant that you made for us.

245
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 For this year, this time.

246
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 You giving a new hope, new spirit.

247
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 When the world feeling hopeless.

248
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 But your new covenant giving new hope to this city, to this earth, to this world.

249
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 Thank you for first give us this redemption.

250
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 May you renew us through this.

251
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 May you renew us, our spirit to be connected with you.

252
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 May your Holy Spirit fill us.

253
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 We thank you for all this.

254
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 May you also lift up us voice to worship you and praise you for this song coming.

255
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 So that your spirit can flow here.

256
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 Your Holy Spirit flow here.

257
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000

284
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 Just want to have some space here today.

285
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 I know sometimes you just rush through all the songs, go through the motion.

286
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 But why don't we today here together we make space.

287
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 The kind of space for God maybe this is even the first time you talk to him this week.

288
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 He's waiting.

289
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 He's longing like a father.

290
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 He enjoys you.

291
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 He wants to talk to you.

292
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 Just going to take a minute.

293
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 Instead of rushing through another song.

294
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 Let's do what we're singing.

295
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 Let's make that room for him now.

296
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 (Music)

297
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 And we'll sing this one more time.

298
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 (Music)

299
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 And I will make room for you.

300
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 To do whatever you want to.

301
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 To do whatever you want to.

302
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 I will make room for you.

303
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 To do whatever you want to.

304
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 To do whatever you want to.

305
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 If you really mean it we're going to sing it one more time.

306
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 And I will make room for you.

307
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 To do whatever you want to.

308
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 To do whatever you want to.

309
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 And I will make room for you.

310
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 To do whatever you want to.

311
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 To do whatever you want to.

312
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 Here is where I lay it down.

313
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 You are all I'm chasing now.

314
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 This is my surrender.

315
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 This is my surrender.

316
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 Here is where I lay it down.

317
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 You are all I'm chasing now.

318
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 This is my surrender.

319
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 This is my surrender.

320
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 (Music)

321
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 Father we thank you for this love.

322
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 We thank you for your presence.

323
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 We know that this is not just emotional.

324
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 This is so real.

325
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 You come to us.

326
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 This is so real.

327
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 Your Holy Spirit here to fill us.

328
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 Because you are doing something real in our life and in our city.

329
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 Because you call us here as a community of faith.

330
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 You have your purpose on us.

331
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 You want to transform our life.

332
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 You want to transform this city.

333
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 You want us to experience your goodness.

334
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 So this goodness for us to bring to this community.

335
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 Bring to the earth.

336
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 That is what you are calling your people to go.

337
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 To do and to live out.

338
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 So Lord we thank you for this.

339
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 We thank you today you come to us.

340
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 And confirm that.

341
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 You are good.

342
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 And you are faithful.

343
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 Father we thank you for all this.

344
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 In Jesus name we pray.

345
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 Everyone says amen, amen, amen.

346
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 Why don't we give a round of applause to our Father God for Jesus.

347
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 And also we thank you so much for worshipping to meet us today.

348
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 Have a very renewable worship all together.

349
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 Please have a seat.

350
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 Wow.

351
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 Wonderful, powerful.

352
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 I hope that every single morning.

353
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 We have that kind of renewable spirit on us.

354
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 During the whole year 2024.

355

 We would like to welcome you.

356
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000

375
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000

00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000

 They are part of your work.

379
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 They are part of your kingdom.

380
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 So Lord may you lead them.

381
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000

 To serve these beautiful children all together.

00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 We pray that in Jesus name.

386
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 Amen, amen.

387
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000

456
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 >> Hello again.

457
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 I'm Ivan, by the way.

458
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 I'm one of the pastors of the Vine Church, Yuen Long.

459
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 I think it's so good to see all of you.

460
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 I know that some of you have just had a very good trip,

461
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 had a very good celebration time for Christmas and also Chinese New Year.

462
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 What now, first thing we would like to bring to you guys is

463
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 you need to fast.

464
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 It seems like, wow, I have been having a party all the time,

465
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 but now I need to go to a very spiritual.

466
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 But actually, I know that even though we are having fun,

467
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 we are also very spiritual if the spirit is with us.

468
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 But in the first month of the year, we have a tradition of the Vine.

469
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 We will have fasting period.

470
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 We have 21-day fasting every year.

471
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 So when we plan a church in Yuen Long, we also have this tradition.

472
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 When we sing, we break the tradition.

473
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 We are not breaking this because this really helps us

474
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 to have the direction for the whole year.

475
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 It really helps us to open our hearts, to receive God's Word,

476
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 to have a good connection, intimacy with God.

477
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 Pastor Tim will share more about how we fast in the message today.

478
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 But now I would like to remind everyone,

479
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 since tomorrow we will have 21-day fasting at the whole church together.

480
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 When we talk about the whole church fasting,

481
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 in the middle of this fasting period, that means next week,

482
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 we will have some prayer time.

483
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 We have some prayer time altogether.

484
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 Monday, we will have a prayer room.

485
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 So this room, this church venue, we will have a little setup

486
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 to help everyone anytime you come during that evening.

487
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 You can have a space to pray personally yourself.

488
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 Of course, there are ones who have other brothers and sisters.

489
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 But this is really a time we make room for God.

490
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 We make room to pray.

491
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 So we invite you, feel free to come.

492
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 And Tuesday, the day after, we will have our prayer meeting.

493
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 We will focus on prayer and also pray for the coming year.

494
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 We listen to God, how God needs us altogether as a church.

495
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 This is a corporate prayer.

496
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 And then after our personal prayer, and then we have a corporate prayer,

497
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 that is the time we go out to pray.

498
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 We at our church would love to serve.

499
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 So Wednesday will be the time we gather together first,

500
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 and then we will go out to have a prayer walk.

501
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 And then we come together to share what we receive from God.

502
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 So this is super meaningful.

503
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 So we invite you, set aside your time.

504
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 Any night or all night, you would like to join us.

505
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 Feel free, no pressure, but super encouraged.

506
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 You guys, we can pray together.

507
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 When we talk about prayer, fasting seems like your face is getting,

508
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 "Oh, no, we have something to celebrate."

509
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 Actually, fasting is also a celebration,

510
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 because we are getting connected with God very closely.

511
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 And then, on the 28th, actually this is the day we have our monthly lunch time,

512
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 gathering together, bring your own lunch.

513
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 We can have our time right there to have our community time.

514
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 And this is also the time, the day we are going to break our fasting.

515
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 So this is super meaningful.

516
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 If you want to connect us more,

517
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 if you want to build a relationship during the lunch,

518
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 please join us, set the time.

519
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 We can come together to have some celebration with what God brings to us.

520
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 Is it okay? Is it good?

521
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 Great. So now is the time we have our offering.

522
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 Yeah, I invite, welcome team can pass around the basket.

523
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 Yeah, when we worship, we can very sense that the joyful heart

524
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 and also the God is moving us in our heart.

525
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 He always wants us to be renewed.

526
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 And this offering also God gives us,

527
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 and then we can contribute to His kingdom by this offering with a new heart.

528
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 So I would like to have a prayer after the basket passed around.

529
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 I would like to pray for this with a new mind,

530
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 a new mind that this is not like an obligation,

531
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 like a tradition, religion things.

532
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 This is really what, how can we worship God with our heart

533
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 to contribute to His kingdom.

534
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 Is it good? So yeah, let's pray.

535
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 Father, we thank you for your provision.

536
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 You not only provide for our living needs,

537
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 you provide to our spirit as well.

538
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 When we do this, we know that this is part of worship

539
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 because we do it with our heart.

540
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 And we know that you will use this to best your kingdom, best your people.

541
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 We thank you so much. You include us in your good planning.

542
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
 This new covenant leads us to this serving.

543
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 So we thank you so much. May you use this in your purpose.

544
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 And thank you again for Jesus to lead us to have this kind of opportunity

545
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 to serve all together. We pray that in your name. Amen. Amen.

546
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 So now today I would like to invite Pastor Tim.

547
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 Yeah, come to us to have our, like a sermon.

548
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 I think Pastor Tim, he spent really lots of time

549
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 and his heart to really prepare for this message.

550
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 I would like to invite everyone, really prepare our hearts as well.

551
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 For this message, I believe that God is really saying something to everyone of us.

552
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 For the first day, first week of the year,

553
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 this is moving us in a direction that God wants us all together to go.

554
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 So I would like to invite all of you, stretch out your hand to pray for Pastor Tim.

555
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:15,000
 Father, we thank you for how you lead us and how you work on us.

556
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 We thank you for you build this church and you brought us to a new year.

557
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 We have that expectation.

558
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 You asked us to expect that you will work on our life.

559
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 So now we open our hearts to receive your message through Pastor Tim.

560
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 Lord, may you best, may you best, Pastor Tim.

561
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 May you best him to speak your words, to be the visual,

562
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:47,000
 to pass through this amazing work to us and that we can receive and that we can apply in our life.

563
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 We pray that in Jesus name. Amen.

564
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 Amen. Thank you, Pastor Ivan.

565
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
 Hey, Sanin Philok, Happy New Year.

566
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 So good to see you all.

567
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 So, as we start the beginning of this year,

568
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 I thought it was important for us to actually take a look back at what God has done in this past year.

569
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:16,000
 And I think that will help us actually step into what God has for us in 2024.

570
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 And so what I want to do is highlight some milestones, you know, in our churches life.

571
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 So let me share some with you.

572
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
 First, in January last year, we set out from Wan Chai.

573
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 We moved from Wan Chai. We were meeting there as a launch team.

574
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 Here to Yuen Long at EIS International Preschool.

575
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
 And we started our English service.

576
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 It was incredible.

577
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:49,000
 After that, or while we were at EIS, God did some significant things in us.

578
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,000
 He helped us to shift from being acquaintances.

579
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 We actually didn't know each other well.

580
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 To being a spiritual community, a spiritual family that loves each other.

581
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
 That knows what's going on in each other's lives.

582
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
 That was a significant shift.

583
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 We also went from being a launch team to actually being a local church.

584
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 Now during that time, we also had some amazing celebrations.

585
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,000
 We had our first child dedication, where we prayed and blessed one of our children.

586
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 We had our baptisms, our first baptisms, had an amazing celebration at the beach.

587
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
 And we also started live preaching.

588
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 On August 20th, we were able to launch our Cantonese service.

589
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 Now if you don't know, right from the beginning, we set out that we want to plant a church that has an English and a Cantonese service.

590
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
 And August 20th, we were able to get that started.

591
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
 God's work is amazing.

592
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:07,000
 I always say to Pastor Ivan, it's not easy to start a Cantonese speaking service coming out of an English speaking church.

593
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,000
 But God has worked in incredible ways.

594
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
 So this morning, we had our Cantonese service, it was amazing.

595
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,000
 Then in September, we relocated here to this venue.

596
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
 Now there is also a lot of stories behind that.

597
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:28,000
 It was such a struggle to get this thing ready and approved.

598
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:36,000
 And there was a point I prepared a speech to the whole church to say that we are not able to move forward with this venue.

599
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
 But then God came through and he provided for us.

600
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 And so now we were able to move in here in September.

601
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
 Yes, praise God.

602
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
 Michael Angelo Anu.

603
00:46:50,000 --> 00:47:00,000
 We also had our public launch before we were kind of in hiding, soft launch.

604
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
 But then we publicly announced that we have planted a church here and we are here.

605
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:12,000
 And then since coming into this place, we've facilitated Alpha in Cantonese and in English.

606
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:24,000
 We've had some collaborations or started to in some ways a farm with YWAM Shanty, with YWAM Harbor City, with Branches of Hope, with Oasis, with EIS.

607
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:34,000
 And so those are some of the partnerships and some of the work outside of this church that we started doing.

608
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:40,000
 And then one thing that amazes me, and if anyone would have told me that at the beginning of the year,

609
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:47,000
 we went from 35 people who were called from God to step out and launch this church,

610
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:53,000
 to being on average 166 people every Sunday and 31 children.

611
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
 And so to me that's amazing.

612
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:03,000
 And then finally we were able to start eight community groups, both in English and Cantonese.

613
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:09,000
 Places of connection, places where we can belong, places where we can grow in our faith.

614
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
 And so God has been amazing.

615
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
 He has done incredible work in 2023.

616
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
 He has laid a foundation for us.

617
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,000
 And so now we stand at the beginning of 2024.

618
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,000
 And how are we going to step into this new year?

619
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:31,000
 And I believe that there's a lot of things on God's heart for us for this year.

620
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
 But how are we going to do it?

621
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,000
 Part of our vision has always been that we're going to plant this church,

622
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,000
 that we love and serve Yilong, Hong Kong, our community,

623
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:50,000
 and that we would serve our neighbors in practical and impactful ways.

624
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:56,000
 We see ourselves especially serving ethnic minority and majority families.

625
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:03,000
 So we feel that God is giving us a family focus of serving people in the community.

626
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,000
 And this year, 2024, is really about fleshing that out, working that out.

627
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
 We really want to see this happen.

628
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:18,000
 We want to see parents' lives touched, children's lives touched, single parents' lives touched

629
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
 by the love of God, cared for in practical ways.

630
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
 But here's the thing.

631
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
 We know that we cannot do this out of our own strength.

632
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
 We cannot do this by our own wisdom.

633
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,000
 We need God to work in our hearts, in our lives.

634
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:45,000
 And so we desperately need the Holy Spirit to move, to bring unity to us as a body of Christ,

635
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:50,000
 to prepare us, to equip us, to mobilize us.

636
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:56,000
 You know, I as a pastor, I can try to encourage you to go and maybe we go a little.

637
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:03,000
 But it's really the Holy Spirit's work in our hearts that sends us, that mobilizes us.

638
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,000
 It's God's calling us into this work in 2024.

639
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
 I cannot do that for myself.

640
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
 I cannot do it for you.

641
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
 It's the Holy Spirit's work.

642
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:25,000
 And so as we begin the year with a 21-day fast, we're calling out to God to meet us, to speak to us.

643
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:33,000
 We're asking God for a move of His Holy Spirit to bring us in alignment with each other

644
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:40,000
 as we go out and serve and love the people around us in 2024.

645
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,000
 And this really is a cry of our hearts.

646
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
 God, we need you to work.

647
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
 We desperately need you.

648
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
 We cannot do it on our own strength.

649
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
 You know, it's you who changes lives.

650
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
 We don't change people's lives.

651
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
 God changes people's lives.

652
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,000
 If we rely on our own strength, you know, we're going to do some stuff.

653
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
 But I don't want to just do stuff in 2024.

654
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
 I want to see God move.

655
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:16,000
 I want to stand at the end of 2024 and say, "Wow, praise Jesus for what He has done."

656
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:25,000
 Where it's so clear that it was not us, but it was by the Spirit, by God's power that He was working through His people.

657
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
 That's what I want to see.

658
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,000
 And so as we're entering into this fast, we're expressing this longing.

659
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
 God, we need you.

660
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,000
 We need you for our own life because there's stuff going on in our own lives.

661
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,000
 And we need you for what you are calling us to.

662
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
 We don't want to move on our own strength.

663
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
 We want to move in the strength of the power of the Holy Spirit as we go out.

664
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:54,000
 So that's why we're beginning the year with a 21-day fast.

665
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
 Now this is part of the Vine Church tradition.

666
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
 You want to see God.

667
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
 You want to say, "We need you."

668
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
 We want to commune with God.

669
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:12,000
 And so we're going to enter into this year and step into this year having heard from God, having come into His presence,

670
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:20,000
 having possibly sorted out some stuff in our own lives that needs some sorting so that we can move ahead for what He has for us.

671
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
 You know, that's our heart for this year.

672
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
 That's my heart as a pastor for this year.

673
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
 I want to see God move.

674
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,000
 So I'm excited about this.

675
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
 I hope you're excited.

676
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
 I'm really excited about it.

677
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
 And I can't wait to see what God does.

678
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
 Now today we're beginning a new sermon series, new year, new sermon series, right?

679
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
 Seems like that's what we should do.

680
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:51,000
 And we've entitled the sermon series "Fresh Encounter."

681
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:57,000
 We want to encounter Jesus in fresh and new ways.

682
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:08,000
 As a church, and this is one Chai and also here in Yulong, there was a sense, you know, that Jesus was calling us to commune with Him in a deeper way.

683
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
 To draw close to Him.

684
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
 To really just sit in His presence.

685
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:26,000
 And so the series, we're going to have five practical ways, five spiritual practices that are going to help us to draw into Jesus' presence, to commune with Him.

686
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
 And so let me share the five things that we're planning on doing.

687
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
 So today we're going to talk about fasting.

688
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
 You know what that is.

689
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
 Next week, prayer.

690
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
 Then we'll talk about personal worship.

691
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
 Confession and repentance.

692
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
 Don't skip that one, that's Sunday, right?

693
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
 It's an important one.

694
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
 And God's Word.

695
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:55,000
 Now earlier before the service we were talking about, or somewhere, I actually don't remember where, but today is some time.

696
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:00,000
 We talk about, you know, it's easy in our Christian life to talk about past experience of what God has done.

697
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
 He did 20 years ago.

698
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
 But we want a fresh encounter this year.

699
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
 We don't want to tell stories from a few years ago or several years ago.

700
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
 We want to experience Jesus in new ways this year.

701
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:24,000
 So this sermon is going to challenge us to deepen our walk with Jesus.

702
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,000
 And even if we've been Christians for a long time, it's time for something fresh.

703
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:35,000
 It's time for Jesus, for us to ask Jesus to do something new in our lives and to hear from Him anew.

704
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
 So I'm excited about this.

705
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
 This is going to be good.

706
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
 Now today our topic is fasting.

707
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,000
 And we're doing a corporate fast, which means we're doing it together as a church.

708
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:55,000
 But we also want to invite you to personally ask the Holy Spirit, what is it that you want me to fast about?

709
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,000
 What is in your life that you need God to meet you for?

710
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
 Is there a relationship?

711
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,000
 Is there a sin that we're stuck in that for whatever reason we just can't break free from?

712
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,000
 Is there a decision that we have to make?

713
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
 Is there a favor in the workplace or something that we need?

714
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:21,000
 So I want to encourage you to ask the Holy Spirit, what is it that you want me to fast for?

715
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:27,000
 So what we're going to explore today through this message is three questions.

716
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
 What is fasting?

717
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
 Why do people fast?

718
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
 So let me start off with what is fasting?

719
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:42,000
 Now I don't know about you, but for me for the longest time fasting played no role in my life.

720
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,000
 I didn't do it for a long time.

721
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
 I actually can't remember when I fasted for the first time.

722
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
 It might have been my 30s.

723
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,000
 I was already a pastor at that time.

724
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
 But I never fasted.

725
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:06,000
 And I just didn't see the connection between me and fasting, between my spiritual life and fasting.

726
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:11,000
 And so I was surprised when I found out and was reading God's Word

727
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,000
 that Jesus actually assumes that his followers will fast.

728
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:20,000
 So in the Sermon on the Mount Jesus teaches a little bit about fasting.

729
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:26,000
 And he starts off that teaching section with when you fast.

730
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:33,000
 So Jesus is assuming that fasting will be part of Christians' lives.

731
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
 Now it's not a command.

732
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
 He doesn't say you need to fast.

733
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
 He doesn't say how often you need to fast.

734
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:46,000
 But it is assumed that Christians will engage in a spiritual practice of fasting.

735
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:54,000
 Now besides seeing that Jesus, that is something that he assumes that we're going to be doing,

736
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
 I want to take you to the Bible passage.

737
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,000
 And I believe in the New Testament it's the most important teaching on fasting.

738
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,000
 So we're going to go to Matthew 9 verses 14 and 15.

739
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
 It says this,

740
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
 "Then John's disciples came and asked him,

741
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:17,000
 'How is it that we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?'

742
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:23,000
 Jesus answered, 'How can the guests of the bright room mourn while he's with them?

743
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
 The time will come when the bright room will be taken from them.

744
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
 Then they will fast.'"

745
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:39,000
 So John the Baptist's disciples, they're observing, they're watching Jesus and Jesus' disciples

746
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
 and something just does not seem right.

747
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:47,000
 And they're like, why are they feasting?

748
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
 They're like eating a lot.

749
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
 They're having all these social engagements.

750
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
 But why are they not fasting?

751
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:02,000
 Because fasting, it's like the longing for God to move and do something.

752
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:10,000
 And actually the Pharisees, John's disciples, they fasted for the Messiah to come.

753
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
 They were longing for change.

754
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,000
 And so John's disciples are like, you guys don't seem serious.

755
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
 You don't seem serious about God.

756
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:26,000
 And so they're asking Jesus because he's a teacher and a teacher is responsible for their students.

757
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,000
 And I love, I always love how Jesus responds.

758
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
 He responds with a question.

759
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:37,000
 He says, "How can the guests of the bright room mourn while he's with them?"

760
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
 Now what does that mean?

761
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:44,000
 Why is Jesus talking about bright rooms and mourning and guests and all that?

762
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:50,000
 Well, during the days of Jesus, wedding feasts, they were seven days long.

763
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:56,000
 And if you were invited to a wedding feast, you were not allowed to do very heavy work.

764
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,000
 But you were also not allowed to mourn during that time.

765
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
 You're not allowed to fast during that time.

766
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
 It was a time of celebration.

767
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
 It was a joyous occasion.

768
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
 So you're not allowed to be the downer from the party.

769
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:16,000
 And Jesus is saying about himself, I am the bright room and the disciples, they're my guests.

770
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:22,000
 And it doesn't make sense for them to fast while I'm with them.

771
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:30,000
 But there's another important piece of information that we need to know to understand this whole bright room, guests, wedding feast thing.

772
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:36,000
 In the Old Testament, the prophets, for example, Isaiah,

773
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:42,000
 he talks about a time when there will be a banquet, when God will host a banquet.

774
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,000
 And it's when God's kingdom is fully realized.

775
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:52,000
 When his kingdom has come, his will has been done, and he fully reigns.

776
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
 His reign has been fully established on earth.

777
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
 And it's known as a messianic banquet.

778
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:03,000
 And Jesus, he's making a claim about himself, about his identity.

779
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,000
 He's making a claim that he is God with us.

780
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,000
 He's the bright room of that banquet.

781
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
 And he's here now.

782
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:21,000
 In the person of Jesus, the kingdom of God has broken into the present moment.

783
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:26,000
 And so it doesn't make sense for those who are with him to be fasting.

784
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
 This is a joyous occasion.

785
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,000
 This is actually what John the Baptist's disciples had been fasting for.

786
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
 That the Messiah would come.

787
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:39,000
 And so he's saying it doesn't make any sense for the disciples to fast.

788
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:50,000
 But then Jesus continues to respond to the question that was asked.

789
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
 He says, the second part of verse 15 says this,

790
01:00:54,000 --> 01:01:02,000
 "The time will come when the bright room will be taken from them, then they will fast."

791
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,000
 So Jesus is predicting his own death.

792
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:14,000
 He's predicting that he will go to the cross, that he will die, that he will rise, and that he will ascend to heaven.

793
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:20,000
 And then the disciples will fast during that time period.

794
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,000
 Again, it assumes that we will be fasting.

795
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,000
 But it changes a little bit the meaning of fasting.

796
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:34,000
 Because now the disciples are fasting in anticipation of Jesus' second coming.

797
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,000
 When this messianic banquet will be held.

798
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:46,000
 They're longing for God's work, his kingdom work, to be manifested in the present now.

799
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,000
 It's a cry for the kingdom when they're fasting.

800
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:57,000
 They're crying out for God to come and to move and for him to reign and for his will to be established.

801
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,000
 For his wholeness to come, for his peace to come.

802
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,000
 That's the character of the fasting.

803
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:15,000
 By fasting they're expressing through the hunger of their bodies,

804
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,000
 they're longing for moral, spiritual, social, political change in this world.

805
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:25,000
 For the manifestation of the kingdom of God to break into their present moment.

806
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:30,000
 Because in their present moment there are things that are just not right.

807
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:35,000
 And there is a deep longing in the heart for them to change in their own lives,

808
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,000
 but also in the lives of the people around us.

809
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:46,000
 Now this type of fasting is nothing else than the second and the third petition of the Lord's Prayer.

810
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:53,000
 Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

811
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,000
 It's a cry for the kingdom.

812
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,000
 So what is fasting?

813
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:06,000
 Christian fasting and prayer is the passionate pursuit of the not yet of the kingdom.

814
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,000
 The areas where God's will is not realized yet.

815
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:15,000
 A longing for the establishment of God's reign in our present moment.

816
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,000
 That's what fasting is.

817
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:23,000
 And when we fast we make ourselves available.

818
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:28,000
 Like we sang earlier, I will make room for you to do whatever you want to.

819
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:33,000
 We're humbling ourselves, we're coming before God empty handed.

820
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,000
 We say we need you, we desperately need you.

821
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,000
 Our city desperately needs you.

822
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:49,000
 And we ask for you to come and to meet us, to move, to bring change, to transform for redemption.

823
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:58,000
 Fasting is also a prophetic declaration of hope.

824
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:03,000
 That whatever might be going on, whatever our circumstances are,

825
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:09,000
 whatever seems like a lost cause, it is not the final word.

826
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:13,000
 So when we fast we make that prophetic declaration.

827
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:20,000
 Whatever is going on, whatever the circumstances are, this is not God's final word on the circumstances.

828
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:25,000
 Because we have hope, because we know Jesus is coming again.

829
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,000
 And Jesus is not finished with us yet.

830
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
 He's not finished with you yet.

831
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
 He's not finished with Hong Kong yet.

832
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:39,000
 He is at work.

833
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:46,000
 And he's longing and waiting for people to make themselves available to him.

834
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
 To just long for him, to long for his things.

835
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:53,000
 It's like longing for the kingdom, it's like longing for the works of Jesus.

836
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:57,000
 That we see Jesus doing the Bible to unfold in people's lives.

837
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
 That's my longing, that's my heart's cry.

838
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
 That's what I want to see happen.

839
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
 But I can't do it out of my own strength.

840
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
 You cannot do it out of your own strength.

841
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
 We cannot do it by our own wisdom, we cannot do it by our own power.

842
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:18,000
 But we can do it by the spirit of the living God moving and working through us, his people.

843
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:23,000
 So that is what fasting is.

844
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:28,000
 It's a cry for the kingdom to come.

845
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,000
 And it's us humbling ourselves and making us available to the king of kings.

846
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
 Saying here I am, use me.

847
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:40,000
 God loves working when we come to him and fasting.

848
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
 He loves us, he loves working through his people.

849
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:50,000
 He loves when we humble ourselves and say we need you, we want the things of you.

850
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:54,000
 So that is what fasting is.

851
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
 Now why do people fast?

852
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:01,000
 I'm going to give five reasons, there's more but I'll just share five.

853
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:06,000
 The first one is to release the Holy Spirit's empowering presence in their lives.

854
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:14,000
 Now you see Jesus, he was baptized, the Holy Spirit came upon him.

855
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:24,000
 And then in Luke chapter 4 verse 1 read, "Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, left the Jordan and was led by the spirit into the wilderness."

856
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:31,000
 So that in the wilderness he fasted, he only drank water apparently.

857
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:36,000
 And then in the end he was tempted and overcame Satan's temptation.

858
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:42,000
 Now I want you to note that it says he was full of the Holy Spirit.

859
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:52,000
 But then in verse 14, so just right coming out of the fast, read, "Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the spirit."

860
01:06:53,000 --> 01:07:08,000
 So there is a shift that Jesus is operating not out of his human strength but in the power of the Holy Spirit because he relied on the Holy Spirit.

861
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:16,000
 And so if we want to move in the power of the Holy Spirit and not out of our own strength, that's one of the reasons why we fast.

862
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:30,000
 Because we want and we desire to move in the spirit and not in the flesh, not in our own strength, by his power.

863
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:35,000
 Because he's the one that really can change things.

864
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:39,000
 He's the one that knows what's best.

865
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:45,000
 And we don't, we have selfishness and things in our heart.

866
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,000
 But if we move by the power of the Spirit, it's amazing.

867
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:55,000
 So we fast to release the Holy Spirit's empowering presence in our lives.

868
01:07:55,000 --> 01:08:01,000
 Second, we fast to become untangled from sin and experience victory over our lives.

869
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:05,000
 I'm not going to, I have a lot of passages, I'm not going to read every passage.

870
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,000
 If you want to keep track of this later on, really you can take a photo.

871
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:18,000
 In the Old Testament, there's many times where Israel, it's always like they are living right, righteously right.

872
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,000
 Then they sin and they're stuck in their sin of worshipping idols.

873
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:29,000
 And then they are confronted with their sin, they realize their sin.

874
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,000
 Sometimes a prophet even calls them, calls them out on it.

875
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,000
 And then they come before God with repentance and fasting.

876
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:42,000
 And God entangles them from their sin and allows them to move forward as a nation,

877
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
 allows them to move forward as individuals.

878
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,000
 And that the power of sin is broken in their lives.

879
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:53,000
 And so when we, so fasting and repentance is also linked in Scripture.

880
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:58,000
 So perhaps there's a sin that keeps resurfacing.

881
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,000
 You know, even when we're Christian, there's sins that just don't seem to be going away.

882
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,000
 They keep popping back up in our lives.

883
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:14,000
 And so when we fast, we can also ask God to entangle us and give us victory from sin, over sin.

884
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:23,000
 The third reason we fast is to become more alert and receptive to the Holy Spirit's leadership.

885
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:31,000
 And so an act that we're going to read this passage in a second, the church is gathering in Antioch.

886
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
 The Christian movement, it's brand new.

887
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,000
 You know, it hasn't existed for very long and it says this.

888
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:41,000
 While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said,

889
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:45,000
 "Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them."

890
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:51,000
 So after they had fasted and prayed, they placed their hands on them and they sent them off.

891
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:56,000
 And Paul and Barnabas went on to their missionary journeys to plant churches.

892
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:03,000
 But we fast to be more alert and receptive to the Holy Spirit's leadership in our lives.

893
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:07,000
 You see, a lot of times we have so much noise in our lives.

894
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:15,000
 Work, family stuff, Instagram, TV, whatever, music, whatever you do.

895
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:20,000
 We do all sorts of stuff, but a lot of times we're not very tuned in to God.

896
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:24,000
 But when we fast and worship and we carve out the space,

897
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:29,000
 we're actually open to what God is doing and we can receive that.

898
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,000
 We can receive words from God and direction from God.

899
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:36,000
 And so we fast because we need direction from God.

900
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
 This is why we're fasting as a church.

901
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:42,000
 Because we want to be alert and open to the Holy Spirit's leadership.

902
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
 We want to hear.

903
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,000
 We don't want to move out of our own wisdom.

904
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:58,000
 The fourth reason people fast is to seek God's guidance.

905
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:04,000
 A lot of times we find ourselves at crossroads or we need direction

906
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
 or there's something difficult to navigate.

907
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:12,000
 Here in this case, Israel had to navigate, had a dangerous journey that they needed to navigate.

908
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,000
 So they fast and they pray and they ask God for wisdom.

909
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:21,000
 And God answers their prayer and gets them safely to where they need to go.

910
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:25,000
 So you pray and fast for God's guidance.

911
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:31,000
 And then finally, we pray and fast to commune with God.

912
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:35,000
 That is actually the most important thing.

913
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:40,000
 It's to draw deeper in our relationship with God when we fast.

914
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,000
 And just commune with Him, spend time with Him.

915
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:47,000
 Here in this example, the prophet is Anna.

916
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:53,000
 You know, that's been waiting for the Messiah and it says in Luke 2, verse 37,

917
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:58,000
 "She never left the temple but worshipped night and day, fasting and praying."

918
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:03,000
 So she was communing with God.

919
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,000
 She was worshipping and drawing near to God.

920
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,000
 And so our fasting is also a drawing near to God.

921
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
 Just spend time with God.

922
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
 Just sit to listen.

923
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
 It's not us just talking all the time.

924
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
 It's about a relationship.

925
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:23,000
 You're like, "All of that sounds great. I want all of that in my life.

926
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:27,000
 How do I do it? How do we do this?"

927
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
 And I want to say one thing too.

928
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:35,000
 I don't want to give the impression that this is like fasting makes your wish list magically happen.

929
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:39,000
 You know, it really is a surrendering and coming before God

930
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
 and then He acts and moves how He wants to act and move.

931
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,000
 But He loves us and He's good and He loves giving us good gifts.

932
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
 Now I just want to make that clear.

933
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
 But how do we do it?

934
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:56,000
 So I'm going to have five steps, just simple steps for how you can enter into this fast.

935
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,000
 Later on, after this, we're going to also share a QR code

936
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,000
 where you can sign up for our WhatsApp communication.

937
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:09,000
 Through that, you'll get actually a guide that captures a little bit of what's on here

938
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,000
 that you can use to prepare for the fast.

939
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,000
 But let me go through this.

940
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,000
 First step is determine your spiritual purpose for the fast.

941
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:20,000
 You know, ask the Holy Spirit, "What do you want me to fast for?"

942
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,000
 Actually spend some time praying and asking Him.

943
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,000
 Where do you need God to change? Where are things not right?

944
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,000
 You need God to act and move in your life.

945
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:35,000
 Is there an important decision that needs to be made?

946
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
 Is there a need for healing?

947
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:43,000
 Is there a problem that requires a resolution or pattern of sin that needs to be broken?

948
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:47,000
 What is the Holy Spirit inviting you to personally fast for?

949
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:52,000
 And it's helpful to do that because then our praying,

950
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,000
 while we're fasting, can be more strategic.

951
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
 We actually know what we're focusing on.

952
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,000
 So that's for the personal fast.

953
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:06,000
 For the corporate fast, our focus is to ask the Holy Spirit to prepare us,

954
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,000
 to equip us, to unite us.

955
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,000
 We really sense it's important for the Holy Spirit to unite us

956
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:15,000
 between the counties, the English service, and us as a community

957
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,000
 for us to see if we can move forward into what He has for us together.

958
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:25,000
 To lead us, empower us for the ministry and work that He calls us to do in 2024.

959
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:30,000
 Of just loving and serving the people around us.

960
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:34,000
 So that is the first step.

961
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
 First, determine your spiritual purpose for the fast.

962
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
 The second one is, choose how long you will fast for.

963
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
 Well, we've chosen it's 21 days.

964
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:47,000
 But if you fast another time, just set a time, start small, build up from there.

965
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,000
 The third step, decide on what you will fast.

966
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
 What are you going to abstain from?

967
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:58,000
 Now, biblically, it is always food in the Bible as an example.

968
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
 And there are different types of fasts.

969
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
 I'm not going to get into all of them.

970
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,000
 The normal fast, which is you fast food and you just drink water.

971
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,000
 The other one is the Daniel fast, where you eat vegetables, you drink water,

972
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14,000
 but you don't have wine, you don't have steak, you don't have your candy,

973
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
 your dessert, whatever it is that you like.

974
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
 So it's very simple.

975
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:26,000
 So we encourage you, if you want to fast food, to keep it real simple.

976
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:31,000
 So whether the Daniel fast or skipping a meal a day.

977
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,000
 Like we don't recommend, especially if you've never fasted before,

978
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
 doing a 21 day fast of no food.

979
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
 If you want to do that, talk to your doctor first.

980
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:47,000
 Now, for some of us, maybe there's actually some issues around food.

981
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:50,000
 And that would actually be distracting while we're fasting.

982
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:54,000
 Or maybe the Holy Spirit is leading you to fast something else.

983
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,000
 And so, I have some questions for you to help you discern

984
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
 what other things you can fast for.

985
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:04,000
 What activities are crowding out your time with prayer and with God?

986
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:08,000
 What activities are becoming more important to you than God?

987
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,000
 And what's taking up your time?

988
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:18,000
 And if we're honest, we do all sorts of things a lot of times,

989
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
 but don't spend very much time with God.

990
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,000
 We spend so much time on Instagram, it's like the doom scrolling,

991
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
 it's like endless, right?

992
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:29,000
 Maybe we have different things as different people.

993
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
 But it's like, what is crowding out your time for God?

994
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
 And fast from that.

995
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,000
 And this brings me to the fourth step.

996
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:43,000
 So it might be Instagram, Netflix, sports news, whatever it is for you.

997
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:47,000
 So the fourth step is plan how you will spend your time with God.

998
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:50,000
 Because fasting is not just abstaining from something,

999
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
 it's actually making space for God.

1000
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,000
 And this is where I see fasting go wrong.

1001
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,000
 Like where a lot of people, for some reason,

1002
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
 we love like abstaining from something,

1003
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:04,000
 but then we don't actually spend time with God.

1004
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
 But if you want to do a Christian fast,

1005
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,000
 it actually involves carving out time with God.

1006
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
 For example, if you skip a meal,

1007
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
 maybe during that time you spend some time with God,

1008
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:17,000
 reading His Word, worshipping Him, going for a prayer walk,

1009
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
 just being still and listening,

1010
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
 whatever it is that you're meditating on a scripture.

1011
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:25,000
 But have a plan for how you will spend time with God.

1012
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
 And I also want to just keep it simple.

1013
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,000
 You don't need to break a world record of how long you do this.

1014
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
 Do something that you can do.

1015
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
 But have a plan.

1016
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,000
 And then the final one is be expectant of God.

1017
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,000
 God loves you.

1018
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,000
 He is your loving Father.

1019
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:48,000
 And He loves when His children come to Him.

1020
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
 He loves it.

1021
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
 He loves meeting us.

1022
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
 He loves speaking to us.

1023
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
 He loves providing for us.

1024
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
 And so we can come to Him in faith.

1025
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,000
 We don't have to beg.

1026
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,000
 We just ask Him like a child asks a father.

1027
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,000
 We just pour the things that are in our hearts out to Him in that way.

1028
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,000
 We ask God to move and to provide.

1029
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,000
 So those are the five steps of fasting.

1030
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,000
 And as I shared, there's a QR code

1031
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:22,000
 where you can sign up for WhatsApp.

1032
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:26,000
 And can we have the QR code, please?

1033
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,000
 So you can sign up to our WhatsApp community

1034
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,000
 and there you will receive those five steps that I just shared about.

1035
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,000
 It's also where you get your 21-day devotional

1036
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
 that we've created as a church.

1037
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
 Every day we're going to be sending out one.

1038
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,000
 Some of your community members have written one.

1039
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:49,000
 You might use that for that time that you're going to spend with God.

1040
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:55,000
 Now I want us to take a step back.

1041
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,000
 I actually want to invite the worship team to come up at this time.

1042
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:05,000
 And I was thinking, what would happen?

1043
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:10,000
 What would happen if we actually all would fast?

1044
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,000
 If we all would humble ourselves

1045
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:19,000
 and seek God at the beginning of this year through worship and prayer?

1046
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
 What would God do?

1047
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
 What would He do in our hearts?

1048
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
 How would He move?

1049
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
 How would He prepare us?

1050
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:31,000
 And then that picture is at the end of 2024.

1051
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:35,000
 That picture of standing there, looking back,

1052
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,000
 and just falling on our knees in worship.

1053
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:43,000
 Because it's so clear that what happened

1054
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,000
 was not something that happened out of our own strength.

1055
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
 It was God's work.

1056
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,000
 That God has worked this year in our lives,

1057
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
 in our community's lives.

1058
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
 Because we have come to Him.

1059
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:59,000
 We said, Lord, we desire for You to move.

1060
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
 Because we cried out for the kingdom,

1061
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:06,000
 for a manifestation of the kingdom to break into our here and now.

1062
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
 We said, Lord, we long for that.

1063
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,000
 We long for the things that are not right to be said right.

1064
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:16,000
 We long for people to experience healing,

1065
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
 physical healing, emotional healing.

1066
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,000
 We long for people to be brought into the kingdom.

1067
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,000
 That they can experience Your love and Your goodness.

1068
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:30,000
 And so I just picture us at the end of the year,

1069
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:34,000
 looking back and knowing that this time fasting,

1070
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
 this time coming before God,

1071
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
 God met us and He worked.

1072
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
 And I want to invite you all to stand.

1073
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:45,000
 And I want to challenge you.

1074
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
 I want to invite you.

1075
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:51,000
 Like I said, we come from different backgrounds.

1076
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
 Maybe like, eh, I don't want to fast.

1077
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,000
 But I really believe God wants to meet us.

1078
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,000
 He wants to work through this time together.

1079
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,000
 We get to be encouraged because we get to do it together.

1080
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
 You're not doing it on your own.

1081
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
 And I believe that through this fasting,

1082
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:10,000
 we're going to be able to step in a different way into this year.

1083
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,000
 We're not going to be operating out of our own power,

1084
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
 but through the power of the Holy Spirit.

1085
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
 So I would love to pray for you.

1086
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,000
 And I want to invite you to stretch out your hands before you,

1087
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,000
 just to symbolize just wanting to receive from God.

1088
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:29,000
 So Jesus, we thank you so much that you love us.

1089
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:33,000
 We thank you that we can come to you in prayer and in fasting.

1090
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:37,000
 That you love when we commune with you.

1091
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:41,000
 And I ask that you would take us deeper into our relationship with you.

1092
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
 That we would experience this year you in a new way

1093
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
 that we have not experienced you before.

1094
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,000
 I pray that we, there would be a move of the spirit among us.

1095
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:56,000
 We do something special, something beautiful, something fresh.

1096
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:00,000
 I pray for personal breakthroughs, Lord.

1097
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,000
 There's stuff where we need you to act now in our own lives.

1098
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,000
 I pray that you would move in people's lives,

1099
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,000
 that you would experience you like they have not experienced you before.

1100
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:14,000
 Most of all, Lord, we just want to honor you.

1101
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,000
 We just want to do this as I worship to you and say,

1102
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:22,000
 we love you and we long for the things that you long for.

1103
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:27,000
 So will you work and move as we come to you in our fasting and prayer.

1104
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,000
 I pray all of us in your name, Jesus. Amen.

1105
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
 I pray all of us in your name, Jesus. Amen.

1106
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:50,000
 [Music]

1107
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
 Let's sing this.

1108
01:22:53,000 --> 01:23:22,000
 [Music]

1109
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
 Once again, here's where I lay it down.

1110
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:54,000
 [Music]

1111
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
 I surrender.

1112
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:05,000
 And I will make room for you.

1113
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:10,000
 To do whatever you want to.

1114
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:14,000
 To do whatever you want to.

1115
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:21,000
 And I will make room for you.

1116
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:26,000
 To do whatever you want to.

1117
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:30,000
 To do whatever you want to.

1118
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:37,000
 And I will make room for you.

1119
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:41,000
 To do whatever you want to.

1120
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:45,000
 To do whatever you want to.

1121
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:52,000
 And I will make room for you.

1122
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:56,000
 To do whatever you want to.

1123
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:02,000
 To do whatever you want to.

1124
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:06,000
 So here is where I laid it down.

1125
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:10,000
 Every burden, every crown.

1126
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,000
 This is my surrender.

1127
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:17,000
 This is my surrender.

1128
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:21,000
 Here is where I lay it down.

1129
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,000
 Every lie and every doubt.

1130
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:30,000
 This is my surrender.

1131
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:36,000
 And I will make room for you.

1132
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:41,000
 To do whatever you want to.

1133
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:45,000
 To do whatever you want to.

1134
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:51,000
 And I will make room for you.

1135
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:56,000
 To do whatever you want to.

1136
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:00,000
 To do whatever you want to.

1137
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:07,000
 And I will make room for you.

1138
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:11,000
 To do whatever you want to.

1139
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:15,000
 To do whatever you want to.

1140
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:22,000
 And I will make room for you.

1141
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:26,000
 To do whatever you want to.

1142
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:31,000
 To do whatever you want to.

1143
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:36,000
 Shake off the ground of all my traditions.

1144
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:40,000
 Break down the walls of all my religion.

1145
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:46,000
 Your way is better.

1146
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:50,000
 Shake off the ground of all my traditions.

1147
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:54,000
 Break down the walls of all my religion.

1148
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:58,000
 Your way is better.

1149
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,000
 Yes God come and shake it up.

1150
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:05,000
 Shake off the ground of all my traditions.

1151
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:09,000
 Break down the walls of all my religion.

1152
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
 Your way is better.

1153
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,000
 Your way is better.

1154
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:18,000
 One last time shake off, shake off the ground.

1155
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
 Of all my traditions.

1156
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,000
 Break down the walls of all my religion.

1157
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:27,000
 Your way is better.

1158
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:30,000
 Your way is better.

1159
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:36,000
 And I will make room for you.

1160
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,000
 To do whatever you want to.

1161
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:44,000
 To do whatever you want to.

1162
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:50,000
 And I will make room for you.

1163
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:55,000
 To do whatever you want to.

1164
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:58,000
 To do whatever you want to.

1165
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
 Let's sing this one more time.

1166
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:06,000
 And I will make room for you.

1167
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:11,000
 To do whatever you want to.

1168
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:22,000
 And here is where I lay it down.

1169
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:26,000
 You are all I'm chasing now.

1170
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,000
 This is my surrender.

1171
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:33,000
 This is my surrender.

1172
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:38,000
 Here is where I lay it down.

1173
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:42,000
 You are all I'm chasing now.

1174
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,000
 This is my surrender.

1175
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:49,000
 This is my surrender.

1176
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:54,000
 Yes Father this is where we lay it down.

1177
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:59,000
 This is where and how we get encounter to you.

1178
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:03,000
 Father we thank you for giving us this freedom.

1179
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
 This is a freedom for us to make a decision.

1180
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
 To make room.

1181
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:11,000
 This is a freedom for us to set aside something in our life.

1182
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
 In our daily life.

1183
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:17,000
 In some pattern that we were stuck in.

1184
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:24,000
 But now you give us freedom to have a new life through this fasting period.

1185
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:28,000
 Father we thank you for giving us freedom.

1186
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:32,000
 To go into a new season, a new page.

1187
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:35,000
 Father we thank you for all this.

1188
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,000
 Thank you for today you talk to us.

1189
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:48,000
 We really thank you for how you, how your spirit really leading us to something new.

1190
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,000
 So Lord we commit ourselves to you.

1191
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:57,000
 You show us how we can get encounter to you more closer and closer.

1192
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:02,000
 You love us and you are always there for us.

1193
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
 We pray that in Jesus name.

1194
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,000
 Amen. Amen.
