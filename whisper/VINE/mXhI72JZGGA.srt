00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Sandlin Feilok, Happy New Year!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 So good to see you all.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 So, as we start the beginning of this year,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 I thought it was important for us to actually take a look back

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 at what God has done in this past year.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 And I think that will help us actually step into what God has for us in 2024.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 And so what I want to do is highlight some milestones

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 in our church's life.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 So let me share some with you.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 First, in January last year, we set out from Wan Chai.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 We moved from Wan Chai. We were meeting there as a launch team.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Here to Yuen Long at EIS International Preschool.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 And we started our English service.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 It was incredible.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 After that, or while we were at EIS,

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 God did some significant things in us.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 He helped us to shift from being acquaintances.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 We actually didn't know each other that well.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 To being a spiritual community, a spiritual family that loves each other.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 That knows what's going on in each other's lives.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 That was a significant shift.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 We also went from being a launch team

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 to actually being a local church.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Now during that time, we also had some amazing celebrations.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 We had our first child dedication.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 We prayed and blessed one of our children.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 We had our baptisms, our first baptisms.

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Had an amazing celebration at the beach.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 And we also started live preaching.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 On August 20th, we were able to launch our Cantonese service.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Now if you don't know, right from the beginning,

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 we set out that we want to plant a church

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 that has an English and a Cantonese service.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 And August 20th, we were able to get that started.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 And I really, God's work is amazing.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Because I always say to Pastor Ivan,

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 it's not easy to start a Cantonese speaking service

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 coming out of an English speaking church.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 But God has worked in incredible ways.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 And so this morning, we had our Cantonese service.

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 It was amazing.

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Then in September, we relocated here to this venue.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Now there is also a lot of stories behind that.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 It was such a struggle to get this thing ready and approved.

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 And there was a point I prepared a speech to the whole church

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 to say that we are not able to move forward with this venue.

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 But then God came through and he provided for us.

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 And so now we were able to move in here in September.

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Yes, praise God.

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Michael Angelo Anu.

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 We also had our public launch.

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Before we were kind of in hiding, soft launch.

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 But then we publicly announced that we have planted a church here

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 and we are here.

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 And then since coming into this place,

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 we've facilitated Alpha in Cantonese and in English.

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 We've had some collaborations or started to in some ways

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 a farm with YWAM Shanty, with YWAM Harbor City,

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 with Branches of Hope, with Oasis, with EIS.

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 And so those are some of the partnerships

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 and some of the work outside of this church that we started doing.

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 And then one thing that amazes me,

63
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 and if anyone would have told me that at the beginning of the year,

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 is we went from 35 people who were called from God

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 to step out and launch this church,

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 to being on average 166 people every Sunday and 31 children.

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 And so to me that's amazing.

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 And then finally we were able to start eight community groups,

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 both in English and in Cantonese, places of connection,

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 places where we can belong, places where we can grow in our faith.

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 And so God has been amazing.

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 He has done incredible work in 2023.

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 He has laid a foundation for us.

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 And so now we stand at the beginning of 2024.

75
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 And how are we going to step into this new year?

76
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 And I believe that there's a lot of things on God's heart for us for this year.

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 But how are we going to do it?

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 Part of our vision has always been

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 that we're going to plant this church,

80
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 that we love and serve Yulong, Hong Kong, our community,

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 and that we would serve our neighbors in practical and impactful ways.

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 We see ourselves especially serving ethnic minority and majority families.

83
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 So we feel that God is giving us a family focus

84
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 of serving people in the community.

85
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 And this year, 2024, is really about fleshing that out,

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 working that out.

87
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 We really want to see this happen.

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 We want to see parents' lives touched,

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 children's lives touched, single parents' lives touched

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 by the love of God, cared for in practical ways.

91
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 But here's the thing.

92
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 We know that we cannot do this out of our own strength.

93
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 We cannot do this by our own wisdom.

94
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 We need God to work in our hearts, in our lives.

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 And so we desperately need the Holy Spirit to move,

96
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 to bring unity to us as a body of Christ,

97
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 to prepare us, to equip us, to mobilize us.

98
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 You know, I as a pastor, I can try to encourage you to go,

99
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 and maybe we go a little,

100
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 but it's really the Holy Spirit's work in our hearts

101
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 that sends us, that mobilizes us.

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 It's God's calling us into this work in 2024.

103
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 I cannot do that for myself.

104
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 I cannot do it for you.

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 It's the Holy Spirit's work.

106
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 And so as we begin the year with a 21-day fast,

107
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 we're calling out to God to meet us, to speak to us.

108
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 We're asking God for a move of His Holy Spirit

109
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 to bring us in alignment with each other

110
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 as we go out and serve and love the people around us in 2024.

111
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 And this really is a cry of our hearts.

112
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 God, we need you to work.

113
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 We desperately need you.

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 We cannot do it on our own strength.

115
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 You know, it's you who changes lives.

116
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 We don't change people's lives.

117
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 God changes people's lives.

118
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 If we rely on our own strength, you know,

119
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 we're going to do some stuff,

120
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 but I don't want to just do stuff in 2024.

121
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 I want to see God move.

122
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 I want to stand at the end of 2024 and say,

123
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 "Wow, praise Jesus for what He has done."

124
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 Where it's so clear that it was not us,

125
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 but it was by the Spirit, by God's power

126
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 that He was working through His people.

127
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 That's what I want to see.

128
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 And so as we're entering into this fast,

129
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 we're expressing this longing.

130
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 God, we need you.

131
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 We need you for our own life,

132
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 because there's stuff going on in our own lives,

133
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 and we need you for what you are calling us to.

134
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 We don't want to move on our own strength.

135
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 We want to move in the strength of the power of the Holy Spirit

136
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 as we go out.

137
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 So that's why we're beginning the year with a 21-day fast.

138
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 Now, this is part of the Vine Church tradition.

139
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 You want to see God.

140
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 You want to say, "We need you."

141
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 We want to commune with God.

142
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 And so we're going to enter into this year

143
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 and step into this year having heard from God,

144
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 having come into His presence,

145
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 having possibly sorted out some stuff in our own lives

146
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 that needs some sorting

147
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 so that we can move ahead for what He has for us.

148
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 You know, that's our heart for this year.

149
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 That's my heart as your pastor for this year.

150
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 I want to see God move.

151
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 So I'm excited about this.

152
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 I hope you're excited.

153
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 I'm really excited about it.

154
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 And I can't wait to see what God does.

155
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 Now, today we're beginning a new sermon series,

156
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 new year, new sermon series, right?

157
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 Seems like that's what we should do.

158
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 And we've entitled the sermon series "Fresh Encounter."

159
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 We want to encounter Jesus in fresh and new ways.

160
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 As a church, and this is one Chai and also Hyunhee Long,

161
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 there was a sense, you know,

162
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 that Jesus was calling us to commune with Him in a deeper way,

163
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 to draw close to Him,

164
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 to really just sit in His presence.

165
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 And so the series, we're going to have five practical ways,

166
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 five spiritual practices

167
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 that are going to help us to draw into Jesus' presence,

168
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 to commune with Him.

169
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 And so let me share the five things that we're planning on doing.

170
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 So today we're going to talk about fasting.

171
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 You know what that is.

172
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Next week, prayer.

173
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Then we'll talk about personal worship,

174
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 confession and repentance.

175
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 Don't skip that one, that Sunday, right?

176
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 It's an important one.

177
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 And God's Word.

178
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 Now earlier before the service,

179
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 we were talking about -- or somewhere, I actually don't remember where,

180
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 but today is some time.

181
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 We talk about, you know, it's easy in our Christian life

182
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 to talk about past experience of what God has done,

183
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 He did 20 years ago.

184
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 But we want a fresh encounter this year.

185
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 We don't want to tell stories from a few years ago or several years ago.

186
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 We want to experience Jesus in new ways this year.

187
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 So this sermon is going to challenge us to deepen our walk with Jesus.

188
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 And even if we've been Christians for a long time,

189
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 it's time for something fresh.

190
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 It's time for Jesus, for us to ask Jesus to do something new in our lives

191
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 and hear from Him anew.

192
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 So I'm excited about this.

193
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 This is going to be good.

194
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 Now today our topic is fasting, and we're doing a corporate fast,

195
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 which means we're doing it together as a church.

196
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 But we also want to invite you to personally ask the Holy Spirit,

197
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 what is it that you want me to fast about?

198
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 What is in your life that you need God to meet you for?

199
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Is there a relationship?

200
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Is there a sin that we're stuck in that for whatever reason

201
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 we just can't break free from?

202
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 Is there a decision that we have to make?

203
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 Is there a favor in the workplace or something that we need?

204
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 So I want to encourage you to ask the Holy Spirit,

205
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 what is it that you want me to fast for?

206
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 So what we're going to explore today through this message is three questions.

207
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 What is fasting?

208
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 Why do people fast?

209
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 And how do I do it?

210
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 So let me start off with what is fasting?

211
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 Now, I don't know about you, but for me, for the longest time,

212
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 fasting played no role in my life.

213
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 I didn't do it for a long time.

214
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 I actually can't remember when I fasted for the first time.

215
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 It might have been my 30s.

216
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 I was already a pastor at that time.

217
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 But I never fasted.

218
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 And I just didn't see the connection between me and fasting,

219
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 between my spiritual life and fasting.

220
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 And so I was surprised when I found out and was reading God's word

221
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 that Jesus actually assumes that his followers will fast.

222
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 So in the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus teaches a little bit about fasting.

223
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 And he starts off that teaching section with, "When you fast."

224
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 So Jesus is assuming that fasting will be part of Christians' lives.

225
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 Now, it's not a command.

226
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 He doesn't say, "You need to fast."

227
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 He doesn't say how often you need to fast.

228
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 But it is assumed that Christians will engage in a spiritual practice of fasting.

229
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Now, besides seeing that Jesus--that is something that he assumes

230
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 that we're going to be doing, I want to take you to the Bible passage

231
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 that I believe in the New Testament is the most important teaching on fasting.

232
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 So we're going to go to Matthew 9, verses 14 and 15.

233
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 It says this, "Then John's disciples came and asked him,

234
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 'How is it that we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?'

235
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 Jesus answered, 'How can the guests of the bright room mourn while he's with them?

236
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 The time will come when the bright room will be taken from them.

237
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 Then they will fast.'"

238
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 So John the Baptist's disciples, they're observing, they're watching Jesus

239
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 and Jesus' disciples, and something just does not seem right.

240
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 And they're like, "Why are they feasting?"

241
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 They're like eating a lot.

242
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 They're having all these social engagements.

243
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 But why are they not fasting?

244
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 Because fasting--see, it's like the longing for God to move and do something.

245
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 And actually, the Pharisees, John's disciples, they fasted for the Messiah to come.

246
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 They were longing for change.

247
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 And so John's disciples are like, "You guys don't seem serious.

248
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 You don't seem serious about God."

249
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 And so they're asking Jesus because he's the teacher,

250
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 and the teacher is responsible for their students.

251
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 And I always love how Jesus responds.

252
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 He responds with a question.

253
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 He says, "How can the guests of the bright room mourn while he's with them?"

254
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 Now what does that mean?

255
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 Why is Jesus talking about bright rooms and mourning and guests and all that?

256
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 Well, during the days of Jesus, wedding feasts, they were seven days long.

257
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 And if you were invited to a wedding feast, you were not allowed to do very heavy work,

258
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 but you were also not allowed to mourn during that time.

259
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 You were not allowed to fast during that time.

260
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 It was a time of celebration.

261
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 It was a joyous occasion.

262
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 So you're not allowed to be the downer from the party.

263
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 And Jesus is saying about himself, "I am the bright room."

264
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 And the disciples, they're my guests.

265
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 And it doesn't make sense for them to fast while I'm with them.

266
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 But there's another important piece of information that we need to know to understand this

267
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 whole bright room, guests, wedding feast thing.

268
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 In the Old Testament, the prophets, for example, Isaiah,

269
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 he talks about a time when there will be a banquet,

270
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 when God will host a banquet.

271
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 And it's when God's kingdom is fully realized.

272
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 When his kingdom has come, his will has been done, and he fully reigns.

273
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 His reign has been fully established on earth.

274
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 And it's known as a messianic banquet.

275
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 And Jesus, he's making a claim about himself, about his identity.

276
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 He's making a claim that he is God with us.

277
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 He's the bright room of that banquet.

278
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 And he's here now.

279
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 In the person of Jesus, the kingdom of God has broken into the present moment.

280
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 And so it doesn't make sense for those who are with him to be fasting.

281
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 This is a joyous occasion.

282
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 This is actually what John the Baptist's disciples had been fasting for,

283
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 that the Messiah would come.

284
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 And so he's saying it doesn't make any sense for the disciples to fast.

285
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 But then Jesus continues to respond to the question that was asked.

286
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 He says, the second part of verse 15 says this,

287
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 "The time will come when the bright room will be taken from them.

288
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 Then they will fast."

289
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 So Jesus is predicting his own death.

290
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 He's predicting that he will go to the cross, that he will die,

291
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 that he will rise, and that he will ascend to heaven.

292
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 And then the disciples will fast during that time period.

293
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 Again, it assumes that we will be fasting.

294
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 But it changes a little bit the meaning of fasting,

295
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 because now the disciples are fasting in anticipation of Jesus' second coming,

296
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 when this messianic banquet will be held.

297
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 They're longing for God's work, his kingdom work, to be manifested in the present now.

298
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 It's a cry for the kingdom when they're fasting.

299
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 They're crying out for God to come and to move and for him to reign

300
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 and for his will to be established, for his wholeness to come, for his peace to come.

301
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 That's the character of the fasting.

302
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 By fasting, they're expressing through the hunger of their bodies

303
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 the longing for moral, spiritual, social, political change in this world,

304
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 for the manifestation of the kingdom of God to break into their present moment,

305
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 because in their present moment, there are things that are just not right.

306
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 And there is a deep longing in the heart for them to change in their own lives,

307
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 but also in the lives of the people around us.

308
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 Now, this type of fasting is nothing else than the second and the third petition of the Lord's Prayer.

309
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 "Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven."

310
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 It's a cry for the kingdom.

311
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 So what is fasting?

312
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 Christian fasting and prayer is the passionate pursuit of the not yet of the kingdom,

313
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 the areas where God's will is not realized yet,

314
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 a longing for the establishment of God's reign in our present moment.

315
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 That's what fasting is.

316
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 And when we fast, we make ourselves available.

317
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 Like we sang earlier, I will make room for you to do whatever you want to.

318
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 We're humbling ourselves.

319
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 We're coming before God empty-handed.

320
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 We say, "We need you.

321
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 We desperately need you.

322
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 Our city desperately needs you."

323
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 And we ask for you to come and to meet us, to move,

324
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 to bring change, to transform, for redemption.

325
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 Fasting is also a prophetic declaration of hope

326
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 that whatever might be going on, whatever our circumstances are,

327
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 whatever seems like a lost cause, it is not the final word.

328
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 So when we fast, we make that prophetic declaration.

329
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 Whatever is going on, whatever the circumstances are,

330
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 this is not God's final word on the circumstances.

331
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 Because we have hope, because we know Jesus is coming again.

332
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 And Jesus is not finished with us yet.

333
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 He's not finished with you yet.

334
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 He's not finished with Hong Kong yet.

335
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 He is at work.

336
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 And he's longing and waiting for people to make themselves available to him,

337
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 to just long for him, to long for his things.

338
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 It's like longing for the kingdom.

339
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 It's like longing for the works of Jesus,

340
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 that we see Jesus doing the Bible to unfold in people's lives.

341
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 That's my longing.

342
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 That's my heart's cry.

343
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 That's what I want to see happen.

344
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 But I can't do it out of my own strength.

345
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 You cannot do it out of your own strength.

346
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 We cannot do it by our own wisdom.

347
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 We cannot do it by our own power.

348
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 But we can do it by the spirit of the living God moving and working through us,

349
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 his people.

350
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 So that is what fasting is.

351
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 It's a cry for the kingdom to come.

352
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 And it's us humbling ourselves and making us available to the king of kings,

353
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 saying, "Here I am.

354
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 Use me."

355
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 God loves working when we come to him and fasting.

356
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 He loves us.

357
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 He loves working through his people.

358
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 He loves when we humble ourselves and say, "We need you.

359
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 We want the things of you."

360
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 So that is what fasting is.

361
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 Now, why do people fast?

362
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 I'm going to give five reasons.

363
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 There's more, but I'll just share five.

364
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 The first one is to release the Holy Spirit's empowering presence in their lives.

365
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Now, you see, Jesus, he was baptized.

366
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 The Holy Spirit came upon him.

367
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 And then in Luke 4, verse 1, we read, "Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit,

368
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 left the Jordan and was led by the spirit into the wilderness."

369
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 So that in the wilderness, he fasted.

370
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 He only drank water, apparently.

371
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 And then in the end, he was tempted and overcame Satan's temptation.

372
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 Now, I want you to note, you know, that it says he was full of the Holy Spirit.

373
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 But then in verse 14, so just right coming out of the fast,

374
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 we read, "Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit."

375
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 So there is a shift that Jesus is operating not out of his human strength,

376
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 but in the power of the Holy Spirit because he relied on the Holy Spirit.

377
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 And so if we want to move in the power of the Holy Spirit

378
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 and not out of our own strength, you know, that's one of the reasons why we fast

379
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 because we want and we desire to move in the Spirit

380
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 and not in the flesh, not in our own strength, by his power

381
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 because he's the one that really can change things.

382
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 You know, he's the one that knows what's best.

383
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 And we don't. We have selfishness and things in our heart.

384
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 But if we move by the power of the Spirit, it's amazing.

385
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 So we fast to release the Holy Spirit's empowering presence in our lives.

386
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 Second, we fast to become untangled from sin and experience victory over our lives.

387
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 I'm not going to--I have a lot of passages. I'm not going to read every passage.

388
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 If you want to keep track of this later on, really, you can take a photo.

389
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 But in the Old Testament, there's many times where Israel--

390
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 it's always like they are living right, righteously right, then they sin,

391
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 and they're stuck in their sin of worshipping idols.

392
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 And then they are confronted with their sin. They realize their sin.

393
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 Sometimes a prophet even calls them out on it.

394
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 And then they come before God with repentance and fasting.

395
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 And God entangles them from their sin and allows them to move forward as a nation,

396
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 allows them to move forward as individuals, and that the power of sin is broken in their lives.

397
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 And so when we--so fasting and repentance is also linked in Scripture.

398
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 And so perhaps there's a sin that keeps resurfacing.

399
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 You know, even when we're Christian, there's sins that just don't seem to be going away.

400
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 They keep popping back up in our lives.

401
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 And so when we fast, we can also ask God to entangle us and give us victory from sin, over sin.

402
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 The third reason we fast is to become more alert and receptive to the Holy Spirit's leadership.

403
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 And so in Acts that--we're going to read this passage in a second--

404
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 the church is gathering in Antioch.

405
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 So the Christian movement, it's brand new.

406
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 You know, it hasn't existed for very long, and it says this.

407
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 "While they were worshipping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said,

408
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 'Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.'

409
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 So after they had fasted and prayed, they placed their hands on them, and they sent them off.

410
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 And Paul and Barnabas went on to their missionary journeys to plant churches."

411
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 But we fast to be more alert and receptive to the Holy Spirit's leadership in our lives.

412
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 You see, a lot of times we have so much noise in our lives--

413
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 work, family stuff, Instagram, TV, whatever, music, whatever you do.

414
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 We do all sorts of stuff, but a lot of times we're not very tuned in to God.

415
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 But when we fast and worship and we carve out the space,

416
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 we're actually open to what God is doing, and we can receive that.

417
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 We can receive words from God and direction from God.

418
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 And so we fast because we need direction from God.

419
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 This is why we're fasting as a church,

420
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 because we want to be alert and open to the Holy Spirit's leadership.

421
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 We want to hear.

422
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 We don't want to move out of our own wisdom.

423
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 The fourth reason people fast is to seek God's guidance.

424
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 A lot of times we find ourselves at crossroads, or we need direction,

425
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 or there's something difficult to navigate.

426
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 Here in this case, Israel had to navigate--

427
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 had a dangerous journey that they needed to navigate.

428
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 So they fast and they pray and they ask God for wisdom.

429
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 And God answers their prayer and gets them safely to where they need to go.

430
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 So you pray and fast for God's guidance.

431
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 And then finally, we pray and fast to commune with God.

432
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 That is actually the most important thing,

433
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 is to draw deeper in our relationship with God when we fast,

434
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 and just commune with Him, spend time with Him.

435
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 Here in this example, it's the prophetess Anna.

436
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 You know, that's been waiting for the Messiah.

437
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 And it says in Luke 2, verse 37,

438
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 "She never left the temple, but worshipped night and day, fasting and praying."

439
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 So she was communing with God.

440
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 She was worshipping and drawing near to God.

441
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 And so our fasting is also a drawing near to God.

442
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 Just spend time with God.

443
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 Just sit to listen.

444
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 It's not us just talking all the time.

445
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 It's about a relationship.

446
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 You're like, "All of that sounds great.

447
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 I want all of that in my life.

448
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 How do I do it?

449
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 Like, how do we do this?"

450
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 And I want to say one thing to you.

451
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 I don't want to give the impression that this is like fasting makes your wish list magically happen.

452
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 You know, it really is a surrendering and coming before God,

453
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 and then He acts and moves how He wants to act and move.

454
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 But He loves us, and He's good, and He loves giving us good gifts.

455
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 Now, I just want to make that clear.

456
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 But how do we do it?

457
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 So I'm going to have five steps, just simple steps, for how you can enter into this fast.

458
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 Later on, after this, we're going to also share a QR code

459
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 where you can sign up for our WhatsApp communication.

460
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 Through that, you'll get actually a guide that captures a little bit of what's on here

461
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 that you can use to prepare for the fast.

462
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 But let me go through this.

463
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 First step is determine your spiritual purpose for the fast.

464
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 You know, ask the Holy Spirit, "What do you want me to fast for?"

465
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 Actually spend some time praying and asking Him.

466
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 Where do you need God to change?

467
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 Where are things not right?

468
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 We need God to act and move in your life.

469
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 Is there an important decision that needs to be made?

470
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 Is there a need for healing, a problem that requires a resolution,

471
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 or a pattern of sin that needs to be broken?

472
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 What is the Holy Spirit inviting you to personally fast for?

473
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 And it's helpful to do that because then our praying,

474
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 while we're fasting, can be more strategic.

475
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 We actually know what we're focusing on.

476
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 So that's for the personal fast.

477
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 For the corporate fast, our focus is to ask the Holy Spirit to prepare us,

478
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 to equip us, to unite us.

479
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 We really sense it's important for the Holy Spirit to unite us

480
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 between the counties, the English service, and us as a community,

481
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 for us here so we can move forward into what He has for us together.

482
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 To lead us, empower us for the ministry and work that He calls us to do in 2024,

483
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 of just loving and serving the people around us.

484
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 So that is the first step, is determine your spiritual purpose for the fast.

485
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 The second one is choose how long you will fast for.

486
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 Well, we've chosen it's 21 days.

487
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 But if you fast another time, just set a time, start small, build up from there.

488
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 The third step, decide on what you will fast.

489
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 What are you going to abstain from?

490
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 Now, biblically, it is always food in the Bible, as an example.

491
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 And there are different types of fasts, and I'm not going to get into all of them.

492
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 The two most common are the normal fast, which is you fast food and you just drink water.

493
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 The other one is the Daniel fast, where you eat vegetables, you drink water,

494
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 but you don't have wine, you don't have steak, you don't have your candy,

495
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 your dessert, whatever it is that you like.

496
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 So it's very simple.

497
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 So we encourage you, if you want to fast food, to keep it real simple.

498
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 So whether the Daniel fast or skipping a meal a day.

499
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 Like we don't recommend, especially if you've never fasted before, doing a 21-day fast of no food.

500
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 If you want to do that, talk to your doctor first.

501
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 Now, for some of us, maybe there's actually some issues around food.

502
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 And that would actually be distracting while we're fasting.

503
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 Or maybe the Holy Spirit is leading you to fast something else.

504
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 And so I have some questions for you to help you discern what other things you can fast for.

505
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 You know, what activities are crowding out your time with prayer and with God?

506
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 What activities are becoming more important to you than God?

507
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 And what's taking up your time?

508
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 And if we're honest, we do all sorts of things a lot of times, but don't spend very much time with God.

509
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 We spend so much time on Instagram, it's like the doom scrolling, it's like endless.

510
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 We have different things as different people.

511
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 But it's like, what is crowding out your time for God?

512
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 And fast from that.

513
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 And this brings me to the fourth step.

514
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 So it might be Instagram, Netflix, sports news, whatever it is for you.

515
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 So the fourth step is plan how you will spend your time with God.

516
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 Because fasting is not just abstaining from something, it's actually making space for God.

517
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 And this is where I see fasting go wrong.

518
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 Like where a lot of people, for some reason, we love like abstaining from something.

519
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 But then we don't actually spend time with God.

520
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 But if you want to do a Christian fast, it actually involves carving our time with God.

521
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 You can, for example, if you skip a meal, maybe during that time you spend some time with God.

522
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 Reading His Word, worshipping Him, going for a prayer walk, just being still and listening.

523
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 Whatever it is that you're meditating on a scripture.

524
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 But have a plan for how you will spend time with God.

525
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 And I also want to just keep it simple.

526
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 You don't need to break a world record of how long you do this.

527
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 Do something that you can do.

528
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 But have a plan.

529
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 And then the final one is be expectant of God.

530
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 You know, God loves you.

531
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 He is your loving Father.

532
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 And He loves when His children come to Him.

533
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 He loves it.

534
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 He loves meeting us.

535
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 He loves speaking to us.

536
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 He loves providing for us.

537
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 And so we can come to Him in faith.

538
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 We don't have to beg.

539
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 We just ask Him like a child asks a father.

540
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 We just pour the things that are in our hearts out to Him in that way.

541
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 And we ask God to move and to provide.

542
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 So those are the five steps of fasting.

543
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 And as I shared, there's a QR code where you can sign up for WhatsApp.

544
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 And can we have the QR code, please?

545
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 So you can sign up to our WhatsApp community,

546
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 and there you will receive those five steps that I just shared about.

547
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 It's also where you get your 21-day devotional that we've created as a church.

548
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 Every day we're going to be sending out one.

549
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 Some of your community members have written one.

550
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 You might use that for that time that you're going to spend with God.

551
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 Now I want us to take a step back.

552
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 I actually want to invite the worship team to come up at this time.

553
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 And I was thinking what would happen if we actually all would fast,

554
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 if we all would humble ourselves and seek God at the beginning of this year through worship and prayer?

555
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 What would God do?

556
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 What would He do in our hearts?

557
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 How would He move?

558
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 How would He prepare us?

559
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 And then that picture is at the end of 2024.

560
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 That picture of standing there, looking back, and just falling on our knees in worship.

561
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 Because it's so clear that what happened was not something that happened out of our own strength.

562
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 It was God's work.

563
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 That God has worked this year in our lives and in our community's lives.

564
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 Because we have come to Him.

565
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 We said, "Lord, we desire for You to move."

566
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 Because we cried out for the kingdom, for a manifestation of the kingdom to break into our here and now.

567
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 We said, "Lord, we long for that.

568
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 We long for the things that are not right to be said right.

569
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 We long for people to experience healing, physical healing, emotional healing.

570
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 We long for people to be brought into the kingdom that they can experience Your love and Your goodness."

571
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 And so I just picture us at the end of the year, looking back and knowing that this time fasting,

572
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 this time coming before God, God met us and He worked.

573
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 And I want to invite you all to stand.

574
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 And I want to challenge you.

575
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 I want to invite you.

576
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 You know, like I said, we come from different backgrounds.

577
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 Maybe you're like, "Eh, I don't want to fast."

578
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 But I really believe God wants to meet us.

579
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 He wants to work through this time together.

580
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 We get to be encouraged because we get to do it together.

581
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 You're not doing it on your own.

582
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 And I believe that through this fasting, we're going to be able to step in a different way into this year.

583
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 We're not going to be operating out of our own power, but through the power of the Holy Spirit.

584
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 So I would love to pray for you.

585
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 And I want to invite you to stretch out your hands before you just to symbolize just wanting to receive from God.

586
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 So Jesus, we thank You so much that You love us.

587
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 We thank You that we can come to You in prayer and in fasting.

588
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 That You love when we commune with You.

589
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 And I ask that You would take us deeper into our relationship with You.

590
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 That we would experience this year You in a new way that we have not experienced You before.

591
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 I pray that we -- that it would be a move of the Spirit among us.

592
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 We do something special, something beautiful, something fresh.

593
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 I pray for personal breakthroughs, Lord.

594
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 There's stuff where we need You to act now in our own lives.

595
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 I pray that You would move in people's lives, that it would experience You like they have not experienced You before.

596
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 Most of all, Lord, we just want to honor You.

597
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 We just want to do this as I worship to You and say, "We love You."

598
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 And we long for the things that You long for.

599
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 So will You work and move as we come to You in our fasting and prayer.

600
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 I pray all of a sudden, in Your name, Jesus, amen.
