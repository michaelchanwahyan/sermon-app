[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.940]   - Man, it's hard for me to express, two weeks ago,
[00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.940]   two weeks ago here when I last spoke
[00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.940]   as part of our Exodus series was probably the most intense,
[00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.660]   most vulnerable, most personal,
[00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.380]   most overwhelming and emotional,
[00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.300]   but also the most pastoral, I think,
[00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.900]   service that my wife, Chris, and I have ever experienced
[00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.100]   together here at The Vine.
[00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.860]   And as we opened up the vulnerability of our journey,
[00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.580]   of infertility, and as Chris in particular,
[00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.460]   profoundly spoke of her experience with God
[00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.780]   through that journey, so many of you were so pastoral
[00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.380]   towards us and reached out to us,
[00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.820]   and we're so grateful for that.
[00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.300]   And we kind of knew heading into that week,
[00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.460]   it was gonna be an intense week,
[00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.260]   because chapter five that we were looking at that week
[00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.300]   is an intense chapter.
[00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.740]   It's perhaps the most intense chapter
[00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.940]   of the whole Exodus journey itself.
[00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.020]   It's a chapter where Moses and Aaron,
[00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.980]   with the wind of the spirit behind them
[00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.580]   and all of the support of Israel,
[00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.300]   go before Pharaoh for the first time
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.500]   and say to Pharaoh with so much confidence,
[00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.700]   "Let our people go,"
[00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.540]   expecting that Pharaoh is gonna go, "Good idea."
[00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.420]   And Pharaoh turns to them and says,
[00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.220]   "I don't know this, God.
[00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.300]   "Why would I let you go?
[00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.420]   "You're my slaves.
[00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.900]   "You're part of the economy here.
[00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.500]   "We couldn't survive without you.
[00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.340]   "That's not happening.
[00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.940]   "In fact, I'm gonna punish you
[00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.140]   "for even suggesting that I'm gonna let you go."
[00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.580]   And he places them under even more slavery,
[00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.300]   even harsher conditions.
[00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.860]   And not surprisingly, Israel revolts against Moses and Aaron.
[00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:34.700]   "What are you doing?
[00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.860]   "Why have you done this to us?"
[00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.380]   And then Moses, at the end of chapter five,
[00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.420]   goes before God and says,
[00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.500]   "God, why are you doing this to me?
[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.540]   "Like I thought things were gonna go well now.
[00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.860]   "You had called us, you had promised us,
[00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.860]   "and I thought things were gonna happen, and it hasn't.
[00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.060]   "Why have things gotten worse
[00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.340]   "before they've gotten to get better?"
[00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.340]   And we talked about that week,
[00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.380]   how so often that's the journey of so many of us,
[00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.180]   that God tells us something, gives us a promise,
[00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.020]   gives us a hope,
[00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.900]   and we enter into it with a whole bunch of confidence.
[00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.140]   And yet sometimes things get worse before they get better.
[00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.340]   And I'm so grateful that Chris was willing to share
[00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.060]   just those profound reflections she had had
[00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.060]   about how God had met her in the worst
[00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.620]   and began to reform and reshape a character in her
[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.700]   that would enable her to be the mother she needs to be
[00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.700]   to our adopted daughter, Mia.
[00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.220]   And you see in the chapter five,
[00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.500]   God beginning to take Moses
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.380]   and begin to shape in him a character,
[00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.980]   begin to shape and form out of the worst moments
[00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.660]   something that he would need to be
[00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.140]   in order to stand before all of the challenges
[00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.300]   that were gonna be ahead of him
[00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.540]   to be able to stand for God in those moments.
[00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.860]   He had to go through what it was
[00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.180]   that he was going through in chapter five.
[00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.700]   You know, one of the things I've known
[00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.220]   and experienced in my own pastoral career
[00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.420]   is that so often when God brings us through intense
[00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.180]   and difficult and hard times,
[00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.460]   so often he'll then bring us into a time of release
[00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.420]   and lightness and joy.
[00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.340]   See, God's a good God as we've just been singing
[00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.220]   and he's faithful to us.
[00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.580]   And the journey with God is not all mountaintop experiences
[00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.500]   but thankfully it's not all valley experiences either.
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.860]   And God moves us in valleys and peaks and valleys and peaks,
[00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:17.860]   times where things are hard
[00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.220]   and then a season afterwards of joy
[00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.300]   and a sense of closeness with God
[00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.900]   and things are going well again.
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.820]   And this is exactly what we see happen
[00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.620]   as we continue our study in the book of Exodus.
[00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.820]   'Cause chapter five, as hard as it is,
[00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.340]   as the deepest and darkest valley that it is,
[00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.500]   it moves into chapter six.
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.420]   And chapter six is like the opposite of chapter five.
[00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.900]   Where chapter five was intense and where are you God
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.220]   and why are things getting worse?
[00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.460]   Chapter six, God speaks again to Moses.
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.500]   And in chapter six,
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.180]   God begins to redefine his character to Moses once more
[00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.740]   and begins to tell Moses about who he is
[00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.500]   and what he's about to do and the victory
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.700]   and the good things and the character he has
[00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.140]   and the joy that is gonna be set before Moses.
[00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.460]   And you couldn't get more contrasting things side by side.
[00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:09.640]   When we were planning this series about four years ago,
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.900]   we were planning this chapter five week with you
[00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.580]   and we knew that Chris would be sharing her story
[00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:15.820]   and I knew that would be super intense.
[00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.060]   So I was like, okay, the next week,
[00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.980]   how do we capture the joy of chapter six?
[00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.380]   How do we capture the fact that it's so contrasting
[00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.980]   and so different and kind of fun
[00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.180]   and a lot lighter than chapter five?
[00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.180]   And one of the things that you guys have been asking me most
[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.420]   over the last 10 weeks of doing this series,
[00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.260]   the number one question I've been getting from you
[00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.380]   is how did you actually film the thing?
[00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.820]   Like, how did you actually pull it off?
[00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.100]   Like, what was the journey
[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.100]   of actually trying to put this whole Exodus series
[00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.340]   and all the films together?
[00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.180]   And so when we were planning this four years ago,
[00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.900]   we're like, wouldn't it be great to follow Chris's intensity
[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.060]   with the joy of a behind the scenes kind of episode?
[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.500]   Like take people behind the scenes
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.660]   and show them how crazy it was
[00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.620]   to actually put this whole thing together.
[00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.100]   Because the reality is if chapter five is hard
[00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.560]   and chapter six is good,
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.100]   there's a journey that you have to go through to get there.
[00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.100]   And if there's anything I can testify
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.140]   through this whole Exodus experience
[00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.780]   and the films and everything we made
[00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.420]   is that we went through that journey ourselves.
[00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.380]   That things got worse before they got better for us.
[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.860]   That the whole journey was not easy.
[00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.460]   It wasn't fun all the time.
[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:19.460]   It was challenging.
[00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.860]   And yet through that, we saw God do things
[00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.500]   that we never thought or expected He would ever do.
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.700]   And so today, I wanna make things a little bit more fun.
[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.380]   And we're gonna actually go back to Egypt and Jordan,
[00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.260]   but I'm gonna take you behind the scenes.
[00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.620]   We're gonna do this by,
[00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.900]   but we actually put together a Zoom call
[00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.420]   with four of the key members of the crew.
[00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.940]   Toby Thomas, who was our director based in London.
[00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.580]   Anthony Gibbs, who's our editor based in Sydney.
[00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.220]   Riley Su, who's the producer of the whole series,
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.600]   who's based here in Hong Kong and myself.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.180]   We all got on a call together
[00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.580]   to talk about the craziness of this journey.
[00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.140]   And so I wanna now take you behind the scenes with Exodus.
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.140]   Let's check it out.
[00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.720]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:09.540]   - Hi, I'm Andrew.
[00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:10.700]   - Hey, I'm Toby.
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:11.700]   - Hi, I'm Riley.
[00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:12.660]   - I'm Anthony.
[00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.860]   - Yeah, so I think the project was originally conceived
[00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.380]   back in 2018.
[00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.420]   - I think I probably got like an Instagram message
[00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:20.460]   from Andrew.
[00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:21.780]   - Yeah, 2018 being like,
[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.860]   "Hey man, love to speak to you about something."
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.540]   And then when he'd pitched the project to me,
[00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.340]   I was like, "Oh, this sounds like it's gonna be
[00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.580]   really, really exciting."
[00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.980]   - Toby, myself, and one of our producers
[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.220]   in the very early days, Lauren,
[00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.940]   got on Skype back in those days
[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.540]   and read through the book of Exodus
[00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.380]   over about three months together.
[00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.580]   That was sort of late 2018 into early 2019.
[00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.780]   And that was how we began everything.
[00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.740]   And I think soon after we finished reading that,
[00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.220]   we were expecting things to be boom, boom, boom,
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:54.940]   get the crew together, do some recces, start filming.
[00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:59.460]   And of course, you know, the world fell out from itself.
[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:00.900]   - I mean, like just to give you an idea
[00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.020]   of how long this took, right?
[00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:06.900]   Like when this started, Toby was unmarried with no children
[00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.620]   and I didn't have a child.
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.340]   And now we're not even finished
[00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.940]   and Toby's married with two kids and I have one.
[00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:15.500]   I mean, that just goes to show how long this took.
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.220]   - I had brown hair when we started.
[00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.620]   So I guess the crew was firstly,
[00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:21.940]   the person who stayed on the project
[00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.140]   the whole time was Devin.
[00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.380]   Secondly, there was Oliver and then Anthony.
[00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.540]   Riley is strict on the budget.
[00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:29.980]   And we also had Ben with us.
[00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:31.420]   And then my role was the director.
[00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.940]   That was the crew on the ground.
[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:38.580]   - We started off with Jordan first because of delays.
[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.580]   - How was lunch?
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:42.620]   - Oh, fantastic.
[00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.580]   - So you'd expect from the first day of a game.
[00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:45.420]   - Thanks, friends.
[00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:51.340]   - And first location was the amazing Petra.
[00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.700]   We rocked up, you know, with our camera gear
[00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.620]   and there you have it.
[00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:56.540]   Oh, nope.
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.740]   - We're supposed to be shooting in the Petra.
[00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.020]   We wanted to get in super early whilst it was quiet
[00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.940]   and the light was good, but we have permits,
[00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.780]   but apparently now there's a new rule.
[00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:08.340]   We're being told that we need to wait maybe 30, 45 minutes
[00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.140]   for a security personnel to come
[00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:12.500]   and accompany us on the shoot,
[00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.060]   which we probably will have to pay for,
[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:15.380]   which is kind of part of the thing.
[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.540]   So a little frustrating right at the start.
[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:19.940]   - How are you feeling, Toby?
[00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.500]   - A bit gassy.
[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.620]   - And so that was our first day of shooting.
[00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:29.500]   We're all pumped up and it's like, oh, okay, slow down.
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.340]   Hang on, slow down.
[00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.940]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:38.020]   (indistinct chatter)
[00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:49.300]   - We just done the first sort of four or five takes
[00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.380]   for episode 30.
[00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:52.540]   Yeah, I'm feeling good.
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.900]   From what I can tell on the little monitor,
[00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.460]   the shots look incredible.
[00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.340]   I feel like the content was strong.
[00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.100]   So it's all coming together.
[00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.980]   Crew have gone back to the hotel just to test everything,
[00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.220]   make sure we caught everything that we need.
[00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.900]   Now we're going to get a few more B-roll shots.
[00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:08.740]   Loving it.
[00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:15.500]   - There'll be a few moments on the trip
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.180]   where someone would turn up,
[00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:20.340]   there'd be five to seven minutes of shouting.
[00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.420]   I mean like guttural shouting,
[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:24.500]   and then people would get in a car and drive away
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.100]   and then apparently it was fine.
[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:30.220]   - We were at a location that we had gotten permit for
[00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.580]   and our fixers have told us that,
[00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:33.900]   yes, you can film there.
[00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.660]   And we rock up, we're in the middle of shooting
[00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.500]   and the owner of the location comes out
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.660]   and starts berating our fixers
[00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.060]   for allowing us to shoot there.
[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:46.620]   - We went down to start filming.
[00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:49.740]   We got permits and everything, so everything's legit.
[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:52.340]   But then we got a call from the local intelligence bureau,
[00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.860]   this area, saying that we had to stop shooting straight away.
[00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.100]   We came back to the car park
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:59.740]   and now there are Jordanian fixes
[00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:01.940]   and the security guys are having this massive argument
[00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:05.500]   and we're just praying that we'll be able to clear this up
[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:06.740]   and get shooting again.
[00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:09.500]   But yeah, it's pretty disruptive
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.820]   to suddenly have this sort of stuff happen.
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.620]   - Definitely the most extreme shouting.
[00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:16.500]   Definitely the most intimidating people.
[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.140]   - And so we got kicked out
[00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:22.220]   and we had to delete all of our footage from that location.
[00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:25.020]   - I distinctly remember at one point during the Jordan
[00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:27.940]   that I was like taking the SD cards out of my camera,
[00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:29.460]   putting like another empty one in
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.580]   and like putting the other one down my sock,
[00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:33.300]   just in case, you know.
[00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:34.620]   Just be like, "Oh no, I've got nothing.
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:35.780]   I haven't shot anything at all.
[00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:36.860]   What are you talking about?"
[00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:39.460]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:48.420]   - Yeah, so Egypt is split by different kind of districts
[00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:49.860]   in some ways.
[00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:53.380]   And each of the areas have their own political sensitivities
[00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:54.700]   to them.
[00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:56.140]   And as you travel,
[00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:59.580]   and of course we were tracing the journey of Israel
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:00.660]   through Egypt.
[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:02.340]   So we had to cross quite a few of these
[00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:05.260]   sort of internal borders, if you will.
[00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.020]   Every single time you would do that,
[00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.500]   you would have to go through a checkpoint.
[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.980]   And the checkpoints are everywhere.
[00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:14.540]   - This is the fourth checkpoint of the day.
[00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:18.220]   And one of the guys that will wait
[00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.900]   for the Egyptian company raising this.
[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:23.420]   I think they're all getting a bit frustrated.
[00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.380]   You know, it's really slow going where,
[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.540]   you know, you constantly have to stop at these checkpoints.
[00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.740]   And sometimes they just kind of wait you through.
[00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:31.500]   Sometimes you have to stop for an hour
[00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.020]   and you just never know
[00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.060]   till you get there of what's gonna happen.
[00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:36.260]   And this one, I think they thought
[00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:37.300]   we were just gonna drive through
[00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:38.940]   and they've stopped us again.
[00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.700]   So yeah, tensions a bit high.
[00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:42.900]   - And I think, you know,
[00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.820]   so security in Sinai in particular,
[00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:45.860]   the Sinai Peninsula,
[00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:47.620]   that area, you know, can be quite,
[00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:49.460]   you know, again, politically sensitive.
[00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.940]   There were certain areas where we'd have a police escort
[00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:54.580]   to go to the various places that we needed to get to.
[00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:57.700]   There was this moment where we were driving down
[00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:59.980]   to Beni Hassan, which is in the South.
[00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:03.060]   We're in two vans with two police escorts
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.660]   with six people with guns in both vans,
[00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:06.980]   either side of us.
[00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:08.460]   And Devin is just like,
[00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:10.060]   "I am not gonna tell my wife
[00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:11.740]   this is happening right now, this moment.
[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:12.980]   She can know when I get back."
[00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:15.340]   Because he's just like, "Why is this necessary?"
[00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:17.900]   So you're just kind of like watching over your shoulder,
[00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:19.580]   trying to figure out why all these people
[00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:21.100]   are escorting you there.
[00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:24.020]   It's because they think Andrew's a major celebrity, I think.
[00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:26.180]   - Yeah, I think that was the reason, yeah.
[00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:29.180]   I think the other important thing to kind of weigh in here
[00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:32.940]   with is I think actually doing a project like this
[00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:37.300]   in Egypt itself is incredibly complex and difficult.
[00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.860]   And it's funny, actually, Riley and I chatted about this
[00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:42.340]   early on in the project, and we did our research,
[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.180]   like, "Who else?
[00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:46.220]   What other films are out there by churches on the Exodus?"
[00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:49.060]   And it was like, we could find nothing.
[00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.220]   I remember maybe like a year into the project,
[00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:52.500]   Riley was like, you know,
[00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:53.700]   Riley and I were having a conversation.
[00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.020]   It was basically like, now we know
[00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:56.580]   why no one else has done this thing.
[00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.620]   It's just incredibly complex.
[00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:02.420]   Oh my God.
[00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:04.420]   Yeah, so we went to the pyramids.
[00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:05.500]   We show up on day one.
[00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.380]   It was literally day one of the shoot.
[00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:10.620]   Day one, we went to the pyramids, excited.
[00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:11.900]   And we got all the cameras out.
[00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.420]   We're out there, and-
[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:14.300]   - There's no one here.
[00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:15.860]   We've got the spot, let's go.
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:21.780]   - Okay, so we show up here back in 2019.
[00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:25.380]   They didn't have these flying lawnmowers
[00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:28.380]   around the pyramids, but now they're absolutely everywhere.
[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:31.700]   And when you're trying to record sound,
[00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.460]   it's an absolute nightmare.
[00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:34.860]   So much of the last two days,
[00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:37.020]   it's been us standing ready to go,
[00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:41.620]   like, ready to shot action, and that happens.
[00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:45.940]   And the noise was just like,
[00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.620]   like, we can't do audio with these things
[00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.340]   flying over our heads.
[00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:54.100]   And it was just like, oh, the morale on day one
[00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.860]   was just like everyone looking at each other,
[00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:57.300]   feeling a bit awkward.
[00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.340]   - And any time, like, one would sort of fly away,
[00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.900]   we'd be like, "Okay, go, go, go, go."
[00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:03.500]   And I'd be like, "Do my thing."
[00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.140]   And it'd be like, this next one would fly in.
[00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:07.580]   We'd all have to stop all of a sudden.
[00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:11.300]   And so it was quite stressful, yeah.
[00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:14.300]   - The walk up to the top of St. Catherine's.
[00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:15.580]   I've never been able to be like,
[00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:17.620]   "I've seen something break someone,
[00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:19.260]   "but now I can say that."
[00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.900]   - That's Anthony and Andrew.
[00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:22.740]   So close.
[00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:23.580]   There they are.
[00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:24.580]   I'm falling behind.
[00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:28.340]   - Weather update, it is cold.
[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:32.620]   Over there.
[00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:36.140]   - He's got his hands in it, he's so cold.
[00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:37.140]   He's got his hands in it.
[00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:40.060]   - And I think he healed over time.
[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:41.820]   Probably when he returned back to Hong Kong,
[00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:45.780]   but he was a different man by the end of the walk up,
[00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.220]   let's put it that way.
[00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:50.340]   - In terms of like, yeah, I'm very proud of this project.
[00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:55.020]   It's been birthed through prayer and study and fellowship
[00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:58.620]   and just a deep relationship and trust for one another.
[00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:01.300]   - This is what we go through to get these shots.
[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:05.300]   - Three hour drive.
[00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.140]   Till we sleep.
[00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:13.300]   And I have to put on a face mask.
[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.260]   - Oh, this is sick.
[00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:19.900]   - For me, there were two highlights.
[00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.540]   I think one was on the top of Mount Sinai.
[00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:23.700]   We timed it a little bit wrong
[00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:24.940]   and we got up there two and a half hours
[00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:26.220]   before the sun came up.
[00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.100]   So we had a very cold two and a half hours
[00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.340]   on the top of this mountain in the pitch blackness.
[00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:32.580]   And we laid down and we looked up at the stars
[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:34.060]   and the stars were just incredible.
[00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:36.700]   And we saw like, I don't know how many shooting stars.
[00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.700]   And I remember just having this prayer time,
[00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:42.980]   just myself praying with God on the top of Mount Sinai.
[00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:44.900]   Like it was just, that was very,
[00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:49.180]   I think that was the most spiritually moving moment for me.
[00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:51.020]   You know, when I thought about the whole project,
[00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:53.500]   the fact that we were finally there doing this dream
[00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:54.860]   that we'd had for so long
[00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:57.260]   and being on top of that mountain
[00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.740]   and feeling very connected to God.
[00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:07.060]   - I think for me, the hardest bit
[00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:10.340]   was when we had to cancel Egypt
[00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:13.260]   like two days before flying out.
[00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.180]   And I think internally I was kind of upset with God
[00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:19.500]   because I was just like, what is this?
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.820]   You know, if it's a no, we're not meant to go,
[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:26.380]   then just tell us, then I wouldn't have to go through,
[00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:29.300]   you know, all the stress and like, you know,
[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.940]   working like at three, 4 a.m. at night,
[00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:35.980]   trying to, you know, like cancel flights and tell everybody
[00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:37.340]   and then, you know, what next?
[00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:40.860]   And then like, oh, reconnecting them to Jordan instead.
[00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:43.580]   And that was, yeah, that was very hard.
[00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:44.900]   - It's interesting you share that, Raleigh,
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:46.860]   'cause that's exactly how the Israelites felt
[00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:49.500]   when they were there by the Red Sea,
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.100]   the armies coming at them.
[00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:54.180]   And they said to Moses, like, why did we even bother?
[00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:55.060]   Like, it would have been better
[00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:57.260]   if we'd just not even done this kind of thing.
[00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.780]   And I think it's really interesting that I think in a way,
[00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:02.780]   we did experience that same sort of feeling
[00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:03.980]   throughout the trip.
[00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:05.860]   You know, why are we doing this?
[00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:07.980]   Like, why has God set us up to fail?
[00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.900]   It felt like that a few times, you know?
[00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.940]   And yeah, it's interesting how that,
[00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:15.220]   I think that connects into the actual Exodus story itself.
[00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.540]   - You like that how Moses would have felt like,
[00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:19.420]   oh gosh, like, God, you better,
[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:21.860]   you better like show up and pull through.
[00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:24.580]   I've got like 2 million people here
[00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:29.060]   who's gonna like slaughter me if this doesn't work out.
[00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:31.380]   - Yeah, and that's exactly how I felt on the flight over.
[00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:32.900]   I'm like, not that I've got 2 million people,
[00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:34.500]   I've got like a crew of eight or whatever,
[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.060]   but you know, like I'm flying over going like,
[00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:39.380]   God, you better, this better work.
[00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:42.260]   So we're taking a step of faith here
[00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.620]   and that's very much what Exodus is all about.
[00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:46.980]   - Yeah, that,
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:49.540]   (audience applauding)
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:52.420]   so that idea of a step of faith
[00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:54.020]   is what the Exodus is all about
[00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:55.220]   and it's exactly what we see
[00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:56.980]   between chapter five and chapter six.
[00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:59.740]   And so much of our journey through the filming of this,
[00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:00.580]   is it gonna happen?
[00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:01.420]   Is it gonna work?
[00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:02.260]   Is God gonna come through?
[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:03.820]   Is exactly how Moses is feeling
[00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:05.900]   as he steps into this new chapter.
[00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:07.980]   And finally God begins to speak.
[00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:09.300]   And it's amazing what God does
[00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:10.660]   in the beginning of chapter six.
[00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:15.500]   He gives Moses three reasons why Moses should trust him.
[00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.260]   And no matter where you are right now
[00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:18.700]   in your relationship with God,
[00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:21.660]   no matter what low you might be facing at the moment,
[00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:24.260]   these are three things that you can take to the bank.
[00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:29.260]   Three things that you always have a reason to trust God.
[00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:30.420]   I wanna share these with you.
[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:33.060]   Starting in chapter six, verse one.
[00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:35.060]   Then the Lord said to Moses,
[00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:37.900]   "Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh.
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:40.540]   "Because of my mighty hand, he will let him go.
[00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:41.980]   "Because of my mighty hand,
[00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:46.420]   "he will drive them out of this country or of his country."
[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:49.740]   The first thing Lord does to try to remind Moses
[00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:50.780]   about how he can trust him
[00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:52.540]   is he speaks about his mighty hand.
[00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:54.180]   Now this phrase, a mighty hand,
[00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:55.500]   becomes a common phrase
[00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.140]   throughout the rest of the Old Testament narrative
[00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:58.780]   from this point from here.
[00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:01.140]   But its roots are in the Exodus story.
[00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:02.980]   It's mentioned twice in this passage alone,
[00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:04.260]   but it's mentioned multiple times
[00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.100]   throughout the rest of the book of Exodus.
[00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:09.100]   And when it's mentioned, it's talking about two things.
[00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.140]   It's talking about the power that God has
[00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:14.060]   to fight battles that we are not able to fight.
[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:15.580]   That's the first thing that's meant.
[00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:17.220]   When God says, "My hand is mighty,
[00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.180]   "my hand is working in a mighty way."
[00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:21.140]   He's saying, "I'm fighting battles on your behalf
[00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:23.540]   "that you cannot fight."
[00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:24.920]   The second thing it means is that,
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:28.280]   "I am at work influencing human affairs
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:31.920]   "in a way that you could not influence or do yourself."
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.320]   So these are sovereign responses of God.
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:37.500]   His mighty hand fights battles we cannot fight
[00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:41.360]   and changes human hearts and changes human affairs
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.620]   in ways that we could never do.
[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:46.020]   And God is wanting to speak to Moses and saying,
[00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.820]   "Right now, it seems like it's getting worse
[00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:49.680]   "before it gets better.
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.700]   "Right now, it seems like things are really hard,
[00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:54.980]   "but you gotta remember, my mighty hand is on your behalf."
[00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:58.820]   He doesn't say to Moses, "Trust in your mighty hand."
[00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:00.400]   He doesn't say, "Trust in your power,
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.460]   "trust in your ability to influence Pharaoh,
[00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:03.760]   "trust in your speaking ability,
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:04.740]   "trust in all these things."
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:06.760]   He doesn't say that, he says, "Trust in me.
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.600]   "Trust in who you know I am.
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.780]   "I'm a mighty God with a mighty hand.
[00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:13.740]   "I'm fighting battles and I can influence world affairs
[00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.100]   "like you never could."
[00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:18.140]   And some of you here, that's the call for you,
[00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:21.460]   to trust in a God who is able to do what you cannot do
[00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:24.420]   and stop fighting in your own strength
[00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:28.020]   because that only ever leaves the burnout
[00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:29.740]   and actually open your heart to the fact
[00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:32.140]   that God is fighting on your behalf.
[00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:34.040]   He's got a mighty hand.
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.240]   And I love what God says right at the beginning
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:40.000]   of this verse, he says, "Now you will see my mighty hand."
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.680]   In other words, he's not asking Moses
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.960]   to believe in blind faith.
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:45.760]   He's not just saying, "Believe in my mighty power,
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.680]   "even though you're never gonna see it."
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:51.100]   He's like, "Now you will see my might and my power at work.
[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:52.960]   "I'm about to change Pharaoh's heart.
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.200]   "His heart is hardened, but I'm gonna soften it.
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.040]   "I'm gonna cause him to let you go.
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.640]   "You're gonna see the power of my hand at work.
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:00.800]   "I'm gonna fight battles for you
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:01.840]   "throughout the whole journey.
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:03.000]   "It's about to take place.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.620]   "Now you will see."
[00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:06.900]   And I think this is really important
[00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:09.240]   because so often if we're in a low time,
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.640]   if we're in a valley,
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.240]   if it seems like things are getting worse
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.180]   before they get better, it's so easy for us,
[00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:17.520]   so quick for us to forget the powerful things
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.520]   God has done in the past.
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:21.080]   And I believe for some of you in this room,
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:22.400]   that's exactly what God wants to be doing.
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.480]   He wants you to have that faith again to say,
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.860]   "Now I'm going to see the power of God."
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:31.380]   Something changes in us in terms of our faith
[00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:33.880]   when we see the power of God at work.
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:34.880]   I remember a few years ago,
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.980]   I was on a KMB bus in Kowloon
[00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:38.760]   and I'm traveling through Kowloon somewhere
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:41.080]   and I'm on this bus and this is kind of like
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:42.720]   a pastor's thing, but every once in a while
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.640]   when you're a pastor and you get into a place
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:45.800]   where nobody knows you,
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.500]   you kind of just breathe a sigh of relief.
[00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:48.960]   It's like, I don't need to be a pastor now
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.240]   for like the next five minutes
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.720]   and I can enjoy my bus ride in Kowloon
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:53.640]   where no one knows me.
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.160]   It's awesome.
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:58.000]   So I'm on this bus, I'm relaxed, I'm chilled.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.100]   I kid you not, after about five minutes of going,
[00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:03.440]   this guy about four seats away from me
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:06.820]   starts to manifest demonically.
[00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:09.820]   Now I've been involved and I've been around demonic work
[00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:11.720]   and I've been involved in deliverance of people
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:14.760]   that have demonic spirits over my pastoral years
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.340]   and so I knew exactly what was happening.
[00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:18.920]   I knew that this was what was taking place in this person
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:20.760]   and it was so funny 'cause my immediate reaction was,
[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:23.160]   "Is there any other Christian on this bus
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:25.220]   "who can step up right now
[00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:27.520]   "'cause I'm on a short holiday right now?"
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:28.620]   You know what I mean?
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.900]   And I heard God say something to me straight away.
[00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:35.720]   He said, "Andrew, do you wanna see my power?"
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:39.000]   It's a great question.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.020]   'Cause you'd think immediately we'd say yes, right?
[00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:43.620]   But do you really wanna see my power?
[00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:47.040]   And I said, "Yeah, God, I wanna see your power."
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:49.200]   He's like, "Well, pray for him then.
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:52.380]   "Deliver a demon and you'll see my power."
[00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:56.640]   And so mustering up all of the faith that I have,
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.480]   which wasn't very much at that time,
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:04.400]   I said out loud, I said, "In Jesus' name, be gone."
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.500]   And immediately he fell asleep.
[00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:09.400]   Just fell asleep.
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:12.680]   Just totally like passed out, fell asleep.
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:17.140]   And I was like, "Whoa, that was cool."
[00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:18.920]   I just saw the power of God.
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.080]   I'm like, "Is that gonna work again
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.560]   "next time I'm arguing with my wife?
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:23.000]   "In the name of Jesus!"
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.320]   (congregation laughing)
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.580]   (laughing)
[00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:31.220]   David's like, "Teach me, teach me."
[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:34.460]   (congregation laughing)
[00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:36.980]   God says to Moses, "Now you will see."
[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:38.860]   And I think sometimes there's a faith needed
[00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:41.940]   in the church around the world to say, "God, I wanna see."
[00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:44.020]   Would you move in power like you've never moved before?
[00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:45.980]   We need it now, Lord.
[00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.740]   Would you come and would you show yourself faithful?
[00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:50.020]   So God says, "You can trust me
[00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:51.980]   "'cause I'm a mighty hand, I'm at work."
[00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:53.980]   Here's the second thing he says in verse two.
[00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:56.260]   God also said to Moses, "I am the Lord."
[00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:57.500]   This is the word Yahweh.
[00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:01.080]   "I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and to Jacob as God Almighty,
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:06.080]   "but by my name, the Lord,
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:12.420]   "I did not make myself known to them."
[00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:14.320]   So it's an amazing thing what he says here,
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.500]   even though I can't read it.
[00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:18.340]   What he's saying here is there's two names
[00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:20.300]   that you have to understand that I've revealed myself.
[00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:22.240]   There's a name that I revealed myself
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.260]   to the generations in the past,
[00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:26.740]   and he says that's the name Lord Almighty.
[00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:29.060]   And there's a name now that I'm generating
[00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:30.860]   and that I'm giving to you, which is Yahweh.
[00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:32.860]   Now, here's what you need to understand.
[00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:36.580]   The name that he had given to the generations of the past,
[00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:38.820]   to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob was El Shaddai.
[00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:43.180]   It means the God of might or the God of power.
[00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:46.040]   So when he first reveals and he calls Abraham
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:48.380]   to come out and to start the new nation of Israel,
[00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:50.020]   he reveals himself as El Shaddai,
[00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:52.660]   the God of power, the God of might.
[00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:55.900]   But when he shows up and reveals himself to Moses
[00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:57.940]   at the beginning of the Exodus at the burning bush,
[00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:00.820]   he doesn't use that name, he uses a new name.
[00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.940]   The name is Yahweh, which is translated
[00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:05.820]   in the Old Testament Lord in capital letters,
[00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:07.660]   but it essentially means I am who I am,
[00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:11.460]   or he is who he is, or he will be what he will be.
[00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:15.500]   Or more specifically, it means he will be with us.
[00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:18.860]   So I want you to see something powerful that God does.
[00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:20.900]   And this is the second reason why he says to Moses
[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:21.820]   that he can trust him.
[00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:23.480]   He says, it's because you need to understand
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.060]   that I'm revealing something about myself
[00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:27.480]   that I had not revealed in history past.
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.000]   With your generations in the past,
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.820]   I reveal myself mighty and powerful,
[00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:33.740]   but for you, I'm revealing myself personally,
[00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:38.540]   intimately, the one who is with you.
[00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:39.900]   In fact, this is what we've seen of God
[00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:41.980]   throughout the whole of the Exodus journey so far.
[00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:43.420]   I have seen the misery of my people
[00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:45.340]   and I've come down to be with them.
[00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:47.360]   I have compassion because I see their pain
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:50.380]   and their suffering, I wanna be here with them.
[00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:53.060]   And so it's fascinating to me that God reveals himself
[00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:55.460]   differently at different seasons and different times.
[00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:57.420]   And note this, 'cause I think God got it
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:58.740]   around the wrong way.
[00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:00.860]   When you see the El Shaddai at the beginning,
[00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:03.580]   God of power, and the Yahweh, the personal,
[00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:05.900]   shouldn't it have been the other way around?
[00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.140]   Like when God first reveals himself to Abraham,
[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:10.100]   you would think he would reveal himself personally
[00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:11.380]   and intimately with him.
[00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:14.140]   Hey, it's us, it's me, I'm your God.
[00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:16.020]   Let me tell you a little bit about what it is to worship me.
[00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:17.420]   Let's journey together.
[00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:19.500]   You know, that's the establishing of relationship.
[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.660]   You think God would reveal himself personally.
[00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:23.300]   And when it comes to the Exodus,
[00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:25.260]   wouldn't you think that God would reveal himself mighty
[00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:28.180]   and powerful and like awesome and stuff?
[00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:29.780]   But he doesn't, he does it the other way around.
[00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:31.820]   With Abraham and Isaac, it's power and might.
[00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:35.340]   With Moses and Israel, in the moment of their greatest need,
[00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:38.260]   it's intimacy, care, and love.
[00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:41.660]   And the question you should be asking yourself is why?
[00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:48.060]   The answer is this, the greatest amount of God's power
[00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:50.940]   that you will ever experience in your life
[00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:54.380]   will come through his intimacy and his care for you.
[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:58.500]   God breaks chains over you
[00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.460]   by deepening his relationship with you.
[00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:05.260]   So his personal and intimate relationship with us,
[00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:06.820]   his desire to draw close
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:08.860]   so that we can know him personally and intimately,
[00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:10.820]   that is always going to be the place
[00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:12.740]   where you will find your greatest freedom.
[00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:14.620]   You will find your greatest breakthroughs,
[00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:15.860]   your greatest freedoms,
[00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:17.940]   your greatest walking out of slavery
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:19.820]   when you know the intimacy of a God,
[00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:21.500]   when you have that intimate, personal,
[00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:23.300]   connected relationship with him.
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:25.820]   If you only have the God of power,
[00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:27.500]   you might break some chains,
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:30.180]   but you will fall back into those chains again.
[00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:32.100]   The thing that sustains you,
[00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:33.060]   the thing that's gonna enable you
[00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:36.460]   to walk out of those chains forever and move into freedom
[00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:38.060]   will be because you know there's a God
[00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:40.220]   who walks with you intimately and purposely
[00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:41.060]   every step of the way.
[00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:44.020]   His care, his love, his intimacy with you
[00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:47.500]   is the defining thing that won't just break the chains,
[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:49.260]   but will keep them off you.
[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:51.460]   Are you with me?
[00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:53.860]   So you can trust me, God says to Moses,
[00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:55.940]   because I am this mighty and powerful God
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:57.020]   and I'm in fighting battles
[00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:59.100]   and I'm involved in the hearts of man,
[00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:02.900]   but you can also trust me because I'm with you.
[00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:06.780]   I know you and I love you and I'm caring for you.
[00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:09.300]   And both of those two things are a reality at the same time
[00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:12.780]   and your freedom needs both of those things.
[00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:15.820]   Here's the third thing he does in verse four.
[00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:17.940]   He says, "I also established my covenant with them
[00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:19.460]   to give them the land of Canaan
[00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:21.060]   where they had lived as aliens.
[00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:23.500]   Moreover, I have heard the groaning of the Israelites
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:25.100]   whom the Egyptians are enslaving
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:26.660]   and I have remembered my covenant."
[00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:28.340]   The third reason that he gives
[00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:30.180]   for the reason why Moses can now trust him
[00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:31.620]   is 'cause of the covenant.
[00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:33.220]   And God has mentioned his covenant
[00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:35.780]   every step of the way of the Exodus so far to Moses
[00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:37.220]   'cause it's that important to God.
[00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:40.260]   His covenant is his contract with his people
[00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:41.660]   that he will deliver them,
[00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:43.140]   that he will bring the promises
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:44.580]   that he has in his heart for him.
[00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:47.140]   His covenant is the established reality
[00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:49.620]   that I have taken you, I have chosen you,
[00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:50.780]   you are my people.
[00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:54.420]   And because I have said my word, I never break my word.
[00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:57.100]   You can trust me because I'm covenanted to you.
[00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:58.260]   I'm connected with you.
[00:28:58.260 --> 00:28:59.620]   I have a contract with you.
[00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:00.620]   I've chosen you.
[00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:02.540]   I've done that in my own free will,
[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:04.940]   not because you've earned it, not because you deserve it,
[00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:07.500]   but because I desire to be in relationship with you.
[00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:09.780]   And because I have covenanted,
[00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:12.900]   I've contractually committed myself to you.
[00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:14.500]   No matter what you do,
[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:18.020]   it will not break the power of the coming of the promise
[00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:19.020]   that I have for you.
[00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:24.900]   You can trust me, God says, because I stand on my word.
[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:28.340]   You can trust me 'cause I never forget my contracts.
[00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:31.980]   You can trust me because unlike so many of us,
[00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:33.780]   you can take my word to the bank.
[00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:36.180]   If I've said it, if I've declared it,
[00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:39.900]   it will come to pass, says the Lord Almighty.
[00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:42.220]   So these three things
[00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:44.860]   is what God is trying to communicate to Moses.
[00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:48.340]   You can trust me because I am mighty before you.
[00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:52.740]   I am personal with you and I'm covenanted to you.
[00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:57.740]   And those three things are what you can build your life on.
[00:29:57.740 --> 00:29:58.940]   You can trust God,
[00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:00.420]   no matter what circumstance situation
[00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:01.580]   is going on in your life,
[00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:05.580]   because he is mighty and powerful to save,
[00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:09.900]   because he is personal and intimate with his people,
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:12.540]   because he has placed a covenant over us.
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:14.420]   In the Old Testament, in Exodus,
[00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:15.940]   a covenant written on stone.
[00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:17.620]   In the New Testament through Jesus,
[00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:20.140]   a covenant given by the blood of Christ.
[00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:22.060]   Those things have never changed.
[00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:24.780]   These three things, which are started and founded here
[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:26.220]   at the beginning of chapter six,
[00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:28.380]   become the complete foundation
[00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:29.740]   of our relationship with God.
[00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:33.380]   It is the foundation of our Christian faith
[00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:37.620]   that he is mighty, personal, and committed.
[00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:39.180]   Are you with me still?
[00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:40.700]   Now, off the back of all three of those,
[00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:42.300]   I want you to see what then God says.
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:44.900]   He said, "Because you can trust me for these three things,
[00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:48.460]   here are seven things I'm gonna do for you."
[00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:50.620]   And I think these seven things he does
[00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:52.860]   for Moses in Israel are seven things
[00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:53.980]   he will always do for you.
[00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:55.420]   Let me show you this really quick.
[00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:57.500]   Verse six, "Therefore say to the Israelites,
[00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:00.380]   I am the Lord," there it is, Yahweh, this personal God,
[00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:02.580]   "I will bring you up out from under the yoke
[00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:03.420]   of the Egyptians.
[00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:05.420]   I will free you from being slaves to them.
[00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:07.420]   I will redeem you with an outstretched arm
[00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:08.820]   and with mighty acts of judgment.
[00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:10.700]   I will take you as my own people.
[00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:12.180]   I will be your God.
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:14.340]   Then you will know that I am the Lord God
[00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:16.820]   who brought you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians.
[00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:19.580]   I will bring you to the land that I swore
[00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:22.980]   with uplifted hand to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:25.380]   I will give it to you as a possession,
[00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:27.580]   for I am the Lord."
[00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:30.900]   Seven I will do statements here.
[00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:32.460]   Let me show you the seven here.
[00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:34.740]   I will bring you out, I will free you,
[00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:36.740]   I will redeem you, I will take you,
[00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:39.740]   I will be your God, I will bring you, I will give it to you.
[00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:42.180]   These are the seven things that he says,
[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:44.580]   "Because I have a foundation of my mighty power,
[00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:46.620]   my personal intimacy, and my covenant with you,
[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:49.260]   I will do these seven things for you, Moses."
[00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:51.100]   And I say, he's doing these seven things
[00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:52.180]   for the vine church, for you,
[00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:53.700]   and whatever journey of Exodus you're in,
[00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:56.140]   he will do these things for you.
[00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:59.220]   Now, what's beautiful is when you read this in the Hebrew,
[00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:01.140]   rather than the English, when you read it in English,
[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:03.140]   it just looks like a random bit of a list.
[00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:04.300]   When you read it in the Hebrew,
[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:06.660]   you can see that poetically the writer here
[00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:10.780]   is trying to group these under four different phases
[00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:11.820]   of who God is.
[00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:13.180]   And I wanna show you this really quick.
[00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:15.220]   The first is this idea of take.
[00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:19.260]   God declares to Moses, "I will take you.
[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:22.140]   I will take you and be your God, because that's who I am.
[00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:24.540]   I've chosen you of my own free will.
[00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:27.580]   And because I will take you, here's what I will do for you.
[00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:29.860]   The second thing, I will bless you.
[00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:34.100]   If I take you to be mine, then my promises, my character,
[00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:35.820]   my love will be yours.
[00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:39.860]   In taking you to be part of my family, in being your God,
[00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:42.420]   I will then give to you these promises."
[00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:45.260]   And it's capturing this idea of I will bring you in,
[00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:46.500]   as he says in this passage.
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.300]   In other words, there is a time in the future
[00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:50.300]   where you will be in my promises.
[00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:51.900]   The things that I have for you
[00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:53.420]   will always be a blessing for you.
[00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:56.860]   I bless the things that I have chosen and taken.
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:57.700]   Are you with me?
[00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:01.260]   So I will take you so that I would ultimately bless you.
[00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:06.220]   Now, however, I cannot bless you until I, third,
[00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:10.060]   break some of the things that are holding you enslaved.
[00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:12.220]   So this idea of breaking,
[00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:14.700]   or I will bring you out of your slavery,
[00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:17.260]   I will free you from the bonds of your slavery,
[00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:19.460]   I will redeem you or save you.
[00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:22.720]   These are the ideas of God breaking the bonds
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:25.640]   that are holding Israel out of the promises
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:27.420]   that God had already declared for them.
[00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:30.180]   So I'm gonna take you because I have a promise
[00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:31.620]   that I wanna bless you with,
[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:32.700]   but to get you there,
[00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:35.420]   I gotta break some of that stuff off of you.
[00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:38.500]   Once it's broken, then I can give you,
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:39.780]   that's the final phase,
[00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:41.780]   I can give you what it is that I long to give you.
[00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:44.420]   And so this idea of I will actually give you,
[00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:45.260]   as it said here.
[00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:48.040]   So those seven things actually become a part
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:50.940]   of a four-stage process
[00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:52.940]   that God is declaring to Israel in this moment
[00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:54.980]   and saying, "The rest of the Exodus is about this.
[00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:58.060]   I'm gonna take you, I'm gonna pull my blessings on you,
[00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:00.180]   I'm gonna break off Pharaoh's hold from you,
[00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:02.460]   and then eventually I will give you the promised land
[00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:03.300]   that you'll move in."
[00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:04.720]   Are you with me still?
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:09.700]   This idea of taking, blessing, breaking, and giving
[00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:14.020]   becomes the foundational thinking for Jewish people
[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:15.780]   when it comes to their understanding of God.
[00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:18.500]   And it's based here in Exodus chapter six,
[00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:21.860]   the mountain after the valley of Exodus chapter five.
[00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:25.400]   But it's not the only time in history
[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:29.440]   when this concept becomes so important for God's people.
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.340]   In fact, as I draw to a close,
[00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:34.040]   I wanna share with you one final passage
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:36.000]   that happens in the New Testament.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.040]   This is a moment where Jesus,
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:43.000]   just literally the night before He's about to be betrayed,
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.840]   He comes before His disciples
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:47.840]   and they find an upper room to celebrate Passover.
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:49.520]   Passover, the meal that was celebrated
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:50.840]   and is still celebrated today
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:52.840]   by Jewish people around the world,
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:56.000]   that recognizes the power of God
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.020]   to bring people out of their slavery.
[00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:00.140]   And so in this moment,
[00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:04.380]   Jesus is celebrating a Jewish festival with His disciples
[00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:05.640]   that's linked to the Exodus.
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:06.480]   Does that make sense to you?
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:07.800]   Are you with me?
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.640]   Everybody still okay?
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.160]   Okay, you need to follow this.
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:12.400]   So He's sitting in this upper room
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:15.160]   and He's doing a Jewish festival with His disciples.
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:16.680]   But for the first time in history,
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:21.160]   Jesus will now embody Himself into the Exodus narrative.
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:23.600]   He will now say that that whole journey
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:26.800]   that took place in Exodus was actually about me
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:29.760]   and the journey I'm about to bring you on.
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:33.000]   I wanna show you this in what He says, verse 14 onwards.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.200]   This is Luke 22, verse 14.
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:36.180]   When the hour had come,
[00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:38.500]   Jesus and His apostles reclined at the table.
[00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:39.340]   And He said to them,
[00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:41.720]   "I've eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:43.000]   before I suffer.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.720]   For I tell you that I will not eat of it again
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:47.200]   until it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of God.
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.080]   After taking the cup,
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:48.920]   He gave thanks and said,
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:50.800]   "Take this and divide it among you.
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:52.360]   For I tell you that I will not drink again
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:55.240]   of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes."
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:57.680]   Verse 19, He took the bread, gave thanks and broke it
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.120]   and gave it to them and said this,
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:01.680]   "This is my body given for you.
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:04.040]   Do this in remembrance of me."
[00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:05.400]   In the same way, after the supper,
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.220]   He took the cup saying,
[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:09.040]   "This cup is the new covenant in my blood,
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:10.880]   which is poured out for you."
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:12.580]   I want you to hear Exodus in this.
[00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:14.560]   It's the Passover celebration.
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:16.620]   And Jesus is talking about a new covenant
[00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:19.600]   He's going to bring, linking to Exodus chapter six.
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:22.120]   But I want you to see where the link is most powerful.
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:23.440]   Take a look at verse 19.
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:27.760]   "And He took bread, He blessed it,
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:30.600]   He broke it and He gave it to them."
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:33.280]   Isn't that crazy?
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:37.240]   Jesus, in deciding to create
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:40.600]   what we now commonly call communion,
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:44.360]   what the church has been practicing for over 2000 years,
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:47.680]   Jesus begins that practice by literally doing
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:50.040]   the very four things that is rooted
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:53.440]   in chapter six of Exodus.
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:57.080]   He takes the bread, He blesses it,
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:59.840]   He breaks it and He gives it,
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:03.020]   creating a tradition that we now do
[00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:05.120]   that not only aligns ourselves to Jesus,
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:08.000]   but aligns herself to the God of the Exodus,
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.980]   the one who is mighty, personal and covenanted to us.
[00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:15.360]   And this is exactly what happens for Jesus Himself.
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:18.320]   God has taken Christ Jesus.
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:22.160]   He has blessed Him with His life on earth.
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:24.760]   His body is broken on the cross
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:27.100]   so that that body broken and the blood shed
[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:29.900]   would give those who would believe in Him eternal life.
[00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:35.040]   In the same way, Christ, through His relationship with you,
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:38.980]   He has taken you from your bondage of slavery.
[00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:42.320]   He has blessed you with His presence and with the gospel.
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:45.240]   He has broken off the slavery of sin in your life
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:48.080]   and He has given you eternal life.
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:50.960]   Take, bless, give.
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:52.960]   I got it wrong.
[00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:57.640]   Take, bless, break, give
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:01.120]   is the process that God has for His people.
[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:03.680]   That's the God of the Exodus, my friends.
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:05.240]   Whatever it is that you're going through right now,
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:08.680]   those four things God does for you
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:12.160]   and you can trust Him 'cause He has the might to do it,
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:14.960]   He's personally with you, He's covenanted to you
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:17.680]   and He will take you, He will bless you,
[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:19.980]   He will break off the things that need to be broken off
[00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:21.800]   so that He can give you all the promises
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.820]   that He's longed to give you, amen?
