[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Well, when I was in university, I was very proud
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.080]   because I made the men's basketball team.
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.920]   I know.
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.520]   And on my team, there was actually incredible players.
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.880]   They were really good.
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.240]   One of them, so much so that every summer,
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.240]   he practiced with NBA players.
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.120]   So it was like he, I was living in Northwest.
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.360]   At that time, there was the Seattle Supersonics.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.280]   They now moved to, I think, Oklahoma City or something.
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.000]   And so he was playing with some of those players.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   Now, on the men's team, there usually was seven
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.920]   or eight players that got to play most of the time.
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.040]   I was not one of them.
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.000]   So we'll see the other ones play.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.560]   Now, the first year, I was okay with that.
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.040]   You know, the other players are better.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.800]   That's fine, fantastic, you know, go ahead.
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.800]   Second year, there was one guy that was playing my position
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.920]   who was in that eight-person rotation.
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.880]   And I felt like that I had the similar skill set as he did.
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.800]   And I started comparing myself to him.
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.640]   And as I was doing that, I was like, you know,
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.120]   I really would deserve to have a spot
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.320]   and be able to play and be in that rotation.
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.760]   At the very least, I should get the opportunity
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.840]   to prove myself a few times.
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.160]   Why does he get to play?
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.320]   Why don't I get to play?
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.320]   And so I started to complain and grumble inside my heart
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.920]   as I compared myself.
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.520]   Now, before that, I was actually feeling great.
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.680]   I was so proud to be on the team.
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.720]   But when I started comparing, all that went out the window.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.040]   Isn't that interesting how that goes, right?
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.280]   Like when you start complaining,
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.360]   like maybe something that we enjoyed before
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.280]   or something else good suddenly doesn't seem
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.640]   that good anymore.
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.640]   Now, we all experience that.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.000]   You know, whether that's in your workplace,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.680]   in a relationship, in church,
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.000]   in all these different places, we experience that.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.600]   That's when we start comparing ourselves,
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.680]   we get tunnel vision.
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.480]   We start focusing in on what the other person has
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.480]   that we don't have, that we should have.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.240]   And we kind of lose joy along the way.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.560]   Like we stop seeing the good things
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.800]   that God is doing in our lives.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.800]   And a lot of times, there's a lot of negative emotions
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.040]   with that as well, right?
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.960]   And so what I wanna do with you today,
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.240]   I wanna explore with you a question is,
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.240]   how can we break out of or escape from this pattern
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.480]   of comparing ourselves with others that brings us down?
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.440]   You know, how do we get out of that?
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.400]   'Cause it's so destructive and it's like kills our joy.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.880]   You know, what do we do?
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.600]   And what does God's word have to say to us about that?
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.960]   So we are in a new sermon series
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.480]   that we have entitled "Living the Kingdom Parables."
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.280]   And Jesus, if you're familiar with him,
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.400]   I think like 30 or 40% of the words in the Bible from him
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.240]   are actually parables.
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.280]   So it was one of the major ways that he taught.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.240]   And for those of you who are not so 100% sure
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.440]   about what is a parable, that sounds interesting,
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.280]   but what is this?
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.880]   Here's a little definition.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.120]   A parable is a comparison that employs
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.520]   an ordinary circumstance in everyday life
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.240]   to illustrate a spiritual truth.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.640]   So Jesus uses everyday examples,
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.520]   but with that he's actually illustrating,
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.120]   you know, a truth about something else.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.880]   And in this series,
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.640]   we're gonna look at five different parables.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.760]   Parables also, they tend to provoke us.
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.600]   They tend to stir some emotions in us
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.760]   'cause there's something in them
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.560]   that rubs us the wrong way.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.880]   And it's usually right at that point
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.480]   where we are rubbed the wrong way
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.360]   that God wants to say something to us,
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.240]   that that's why Jesus uses them,
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.400]   because they're so powerful.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.800]   And so I'm really excited about this series.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:26.200]   And the heart behind it is that we can align ourselves
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.400]   with a kingdom mindset, with kingdom living,
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.840]   with the things where we are not aligned
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.800]   with God's will, Jesus' desire for us,
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.800]   his followers, his disciples.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.640]   Now in just a moment,
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.120]   we're gonna look at the parable of the laborers
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.040]   in the vineyard.
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.200]   But before we get there,
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.640]   I wanna settle it with the context.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.600]   And actually, there's a lot of things
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.080]   that could be said about the context.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.280]   It's a lot more than I usually would do,
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.520]   but I'm gonna try to keep it very short.
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.000]   So basically, there's a story where a rich young man,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.680]   he comes to Jesus and he wants to understand,
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.400]   how can I have eternal life?
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.880]   But in the process of talking with Jesus,
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.680]   he chooses his wealth over following Jesus.
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.400]   And he walks away sad, but he's just not able to let go
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.960]   of what Jesus asked him to do.
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:31.080]   Now in response to this, Peter, who was listening,
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.400]   who has left things behind, he's like, "Hey, Jesus,
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.240]   "what about us?
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.280]   "I wanna read with you actually something that he says."
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.240]   So it's Matthew 19, verse 27.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.680]   He says, "We have left everything to follow you.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.360]   "What then will be there for us?"
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.760]   And it's interesting because Jesus,
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.840]   he does tell Peter that there will be rewards
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.320]   for him leaving everything,
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.000]   that he actually will bless them in incredible ways.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.080]   But he also tells this parable
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.000]   in response to Peter's question.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.600]   'Cause there's something about the question,
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.840]   there's something about the comparison that Peter did
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.200]   to the rich young ruler,
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.400]   where Jesus wants to say a little bit more.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.120]   Where there's something else that needs to be said.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.680]   And this is where we're gonna pick up.
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.120]   So we're in Matthew chapter 20,
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.160]   we're starting in response, it says this.
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.080]   "For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.580]   "who went out early in the morning
[00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.920]   "to hire workers for his vineyard.
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.240]   "He agreed to pay them a denarius for the day
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.600]   "and sent them into his vineyard.
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.040]   "About nine in the morning, he went out
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:44.160]   "and saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.140]   "He told them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard
[00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.480]   "'and I will pay you whatever's right.'
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.400]   "So they went.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.380]   "He went out again about noon
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.900]   "and about three in the afternoon, did the same thing.
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.260]   "About five in the afternoon,
[00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.660]   "he went out and found still others standing around.
[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.220]   "He asked them, 'Why have you been standing here
[00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.560]   "'all day long doing nothing?'
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.700]   "Because no one has hired us, they answered.
[00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:13.880]   "He said to them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard.'
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.300]   "And when evening came, the owner of the vineyard
[00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.500]   "said to his foreman, 'Call the workers
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.460]   "'and pay them their wages,
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.640]   "'beginning with the last ones hired and going to the first.'
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.720]   "So the workers who were hired about five in the afternoon
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.520]   "came and each received a denarius.
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.940]   "So when those came who were hired first,
[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.560]   "they expected to receive more.
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:41.220]   "But each one of them also received a denarius.
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.400]   "When they received it,
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.840]   "they began to grumble against the landowner.
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:51.200]   "'These who were hired last worked only one hour,'
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.640]   "they said, 'and you have made them equal to us
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.560]   "'who have borne the burden of the work
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.040]   "'and the heat of the day.'
[00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:03.960]   "But he answered one of them,
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.580]   "'I'm not being unfair to you, friend.
[00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:09.540]   "'Didn't you agree to work for a denarius?
[00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.580]   "'Take your pay and go.
[00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:14.620]   "'I want to give the one who was hired
[00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.320]   "'last the same as I gave to you.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.060]   "'Don't I have the right to do what I want
[00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:20.800]   "'with my own money?
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:25.040]   "'Or are you envious because I am generous?
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:29.900]   "'So the last will be first and the first will be last.'"
[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:34.740]   Wow, that's a lot, isn't it?
[00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:39.900]   So let's unpack that, let's walk through this parable,
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.260]   and let me highlight some things along the way.
[00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.880]   So the first thing is, in this parable,
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.720]   it's, again, it's an everyday scene.
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.140]   It's a laborer looking for workers, the workman's vineyard.
[00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:55.540]   So people, he finds people in the marketplace,
[00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:58.120]   he tells them, "You want to come work in my vineyard?
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.260]   "There's probably the harvest.
[00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.480]   "These workers will bring in the harvest."
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.440]   And so they agree to work for one denarius,
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.560]   which basically was enough money to pay for food
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.960]   for the family for that day.
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:12.760]   But then what's interesting is that the landowner
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.040]   actually keeps going out, and it's also interesting
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.600]   that the landowner does that.
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:21.240]   You know, it's him going out and hiring workers,
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.600]   not somebody else, not one of his employees, but he does it.
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.560]   And so there's other people he meets,
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:30.220]   and they agree that they will be paid
[00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:33.300]   whatever is right, in verse four.
[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.260]   And so he tells them, "I'll pay you something that's fair."
[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:40.140]   And then he goes out at five o'clock,
[00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.500]   which by this time, there's only one hour left in workday,
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.180]   so workdays usually were 12 hours.
[00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:46.740]   So there's only one hour left.
[00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:50.660]   And he still finds people standing around,
[00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:51.860]   and he's kind of confused by that.
[00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.680]   He's like, "Why are they standing around?
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.540]   "Why are you doing nothing?"
[00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.740]   And they say, "No one has hired us."
[00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:04.620]   Now, no one, in other words, wants them.
[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:10.520]   When I lived in the US, I one time rode along
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.860]   with a contractor who actually picked up workers.
[00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:17.420]   You know, there was a place where they were waiting
[00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.620]   for work for the day.
[00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.140]   And it was interesting because the contractors
[00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:24.260]   actually get to know the workers.
[00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.580]   And then a lot of times, they know who they like
[00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.060]   to work with, but they also know maybe the person
[00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.160]   who doesn't work that well.
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:36.500]   And so I can imagine in the setting,
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.100]   you know, the workers, they knew these guys,
[00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.580]   and they're like, "Ah, we don't want them working for us."
[00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:43.080]   So they didn't hire them, but they hired the other guys.
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:47.180]   But this landowner, he hires them nonetheless for one hour.
[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:48.080]   So it's interesting.
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.340]   It's kind of something precarious,
[00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.400]   something that should make us curious.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.400]   So at the end of the day, 12 hours worked.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.600]   You know, you have people working different hours.
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.840]   Some work 12, and some work one hour.
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:06.000]   Now, we have to remember that this is a parable
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.880]   because it's easy to kind of lose track of that.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:15.160]   So in this parable, the landowner is God
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.280]   who's calling people into his kingdom
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.760]   to be his kingdom workers.
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.480]   So that's something we need to keep in mind
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.920]   as we continue walking through it, okay?
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.760]   But let's go on, and this is where things get interesting,
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:27.960]   the next part.
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:30.680]   This is where it gets juicy, as they say.
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:37.320]   So in verse eight to six, we see that the landowner
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.960]   tells the foreman, "Call the people together.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.760]   "I wanna pay them."
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:44.200]   And he decides to pay them from those who came last.
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.920]   He wants to pay them first, and then, you know,
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.040]   pay all of them after the first one.
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.160]   And then, you know, pay all of them
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.440]   until the ones who started in the morning.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:56.880]   Now, what's absolutely incredible
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:00.600]   is that the landowner pays those who came
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.800]   and worked for one hour.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.720]   He pays them one denarius, which is the same
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.840]   that he had agreed upon, you know, for the others.
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.640]   And this kind of stirs some excitement.
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.500]   Actually, at this point in time, nobody minds that,
[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.300]   that they're getting paid a denarius
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:21.280]   because they are expecting that they will receive more.
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:29.620]   But when it's their turn to pay, to be paid,
[00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:30.460]   guess what happens, right?
[00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:31.400]   We already read it.
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.200]   They just get one denarius.
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.040]   Ooh.
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:39.760]   They worked 12 hours, the other ones worked one hour,
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.280]   and they get paid the same.
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.600]   I don't know if you've ever, like,
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:48.120]   been in a work situation where you do a lot more,
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.880]   maybe somebody else is chilling and playing video games,
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:51.920]   and you get paid the same.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.820]   It just doesn't feel good, does it?
[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:58.680]   I also, if this was today, I wonder, like,
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:02.000]   what people would do on social media, right?
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.120]   Like, they might go on X.
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.560]   Is that what it's called?
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.200]   Twitter, is it called X?
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.040]   I can't remember.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.560]   Okay, yeah, so they go on X, you know,
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.520]   shoot out some tweets.
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:11.980]   If there was Google Review,
[00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:15.440]   they would write a nasty review about this, you know,
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.800]   horrible landowner who is so unfair.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:25.200]   And I think we can feel, we can have sympathy with that.
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.840]   There does seem to be some unfairness
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.760]   from our perspective, right?
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.280]   So, and we can feel that.
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:34.040]   So it's no surprise then that they actually grumble
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:34.880]   and they complain.
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:37.320]   So in verse 11, we're told they begin to grumble
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.960]   against the landowner, so they're angry against them.
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.380]   And then in verse 12, we're told,
[00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:45.580]   these who were hired last worked only one hour, they said,
[00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:49.060]   and you have made them equal to us,
[00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:52.140]   and who have borne the burden of the work
[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:53.620]   and the heat of the day.
[00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:56.500]   You know, hey, you're making them the same as us,
[00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:59.260]   but we earned, we deserve more than them.
[00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.540]   We earned this, we have the right to this.
[00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.560]   You know, that's what they're saying.
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.540]   Like, we're not equal to these other guys
[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:09.260]   that nobody wanted to hire that just worked one hour.
[00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.240]   We should get more.
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.920]   And they're just ticked off.
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:17.480]   But I want you to notice something.
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:20.720]   All of this grumbling and frustration,
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.080]   the only reason why it happens
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.960]   is because they're comparing themselves.
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:32.480]   If the foreman would have paid the first comers first
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.320]   and sent them off, they would have gotten
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.160]   what they agreed upon, right?
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.440]   One denarius and they go and they would have been happy.
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.680]   But it was only when they compared themselves
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.880]   that they got angry and frustrated
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.060]   and felt like they were treated wrongly.
[00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:52.040]   So comparison can turn something that is good
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.240]   into something sour.
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:57.960]   It's like me with basketball.
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.660]   I was proud to be on the team.
[00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:02.000]   I felt amazing.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.800]   I made the college basketball team.
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.840]   But then when I compared myself to the one guy
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:08.320]   who was like similar skill level,
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:11.400]   looking back, he was better than me, just being honest.
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:17.120]   But when I compared myself,
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.800]   then I was grumbling, then I was complaining,
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.320]   and suddenly something that was good
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.520]   didn't feel that good.
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.160]   And my joy was drained.
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.920]   But then, let's continue the story.
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.520]   So the landowner, he actually responds in verse 30.
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.780]   He says, "But he answered one of them,
[00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:37.500]   "I'm not being unfair to you, friend.
[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.220]   "Didn't you agree to work for a denarius?"
[00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:40.820]   He reminds him of the facts.
[00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:42.460]   "Take your pay and go.
[00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:44.660]   "I wanna give the ones who was hired the last
[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:46.560]   "the same as I gave you.
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:48.340]   "Don't I have the right to do what I want
[00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:50.000]   "with my own money?
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.900]   "Or are you envious because I am generous?"
[00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:59.740]   Now it's interesting because the workers,
[00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:01.820]   they're actually claiming that the landlord
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:03.440]   is unjust and unfair.
[00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:07.060]   That he is treating them wrongly.
[00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:09.780]   But he's saying, "I've actually done what I promised you.
[00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.300]   "You agreed to this."
[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:14.620]   And so he's highlighting that.
[00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:20.100]   And they're trying to make this about a justice issue,
[00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:22.000]   and he shifts it and he says,
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.340]   "You're upset, you're envious because I'm generous."
[00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:28.940]   So he's saying, "This is not about justice.
[00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.920]   "This is about envy.
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:33.020]   "This is about my generosity
[00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:34.820]   "with which you struggle with,
[00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:37.640]   "which you don't want for the other person.
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:39.340]   "That's why you're upset."
[00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:42.380]   Ay-yah.
[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:48.540]   This is where we get to the heart issue
[00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:49.980]   that Jesus wants to address.
[00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:53.220]   That he wanted to address in Peter,
[00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:54.860]   that he wants to address in us.
[00:16:54.860 --> 00:17:00.880]   He asks the question, "Or are you envious
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.140]   "because I'm generous?"
[00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:08.740]   And the truth is they are envious because he is generous.
[00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:18.940]   They are envious of the grace and mercy
[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:22.420]   that the workers that nobody wants to hire,
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:24.140]   that maybe are not as skilled,
[00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.640]   that look like they have a messy life,
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.820]   that maybe smell like alcohol,
[00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:32.980]   don't look the way we think somebody
[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:35.180]   who is a good worker looks
[00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:38.480]   because the landowner showed them grace and mercy.
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.320]   That's why they're ticked off.
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.320]   Now, at this point in time, again, we have to remember,
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:44.880]   we're reading a parable.
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:47.660]   This is not a workplace situation.
[00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:51.400]   This is Jesus using life circumstance
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:52.700]   to explain something else.
[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:59.720]   And so Jesus, in this parable, as I already said,
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.540]   the landowner represents God,
[00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:06.180]   and it's actually God calling people into his kingdom,
[00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:09.260]   inviting them to be workers in his kingdom,
[00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:12.420]   inviting them to give them some work in the vineyard.
[00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:17.220]   So when you're a Christian, God has called you
[00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:19.060]   and he has given you a place in the vineyard
[00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:21.300]   to work, every one of us.
[00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:27.400]   And it is all by the grace and by the mercy of God.
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.520]   None of us deserve it.
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.620]   None of us are entitled to it.
[00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:36.620]   It is 100% the grace of God that he calls us
[00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:39.820]   and that we get to be part of his family,
[00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:42.400]   that we get to be his workers in the vineyard.
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:52.500]   But the reason the early workers in this parable
[00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:55.340]   are so upset because they have forgotten that.
[00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:56.180]   And guess what?
[00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:57.300]   We forget that as well.
[00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:01.860]   And we start actually thinking about our relationship
[00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:06.220]   with God a lot of times as we think about relationships
[00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:07.500]   in business.
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:08.700]   You know, they're transactional.
[00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.600]   You owe me something.
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.700]   I did this, God, and you owe me this.
[00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:17.080]   Why should he or she have this?
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.740]   I have done this.
[00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:23.140]   I am entitled to that, but you're not giving it to me.
[00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:26.580]   And so we start grumbling against the landowners.
[00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:28.140]   We start grumbling against God.
[00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:33.260]   And our relationship with God starts growing sour
[00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:37.820]   'cause we have lost sight that this whole thing
[00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:42.220]   is all by the mercy, by the grace, by the love,
[00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:44.980]   by the generosity of God.
[00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:52.500]   In the kingdom of God, it isn't about earning or deserving,
[00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:57.620]   but about receiving, saving grace, and joyfully serving God.
[00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:01.920]   (audience members clapping)
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:05.780]   Now, what does all this have to do with us?
[00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:08.780]   I know I was just walking us through the story,
[00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:10.700]   trying to help us understand some of the details
[00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:12.260]   a little bit better.
[00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:15.120]   But what is it that this parable exposes
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.420]   and challenges within our hearts?
[00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:20.960]   And what does Jesus call us to instead?
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:26.800]   Well, the first thing is we theoretically love grace.
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.680]   We theoretically like it.
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:33.280]   We like it when God is gracious to us,
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.200]   when he's good to us.
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.640]   Oh, thank you, God, for the promotion.
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.480]   Hallelujah, praise the Lord.
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:41.520]   Thank you, God, for this that you've done in my life.
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.700]   I love you, you're amazing.
[00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:46.160]   So we love grace theoretically.
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:50.000]   Well, we start not liking it when God's generosity
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.320]   and goodness comes to somebody else,
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.480]   when it comes to our competitor,
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.200]   when it comes to the other family member,
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.280]   when it comes to, you know, what you can fill in the blank.
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.960]   So theoretically, we like grace.
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.680]   We're like, yeah, I love grace, we're a grace church.
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.920]   But then when it actually comes down to it,
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.520]   a lot of times we don't like it.
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.960]   Is this true?
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.560]   Yeah, I think so, right?
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:15.720]   Come on.
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.740]   Just having honest conversation here.
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:23.120]   And so perhaps we envy a relationship,
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:27.360]   a promotion, success, praise,
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.680]   gifts that people have, scholarships they've been awarded,
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:34.100]   favors, you know, from someone you can fill in the blank.
[00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:41.360]   You know, where have you envied God's generosity
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:42.460]   towards somebody else?
[00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:48.320]   Where do you find yourself being envious right now
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:52.560]   and comparing yourself and feeling like you are entitled,
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:54.920]   they shouldn't be entitled?
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.240]   And by the way, I chose a very safe example
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:00.160]   with the basketball team on purpose,
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.960]   you know, keeping it light and easy.
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:06.760]   Where are you envious right now?
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:08.800]   Where you feel like you deserve something,
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.300]   God owes you something.
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:17.300]   You know, and when we compare ourselves to others,
[00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:22.500]   the legalistic religion within ourselves
[00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:24.100]   actually is exposed.
[00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:29.160]   When I say I deserve this, why is God giving the person that?
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.260]   Really what we're saying is I earned this.
[00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:35.300]   But as we've said, you know, everything from God
[00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:38.020]   is something we get by grace, by his mercy.
[00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:41.260]   It's not something that we earn,
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:44.320]   you know, we just receive it by grace and mercy.
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:46.700]   But so it exposes our heart that actually,
[00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:51.020]   there's some works religion in there, in us.
[00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:53.980]   You know that, and this is what Jesus
[00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:56.340]   is kind of teasing out in Peter's heart,
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:58.180]   in his listeners heart, in our heart.
[00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:04.540]   And we say that person should not be of equal status to me,
[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:07.380]   I should be of higher status, you know,
[00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:09.300]   because I did so and so and that person
[00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:11.220]   is not the same as me, you know,
[00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:13.000]   and we go on and on and on.
[00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:19.900]   So you will never see the goodness of God
[00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:22.480]   when you envy his generosity towards others.
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.820]   It gives you a tunnel vision.
[00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:28.180]   You lose track of it.
[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:29.820]   Now I don't know if you've, you know,
[00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:31.860]   if you struggle with that, it's a real struggle.
[00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:34.340]   We, you know, sometimes it is hard to get out of that.
[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:36.020]   And I actually want us to be compassionate
[00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:37.260]   and graceful towards one another,
[00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:39.840]   even when we find ourselves in those places.
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:45.340]   You know, but it's, when you're so focused
[00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:48.340]   on what somebody else has and you haven't
[00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:49.900]   and you feel like you deserve it,
[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:53.620]   man, you start losing track of all the goodness
[00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:54.860]   of God in your life.
[00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:57.380]   You're not able to see it.
[00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:02.820]   And it's just, it's just not a good place.
[00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:04.620]   And God doesn't want us to live in that place.
[00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:06.860]   You know, he wants us to see his goodness,
[00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:10.180]   his love, his grace, his mercy.
[00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:14.180]   He wants you to see it, he wants you to know it.
[00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:16.140]   He wants you to be confident in it.
[00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:19.720]   He is faithful to you, his people.
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:23.940]   But you will never see the goodness of God
[00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:26.920]   when you are envy his generosity towards others.
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:29.100]   So what's the antidote to that?
[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:30.100]   What do we do?
[00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:33.540]   How can we get out of this comparison trap
[00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:36.380]   that leaves us being jealous and envious?
[00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:42.520]   Well, the antidote is that we start practicing
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:47.520]   and seeing and giving thanks to God's goodness and mercy.
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:52.760]   That we cultivate this attitude of gratitude.
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:56.680]   I came up with another way right before the sermon,
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:59.740]   that we practice the art of seeing God's goodness
[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:00.600]   in our lives.
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:04.640]   You know, we struggle with that.
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:08.680]   But when we do that and we start giving God thanks
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.020]   for, wow, God, thank you for your mercy,
[00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:13.920]   thank you for salvation, thank you for your faithfulness,
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:18.000]   thank you that you are with me, that I know your presence.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.560]   Thank you that I'm breathing today,
[00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:22.920]   thank you for my health, thank you for whatever God
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.200]   is being good to you, just give him thanks.
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:28.200]   You know, it's amazing when we do that.
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:31.580]   Now, there's a biblical scholar, Michael J. Wilkins,
[00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:33.120]   he defines gratitude this way.
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.840]   He says, "Gratitude is the response of the believing person
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:40.040]   "to the goodness of God's grace in creation
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:44.120]   "and redemption, making gratitude the authentic hallmark
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:46.100]   "of the disciple of Jesus."
[00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:51.460]   So gratitude, so our thanks, our praise is a response
[00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:55.500]   to Jesus and our lives are meant to be a response
[00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:58.400]   to the goodness, to the mercy of God,
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.920]   where we say thank you, Jesus, for placing,
[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.620]   for calling me into your vineyard.
[00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:06.520]   And I'm gonna serve you in this patch that you put me in
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.920]   and I believe that you have a purpose for me
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:12.600]   here in this patch, that you don't make mistakes
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:16.040]   and I'm gonna joyfully serve you and work for you.
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:19.600]   And I'm not gonna be focused on rewards or who gets what,
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:24.600]   I'm just gonna live in gratitude of your generosity,
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:27.640]   you know, towards me, your goodness towards me.
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:28.880]   And you know, when we do that,
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:30.960]   there's something really freeing.
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:34.500]   When we just know that God loves us, that we are secure,
[00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:38.080]   that we're not gonna miss out, that he cares for us,
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:42.600]   that he has our back, it just frees us to love other people,
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:45.320]   to serve him and not be concerned, you know,
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.960]   about us being entitled to this or to that.
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:51.040]   And if I only had this, you know,
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.320]   then I'd be happy and all of that.
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:56.720]   Or he should not have that and she should not have that.
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:58.520]   Like there's, it's just amazing, you know,
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:01.780]   when we live in this gratitude and just see God's mercy,
[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:04.760]   that we're just freed to love other people,
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:07.180]   to do the work of God that he gives us
[00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:09.180]   and to just enjoy his goodness.
[00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:17.460]   Now, I was at a point in my life where this was not easy.
[00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:24.920]   It's not always easy to have the attitude of gratitude.
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.520]   And maybe if you're really feeling bad,
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:27.360]   and somebody tells you,
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:30.200]   you should have the attitude of gratitude.
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.560]   You know, you're like, hmm,
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:35.280]   I don't know if I wanna hear this right now.
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:38.280]   (audience laughing)
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:42.500]   So I've shared, you know, some of the story before,
[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:46.700]   but basically, you know, several years ago,
[00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:49.660]   I had significant loss of my life,
[00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:54.660]   loss of relationship, loss of home, loss of my job.
[00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:59.520]   And, you know, really I was like, God, I'm serving you.
[00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:04.280]   You know, I was a pastor.
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:05.920]   I love you.
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:07.840]   Like, why is my life falling apart?
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:10.160]   And why do people maybe who seem like
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.320]   they don't care about you that much,
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.480]   why are they doing good?
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:15.320]   This is so unfair.
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.780]   You know, I deserve this.
[00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:19.240]   So I was complaining.
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.200]   I was grumbling.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.080]   And I have to say, you know,
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:25.720]   sometimes when just our life knocks us down,
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:27.180]   sometimes that's where we're at.
[00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:29.400]   You know, it's not like we can always,
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:32.520]   I always ride away in the ideal place,
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.160]   you know, but that's where I was.
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:39.160]   And it's, but it's interesting when we, you know,
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:42.080]   say why do they have such a good life?
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.800]   Actually, the reality is,
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:46.920]   do we really know that they have a good life?
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:53.900]   Do we know that they don't have marital problems?
[00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:57.400]   Do we know that they're not lonely in the evening
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.780]   and there's tears every night?
[00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:00.800]   Do we not, do we know
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:04.880]   that they're not carrying some baggage from the past
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:08.680]   that's just heavy and that's just impacting them even today?
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:11.440]   You know, is that other person's life,
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.420]   is it really better?
[00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:18.920]   And, and that, because we just see the facade, right?
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:20.600]   That, that we are jealous of,
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:23.320]   and like, why is God generous to this person?
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:25.920]   But if we actually would swap lives like completely,
[00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:29.720]   maybe their life is really not that great.
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:31.400]   Maybe God's just, you know,
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.320]   pouring out some goodness in this area of their lives
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.960]   just to encourage them because the rest is so difficult.
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.920]   But anyhow, I was, I was not thinking this way,
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:42.320]   you know, it's like, why, why do they have a good life?
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:45.200]   And right now my life is a mess.
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.540]   And so I was talking to a friend
[00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:50.840]   and I was, you know, sharing all this stuff with him.
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:55.400]   And he was encouraging me to see God's goodness.
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:58.040]   I have to say, he did listen to me several times.
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:59.240]   Then only after a while,
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:00.960]   it was like after three conversations,
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.880]   or he started to talk to me about seeing God's goodness.
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.280]   It was not the first thing he told me.
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:09.920]   And I shared with him that there was a family
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:15.400]   that took me in, you know, as I had lost my relationship,
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:20.120]   my home, my job, that they welcomed me into their home.
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:25.180]   And my goal was, I'm just gonna be here.
[00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:26.920]   I'm gonna hide in this room
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:29.360]   so that they allow me to stay here longer,
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.720]   that they don't get annoyed and want me out of the house,
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:36.000]   you know, just try to clean up everything, good.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.160]   But they didn't just want me in their house,
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.880]   they actually invited me to be part of their family.
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:44.580]   I had dinner with them, I went shopping with them,
[00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:47.800]   I went wine tasting with them, which was a lot of fun.
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:54.120]   You know, they just really loved me and embraced me
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:57.440]   in this difficult time where I was like a mess,
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:59.040]   crying and all of that.
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:04.320]   And my friend says, "Don't you see how much God loves you?
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:07.120]   "How he's showing you his goodness
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.320]   "in this difficult time through his family?
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:11.460]   "Don't you see that?"
[00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:14.960]   Wow.
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:18.300]   And I really needed that because I couldn't see it on my own.
[00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:22.000]   And I could see God's goodness,
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.960]   and this was a turning point for me,
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:26.720]   where I could start giving God thanks
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:31.560]   and praise him for his love and care for me,
[00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:34.040]   despite the difficulties and the challenges
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:35.400]   that were going on.
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:38.040]   I was just saying, "Thank you, thank you, Lord."
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:42.240]   And I started slowly naming the things
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:44.000]   in which God has been good to me.
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:47.120]   (pages rustling)
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:58.560]   Now, when we have God's grace and mercy in view,
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:02.000]   when we get to see it, it is so powerful.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.320]   Now, for me, there was this complaining against God.
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:09.200]   Now, I don't think that I saw God as like, you know,
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.480]   the evil landowner who's so unjust to me,
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:13.520]   but it was a little bit of that.
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:17.240]   And it's amazing when we see God's grace and mercy,
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:21.220]   we actually can start seeing God again as a loving father,
[00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:24.480]   instead of as that evil landowner who's just harsh to us
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:26.400]   and who messes with our lives, you know,
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:29.060]   and where we're upset and we're angry and we're sour.
[00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:31.920]   And he wants to restore that.
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:35.400]   You know, he wants to restore our relationship with him.
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:38.680]   He wants to restore our joy.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:41.700]   He doesn't want us to live in this place
[00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:44.220]   of envy and complaining.
[00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:50.160]   And now one thing that's also amazing about Jesus,
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:54.440]   you know, his saving work is that he gives us forgiveness.
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:57.080]   'Cause actually when we're complaining,
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:01.520]   when we're saying, why are you giving them that and not me?
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:04.960]   You know, there's actually pride in our hearts.
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:06.860]   We actually need forgiveness for that.
[00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:09.680]   You know, and he forgives us
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.000]   and he gives us his mercy and his grace.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.140]   And he actually helps us overcome, you know,
[00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:18.660]   that so that we can be free,
[00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:21.620]   that we can receive his grace and his mercy and goodness
[00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:23.300]   and just walk in that.
[00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:26.340]   Now, I want to invite the worship team to come up.
[00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:34.140]   And my sense, you know, for today is, you know,
[00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:36.780]   as I shared, Jesus, he tells these parables
[00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:38.540]   to just highlight things in our hearts
[00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:42.520]   where he's inviting us to have a different perspective,
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:45.120]   where he wants to also bring healing, you know,
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:48.780]   the parts of our thinking, parts of our acting
[00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:50.400]   that are not aligned with him.
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:57.180]   And he's inviting us today, he's inviting you today,
[00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:04.420]   you know, to respond to him, to come to him.
[00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:09.420]   Maybe it's asking Jesus, I'm not seeing your goodness.
[00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:12.180]   I'm not seeing your, you know,
[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:14.100]   what I should be grateful for.
[00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:16.240]   Can you help me see it?
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:20.420]   Maybe that's what you bring to him.
[00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:22.460]   And I believe that he will help you see it, you know,
[00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:23.980]   as you ask him for that,
[00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:27.020]   that he will show you, you know, his goodness.
[00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:28.220]   Maybe not right in the moment,
[00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:30.040]   but he will highlight that to you.
[00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:33.780]   Maybe it's, maybe God wants to restore
[00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:36.020]   your relationship with him.
[00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:37.780]   Maybe you've been sour, you've been bitter,
[00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:39.860]   you've been angry at God.
[00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:42.300]   Like, how dare God do this to me?
[00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:43.460]   You know, why does he give,
[00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:45.580]   it's generous to them, but not to me?
[00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:50.560]   And so maybe God is calling some of you,
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:54.020]   you know, just to find healing in that relationship.
[00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:57.620]   To not see God as this angry, unfair,
[00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:00.820]   unjust taskmaster in your life,
[00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:04.180]   but as your heavenly father who loves you,
[00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:07.340]   you know, who cares for you,
[00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:12.920]   who just pours his mercy and his goodness out over you.
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:17.140]   And so what I wanna do right now,
[00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:18.460]   I just wanna invite you actually
[00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:21.620]   to just talk to God right now,
[00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:22.620]   and just to talk to him about
[00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:24.460]   what he's been speaking to you about.
[00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:29.020]   And then in a little bit, I'll lead us into what's next.
[00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:30.420]   So let's do that right now.
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:33.860]   (gentle music)
[00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:37.280]   (gentle music continues)
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:40.700]   (gentle music continues)
[00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:44.120]   (gentle music continues)
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:47.540]   (gentle music continues)
[00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:50.960]   (gentle music continues)
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:54.380]   (gentle music continues)
[00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:57.800]   (gentle music continues)
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:01.220]   (gentle music continues)
[00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:04.640]   (gentle music continues)
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:16.040]   (gentle music continues)
[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:29.460]   (gentle music continues)
[00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:32.880]   (gentle music continues)
[00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:37.320]   Thank you, Jesus.
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:40.220]   Thank you, Jesus.
[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:46.340]   Wanna encourage you right now to transition
[00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:49.300]   to telling Jesus what you're thankful for.
[00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:54.120]   Just name the things that you're grateful for in your life.
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:57.220]   Things that you know he's done for you,
[00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:58.660]   he has provided for you.
[00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:00.860]   Just tell him right now.
[00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:05.220]   Jesus, I thank you for everything.
[00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:12.080]   Thank you, Jesus.
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:15.660]   Thank you, Jesus.
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:18.380]   I wanna invite everyone to stand.
[00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:22.700]   I would love to just pray over you
[00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:28.900]   as a posture of just desiring to receive from God.
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:30.660]   You can stretch out your hand to express that
[00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:31.620]   if you would like.
[00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:34.320]   And let me just pray over you.
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:40.740]   Jesus, thank you
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:45.840]   that you love us,
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:48.900]   that you don't withhold anything good from us,
[00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:50.380]   that you died for us
[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:55.620]   so that we can become workers in you every day,
[00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:57.640]   we can be part of your family.
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:02.060]   Thank you that your grace doesn't stop there,
[00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:03.840]   but it is your mercies and your grace
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:05.540]   that is new every morning.
[00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:11.060]   You show us your goodness every single day.
[00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:15.700]   Lord, but we, a lot of times, we struggle to see it.
[00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:16.820]   So I pray for those right now
[00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:19.380]   who are struggling to see your goodness.
[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:22.860]   I pray that you would reveal it to them,
[00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:26.540]   that you'd show it to them, your goodness, your love,
[00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:29.780]   that just like my friend came alongside me, Lord,
[00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:33.140]   that Holy Spirit, you would come alongside them,
[00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:35.820]   just highlight the goodness in their lives,
[00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:39.780]   where you are good, that you would show us that,
[00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:41.140]   that you would reveal that.
[00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:47.420]   And I pray that you lead us out of this comparison thinking.
[00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:51.260]   Where we're just stuck, maybe we don't know what to do.
[00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:52.500]   And we don't ourselves like it,
[00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:54.660]   but we don't know what else to do.
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:57.460]   I pray for freedom in your name, Jesus.
[00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:00.940]   I pray that you release us from this comparisons envy
[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:05.260]   and that you replace it with joy and gratitude in you,
[00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:07.660]   that you lift our spirits,
[00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:12.660]   that you allow us to joyfully just worship and to serve you.
[00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:16.820]   Strengthen your people, Lord, strengthen us,
[00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:19.820]   move in our hearts, move in our minds,
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:22.380]   help us align ourselves with you.
[00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:27.100]   Be people who rejoice when you are generous to others.
[00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:28.700]   Help us not to be bitter.
[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:31.440]   Thank you, Jesus.
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:34.340]   So I pray all that in your name, Jesus, amen.
[00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:36.440]   Let's worship church.
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:37.440]   [MUSIC]
