1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
 Thank you, church. Thank you, worship team. That was beautiful. Thank you, Hayden, for sharing your story.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:11,340
 Hey, as you sit down, you say hello to the person next to you, give them a little elbow bump, a fist bump, a handshake, hug, whatever.

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:18,260
 Let's just fill this room with welcomes and love this morning.

4
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:24,600
 Cool. Well, we also really want to welcome anyone who's new, who's here for the very first time.

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:33,420
 So if this is your first time joining us at the Vine for a worship service, you can just let us know who you are by raising a hand,

6
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,000
 if you'd be brave enough to do that. If you don't mind, that would be really awesome for us to see.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,480
 Anyone here for the first time? Upper house are here, too. All right.

8
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:47,880
 Welcome. Yay. Thank you for coming and joining us this morning.

9
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,080
 On the screen, you'll see a QR code.

10
00:00:50,080 --> 00:01:00,080
 We would encourage you to scan that QR code and you'll take you to a little page where it's just asked for some very basic information so we can stay in touch with you.

11
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:06,360
 That will let you know what we're doing as a community. But also, like I've been saying, our heart is to hear from you as well.

12
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:13,760
 So if you have a prayer request, if you have anything you would like to share with us, if you're new, if you want to join a community or anything like that,

13
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:21,640
 please do let us know. You can let us know through, like I said, the newcomer's card that you scanned.

14
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:27,240
 Or if you have some time right after the service, there's a team right outside this auditorium.

15
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,120
 Upper house, if you're new, you can just come right downstairs.

16
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:39,120
 There's a team of people that would be more than happy to chat with you, to welcome you, to tell you a little bit more about what we do as a community.

17
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:48,120
 My name is Ellison, by the way. Today I'm the pastor of announcements. And so a few announcements for us before we carry on.

18
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:54,240
 We have a prayer walk that's happening in support of our church plant in Yuen Long.

19
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,640
 Most of you might already know, but if you're not yet aware, we've chosen Yuen Long.

20
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:05,360
 We feel God's called us to Yuen Long as the next place to start our very first vine church plant.

21
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,040
 Of course, there's a lot of preparation, there's a lot of time, there's lots of things that need to happen in that process.

22
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:18,400
 And one of the most important things, of course, is prayer and covering the area of Yuen Long in prayer and seeking God's heart in that.

23
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:27,560
 So an opportunity to do that is coming up Friday, 22nd of July. We'll start at 7 p.m.

24
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:33,160
 And so once the sun goes down, it should be a little bit cooler, but it doesn't make that much of a difference, really.

25
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:42,840
 But anyway, so dress coolly, but 7 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. there'll be a group that meets in Yuen Long and that's going to do a prayer walk around the area.

26
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,680
 To get more details, you can just scan the QR code.

27
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,560
 And a perfect time to, you know, if that's on your heart, to pray for our church plant, to pray for Yuen Long.

28
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,160
 Also to meet some people from the community as well. And there's good food in Yuen Long here also.

29
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,800
 So, you know, 8.30, perfect Hong Kong dinner time. After your walk, you're nice and sweaty and hungry.

30
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,720
 Work up an appetite and go and eat together. So it should be a beautiful evening.

31
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:12,520
 If you want to join us for that, we highly encourage you to do so. Friday, 22nd of July.

32
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:18,520
 Throughout these past few weeks, also, we've been highlighting a very integral, very important part of our community.

33
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:23,400
 This is our branches of hope. Branches of hope. Yeah.

34
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,520
 Branches of hope. Branches of hope. I can't stop saying branches of hope.

35
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:31,720
 Okay. Branches of hope awareness month, BOHAM, has been on throughout this month.

36
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:38,160
 And they have a few more activities coming up for you to get to know the community a little bit, get to know what they do.

37
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,760
 Also to highlight some of the wonderful things that have been happening in them.

38
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,480
 So there is a branches of hope. Sunday was a few weeks ago on the 3rd of July.

39
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,640
 And if you haven't caught that broadcast, you can go back online to watch that.

40
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:57,280
 But there is an exhibition that they're putting on at a place. It's called Okra in Central.

41
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,200
 I don't get out much, so I don't know any of these places.

42
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,520
 But you might be familiar with it. Okay. It's a lovely restaurant in Central, so I'm told.

43
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,600
 And they have an exhibition of some of their work happening.

44
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,360
 And so if you want to check that out, again, details on the screen. QR code is right there.

45
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:18,640
 9th to the 22nd of July. Our branches of hope really do amazing work with our refugees and asylum seekers here in Hong Kong,

46
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:24,560
 empowering them to be the people that God's called them to be in a city where it's very difficult to do that sometimes.

47
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,960
 So I encourage you to check that out as well.

48
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:33,040
 So one more thing that needs your attention is our offering.

49
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,640
 So each and every week we take up our offering as a part of our worship service.

50
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,960
 There's many different ways to give. We give financially.

51
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,280
 And you'll see a bunch of codes online again on the screen that you can give online.

52
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,720
 But we also want people to give of their resources, of their time, of their energy.

53
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,160
 I'll tell you a little bit more about that in a moment.

54
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,160
 But this is very much a part of our worship service, a way we connect with God.

55
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:05,800
 And we're always very thankful for the finances or the resources that you so generously give to the church in order for us to continue to do what God has called us to do.

56
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:15,000
 So I'm going to pray for the offering before we move on. So let's pray with me, church.

57
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,600
 Jesus, thank you for your generosity to us.

58
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,440
 Lord, your heart is always for us and you're the giver of good and perfect gifts.

59
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:33,200
 And so as we come now to give back to you, whatever it is that we give, Father, as you've commanded us to, I pray that it would be given cheerfully.

60
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:43,280
 With a cheerful heart in faith, knowing that what we give is for the benefit, for the glory of your kingdom to reach people with your love and in your name.

61
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,840
 So, Lord, thank you for the generosity of this church, of this community.

62
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:52,200
 May you bless this offering for your name's sake. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.

63
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:58,400
 And if you have, there's an envelope also. If you want to drop the envelope, put your offering in the envelope, you can drop that off as you leave the auditorium.

64
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,520
 Not right now, a little bit later. Okay?

65
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,840
 Well, another thing that's coming up that really needs your attention is our Vacation Bible School, VBS.

66
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,920
 VBS is coming up in the first week of August. It's one of the most fun things we do all year.

67
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:22,160
 But before I tell you any more, here's a short video introducing this year's VBS and what we need you for in this first week of August.

68
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,080
 So pay attention to Vine News.

69
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,520
 Hey, everyone. This is Bernice. And Elvis.

70
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:36,240
 And coming to you from the K4C team, we have some exciting news about an upcoming adventure for both children and adults.

71
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:45,360
 From the 1st to the 5th of August, children aged 5 to 12 years old will get a brand new perspective when we go off-road for a monumental adventure in VBS.

72
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:54,640
 In this year's Vacation Bible School, or VBS, we will explore God's awesomeness in the form of rock-solid faith through a whole lot of fun-filled activities.

73
00:06:54,640 --> 00:07:03,080
 Each day, children will encounter God's Word through songs and Bible adventures, where they will experience amazing stories with all five senses.

74
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:09,960
 They will also hear different testimonies from children all around the world and discover how to live out their faith in cool ways.

75
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,240
 And even take away yummy treats from Oasis Days.

76
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:19,640
 This will be a great opportunity for them to make new friends and learn from one another as they grow closer to God.

77
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:24,360
 To make this happen, we will need monumental people like you to help us.

78
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,920
 If you love God and you love kids, come join us for a monumental week.

79
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,600
 You can scan the QR code here to sign up as a volunteer.

80
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,640
 Or you can scan the QR code here to sign up your children for VBS.

81
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:41,880
 For more information, you can contact us at children@thevine.org.hk.

82
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:48,880
 That's all from us, and we'll see you at Monumental VBS 2022!

83
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,720
 Yay! So yeah, that was a really fun video.

84
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,920
 First week of August, we really need more volunteers to help us out.

85
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:03,600
 Like I said, it's one of the most chaotic—there's like children running around everywhere, kids losing shoes and backpacks and all that kind of stuff, crying, snot, tears.

86
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:11,440
 But at the same time, it's also so much fun, and you get a chance to spend a week with these kids, showing them the love of Jesus.

87
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:17,760
 Now, we need more volunteers, and we need station leaders, we need crew members, and all that kind of stuff.

88
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:22,080
 I know some of you out there have not yet used up all your annual leave this year, okay?

89
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:28,640
 We haven't been able to travel very much, so you're sitting on a bunch of annual leave, you're thinking, "How should I use that up?"

90
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,720
 First week of August, perfect opportunity. You won't be rested at the end of it.

91
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:38,720
 You'll probably be more tired, but it will be well worth you taking some time off to spend with our kids and our community.

92
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:44,080
 So that's my challenge to you, to do that. If you would, that would be awesome.

93
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,520
 More information downstairs, or you can email children@divine.org.hk.

94
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:55,600
 All right, awesome. Well, we get the privilege now of welcoming Pastor Carla to the stage.

95
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,600
 So would you join me in giving her a hand? Hi, Carla.

96
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,800
 Thanks, Ellison. Wow, you really sold VBS. Snotty kids, losing shoes.

97
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,920
 That's just my hope, also. So anyway.

98
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:13,840
 But yes, Carla's here, and she's going to bring us God's Word, starting a brand new sermon series.

99
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:19,440
 So yeah, let's pray for her as we begin to hear from God through Carla today.

100
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:30,080
 So Jesus, we thank you for your Word. Thank you for Scripture and the way it's been preserved down all through the years to what we have today.

101
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,640
 The preciousness of your Word. Lord, we thank you for the teachers and preachers of this Word.

102
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:40,080
 And right now, we thank you for Carla, Lord, and the time and effort that she's taken to prepare this.

103
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,160
 Lord, the stories, the words that you've given her to speak out.

104
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,000
 So may she do that boldly, full of the Holy Spirit.

105
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 And may we open up our hearts and our ears to hear what she has to say, what you've given her to say.

106
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,800
 We pray for Carla, and we pray for our time right now. In Jesus' name, amen.

107
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,520
 Amen. Thanks, Ellison. Good to have you back.

108
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,520
 Good morning, everyone. It's good to see everyone on this beautiful day.

109
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,560
 And good morning watching online.

110
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,360
 Well, as Ellison said, we are about to begin a new sermon series.

111
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:23,200
 For the next six weeks, we will be looking at how we as Christians can live a steadfast faith

112
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:29,920
 in the midst of challenges and all the uncertainties that we are facing.

113
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,880
 And so to help us with that, we're going to be looking at the book of James.

114
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,680
 James is one of the most practical books in Scripture that we have.

115
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:45,440
 It was written specifically at a time when the early church were dealing with severe trials,

116
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,120
 with persecution, with division and societal pressure.

117
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,400
 So sounds familiar, right? So a great book to study together.

118
00:10:54,400 --> 00:11:00,320
 And over these few weeks, really our heart and our prayer as a leadership

119
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,240
 is that our teaching will bring that fresh revelation that grows our faith,

120
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:14,240
 inspires us to practically live out a truly committed and authentic Christian walk,

121
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,760
 whatever our circumstances. Does that sound good? Great.

122
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:26,960
 Well, as a pastor, I'm often present in situations where there is pain, there's grief,

123
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:36,160
 there's also some awkward moments. And so over the years, I have compiled a list of what not to say.

124
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:42,800
 Would you like to know my list? Take me out for a coffee and I'll tell you more on my list.

125
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:48,240
 But for the moment, often those phrases, they're not really helpful.

126
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:54,880
 They are the ones that we so easily turn to because we feel that we should say something,

127
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:00,800
 but we don't really know what to say. And sometimes they are those cliches,

128
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:08,560
 you know, the words that come to mind, probably because we might have verses stuck on our fridge,

129
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:14,240
 or we just don't really stop and think about what we are actually saying in the moment.

130
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:20,320
 And so out of context, sometimes those phrases can be unhelpful.

131
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:30,560
 For example, during funerals, I will sometimes hear, "Remember joy will come in the morning."

132
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,920
 "They are in a better place now."

133
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,440
 "Well, the Lord gives and the Lord takes away."

134
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,200
 Honestly, they do not bring comfort in the moment.

135
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:51,200
 In situations where someone has experienced a wrong or unfair treatment or abuse,

136
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:57,840
 reminding them in the midst of their very real pain that we are called to forgive

137
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:04,320
 is not really what they want to hear at that moment and can do more harm.

138
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,720
 Yes, of course, as Christians, we know we are called to forgive,

139
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:18,080
 but let's be wise in how we use our words and especially how we quote Scripture.

140
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:23,920
 Can I hear an amen? Online?

141
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:30,880
 The book of James opens with an all too familiar verse that frankly can be super annoying

142
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,120
 and is often used out of context. Are you ready?

143
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:44,960
 James 1.2, "Consider it pure joy, brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds."

144
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,160
 Joy? Really?

145
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:56,320
 The first practical advice on Christian living that James gives is to have joy in trials.

146
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,360
 Well, if I was writing to encourage the early church on staying strong in their faith,

147
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:10,400
 I'm not sure that the first advice I would give would be to tell everyone to have joy in their trials.

148
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:15,440
 But if we move past our initial emotional response to these words,

149
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,800
 if we understand the context, as we look at the why and the how,

150
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:26,000
 we can actually see these words not as insensitive or irrational,

151
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,320
 but rather empowering and life-giving.

152
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,920
 They teach us how we can live now.

153
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:39,760
 And my hope is that this message today is that if you are currently in a situation

154
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:46,720
 where you're facing a trial or a challenging circumstance, overwhelmed in crisis,

155
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,600
 we as a church are here for you.

156
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,760
 And my prayer is that as we come together through this time today, you will be encouraged.

157
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,800
 You'll understand a little bit more of how God meets us in our trials,

158
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:08,800
 and how we can grow in our faith, and ultimately how God delivers us in our trials.

159
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,520
 James, let's look at context first.

160
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,320
 James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ,

161
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,960
 to the 12 tribes scattered among the nations, greetings.

162
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,960
 It's widely believed among scholars that the author of the book of James

163
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,760
 was the half-brother of Jesus.

164
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:33,920
 And if that was true, then we know that James was not an early follower of Jesus.

165
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,800
 In fact, we learn from the gospel that Jesus' brothers and family

166
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,560
 often took offense at his teachings.

167
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,920
 And it's likely that James came to believe that Jesus was his Messiah

168
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:54,080
 after Jesus' resurrection, when he appeared to many over those 40 days.

169
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:59,200
 As a sibling to Jesus, can you imagine that, just for a moment?

170
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,840
 Imagine if your half-brother was Jesus, right?

171
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,880
 Yeah, anyway.

172
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,720
 And as a respected leader in the early church,

173
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,000
 you would think that James had earned himself the right

174
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,240
 to mention his heredity and his position.

175
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,440
 However, from the very beginning, James refers to himself

176
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,800
 simply as a servant belonging to God and Jesus Christ.

177
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,440
 And James is this beautiful example of a transformed life.

178
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,720
 With humility, he's writing to a Jewish community

179
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,440
 scattered in Judea, Samaria, and the Mediterranean.

180
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:49,840
 And scattered, most likely, because they were facing persecution in Jerusalem

181
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:54,160
 after the stoning of Stephen, because of Stephen's belief in Jesus.

182
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,360
 And you can read about that in Acts 8.

183
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,800
 James' readers would have been facing all kinds of trials and difficulties,

184
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,320
 having to leave their homes and their businesses,

185
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:11,520
 being considered outcasts within their own Jewish faith communities,

186
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,520
 facing persecution from their Jewish authorities,

187
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:22,800
 and also having the oppression of the Roman oppressors.

188
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,920
 So, given this context and background,

189
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:30,000
 it's not surprising that James is addressing the suffering

190
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,240
 and the trials of his people.

191
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,800
 But what is surprising is how he's addressing it,

192
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,360
 encouraging them to see their suffering as a joy,

193
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,640
 or as the message translation translates it, a gift.

194
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,760
 Consider it a sheer gift, friends,

195
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,200
 when tests and challenges come at you from all sides.

196
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,440
 A gift?

197
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,760
 What does James mean?

198
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,320
 And I think to understand what James means,

199
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,200
 we have to understand what he does not mean.

200
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:11,280
 So he's not suggesting that we embrace all of our happy emotions

201
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,840
 that we could possibly conjure up when we're facing a challenge.

202
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:21,280
 That false Christian bravado, "Yes, everything is great!"

203
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,880
 He's not ordering Christians to enjoy their trials,

204
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,480
 or even suggesting that joy is a trial.

205
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,840
 Can you imagine?

206
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,560
 "Hooray! I'm so grateful! I just lost my job!"

207
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:39,840
 "Oh, I'm so happy! I feel so blessed!

208
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,000
 "There is a pandemic in the world, and Hong Kong is in the fifth wave!

209
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,600
 "Yay! No!"

210
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,960
 Rather, James is commending the conscious embrace

211
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,080
 of a Christian understanding of life,

212
00:18:54,080 --> 00:19:00,480
 which brings joy into our trials because of our faith.

213
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,600
 James says, "Consider it joy.

214
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:10,000
 "It's a deliberate, careful decision to experience joy even in trouble."

215
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,840
 And we see this type of joy expressed many times

216
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,120
 by the believers in the early church.

217
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,520
 In Acts, Luke tells this story of when Peter and the apostles

218
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,360
 were arrested by the high priests for healing the sick

219
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,760
 and performing all sorts of miracles.

220
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,800
 So they're thrown in jail, and then God sends an angel to release them.

221
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,840
 And so what do they do?

222
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,160
 They go back out into the temple courts,

223
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,360
 and they continue to tell people about Jesus.

224
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,960
 Now, that really upset the Jewish leaders who wanted to then kill them.

225
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,560
 But they were persuaded instead of killing them,

226
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,520
 they would have them beaten and flogged.

227
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,880
 So Acts tells us that the apostles left the Sanhedrin rejoicing

228
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,160
 because they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace

229
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,480
 for the name of Jesus.

230
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,240
 It's their faith.

231
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,360
 It's their understanding of who God was

232
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:12,640
 and the hope that they had in Jesus who promised eternal life.

233
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:21,200
 It gave them a perspective that allowed them to embrace joy in their trials.

234
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,920
 You know, as humans, it is inevitable.

235
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:28,560
 We will all experience some form of pain and suffering.

236
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,640
 And when we choose to follow Jesus,

237
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,160
 we do not suddenly become immune to suffering.

238
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,040
 Trials are a part of life.

239
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,320
 And not just one or two.

240
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,480
 As James tells us, there are trials of many kinds.

241
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,200
 So as Christians, we should expect it,

242
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,600
 not be surprised when life gets tough.

243
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,800
 Perhaps for all of us, we have been surprised

244
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,880
 how the past three years have been in Hong Kong.

245
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,280
 And perhaps that has raised some serious questions for us

246
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,320
 about God, about his character, about his nature.

247
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,960
 And on one level, this is understandable.

248
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,200
 And it's okay to have those questions, to hold the doubts.

249
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,600
 You know, God is big enough.

250
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,000
 He can hold our questions and our disappointments and frustrations.

251
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,160
 And I encourage you all to go to God, wrestle those things with him.

252
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,800
 But that doesn't mean, as James is helping us to understand,

253
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:36,000
 that there is to consider another perspective.

254
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,920
 Being a Christian does not cushion us from hardship.

255
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:44,560
 And it does not entitle us to an easy life.

256
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:49,120
 Maybe some of us in this room can be very quick to blame God,

257
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,320
 his lack of protection, or his lack of love

258
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,760
 when things go wrong in your life.

259
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,600
 Maybe some of us are actually blaming God for the consequences

260
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,800
 of maybe what are our own poor choices and habits.

261
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:10,240
 And James here is reminding us to be careful with our heart,

262
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,560
 to be careful with our attitude, and in times of hardship,

263
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:19,520
 to hold a better perspective to the challenges we face in life.

264
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,360
 And we are challenged to have joy

265
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:27,200
 because there is spiritual value in our trials.

266
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,200
 So let's look at why.

267
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,840
 Why do we face trials?

268
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,080
 Well, James explains from verse 3.

269
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:41,360
 "Because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance.

270
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,080
 Let perseverance finish its work, so that you may be mature and complete,

271
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,280
 not lacking anything."

272
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,280
 We know gold is a precious and valuable metal,

273
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,680
 but it doesn't exist in its natural form as we know it.

274
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:02,240
 It contains many impurities that need to be removed.

275
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,480
 And this is done through the refining process.

276
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,920
 There's a number of different techniques,

277
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:11,200
 but one of the techniques is to heat up the gold to almost 1,000 degrees.

278
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,520
 Now, at the moment, what's the temperature?

279
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,080
 It's like 31, 32, and it's hot outside, right?

280
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,760
 Imagine 1,000.

281
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,720
 Anyway, the gold melts,

282
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,760
 and the impurities are then able to be separated.

283
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:34,640
 Scripture is full of strong imagery that shows God as our heavenly refiner.

284
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,200
 And so when James is talking about trials,

285
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:44,160
 he sees them as God refining our faith, developing perseverance.

286
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:50,640
 The Greek word for perseverance is an active, forceful word.

287
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,520
 It's about endurance, fortitude, steadfastness.

288
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,440
 For example, I love running,

289
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,640
 and a couple of years ago, I ran a half marathon.

290
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,800
 Now, I was used to running 10Ks,

291
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:07,200
 but I knew that I'd have to push myself in order to run further

292
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,080
 at the pace that I wanted to do.

293
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,600
 So in my training, at around 16K,

294
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,680
 my body is screaming at me to stop.

295
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:22,320
 I mean, my joints are aching, you know, I got a stitch, I'm in pain.

296
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,280
 And I just knew that I had to persevere

297
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:30,960
 because I had to build up the stamina that I needed to run longer

298
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:37,600
 to ultimately complete that 21K run in the time that I wanted to.

299
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,040
 So even though it was hard work and it was painful at times,

300
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,040
 it was worth it.

301
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,880
 And James is reminding his readers not to give up.

302
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,960
 Endure the trials with joy

303
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,160
 because the end result is a spiritual maturity,

304
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:58,560
 a spiritual stamina that brings growth and maturity.

305
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:02,400
 And we're not talking about a maturity of age.

306
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:08,240
 I'm talking about being refined to be more and more Christ-like.

307
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,280
 And I don't know about you, but when I became a Christian,

308
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,920
 when I chose to follow Jesus,

309
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:18,160
 I didn't want my life to be exactly the same as it was then.

310
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,400
 I want to be transformed.

311
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,760
 I want to grow in my faith, in who I am,

312
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,880
 to be transformed, to be in the likeness of Christ.

313
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:34,000
 Christian maturity is when we reorder our priorities

314
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,320
 from pleasing ourself to pleasing and obeying God,

315
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,440
 when we consciously choose life habits

316
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:47,440
 consistent with Jesus' teachings and our Christian values.

317
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,560
 And that causes us to become more Christ-like.

318
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,320
 James is emphasizing this

319
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,760
 because he understands how much steadfastness

320
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,680
 his people will need for the time that they were facing,

321
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:07,360
 but not just in that moment, in the seasons ahead.

322
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,800
 And this is for us.

323
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,240
 This is for us in our season right now.

324
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,240
 It has been tough.

325
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,720
 The reality is we don't know

326
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,320
 what Hong Kong will be like in a few years' time.

327
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,800
 We don't know what this world will be like in a few years' time.

328
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,280
 There's still so much uncertainty.

329
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,440
 How will our businesses fare?

330
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,880
 How are our children and our youth going to flourish in this city?

331
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:41,440
 Whilst we hold onto a faith that God is ultimately in control.

332
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,560
 The hardships we have faced up to this point

333
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:51,200
 is also working to strengthen us, to mature us as God's church,

334
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,520
 to be the church we are called to be at this time.

335
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,480
 And as we are strengthened,

336
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,920
 we will be able to be His hands and His feet

337
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:07,520
 no matter what we face in the future.

338
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,760
 And this is our heart as a leadership of the Vine.

339
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,560
 We want you to be refined now in whatever you are going through

340
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,520
 so that you personally and we as a church

341
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:24,480
 can be fit for purpose in the season ahead of us,

342
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,640
 no matter what it is.

343
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,200
 And the Apostle Paul, we know that he himself faced many trials

344
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,320
 and he echoes the words of James as he sits under house arrest

345
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,480
 awaiting trial in Rome.

346
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,800
 Paul says, "Not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings

347
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,680
 knowing that suffering produces endurance,

348
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:52,400
 endurance produces character, character produces hope,

349
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,720
 and hope does not put us to shame

350
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,760
 because God's love has been poured into our hearts

351
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:03,440
 through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us."

352
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:09,840
 Trials, they give us that greatest sensitivity to other people,

353
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,880
 an ability to understand,

354
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,800
 to provide practical help to those around us,

355
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:21,360
 causes us to talk more and depend more on God.

356
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:28,400
 They help us appreciate and find comfort in his presence.

357
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:32,000
 What about a time in your own life

358
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,520
 where through persevering through a difficult situation

359
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:42,080
 you grew in fortitude, in courage, in strength of character?

360
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,400
 How did God sustain you?

361
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:49,280
 How is God sustaining you now?

362
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:55,440
 When I first found out I was pregnant,

363
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,280
 Richard and I were ecstatic, this is my husband here,

364
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,520
 and we'd been married for 12 years then.

365
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,440
 We've actually been married for like 30 years.

366
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,800
 This is our 30th years of being married this year.

367
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,560
 Yay!

368
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:13,680
 So 12 years in, yeah, that deserves an applause for Richard.

369
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,280
 We'd been married for 12 years in

370
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,800
 and we felt it was the right thing to start a family.

371
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,520
 And so when I found out I was pregnant for the first time,

372
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,040
 we were just gushing with so much excitement and anticipation

373
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,880
 as we went through our first scan, you know,

374
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,680
 so excited about what we would see,

375
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:35,680
 only to be told that there was a problem.

376
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:41,040
 And so what then followed was a number of weeks of uncertainty

377
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:45,280
 and desperate prayers as we faced the real reality

378
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,160
 that I could miscarry.

379
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,280
 And of course, I'm going to pray.

380
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,280
 So I prayed fervently.

381
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:57,440
 You know, I quoted every conceivable scripture verse

382
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,720
 that I could think of just to remind God who he was

383
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,560
 and what he could do, just in case he needed reminding.

384
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,640
 And of course, you know, I confessed of all my bad things

385
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,080
 and, you know, repented of things

386
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,960
 that maybe I didn't even know about.

387
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,320
 I wanted to make sure that I covered everything,

388
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,720
 bargained, pleaded, praised, was thankful,

389
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,640
 you name it, I did it,

390
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,960
 convinced that God would save our baby.

391
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,280
 But sadly, we lost our baby.

392
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,360
 The second time I got pregnant,

393
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,880
 we were a little bit subdued in our excitement,

394
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,400
 at the same time convinced that this time

395
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,760
 everything would be okay.

396
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,760
 Sadly, we lost our second baby.

397
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,760
 The third time I got pregnant,

398
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:55,280
 I knew I'd built up a harder exterior around myself.

399
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:59,440
 I didn't really know how to pray, what to pray,

400
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,160
 even if I wanted to pray.

401
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:07,280
 All I knew was that God had shown us great comfort and love

402
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:12,320
 in many different ways in those past painful few years,

403
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,640
 even though I didn't understand why.

404
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,720
 But sadly, we lost our third baby.

405
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,320
 In my fourth pregnancy, I was exhausted,

406
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,000
 emotionally, physically, and spiritually.

407
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,160
 I had always thought that I loved God,

408
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,000
 that Jesus was everything to me,

409
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 and that I would happily surrender my life

410
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,720
 to follow him, whatever that meant.

411
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,920
 But the reality was, over the years of experiencing

412
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,640
 the emotional and the physical trauma

413
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:47,600
 of multiple miscarriages, my faith was challenged.

414
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,520
 And I remember sitting on my bed,

415
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:53,680
 pregnant for the fourth time, feeling really unwell,

416
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,680
 and tears pouring down my face

417
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:00,560
 as I found myself asking God some serious questions.

418
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:04,320
 Did I blame God for the babies I had lost?

419
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,520
 Did I still really love God?

420
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,640
 But in that moment, as I reflected

421
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,720
 on the past couple of years,

422
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,200
 I knew that God was not to blame.

423
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,080
 Richard and I had known his love.

424
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,120
 We had known his closeness, his presence

425
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,840
 in the midst of some very dark times.

426
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,520
 Yes, I absolutely loved him.

427
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,920
 And my love was not conditional.

428
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,080
 And even though it hadn't been easy,

429
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,200
 I could see how I had grown in my love

430
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,840
 and dependency on God.

431
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:42,800
 I would not stop, I could not stop loving him,

432
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:47,360
 even if we never had a child.

433
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,160
 The realization of how much I was loved,

434
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,240
 how much Jesus had suffered for me

435
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,320
 so that I could be free, and the hope that I had

436
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,800
 in life after death, where I would see my babies again,

437
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,440
 that stirred within me a joy,

438
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,480
 a joy that certainly did not make sense,

439
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,240
 was absolutely not rational.

440
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,720
 And a flood of peace came over me.

441
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,400
 And I knew then at that time, it would be okay.

442
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:20,800
 It would be okay even if I lost this fourth baby.

443
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,480
 I didn't miscarry, and Richard and I became parents

444
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,680
 to Bella and later to Benjamin.

445
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:32,080
 My story is of trusting God in suffering,

446
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:39,280
 allowing him to refine me in the process.

447
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:43,040
 How do we protect ourselves against our faith

448
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:47,840
 becoming stagnant or even losing our faith

449
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,080
 in the midst of our trials and suffering?

450
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,200
 Thankfully, the practical James tells us,

451
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,560
 the readers, and us, how.

452
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:05,520
 In verse one, chapter one, verse five,

453
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,240
 "If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God,

454
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,360
 "who gives generously to all without finding fault,

455
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,080
 "and it will be given to you."

456
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,080
 Sounds quite simple, right?

457
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:20,560
 We ask God to help us, and he will.

458
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,760
 James is showing us that to lack wisdom

459
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,000
 is to lack an understanding of how to live righteously

460
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,400
 in our challenging situations.

461
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:34,080
 That if we come to God, he will, without fail,

462
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,840
 without judgment, provide us with what we need

463
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:41,360
 to remain steadfast.

464
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:45,280
 The Greek word that James uses for wisdom is sophia.

465
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,880
 And within the Greco-Roman world,

466
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:50,320
 seeking wisdom was all about gaining knowledge,

467
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,560
 the accumulation of information.

468
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,080
 The more information you had,

469
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,680
 the more intellectual you were,

470
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,920
 the more important you were.

471
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,720
 Sounds a bit like Hong Kong at times, right?

472
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,800
 We feel that we need to prove our worth

473
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,800
 through our studies, the schools that we went to,

474
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,960
 the schools that our children go to,

475
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,320
 the letters after our name.

476
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:17,840
 But in contrast, James is writing to a Jewish community.

477
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,280
 They're a community of believers

478
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,120
 with a very different understanding

479
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,000
 and concept of wisdom.

480
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,480
 And the author, Ralph Martin, puts it this way.

481
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,320
 "For the Jewish mind, wisdom meant practical righteousness

482
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,880
 "in everyday living.

483
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,680
 "It is wisdom that surpasses earthly knowledge

484
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,120
 "and information.

485
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:43,040
 "It begins with a healthy reverence for God.

486
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,280
 "It is seeing the world in God's perspective."

487
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,800
 God shows us how to live.

488
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,800
 He shows us how to think, how to act, how to love.

489
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,440
 So our attitude as we go to God to help

490
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,480
 should be that He is the ultimate source

491
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,760
 of real direction and truth.

492
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:07,520
 It is an attitude of prayer, dependency, and humility.

493
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:12,560
 And there is no room for indecisiveness.

494
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,280
 James gives us a condition to meet

495
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,800
 in order to receive that wisdom in our trials.

496
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,240
 And that condition is faith.

497
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,480
 Chapter 1, verse 6 says,

498
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,960
 "But when you ask, you must believe and do not doubt,

499
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,040
 "because the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea blown

500
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,680
 "and tossed by the wind.

501
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,960
 "That person should not expect to receive anything

502
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,480
 "from the Lord.

503
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:47,840
 "Such a person is double-minded and unstable in all they do."

504
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:51,120
 This is critical for us today.

505
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,440
 If we're going to live out our faith

506
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,400
 with joy in the midst of hardship,

507
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,280
 we have to grasp this truth.

508
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,720
 The imagery is very clear.

509
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,720
 The words are strong and direct.

510
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:08,080
 We can't ask for help wanting our way and God's way

511
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,800
 or wanting to know what God says

512
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,720
 but reserving ourselves the right

513
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:17,920
 to decide whether we will obey or not.

514
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,200
 And for some of us, this is exactly what we do.

515
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,880
 Life is tough.

516
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,880
 You just got made redundant.

517
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,640
 You're thinking of leaving Hong Kong

518
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,640
 because you're worried you will not find work.

519
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,240
 But you love Hong Kong.

520
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,520
 Your family is here.

521
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,960
 Your friends are here.

522
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,480
 You attend the Vine.

523
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,200
 You've sought wise counsel.

524
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,480
 You've prayed about it a hundred times.

525
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,880
 You even have a job interview next week here in Hong Kong

526
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,880
 but you are super anxious.

527
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,240
 You're also angry that you've lost your job in the first place

528
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,720
 because you love that job.

529
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:03,040
 And you're beginning to wonder, "Is God really there?

530
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,200
 "Does he not understand that you need to work

531
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,640
 "to pay the rent, to pay the food?

532
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,920
 "Does God even care?"

533
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:17,120
 And all these thoughts tossing backwards and forwards

534
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:21,120
 and that affects your trust in God.

535
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:26,160
 So we need to come to God to believe that he will meet us,

536
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:31,760
 he will give us what we need to endure.

537
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:36,800
 And when we endure, well, what comes next?

538
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,880
 We've learned the what, the why, the how.

539
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,600
 What then?

540
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,760
 Well, James tells us,

541
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,840
 "Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial

542
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,920
 "because when he has stood the test,

543
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,320
 "he will receive the crown of life

544
00:38:54,320 --> 00:39:00,800
 "that God has promised to those who love him."

545
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,240
 Sounds familiar.

546
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,480
 It's the language that James is using

547
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,040
 that echoes Jesus and his teaching on the Beatitudes.

548
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,480
 Jesus said, "Blessed are those who are persecuted

549
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,080
 "because of righteousness,

550
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:18,800
 "for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."

551
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:24,080
 The Greek word used for crown was the word given

552
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:28,080
 to a wreath that was placed on the head of an athlete

553
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:33,520
 or a military honor, and it afforded great honor.

554
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,600
 I don't know about you,

555
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:40,000
 but I want to be known for my joy in the midst of hardship

556
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,840
 because I know that God will help me

557
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:45,040
 to get through the trials as I trust him.

558
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,560
 I know that I will grow in my faith because of my trials,

559
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,880
 and ultimately, I will receive a reward in heaven

560
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,000
 for my faithfulness.

561
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,680
 How about you?

562
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:04,800
 What does that look like for you?

563
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,560
 And as the band comes now,

564
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,800
 I wanted to create a bit of space in our response

565
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,680
 to this message as I was praying about

566
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:18,160
 what does it mean for us as Divine Church here

567
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,360
 and for those watching online?

568
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:25,280
 How can we personally respond to this?

569
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,240
 Where are we in the midst of our trials?

570
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,720
 Do we need a change in perspective?

571
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,480
 Are we being tossed back and forth

572
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,280
 through our indecisiveness?

573
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,360
 Do we truly trust that God is with us

574
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,960
 even in the midst of everything that is happening

575
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,960
 and that we are facing right now?

576
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,280
 And so there will be a couple of ways

577
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,600
 that we will create space for us to respond.

578
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,720
 Firstly, maybe this is a message

579
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,040
 that has spoken to you personally,

580
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,920
 and you feel that you really do need prayer.

581
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,720
 So have a change in perspective

582
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,240
 to be renewed in your courage and your hope

583
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,880
 and your trust once again.

584
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,120
 And in a moment, as the band comes on,

585
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:22,240
 we will be listening to the band play,

586
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,320
 and you'll encourage us to stand.

587
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,760
 We'll open up our hands.

588
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,960
 And if you're watching online,

589
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,760
 there is also an opportunity for you to respond as well.

590
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,120
 And as you open up your hand,

591
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,200
 you are saying that you would like somebody

592
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,360
 to pray for you.

593
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:40,400
 And as we have been doing so many times here

594
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,240
 as a community of faith,

595
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,800
 if you see somebody with their hands open,

596
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,440
 then I encourage you to go to them

597
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,680
 and ask if you could pray with them.

598
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,760
 There's a second response as well

599
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,440
 for maybe for some of us here.

600
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,960
 And I sense strongly that for many of us,

601
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,200
 we really struggle with this

602
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,480
 being tossed backwards and forwards.

603
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,040
 And you know in your head that God is with you,

604
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:14,720
 but, and there's a massive but.

605
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,880
 And what I want you to do,

606
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,120
 if you feel that you need once again

607
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,400
 to take that step of courage to say,

608
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,720
 "Okay, I am gonna trust God.

609
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,400
 I'm gonna ask for his help.

610
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,680
 And then I'm gonna trust that he's gonna help me."

611
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,680
 I want to invite you to come

612
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:37,280
 and just come to the cross.

613
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:43,440
 Write down that trial that you are facing.

614
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:48,480
 It's a relationship broken.

615
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,560
 It's job, it's security, unsure.

616
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,400
 It's health, it's finances.

617
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,600
 It's being misunderstood, it's being judged.

618
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:03,440
 It's feeling like you don't fit in.

619
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,120
 You're questioning who you are, even your identity.

620
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,040
 It's a real trial that you're facing

621
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,160
 and you're suffering.

622
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:17,280
 I want you to write it down.

623
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,840
 I want you to take it in a symbolic act

624
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:27,600
 where you are saying, "I trust God with this."

625
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:35,920
 And then I want you to put it at the cross.

626
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,920
 Symbolic reminder that our God is with us.

627
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,920
 He trusts, we trust him to be with us

628
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,800
 in all of our challenges, in all of our trials.

629
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:57,520
 Would you stand with me?

630
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:02,400
 So the band will play for a period of time.

631
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,960
 This is a time for you to either put out your hands

632
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,960
 and if you see somebody with their hands open,

633
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,920
 then I encourage you go and pray with them.

634
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,000
 This is what we do, church.

635
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,680
 This is what we do as a community of faith.

636
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,840
 And I encourage you if you're struggling

637
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,760
 and you know it, because right now you're thinking,

638
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,520
 "I don't want to do this."

639
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,600
 But I encourage you to come forward

640
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:27,040
 and take that act of faith.

641
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,240
 Write that trial on that piece of paper

642
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,880
 and leave it at the cross.

643
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,640
 And as you go back to your seat,

644
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:39,120
 you know symbolically you've chosen to once again

645
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:45,520
 trust God with the trial and the challenge you are facing.

646
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:51,440
 Let's do that now, church.
