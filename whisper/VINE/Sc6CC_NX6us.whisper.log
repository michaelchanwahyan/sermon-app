[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   My name is Andrew. Welcome to everybody in this room.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   We're packed. I know people are standing.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   We do have a few seats available at the front here.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   So if you do need to come in, I know people are standing up at the back.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   We are at capacity. It's so great to have you guys with us.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   Welcome to everybody online as well. We are so grateful that you are standing with us.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   Wherever you are around Hong Kong and around the world in this moment,
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   you're with us too. This is church together, both in this room and what you guys are doing,
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   wherever it is that you are.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   I pray that that worship experience for you is as deep as it was for us here.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   I don't even know where to begin. I'm so...
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   I'm in a green pasture. Can you notice our green pastures?
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   I'm wearing my green pasture shirt today. Is that alright?
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   You like that? You like that?
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   So about a year ago, almost to this very day, for the first time in my life,
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   I heard what I could only describe to you as the audible voice of God.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   I was walking through the transit terminal of Doha International Airport.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   I don't know if you've ever been to Doha International Airport.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   It's one of the biggest airports in the world.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   The transit lounge and the transit hall there is massive.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   And there are thousands of people that congregate into that place every day
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   that are passing through Doha on their way to anywhere in the world that you could imagine.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   And I was there with an 11-hour layover.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   The Vine had booked my flight to Jordan the cheapest way possible, in the name of Jesus.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   I had an 11-hour layover in Jordan. Praise God.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   And as I'm at the beginning of my 11-hour layover,
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   I'm walking through one of the busiest parts of Doha International Airport.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   And as I'm walking down this corridor where thousands of other people are,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   a Middle Eastern man walks right past me, almost brushes my shoulder.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   We were pretty hemmed in. And almost brushes my shoulder and walks past me.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   And as he does, I hear the audible voice of God, "Follow him.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Follow him."
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   It's hard to describe it to you, but it sounded like Morgan Freeman.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   No, it didn't. It didn't sound like that.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   I don't know really how it sounded, but it was the first time in my life
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   where I almost like, I was like, something like spoke to me,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   or it was like this audible voice. And because it was so real,
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   I immediately found myself following after the guy.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   And I literally like turned around and started following after him.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Not really knowing why I was following after him,
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   but I knew that I had been commanded to change my direction and follow him.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   So I started walking about 10 feet behind him.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   And after about like maybe 20 yards or so, I was like feeling really weird about it.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Like, what am I doing following this guy? Like, who is he?
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   I have no idea who he is. I have no idea why God wants me to follow him,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   but I'm following him. And then I'm thinking like,
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   does he know that I'm following him? Because that would be weird.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Right? Like this is the Middle East. Maybe I'm about to get arrested.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Like what happens when you follow random people?
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   So I'm like following him and he kind of walks through this part of the airport
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   and then he goes into the side. Now at the side of the transit hall in Doha,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   they have all these rooms and these rooms have like little lounge chairs in them
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   where people can go and sleep for a few hours.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   And he walks into one of these rooms.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   There's probably about 30 or 40 of the chairs in the room
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   and he sits down on this chair. And I find myself walking into the room
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   and then very nonchalantly sort of, you're going to be him,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   sort of sitting down right next to him like this, you know,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   like kind of going like, why am I here? Right?
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   As I sit down, he leans forward and he starts to just weep.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   He starts to sob his eyes out.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Now I've spent enough time in the Middle East to understand the culture there
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   and that's unusual in that Middle Eastern culture.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   To be honest, it's unusual in the majority of cultures.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   But particularly in that culture where men, a public display of emotion like that
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   is not necessarily looked upon as a good thing.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   But he just leans forward, head in his hand, just weeping
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   and immediately pasta mode of Andrew takes over, right?
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   And I've been in this scenario a number of times.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   This was a bit of a weird one, I admit, like following this guy.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   But I've been in this scenario a number of times.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   So I just kind of like, again, you're him and I'm me, right?
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   So you're sobbing. Go on, sob. No, no, sit, sit, sit.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Head in hand, cry, cry. Yeah, okay, good.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   So I'm there.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   You're never going to sit in the front row ever again, never.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Neither is anybody else. All right.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   So you're crying.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   So I lean forward and I go like this.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   I'm like, "Hey, I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do to help?"
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Thank you.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   So he turns to me and he points at his mouth like this,
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   basically saying, "I don't speak English."
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   So I kind of like smile and I point to my mouth,
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   basically saying, "I don't really speak English."
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   No, like, "I don't speak Arabic," is what I was trying to say to him.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   "I don't really speak Arabic." And he kind of nodded.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   And he looked kind of embarrassed, as you can imagine, right?
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   But I was like, "I can't communicate to this man,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   but I can be present with him."
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   So I kind of just sat there and I leaned towards him again
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   and I kind of put my hands like this in my lap,
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   like very pastoral, right?
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   And I kind of like just smiled at him,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   you know, like trying to communicate, "I'm here," right?
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Well, he kind of wipes his eyes,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   and I think he's feeling a little embarrassed,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   so he gets out his mobile phone and he flips through it
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   and he shows me what I assume was a picture of his family,
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   beautiful family, massive large family, beautiful family.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   And so I like got my phone out, you know,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   and scrolled and showed a picture of my dog.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   No, I showed my wife and daughter, don't worry.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   I showed a picture of my family as well,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   and he had this face, like it was classic.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   He had this face like, "Wow, that's your family?
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Like, you did well."
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   He was like, "You managed that? Good job," right?
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   So he was kind of looking at me like that,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   and I was like smiling, "Family," you know.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   And then he kind of like put his phone away,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   and then he stood up and he just walked away.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   And that was it.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   That was the whole interaction.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   I have no idea to this day who that man was.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   I have no idea what was going on in his life,
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   but I do know this.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   I do know that God loved that man so much,
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   that God cared for that man so much
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   that he would disrupt my just normal day,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   11-hour layover in Doha, trying to be just a tourist,
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   and change me into that pastor
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   who could then follow him in a moment
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   where his emotions were obviously just sort of built up inside of him,
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   and those emotions just suddenly come out,
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   and I can sit there with him,
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   and I realized what was taking place.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Even though I could not communicate to him,
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   here's what was happening.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   I was a non-anxious presence amid the chaos of this man's world.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   Just in that moment of time,
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   a non-anxious presence in his life.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   You need to know that God desires to take you
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   in and out of places of rest
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   so that you would then become a place of rest for others.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   That's what this series is all about.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   It's what actually Psalm 23 is all about.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   As I said last week, it's not just a psalm
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   to make us feel good about ourselves,
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   to chill out with God,
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   a psalm for us to feel like we can relax.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   The psalm is actually to create in us a place of rest,
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   a place of life, a place of restoration with God
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   so that we can then be that to others in this world
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   who are freaked out, who can't handle it,
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   and we are there with them in the midst of their chaos,
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   communicating something of the peace,
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   the shalom, the restoration that God has given us.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   And God's heart for you is to lead you
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   in and out of those places of rest
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   so you would be the embodied rest of God for others.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   Are you with me, church?
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   It's this idea of God leading his people into rest
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   that David shifts to after his opening verse.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   His opening verse of Psalm 23, "The Lord is my shepherd.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   I shall not be in want."
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   And then he immediately starts talking about leadership,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   about how a shepherd leads his people.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Let me read this to you in verses two and three.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   "He makes me lie down in green pastures.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   He leads me beside quiet waters.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   He restores my soul.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   He guides me in paths of righteousness
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   or right paths for his name's sake."
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   Just a short couple of verses, but this is David at his best.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   This is David writing a psalm.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Remember, psalms were poems.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   He's writing a poem like a song.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   And in his writing, he's trying to express
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   some beautiful imagery to help us to understand
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   the rest and the peace that God provides,
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   not only for ourselves, but for all of his creation.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   And he's also trying to teach some deep theological truths
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   through this poetic imagery.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   Now, if you are to read this in the Hebrew,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   you actually get a much better sense of the poetic form
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   and structure that David's trying to create.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   In fact, his whole argument in these two verses
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   is based around a specific poetic structure.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   In the Hebrew, he basically goes, "Here's an action of God.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   Here's a place that God takes us to, and here's the result."
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Let me actually show you this structure here.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   This is the structure of Psalm 23, verses two and three.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   Here's a few things I want you to see.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   First of all, I want you to see the right-hand column,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   the result.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   This is what God is doing in you.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   This is what David is trying to communicate to his people
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   as he writes this, that God's desire is to bring you
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   into a place of rest, a place of peace,
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   the shalom of God in you, that would bring restoration,
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   change and transform you so that you're not like you were before,
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   but you're now a new person, a new human being
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   with a level of deep rest and peace that you've never had before.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   Why? So that God has glory on the earth,
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   so that God gets glory.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   He doesn't want you just to be at rest so that you can enjoy yourself.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   This is not about being on Bali with a pina colada.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   This is about you becoming the person Christ wants you to be
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   in the craziness of the world around you.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   This is you being a restful presence for God's glory.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   David's saying that's what God wants.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   That's what he's constantly trying to bring into our lives.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   How does he do it?
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   First of all, he has to bring us into certain experiences
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   that will create in us the result of the rest and peace.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   Are you following this?
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   So there are places that he takes us to.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   Now, David metaphorically, poetically describes these places
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   as green pastures, quiet waters, right paths.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   And what he's saying is if you do not go through these places,
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   you will not experience the rest that God wants you to have.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Are you following the argument?
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   So in order to go into those places, he then says at the start,
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   there is an action.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   There's something God does to bring us into those places
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   to create the rest.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   He makes us, leads us, and guides us to certain experiences
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   so those experiences transform us and create the result,
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   the fruit of rest and peace that is seen publicly
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   so God gets the glory.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Are you following this?
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   This is David's heart for this part of the psalm.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   If I was to say it simply, this is what David's saying.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   If you truly want to experience and know his rest,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   then you need to allow yourself to experience the one thing
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   that God desires to do the most in you, and that is lead you.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   Lead you.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   If you truly want to know rest, you have to be willing to allow God
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   to lead you, lead you into places that will do its work in you
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   to create that rest.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   And this is a challenge because David's saying,
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   "There's a prerogative here, and the prerogative is God's leadership
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   of your life."
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   You remember last week when we looked at the opening of the psalm
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   where we said, "The Lord is my shepherd.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   I shall not be in want," and we said we can flip that around
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   and say it in reverse.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   In other words, we can say, "I have wants.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   Therefore, the Lord is not quite my shepherd."
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   Well, in the same way, you can flip this around as well.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   And really what David's saying is this.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   If you do not feel rest, if there is some anxiety in you,
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   if you're not in a place of rest, then there's elements in your life
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   that are not submitted to the leadership of God.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   Are you following me?
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   Now, this is what he's trying to lay out to us,
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   and this is a great challenge because if you're anything like me,
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   we struggle at times to really allow God to lead us.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   Maybe it's just me here, but I think many of us struggle to know
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   what it is to really be led by God, and there are maybe some areas
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   of our lives that we think are being led by God,
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   and there are other areas of our lives that we know we are not
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   definitely being led by God, and then there are some areas
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   of our lives where we do not want God to lead us.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   And we're always in this structure of, I think, struggling to really,
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   truly give ourselves over to be led by God.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   I want to offer today some reasons why I think that's the case.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   I want to say this.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   I think part of the reason why you struggle to allow God
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   to fully lead your life is because you actually have a faulty perception
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   of what it means for God to lead your life.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   Let me unpack that by saying this.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   I think for many of us, the model that we work of when we think about God
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   leading our lives is kind of like the woman that is in Google Maps.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   We think God is like that woman with the really nice English accent
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   or the really nice American accent, and we put in a destination
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   into Google Maps, and the woman shows up and says, "Turn left,"
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   gives us a suggestion, and we think, "Oh, well, if we go there,
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   then we're going to go in this right direction where we want to go."
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   And we've kind of made God the GPS of our lives.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   We kind of think God's role in our lives is to come along
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   and offer some suggestions for us in order that we might go
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   on the right kind of path.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   So we think that God is involved in our lives, and He's like,
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   "Oh, turn left here. Oh, no, you didn't turn left. You turned right.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   Don't worry. That's okay. Re-rooting.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   We're going to get you back on the right path.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   Don't worry. It's perfectly fine.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   Oh, no, you went left again. It's all right. Don't worry.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   Going to turn you right here. No, you didn't go right again."
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   And we think God's role in our lives to be led by Him is like
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   we can just kind of expect He's going to be--
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   Let me put it as bluntly as I can.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   You need to stop thinking that God is the GPS of your life.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   You need to stop thinking that. That's not the way God leads us.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   God doesn't lead us that way.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   When you use a GPS, you put in your destination, you push start,
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   you hope that a nice straight path comes, and if you get off that path,
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   you'll just be nudged back onto the right path.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   God is not interested in you coming up with what you think
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   are the right destinations in life.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   He's not interested in you typing in what you think is the right place to go.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   He doesn't even think that you know where the green pastures are for your life.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   He knows.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   And so He's not there just to kind of help you get where you want to go in your life.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   No, you don't have a GPS. You have a shepherd.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   It's a very different way of leading.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   It's not a nudging. It's a direct leading.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   And the Bible's very clear to us.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   When we think about God like a GPS, when we think we actually know the right way to go,
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   essentially we haven't let God lead in our lives.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   We're still leading our lives, and we're asking God to coach us along the way.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   I won't ask you to put your hand up if that's how you think about your relationship with God,
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   because I know I do sometimes like that.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   The Bible's very clear.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   We actually don't know the way.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   I'm just going to burst some bubbles here.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   You don't know the way.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   You don't know the best way for your life.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   And sure, God's given you a brain, He's given you gifts, and He's given you talents,
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   He's given you the ability to discern.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   We partner with God in many ways.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   But ultimately, you don't know where the green pastures are
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   that He wants to lead you to, so that you would know the rest in order to be able to give Him glory.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   That's His job.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   In fact, Proverbs is very blunt with this.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   Let me go to Proverbs chapter 14.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   I just want to read one proverb here.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   It says this.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   It says, "There is a way that seems right to Andrew, but in the end it leads to death.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   Or submit your name.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   There is a way that seems right to us,
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   but actually ultimately it just leads us to a place of hurt, a place of pain, a place of death.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   One of an ex-shepherd, he was a shepherd for many years,
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   and then he wrote a book about shepherding in Psalm 23.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   Amazing book. His name is Philip Keller.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   He wrote about this in this way.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   Let me read this to you.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   "There is something almost terrifying about the destructive self-determination of a human being.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   It is inextricably interlocked with personal pride and self-assertion.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   We insist we know what is the best way for us,
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   even though disastrous results may be self-evident.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   We think we know the way to go,
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   but actually even though we know that that's not going to work out good,
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   we keep pressing into that because there's something quite painful and dark
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   about our own pride and our own belief about our self-sufficiency."
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   And he's saying this is not the way to go.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   You need to realize that God is not interested in making suggestions about the direction of your life.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   He wants to lead your life.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   This is why when David starts to write these two verses about leadership,
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   he starts like this. Let me read this to you.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   "He makes me lie down in green pastures."
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   I don't know about you, but that doesn't seem like the right kind of language
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   when we come to think about God's leadership in our lives, right?
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   I don't know about you, but I'm uncomfortable with being made to do anything.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   Like, do not make me do anything, right?
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   The last couple of years during COVID, it's like the whole world has been like,
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   "Do not tell me what to do," right?
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   "You cannot make me do anything. I will do what I want to do."
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   Okay, I'm in lockdown again. All right.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   But I'm going to rebel against it.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   We don't like, there's a human nature in us. We don't like to be made.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   And so when David starts and he says, "God makes me lie down,"
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   there's something in us that kind of rebels against that straight away.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   And we're kind of like, "What is God saying here?
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   I would rather this read, 'Oh, he suggests. Oh, he offers some ideas.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   Oh, he kind of goes, 'Maybe over here. Give it a go.'"
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   That's what we want to hear.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   David goes, "You know what God's like?
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   God's not just making suggestions. He's actually giving directions.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   God's not just trying to offer you some advice.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   He's actually telling you what to do.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   Follow Him."
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   There's something about the power of that that we need to grasp.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   See, here's the reality.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   Shepherds know that sheep never lie down in fields.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   Very rarely do they lie down.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   When was the last time you drove past a field of sheep and they were lying down?
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   Right? Sheep don't do that.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   They're up on their feet all the time. Why?
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   Because they're flighty animals. They're afraid all the time.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   And shepherds will tell you that sheep need actually four things to be right in their lives
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   in order for them to lie down. Four things.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   The first thing is they need to be well-fed.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   If they're hungry, they won't lie down.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   Number two, they need to be free from fear.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   So if there's any danger around them, they're not going to lie down.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   Number three, because they're social animals,
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   they need to make sure everything is right with the flock.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   If anybody's got any friction in the flock, they won't lie down.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   And fourthly, if there are any bugs or flies on them or around them, they will not lie down.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   These are very temperamental animals. Okay?
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   So when David says, "He makes me lie down in green pastures,"
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   what he's picturing here is an image of sheep already in green pastures.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   Already there, but they're refusing to lie down.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   They're in green pastures, but they're refusing to lie down
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   because maybe one of those four things is not right in their lives.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   Who of you in this room knows that you can be in one of the most relaxed places in the world?
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   You could be in a spa, but if you're having an argument with your spouse, you are not relaxed.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   Anyone else here? Again, just me. All right.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   I can't tell you the number of holidays I've had,
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   or I've been in some incredible beach resort, some of the most beautiful places,
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   and just because somebody cut in front of me in the line of the buffet at breakfast,
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   I cannot relax, right? Are you with me?
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   What is it? We can be in what we think is a green pasture,
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   but we are refusing to lie down because there's stress in us.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   There's stuff going on in us. We're still overwhelmed.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   We don't know how to handle life, and there's things taking place.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   And so we might actually be in a place that is designed to give us rest,
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   but we're not lying down.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   And so David says, "He makes me lie down because he knows what's best for me.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   He knows the places I need to be, and he knows that I need to receive in that place.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   But if I'm constantly flighty, if I'm constantly looking up and looking around,
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   if I'm not being willing to submit myself to the environment that I'm in,
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   to recognize that I'm actually in a green pasture,
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   I won't lie down, and God will come, and he makes me.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   Maybe not by forcing me, because we know that God gives us choices,
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   but by letting us know that if we don't lie down,
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   we're going to miss out on the very thing that's going to set us free.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   He brings us into places that are actually green pastures,
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   but we refuse to lie down.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   Some of you here today, you're actually in a green pasture,
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   but you are refusing to lie down.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   As I was preparing this, I felt strongly that for some of us in this room,
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   that's Hong Kong for you.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   Hong Kong is God's green pasture, and you're here right now,
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   and you're refusing to lie down.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   Because of all the things that have happened, I get it.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   Because of all the stuff that has gone on, because of all the things,
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   and you've had lots of friends leave, and you're not sure,
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   "Should I stay? Should I go?"
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   That constant fight or flight, that constant sense of being overwhelmed,
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   that constant sense of, "Is this really the city that I thought it was?"
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   And all that's still in your head, and yet you're living here,
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   you're here right now, God is working in this city,
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   he's actually placed you in Hong Kong,
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   it's a gift to you that Hong Kong could be the very green pasture,
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   but with all the flightiness in your mind right now,
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   you're refusing to actually be in the very place that's designed to give you rest.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   I mean, imagine that.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   Hong Kong could give you rest.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   Most of us need to flee out of Hong Kong to get rest.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   Imagine what it would be like to realize that actually,
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   I was designed to be here right now.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   And that actually, if I just allowed him to do what he wants to do,
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   even in the midst of me feeling the way I feel,
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   I could still know rest.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   Some of you, Hong Kong is the very green pasture you know,
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   but you are not receiving it.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   I want to challenge you to let go.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   How do we let go?
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   Well, notice what it says here.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   He says this, "He leads me beside quiet waters.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   He guides me in paths of righteousness."
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   The language of leadership here is a Hebrew word.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   It's the word "nahal."
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   And "nahal" literally means this,
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   "to walk out in front or to take the lead."
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   To walk out in front or to actually take the lead.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   Nahaling is the idea of how a shepherd leads his sheep.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   Shepherds do not get behind the sheep and try to push them forward,
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   drive them forward like you might want to drive cattle.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   If you try to do that with sheep, the sheep just go all over the place, right?
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   Likewise, a shepherd doesn't come up alongside of the sheep and go,
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   "Hey, do you feel like walking forward today?
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   Hey, can I help you? Please turn left. Don't turn right."
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   Here's how a shepherd leads his sheep.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   He actually stands in front of the sheep.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   He makes a call out to the sheep,
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   like we saw in the video last week with Abdallah making that call.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   And then he starts to walk forward,
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   and the sheep come and follow him.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   It's a very simple image.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   God leads and we follow.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   That's not GPS.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   That's not expecting God to give us some guidance in life.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   That's God actually being our guide.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   That's actually submitting ourselves to the reality that He knows more than us,
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   that He has a destination better than us,
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   that if He wants to bring rest and peace in our lives
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   so that we can be a non-anxious presence in the world,
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   then we need to be led by Him to places that He wants us to be in,
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   so that we can be in that place of rest.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   That's us saying, "Okay, you've got it. Not me. I'm following you."
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   That's us submitting ourselves to the leadership of God.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   It is not a suggestion. It is a direction.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   Are you with me? Come on, church. Wake up.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   This is not a suggestion.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   It's the way God leads.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   Throughout the whole of Scripture, God leads this way.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   One of the most important times that God needed to lead His people was the Exodus narrative,
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   when He's taking people out of Israel, out of Egypt, into the Promised Land,
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   out of a place that no longer was to feed them to a new green pasture.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   How does He lead them? Through the desert?
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   Scripture tells us, "A pillar of cloud at day and a pillar of fire at night."
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   And guess what happened?
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   When the pillar of cloud or fire moved,
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   Israel packed up their camp and moved with it.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   When it stopped moving, they put down their camp,
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   and they waited there until it moved again.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   It was a situation of Nahal.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   It would go before them, they would follow.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   It would stop, they would stop.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   It would go, they would go.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   If it stopped, they would stop.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   That's how they got for 40 years through the desert into their Promised Land,
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   because they learned to be obedient to the movement and the leadership of God in their lives.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   There is no scripture where the pillar of fire stops and comes down to Israel and says,
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   "How are you feeling today? Do you feel like going forward today?
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   Maybe I can make some suggestions for you."
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   It's, "I lead, you follow."
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   Jesus, He says to His disciples, "I'm the Good Shepherd.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   If you know my voice, you will follow me."
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   He goes up to Matthew, who's a tax collector for many years,
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   and he says, "Matthew, follow me." And Matthew doesn't go, "Meh, I'm not sure I really quite want to do that."
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   Matthew leaves everything and follows Him.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   He says to Peter, "I'll make you a fisher of men. Just come and follow me."
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   And Peter leaves his whole livelihood behind and follows Him.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   And we want a GPS when God just wants to lead, and He wants us to follow.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   He wants us to give our lives to Him so that He can take us to the very places that He longs to take us to.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   This is the beautiful image. God leads like this.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   He goes before us, He prepares a path for us, and then He calls us to follow Him.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   And He knows the places that He wants you to go to way better than you could know.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   And that's the beauty of following Him,
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   that we get the joy of discovering the places He wants to take us to.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   Some of you in this room and online, you're happy for God to give you guidance,
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   but you don't actually want God to be your guide.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   There's a difference between getting guidance and having someone who's actually your guide.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   And some of you need to actually turn back to Him today and go,
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   "I've been treating you as an advice agent. I've been treating you like my life coach."
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   Life coaches are not necessarily designed to tell you exactly what to do.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   They're just there to offer suggestions and advice to help you to be better.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   God's not your life coach. He's your shepherd, and He's leading you.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   And the question He's asking you is, "Are you going to follow Him? Are you following Me?"
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   Because if you follow Me, guess what I'm going to do?
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   I'm going to take you to places that will be unlike anything you've ever experienced.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   David describes these places, get this, as green pastures, quiet waters, and right paths.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   If you allow yourself to be led by God, He's not going to take you into places that are not safe.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   He's not going to take you into places that are there to harm you.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   He's taking you into places of what he describes as green pastures, quiet waters, right paths.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   And this is a wonderful thought.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   Some of us want the rest of God, but we don't want to be led to the places that will actually give us that rest.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   When David talks about green pastures, quiet waters, right paths here,
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   anybody who read this in Israel, who was in the desert,
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   remember he's writing this in the Judean wilderness,
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   they would know that there's no such thing as green pastures or quiet waters in that place.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   In fact, what is David talking about when he's saying God's going to lead us there like a shepherd?
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   Because in any desert that these shepherds had ever been in, there wasn't this flourishing thing.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   This is why we've done this here today,
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   because it's an ironic picture of what actually David is trying to do in the psalm.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   The green pastures and quiet waters are not in the Judean wilderness.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   They do not exist.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   And what David is doing is he's subverting that imagery.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   And he's saying, "You think green pastures look like this,
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   but actually the green pasture you're in right now looks like the Judean wilderness."
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   That in other words, God can take any circumstance, any situation, any place,
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   and he can turn what we might think as a desert into his flourishing green pasture.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   And sometimes we think we know what we need for rest.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   "Oh, if I just do this, then I'm going to be rested, and I'm going to be able to flourish in life."
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   And God's saying, "You need to recognize that the green pastures I bring you into
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   oftentimes don't look like the green pastures you think they're going to look like."
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   Some of you are in a really hard time right now.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   You're in a desert experience is how you would describe it.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   And God looks down and says, "That's my green pasture for you right now,
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   that you can actually find me in the midst of what it is that you're going through right now.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   That this bit, this place that I've actually led you into
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   is the very thing that's going to turn your life around.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   This moment and this experience, as hard as it is right now,
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   is going to teach you the things that you need to know
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   so that you can be a non-anxious presence before a tired and broken world.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   I've got you in a green pasture.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   Stop trying to fight the place that I've got you in
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   and recognize that your role is to lie down."
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   And then He says this.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   He says, "When you do that, you will have a restoration of your soul."
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   He says, "This restores your soul."
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   The word "restore soul" there in Hebrew means to be brought back.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   He's saying, "This will bring you back."
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   What does it bring you back to?
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   It brings you right back to the way you were created to be in the first place.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   It brings you right back to the person that God wants you to be.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   It's the Genesis 1 and 2 invitation.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   Adam and Eve, naked and unashamed.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   Adam and Eve in the quietness of the night, walking with the presence of God.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   Adam and Eve with nothing broken in them.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   Between their relationship with God, their relationship with themselves,
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   their relationship with others, their relationship with creation.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   Everything just as God intended it to be, created in a way that was to bring rest and shalom.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   The beautiful picture of Genesis 1 and 2.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   And what God's saying here through David, "I restore your soul."
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   Is He saying, "I will bring you back to that place of your fullness and rest."
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   That the imagery here is of a shepherd picking up a stray sheep that's wandered from the flock,
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   putting it on his shoulders and walking it back into the flock,
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   putting it back down so that sheep now can follow with the rest of the animals.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   This is the picture.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   All of us have wandered from the right path.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   And the beautiful thing is when we submit our lives to Christ again,
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   when we allow Him to truly lead us,
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   He picks us up, puts us on His shoulder, takes us back into that right path,
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   and He says, "Follow me. Follow me.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   And I'm going to bring you into the places that will flourish you.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   I will restore your soul, bring you back to the way that you were always created to be."
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   Some of you in this room, you're struggling so much
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   because you know right now you're not the way you should be.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   Hear the Word of God to you today.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   If He's your shepherd and you allow yourself to be led by Him,
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   He will pick you up on His shoulders and He will bring you back.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   And this is all so that His namesake would be understood.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   His glory would be seen.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   Jesus said it this way.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   He said, "All you who are tired and weary and burdened,
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   just ask for My guidance and shepherding.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   Just ask for suggestion."
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   Now He said, "For all of you who are weary and burdened,
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   I will come to you and give you rest."
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   No, He didn't say that.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   He said, "If you're weary and burdened, come to Me and I will give you rest."
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   Hi! How are you?
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   You're coming to Me?
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   I'm not Jesus.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   But you know what?
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   That's a great example that we go to people.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   We go to Jesus.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   High five!
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   All right!
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   There you go.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   Allow yourself to go to Jesus.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   Follow Him.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   Be led by Him.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   And you will find Him bringing you back and restoring your soul.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   Would you stand with me?
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   I want to pray for you.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   And let's pray.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   Father, we are so grateful for you.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   So grateful for the way you lead us.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   And Father, we recognize that some of us in this room are in green pastures,
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   but have refused to lie down.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   Father, would you come right now for anyone online and in this room
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   who they recognize that that's their response today.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   Some of you are fighting Hong Kong in your heart.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   And yeah, Hong Kong may not be a perfect place.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   And we all know there are challenges here in this city.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   But I want you to know that you are here.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   That for all its ups and downs, God has planted you here.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   And He sees this place as your green pasture.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   Some of you need to commit again to lying down here in our city.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   And perhaps for some of you that will take some repentance today to say,
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   "God, I'm sorry that I've spoken so poorly of the very place that you've led me to.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   And I need to submit myself again to your leadership."
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   And if that means staying here, then I know that this will be the right place,
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   the green pasture for me to know true rest,
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   to be that non-anxious presence in a chaotic world for someone else
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   at a later date in some other time.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   Lord, would you show me what it is that you have for me here in this place?
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   Some of you, that's your prayer today.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   For others of you here, you know that you've been using God
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   to get you to the destination you want to go to.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   You've been using God as a GPS in your life.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   I pray that if that's you, you'll hear the Holy Spirit's gentle but firm voice to you today.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   Just say, "Let me lead you.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   I and only I know the destination that's best for you.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   I know where those quiet waters are.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   I know what that green pasture looks like for you so that you can receive that rest.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   Let go," God says to you today.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   "Let go of your ability to lead yourself.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   Let go of your self-reliance that ultimately will only lead to your exhaustion.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   And allow me to lead you again.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   I'm a good shepherd," Jesus says.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   "I will take you.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   I will pick you up and bring you back."
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   Some of you, that's a word for you as well.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   Perhaps you've strayed from your relationship with God.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   Maybe during COVID it was tough.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   Maybe being out of the church.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   Maybe it was difficult for you to maintain a spiritual vibrancy in your life.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   I totally understand that.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   It's been a difficult few years.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   I pray that you would hear the word, the voice of God saying to you today,
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   "I will restore your soul.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   I will bring you back to green pastures, quiet waters."
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   And they may not look like what you think they're going to look like.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   It's not for you to define the green pastures.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   I'm going to say that again.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   Some of you need to hear this.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   It's not for you to define what the green pastures are going to look like for you.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   That's the Lord's sovereignty over your life.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   He actually knows better than you do exactly the experiences you need to have
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   in order for you to find rest.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   Some of you need to let go of your vision of a green pasture.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   And I'll just allow God to lead you.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   Holy Spirit, we pray that you would do this in us and through us.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   That it would be for your namesake.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   Not for us, not for the vine, for yours.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   That your glory would be seen because we become a non-anxious presence
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   in the chaos of this world.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   Lead us, Lord.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   Lead us, Lord.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   Lead us, Lord.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   Lead us.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   May you hear the Holy Spirit say to you today, "Follow me."
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   [music]
