1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 I just also want to say that you're not able to plant a church unless your spouse is a supporter, so thank you, Chris.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 I love you.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Well, hey, I want to update you on the amazing and incredible things that God has been doing in Yuen Long.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 So for those of you who don't know, in 2022, during the pandemic, we announced that we're planting a church.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 And then in 2023, we, with a launch team of 35 people, we moved to Yuen Long and we started meeting in a preschool that was in the middle of nowhere.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 And then in October 1st, 2023, we had our public launch.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 And so since then, we've been running in an amazing, incredible new venue that you helped make possible.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 So also thank you at this point for your generosity.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 If you haven't had a chance to come see it, you're always welcome to stop by and visit.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 We would love to have you.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 And so, yeah, but I want to share with you through pictures what's been happening.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 So let me share with you the first photo.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 So here, what you see right there is the church and they're praying for the children.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 The children are part of our worship.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 We have a lot of families.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 We love our families.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 And so that has been incredible.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 And I want to give a little bit statistics.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Now, church planting, it's always about people and individual stories.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 But I think the statistics also say something.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 So this will be the only point where I share that.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 So we moved over 35 people at the beginning of 2023.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Our first service had 50 people attending.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Then when we shifted to our new venue, which was incredibly conveniently located,

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 from October till December 2023, we had 166 people between our Cantonese and English service attending.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 And then now in this year, we've been averaging 214 people, 49 children, you know, every Sunday.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 So it really is incredible what God has been doing.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 If anyone would have told me that at the beginning, I would have said right away, "Yes, that sounds good."

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 You know, if that's what God does.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 So, yeah, praise God.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Now, next, I want to share with you a photo of K4CA from our children's ministry.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 The children love coming to our church community.

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 And you see here June, who is part of our pastoral team, doing an incredible job and volunteers.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 And these are the three to five-year-olds there in their class.

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 And then next is a photo from Pastor Ivan.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 And you can see him and his father.

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 So can we go to the next photo, please?

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 You can see him and his father welcoming people and also weighing.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Now, since we have a Cantonese service, now father and son can attend the same service.

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 And so that's beautiful and amazing.

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Now, one thing that happens sometimes is when we don't have people greeting and welcoming,

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 people come up because they think we're a wine shop.

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 And we always love that foot traffic.

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 It's great.

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 It's always a good conversation.

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 So I think that has happened here before as well.

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 So it happens here as well.

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 So it's always good.

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Then one thing that we've been doing, so you can go to the next slide, please,

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 is we've been facilitating intentionally community and connection.

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 And so one way we do that is through Bring Your Own Lunch.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 You see that there.

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Once a month after a Sunday service, Cantonese and English service together, we have lunch together.

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 It's Bring Your Own Lunch because we don't have much money.

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 And so people have to self-finance, but it's a great and incredible time.

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 And then we also pray for one another.

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 And so this is just like you do here.

58
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 We have a lot of times, like ministry times, where we pray for one another.

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 And one thing that has been so amazing is just to see the people who God brings.

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 So we've had parents who want their children to have a Christian education,

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 and then their hearts are lit on fire for Jesus themselves.

62
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 So they come to know Jesus.

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 We've also have had people that have gone through difficult and painful things.

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 And we had a sermon series called Longing for Healing.

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 And as they were coming, God was just speaking to them and was doing a healing work in their lives.

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 And so they went from not being sure about what they think about Jesus to following Jesus.

67
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 And so that has been amazing.

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 Those are just two of many stories.

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 And then finally, one of the things that we've been emphasizing this year is we're still establishing the church plan process.

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 And so one thing that we want to establish is that we're a church that loves and serves the city of Hong Kong.

71
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 And so that takes actually a lot of facilitation for that to happen.

72
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 So we had Young Lives with us last Sunday.

73
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 So you can go to the next slide, please.

74
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 And you see cats speaking, Young Lives, if you're not familiar with them.

75
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 They work with teenage moms.

76
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 And so we're sharing about stories and how we can get involved.

77
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 And we're having playgroups with them in our settings.

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 We're excited about that. It's just one example of a way that we're seeking to love, to serve our city.

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 And so life is amazing most of the time.

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 God is amazing always.

81
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 And we're so incredibly blessed by what he has been doing.

82
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 I always feel like I have front row seats to what God has been doing in this time.

83
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 It's amazing.

84
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 Now what I would love to do, I would love to pray for us before I go into our message for today.

85
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 So let's pray.

86
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Jesus, thank you so much for bringing us here today together.

87
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 Thank you that you love every single person here.

88
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 And that you have brought us here today to hear from you through worship, through community, through your word, through your spirit.

89
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 And so we just want to surrender. We want to say, "Lord, speak to us."

90
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 We want to hear from you.

91
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 And we want to say yes to whatever it is that you are talking to us about.

92
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 I pray this in your name, Jesus. Amen.

93
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 Amen.

94
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 When I was in university, my senior year of university, I had quite an amazing senior year.

95
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 And it was a lot of spiritually quite rich experiences.

96
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 And one of them was I started this conversation with a childhood friend.

97
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Now he was not a Christian, but we were talking about faith.

98
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 And this was almost weekly.

99
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 And he asked a lot of challenging questions.

100
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 They were not easy conversations, but they were very enriching.

101
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 And it culminated with my friend coming to know Jesus, which was amazing.

102
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 And actually he's a pastor here in Hong Kong as well.

103
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 So I have my German buddy here.

104
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 And so for me, my senior year was something where I grew in faith.

105
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 And it was just incredible.

106
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 And then I graduated.

107
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 I started a job with Sherman Williams, a paint and coating manufacturer distributor.

108
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 One of the largest ones in the world.

109
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 And at first things were going well.

110
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 Then the company moved me from central California.

111
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 We had a lot of friends. I had a network.

112
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 I went one year to high school there.

113
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 They moved me to the California coast, to Monterey.

114
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 And Monterey, if you don't know California, it's along the coast.

115
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 It's a beautiful place.

116
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 But for me, it actually turned out to be a really challenging time in my life

117
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 where I made a lot of bad choices that I'm not very proud of.

118
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 You could also say I was living in habitual sin and just brokenness.

119
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 And so I went from this mountain peak experience my senior year in university

120
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 and this first year of working coming out of college,

121
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 I found myself in this bottom pit in the valley.

122
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 And I was not the person that I wanted to be.

123
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 I knew this was not the life I want to live, but I just was there.

124
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 I was stuck there.

125
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 It was also not the life that God called me to live.

126
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 And I wanted to change.

127
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 I wanted things to change, but I didn't really know how or what to do.

128
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 So what do you do when you find yourselves in those places,

129
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 when you're not living the way that you know God is calling you to live,

130
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 when you're not the person that you want to be, what do you do?

131
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Well, as you have been going through the series on Ephesians,

132
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 God's word is quite clear, that especially in the chapters 1 through 3,

133
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 it talks about how Jesus is saving, healing work in our lives.

134
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 You know, that we were dead in our sins, but that we have been made alive in Christ.

135
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 And then last week, Pastor Andrew, he talked about that God has shaped a community,

136
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 a church community, that it has become a maturing community,

137
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 where we can grow, where we can change, where our lives can be transformed,

138
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 where we can attain to the full measure of the wholeness of Christ Jesus.

139
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 That we can start reflecting his character.

140
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 That is amazing news, if you think about it.

141
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Like, we can really change, we don't have to stay the same.

142
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 Now, I think that some of us here, maybe we have family history of whatever,

143
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 broken relationship, addiction, and maybe we find ourselves stuck in that as well.

144
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 And perhaps we have bought into this lie that life cannot change,

145
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 this is just the way it is going to be.

146
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 And so what God's word says, and also the church community,

147
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 and the testimonies of people says, that you can change.

148
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 And so here at the Vine, we believe that Jesus has the power to transform and change your life.

149
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 And one thing I love, in Ephesians 2.10 it says this,

150
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 "For we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works,

151
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 which God prepared in advance for us."

152
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 So that means that when God looks at you, he sees all your potential.

153
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 He sees all that you can be that he created you for.

154
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 And his heart longs for that in your life to unfold.

155
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 He desires to see that unfold in you.

156
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 And so he can bring that about, this transformation and change.

157
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 So just really sense for the day that some of us,

158
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 maybe we've gotten comfortable where we are,

159
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 and today maybe the Holy Spirit is going to bring some conviction,

160
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 and just calling us to something better.

161
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 But for others of us, we've bought into the lie,

162
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 where we're like, "I don't know if I'll ever change, I tried, but nothing happened."

163
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 And I believe that Jesus wants to say, "I can bring true change in your life.

164
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 You do not have to continue in this way.

165
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 I can bring wholeness, where there's brokenness, where there's pain."

166
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 And so what I want to do with you today in this message,

167
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 I want to explore a question with you.

168
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 Because we all have a choice.

169
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 Do we remain in immaturity?

170
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 You know, as Christians, where we live ineffective lives,

171
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 actually last week, Pastor Andrew said something quite powerful.

172
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 He said this, he said, "If the enemy can't keep you from being a Christian,

173
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 then the next best thing for him to do is to keep you from being a mature and effective one."

174
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 And so what I want to look with you at today is,

175
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 how can we be a mature and effective Christian

176
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 and continue the conversation that Pastor Andrew started last week?

177
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 How can we say yes to the Holy Spirit's transformed work in our lives?

178
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 Now what does it look like?

179
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 How do we engage this change process,

180
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 where Jesus just wants to bring wholeness into your life, into our lives, into my life?

181
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Well, let me take you to Ephesians 4, starting with verse 17, it says this,

182
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 "So I tell you this and insist on it in the Lord,

183
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do in the futility of their thinking.

184
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God

185
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 because of ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts.

186
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality,

187
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, and they are full of greed.

188
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 That, however, is not the way of life you learned,

189
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 when you heard about Christ and were taught in Him in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus.

190
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 You were taught with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self,

191
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 which was being corrupted by deceitful desires,

192
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 to be made new in the attitude of your minds,

193
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness."

194
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Now, this all starts out with Paul saying, "So..."

195
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 So all of this builds on what Paul has said before, and this is really important,

196
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 because in the first three chapters of Ephesians,

197
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 Paul talks about the incredible saving work that Jesus has done.

198
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 He talks about all the blessings that flow from Jesus.

199
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 We're adopted, we're justified, we're made righteous,

200
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 we're brought together as one family of God,

201
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 and you create a new humanity, where people from all walks of life become a spiritual family.

202
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 And it's all these incredible things that Paul talks about,

203
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 because he wants the Ephesians to understand their identity as Christians.

204
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 They have a new identity, and they need to understand the love of Jesus,

205
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 before he moves into how to now live.

206
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 Because how we live is always a response to the love, and the work, and the grace, and the mercy of Jesus.

207
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 So that's always a starting point, so we have to keep that in mind as we go through the message today.

208
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 So Paul is now telling the Gentile Christians that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do.

209
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Now that's interesting. He's talking to Gentiles, he tells them you must no longer live as Gentiles do.

210
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 So what does he mean by that? Well, he doesn't want them to return to their old life, their old way of living,

211
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 their old patterns of brokenness, of sinfulness.

212
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 He wants them to make a clean cut, and to live in a new way,

213
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 because Jesus has done something new in them, they are a new creation,

214
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 they've been given a new identity, and he wants them to live out that new identity.

215
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 So verse 17 through 19, it describes basically their life before they knew Jesus.

216
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 And one of the main characteristics that Paul describes, and is asking them not to return to,

217
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 is the futility of their thinking.

218
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 Because he knows that futile thinking leads to futile living.

219
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 Like how we think about something actually impacts how we live it out.

220
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 And he doesn't want them to go back to their old ways of thinking.

221
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 Now the word futility, the Greek word "mateotis", means three things.

222
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 Futility, meaninglessness, and empty.

223
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 And Paul does not want Ephesian Christians to go back to empty, meaningless ways.

224
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 But if you think about the word futility, there's actually a lot of pain in that word.

225
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 Because if you're striving, if you're trying, but you never are satisfied,

226
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 you never arrive, man, that's tiring.

227
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 It's not a fun journey.

228
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 And so Paul is saying, why would you return to that?

229
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 To the striving, where you're never truly satisfied.

230
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 Maybe think, if I reach this achievement, then I'll be truly satisfied.

231
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 So we chase after it, and then we have it.

232
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 And there is some satisfaction in it.

233
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 But then soon we want the next achievement, because that one's not enough.

234
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 Or maybe we engage in a relationship, and we think that this relationship is going to satisfy us.

235
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 But then it doesn't fully satisfy us, and so then we go into the next relationship, and so on and on.

236
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 So it's this empty chasing.

237
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 And so Paul says, why would you return to that?

238
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 Why would you go back to that?

239
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 I've given you a new life.

240
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 I've given you a new identity.

241
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 So then in verse 19, Paul says that ultimately this life, when we live in futility,

242
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 and we go down that route, is a life where we're living in separation from God.

243
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 It's a life apart from God.

244
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 And again, why would you go back to that?

245
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 For me, when I was in Monterey, I went into an environment where I didn't know anyone.

246
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 So I went back to my old life, to my old patterns, my old ways of living.

247
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 And sometimes there is comfort in that, but it never truly satisfies.

248
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 And so I went back to these patterns of brokenness, of selfishness, of sinfulness.

249
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 And for some of you that might be that way as well.

250
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 That you've become a Christian, you've been given this new identity,

251
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 but for whatever reason you've been going back to your old way of living.

252
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 And you're also like, I was at that point, you're not who you want to be.

253
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 And you know you're also not who God is calling you to be, who has created you to be.

254
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Because you're a new creation. He has something good, something beautiful for you.

255
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 Now, let's continue verse 20 and 21.

256
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 So there it says, "That, however, is not the way of life you learned when you heard about Christ,

257
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 and were taught in him accordance with the truth that is in Jesus."

258
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 So Paul and other leaders, they were teaching the new Ephesian Christians.

259
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 They were teaching them what it means to follow Jesus.

260
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 They were not teaching them a bunch of rules to observe.

261
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 But it was centered around the person of Jesus.

262
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 Because our faith has to do with a personal relationship with Jesus.

263
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 And so they were teaching them how to live in a relationship with Jesus.

264
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 Instead of going back to like we're not in a relationship with Jesus.

265
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 Now this did involve the aspects that it talks about.

266
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 Truth that is in Jesus.

267
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 That does refer to his historical life, where he's fully human, fully divine.

268
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 But he did his miracles, his ministry, he died, he rose.

269
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 All those things we do need to learn about.

270
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 But ultimately, Paul was saying, "That's not what we taught you to go back to your old ways.

271
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 We taught you to live in that relationship with Jesus."

272
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 So that's what he's inviting them.

273
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 Start relating again. Start engaging in that relationship again.

274
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 I think that's perhaps something that God is saying to some of us today.

275
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 Start engaging again in that relationship with Jesus.

276
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 Don't go back to that old way, it doesn't make any sense.

277
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 So the essence of the Christian life is not a rigid set of rules.

278
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 But a vibrant, transformative relationship with Jesus.

279
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 So as we grow closer to him and seek to honor him in all we do,

280
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 we'll discover the true freedom and purpose found in walking with him.

281
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 So that's Paul, he's reminding them of their identity.

282
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 He's reminding them, "Hey, this is what you learned, this is what we taught you.

283
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 This way of life. Now live this way of life. Don't go back to the old way of life."

284
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 But then he turns to, "How do we put on the old self, the new self, and renew the attitude of our minds?"

285
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 So he turns to all of that. That's really what I want to focus on today.

286
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 Because I think that's really where this transformation, this change is found.

287
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 Where God's really telling us something. So let me read that, verse 22.

288
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 "You were taught with regard to your former way of life to put off your old self,

289
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 which was being corrupted by its deceitful desires,

290
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 to be made new in the attitude of your minds,

291
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 and to put on the new self created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness."

292
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 So Paul, in this, he's actually, I think, making a really important point.

293
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 Because he talks about putting off and putting on.

294
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 What it points to is that even though we become Christians,

295
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 there is still stuff in our lives that needs to be worked out.

296
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 There are still things that are not fully there yet.

297
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 There is still brokenness in our lives. There is still sin in our lives.

298
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 This is true for everyone. We're living in this already but not fully yet part.

299
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 So this is what Paul is talking about.

300
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 And the word, the theological word for that is sanctification.

301
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 So what I want to do is I want to talk about that,

302
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 but I want to put it in a broader theological frame or conversation.

303
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 The Bible talks about that we are saved, we were saved, we are saved,

304
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 we are being saved, and we will be saved.

305
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 So like past, present, future.

306
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 And so when it talks about we were saved, it's talking about justification.

307
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 When it talks about we are being saved, it talks about sanctification.

308
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 And when it talks about we will be saved, it talks about glorification.

309
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 Now let me unpack those a little bit.

310
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 So justification is what Ephesians chapter 1 through 3 covers a lot.

311
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 It's like Jesus died for your sins, you were dead in your sins,

312
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 you were made alive in Christ by grace through faith,

313
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 and you are declared, you're justified, you're declared righteous.

314
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 So there's like a legal metaphor that God has spoken this legal sentence over your life.

315
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 When God now looks at you, he sees the righteousness of Jesus

316
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 in place of your sinful self that he has forgiven you for.

317
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 So that's justification.

318
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 And let's move to glorification.

319
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 Glorification is when Jesus, when Christ has completed his saving,

320
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 his healing work in your life.

321
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 One day God's work with us will be completed,

322
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 will be completely whole, there will be no more pain, no more tears.

323
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 And so that's glorification.

324
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 But right now most of us we're living in a sanctification space

325
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 where we are more and more becoming who Jesus is calling us to be.

326
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 We're not fully yet who we know we're meant to be.

327
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 But God is not finished with us yet.

328
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 He's not finished with you yet.

329
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 And he's working things out.

330
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 And sanctification is really about being made holy.

331
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 It's about putting on the character of Christ,

332
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 that we reflect Christ's character more and more.

333
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 And all the spheres of our influence, you know, on all parts of our lives.

334
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 That when people look at you, they can see a bit more and more Jesus in you.

335
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 Because you can see your love, your grace, how you treat people.

336
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 So that's what sanctification is about.

337
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 And that's what this passage is really talking about.

338
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 So let's unpack that a little bit.

339
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 So first in verse 22 it talks about,

340
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 "You were taught with regard to your former way of life to put off your old self."

341
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 Now putting off the old self can also be translated, "put off the old humanity."

342
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 Like we're, you know, we were saying earlier, "death to death."

343
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 You know, we died to being dead in our sin.

344
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 We've been raised to new life.

345
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 And so we're meant to keep putting that off.

346
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 We don't always live in the victory that Jesus has won.

347
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 But we're meant to put this off.

348
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 Now what does it mean to put off our old self?

349
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 And what does that actually mean?

350
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 Well, it's like turning away from our sinfulness, our brokenness.

351
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 It's like coming to Jesus and saying, "Jesus, this is what's going on in my life.

352
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 Help me.

353
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 I know I'm not who I want to be.

354
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 I know I'm not who you want me to be.

355
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 But help me to be that person."

356
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 It also has to do with the word "repentance,"

357
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 where we turn from whatever we're doing that we know doesn't honor God

358
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 and say, "Jesus, I don't want to live this way anymore.

359
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 Forgive me.

360
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 Help me now from this point forward to live by your grace, by your power, by your strength."

361
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 That's what putting off our old self means.

362
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 And it happens in that relationship with Jesus that Paul taught the Ephesians.

363
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 You do that in a relationship.

364
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 It happens with that intimacy of Jesus that we've been talking about.

365
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 But notice this too also talks about the old self as being corrupted by deceitful desires.

366
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 So it's a life that seems to be good and enjoyable, but really it leaves us empty-handed and broken.

367
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 It's like false advertisement.

368
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 You think you're getting something good, but you find yourself in shambles and more pain.

369
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 And some of you may feel that way.

370
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 On the one hand, you're excited to be here.

371
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 You're like, "Man, I love worship.

372
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 I love Jesus.

373
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 I love this community, and it's so good always to be here."

374
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 But then on the other hand, you haven't been--you're still stuck in patterns of the past.

375
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 You've returned to part of your old life, and you live in some of that brokenness.

376
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 So what do we do?

377
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 Well, this passage actually provides an answer, a solution for us, and I want to continue to unpack that.

378
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 That's also where we can start addressing our question.

379
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 So how do we say yes to the Holy Spirit's transforming and healing work in our lives?

380
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 How do we say yes to that, that we can experience that change, that we can become more Christ-like,

381
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 that we don't have to stay the same person?

382
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 Maybe the ugliness that's in our heart or in our actions, maybe it's anger, whatever it may be,

383
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 we don't have to stay there, and we can experience this transformation.

384
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 So here it goes.

385
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 While Christ has defeated sin on the cross, we don't always live in that victory.

386
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 And so putting on and putting off is actually daily discipleship, it's daily relationship with Jesus.

387
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 And so we've already talked about the putting off part, but then in between the putting off the old self

388
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 and putting on a new self, there's another line, so I want to look at that with you.

389
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 It says that we, it says this, "to be made new in the attitudes of your mind."

390
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 So God wants to do some renewing of our mind so that we're not stuck in the futility of our thinking.

391
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 And the Greek verb "to be made new," it's in a passive voice, and what that means is

392
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 that we're not the agents that make ourselves new.

393
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 We do not renew ourselves, but God is the agent of renewal.

394
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 And I think that's really important for us to know, that whether it's with justification,

395
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 sanctification, glorification, it is always 100% the work of God in our lives.

396
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 And He's the one that changes and renews us. It's His power. It's not us. It's not your effort.

397
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 And I think sometimes we get stuck in our own efforts, where we try to make stuff happen out of our own

398
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 and we fall short. But we need to learn to surrender and rely on the power of God

399
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 to bring about this change, because He's the one who changes us. We don't do that ourselves.

400
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 But we are given part in the process where we can say yes to the Holy Spirit's work,

401
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 and that's the putting off and the putting on. Now what does putting on mean?

402
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 Putting on, just very simply, means putting on the new self as obedience to Jesus.

403
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 That we do what Jesus says. That we do what the Holy Spirit is revealing to us.

404
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 And we don't always feel like that at first, but that's what putting on the new self means.

405
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 So God has given us this picture, and this actually comes from our daily putting on clothes and taking off clothes.

406
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 Take off the dirty clothes, put on the fresh clothes. That's what this imagery is about and comes from.

407
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 And when we do that, we start reflecting more and more the true righteousness and holiness

408
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 that we've been created for. We give God, we give the Holy Spirit a space in our lives to move

409
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 and to transform us as we put off the old self and we put on the new self.

410
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 And in that process, the Holy Spirit renews us and conforms our image more and more to Him.

411
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 And that's how we say yes to the Holy Spirit's work.

412
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 It's through daily putting off our old self and putting on the new self.

413
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 Now, through the imagery of putting off the old self and putting on the new self, Paul is saying,

414
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 become what you are. Live in line with your new identity that you have been given.

415
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 You're children of God. Now reflect God. Reflect your heavenly Father.

416
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 That's your identity. Your new identity.

417
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 Now, you might again still wonder, like, well, what does that look like?

418
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 So I want to share a little bit with you.

419
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 When I was in university, I struggled really with one person that I knew.

420
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 Different personality. There was nothing wrong with him.

421
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 Just different personality. Personality clash.

422
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 And there was a lot of judgment in my heart towards him.

423
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 There was a lot of lack of grace.

424
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 You know, as Christians, we've been shown grace by Jesus.

425
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 But then sometimes we turn around and we don't show grace to other people.

426
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 Well, that was what was happening.

427
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 And I knew I had a bad attitude, a bad way of thinking and feeling about this other person.

428
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 And I wasn't honoring God. And I was not the person I wanted to be.

429
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 But at that point, I wasn't admitting that to myself yet. I hadn't gotten to that.

430
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 So I received a package from my parents from Germany.

431
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 It was around Christmas, a little bit before Christmas.

432
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 It was amazing, German chocolate.

433
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 And so he comes into the room and I'm eating some chocolate.

434
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 And he's like, "Oh, I love chocolate."

435
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 He's like, "German chocolate is my favorite chocolate."

436
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 And I said, "Nein! Du kriegst keine Schokolade. You're not getting any chocolate."

437
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 So I didn't say that.

438
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 But I knew what he was asking for.

439
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 But I pretended like I didn't understand.

440
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 So I just kept eating my own chocolate.

441
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 It was not very nice.

442
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 Another occasion, I was trying to walk to class.

443
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 And I was rushing to get there.

444
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 And so he was blocking the hallway.

445
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 And he's like, "You first got to fight me if you want to get past me."

446
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 Now, he was saying this in a playful way.

447
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 So this was not like he was not really trying to fight me.

448
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 So he was just trying to relate to me and engage me.

449
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 And he's like, "You first got to fight me."

450
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 And I was like, "I don't want to fight you. I just actually want to go to class."

451
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 Again, this German anxiety about not being late.

452
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 It's like the biggest sin in Germany is to be late.

453
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 So I'm so anxious.

454
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 And so I asked him several times.

455
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 And he didn't understand that I was serious.

456
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 And so I put him down on the ground.

457
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 I was like, "I'm sorry. I really need to go to class."

458
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 So I went to class.

459
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 So there's just some personality things where it's just really struggling with that relationship.

460
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 Now, fast forward a year.

461
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 I signed up for a Christian community group on campus.

462
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 So I had no idea who I was going to be placed with.

463
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 So I show up to our first meeting. The leader had called me.

464
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 I show up. Guess who's there.

465
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 I felt like quitting right there when I saw him.

466
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 But then the Holy Spirit convicted me in my heart.

467
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 I knew that my feeling and my attitudes towards him were not right.

468
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 And I was not who I wanted to be.

469
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 And I was not who God had called me to be.

470
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 And so I knew that God was asking me to stay in this group.

471
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 And that there was something I needed to learn.

472
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 Even though I didn't feel like it.

473
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 But in this instance, I said yes.

474
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 So I ended up bringing my feelings, my thoughts, and prayer before Jesus.

475
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 Asked for patience and grace over all of this.

476
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 And I also did what God was asking me to do, which was go to those meetings.

477
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 So you see in this, there's the putting off.

478
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 Like I was acknowledging my feelings that were not right.

479
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 And I was asking Jesus to help me with this.

480
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 I'm giving this to you.

481
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 I know I'm not feeling, thinking about this the right way.

482
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 And then there was the putting on.

483
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 The actually doing what was right.

484
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 To keep going. To be there. To listen.

485
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 This went on for two years.

486
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 And I can truly say that after two years,

487
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 it wasn't a chore for me to go to this community group anymore.

488
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 I loved the people there. I loved my brother.

489
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 And my heart had genuinely changed.

490
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 It was transformed.

491
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 Now I could not do this out of my own strength.

492
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 But it was the power of God working in my life.

493
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 Changing my heart and my attitude.

494
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 Now if I would listen to IG influencers or YouTube influencers,

495
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 they just tell you, do you.

496
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 Now if I would do me in this instance,

497
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 I would not go through all of that stuff.

498
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 I would not make myself do something I don't feel like doing.

499
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 So we have to remember, what does all of this flow out of?

500
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 Well it's because of the love and grace of Jesus that he has shown me.

501
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 It's the work of the Spirit of God in my life.

502
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 And me just wanting to love Jesus back.

503
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 And being the person that he has called me to be.

504
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 That's where all of this always flows from.

505
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 It always flows from there.

506
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 So I want to invite the worship team to come up right now.

507
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 And I just want to invite you here today.

508
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 As I have been sharing about putting off and putting on our new self,

509
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 putting off our old self.

510
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 Like what things the Holy Spirit has been bringing to your mind.

511
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 What he has been speaking to you about.

512
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 And I just want to create some space right now where you can come yourself before Jesus.

513
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 Can respond to him in a way that he is inviting you to respond.

514
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 I don't want you to play down this moment.

515
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 Like we sometimes we treat things like this casually, yeah whatever.

516
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 No, Jesus has the power to change and transform your life.

517
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 He has the power to change and transform your heart.

518
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 I believe he wants to release some faith in us.

519
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 That he can do this work.

520
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 So I have two questions up there to help us prayerfully reflect.

521
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 What are some areas in your life where you need to put off your old self and put on your new self?

522
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 And the second one is what are the parts of your life we are longing for God's healing and transforming work?

523
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 Because a lot of times where we are living in our old self there is actually a lot of brokenness.

524
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 We just want, we need God's love, we need God's healing.

525
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 So I just want to invite you right now for a couple of minutes just to pray,

526
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 to come respond to the Holy Spirit's leading and then I'll pray over us.

527
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 So let's do that right now.

528
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 Let's take this time to pray.

529
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,160
