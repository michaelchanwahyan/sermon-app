[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   So good to see everyone. Also want to say hi to the people online.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   I know some of you are watching there. Always good to have you as well.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   I was praying for us before the service. I felt led to pray.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   And a lot of times when the Holy Spirit is working in me, then there's tears.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   So when you see me crying here, then it's usually because of the Holy Spirit.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   And as I was praying, I just had the sense that everyone here was caring a lot.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   That you all have a lot going on in your lives.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   And that we've been really busy. That we've just been really busy as a church.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   But then part of that is that we've also been, to one degree or another,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   there's been some disconnecting with Jesus.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Where we're just not in that intimacy that Jesus desires for us,
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   that probably we ourselves also desire.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   And so it was really stirred to pray for us.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   And then as we were worshipping and sang that song, "God of Revival",
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   I was like, "That's it."
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   God wants to do a revival in our hearts through the Holy Spirit.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   He wants to draw us back into relationship and do something new,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   something powerful, something beautiful in our lives.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   But that's us yielding ourselves to Jesus.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   That's not something that any speaker can push or force.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   It's really just the Holy Spirit moving in us, just saying,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   "Lord, we want more of you. We desire you. We hunger for more of you in our lives."
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   So I don't know if that's resonating with anyone.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   That's how I felt led in prayer.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   But I just wanted to set that expectation for us today as we're here.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   I just want to encourage you to express your hunger for Jesus.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Say, "Holy Spirit, come. Fill my life. Do work in my life. Do something new.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   I've been busy. There's other stuff that's going on.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   And just do something new and do something beautiful."
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   And so, well, when I was attending or when I was studying university,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   I attended a church in Texas.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   And so this church was known for being a safe place, like a safe church
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   where people from all walks of life, from diverse backgrounds, they can come.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   It's safe. It's also a place of feeling, a place of processing.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   And so that was the context of this church.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Now, a friend of mine and I, we both attended the church.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   So on one Sunday, we both were early. We're talking with each other.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   It's nice to catch up. And I see this guy come in.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   And I turn to my friend and say in a very judging way, "What is he doing here?"
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Now, I didn't know that person.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   I just saw him for five seconds and made some observation, some judgment about him.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   And I don't even know where that came from because I'm usually not the person
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   who says something like that. But I said it.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   And my friend, he responded. He said, "Tim, for you and I to be here this Sunday morning,
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   it's not a big deal. It's easy for us to come here and to worship God.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   But for many people, they have so many challenges in their lives.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   There's so much difficulty that it is a big deal for them to be there."
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   I'm even just sensing that for some of us here right now.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   And then he said, "And this man, he had to overcome so many barriers
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   to just even be here this morning to worship with us together God."
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   I was like, "Wow." It's like a mic drop moment, right?
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   And he also put me in my place when I had spoken those thoughtless words.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Now, you see at this moment that the gospel was not fully worked out in my life.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   There was judgment. And I don't know what it was.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   In some sense, I was comparing myself with him. And I was saying that I belong and he doesn't.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   I somehow measure up, he doesn't. I'm part of this church and he shouldn't be part of it.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   I mean, I would have not said it like this, but that's what my judgment ultimately said, right?
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   And so that moment showed me that there still is a lot of things that need to be worked out in my heart,
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   in my mind, in my thinking, in my feelings, in my actions.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   And that I need more Jesus. I need more Jesus. And I still need more Jesus today.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   I'm still a work in progress. I'm sure that some of you, you're feeling that way as well.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   And I need the Holy Spirit to do a continuous work in my life, in my heart.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Now truth be told, we all at one point or another, we find ourselves in this place
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   where there's just things that pop up in our lives that are just not pretty,
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   where we see we are a work in progress. For me, it was that judgment.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   For you, maybe it's something else. Maybe it has something to do with relationships.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Maybe it has something to do with your workplace.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Maybe it has something to do with your private life or your ethics.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   I don't know, but you know.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   And so, as I was preparing this message today, I just had the sense that Jesus really wants to lead us
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   in aligning our lives more with the truth of the gospel.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   To bring us more in alignment with the truth of the gospel.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   So I want to discuss with you this question.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   How can I more fully align my life with the truth of the gospel?
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   And what does that look like? What does that even mean?
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   How can I take my life that's not where I want it to be, to be more fully like the life of Jesus?
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   That my life shines Jesus when somebody looks at it.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   That he can see, man, there's something different in this person's life.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   That it shines Jesus.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   So that's what I want to explore with you today through this message.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   We're in the book of Galatians. We're continuing our sermon series.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   This is the third week. Actually, I don't know if you don't mind. Sorry. I apologize.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Can we turn the mic off for a second?
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   I think I'm good.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   So let me set the context for our passage.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   So in the sermon series, we're exploring what does it mean to have Jesus at the center of our lives?
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   What does it mean to work out the gospel and the implications of the gospel for us as individuals, but also for us as a church?
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   And so let me briefly set the context for our passage.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   So Paul, he started churches in Galatians.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Actually, while he was sick, he planted his church, or actually multiple churches in Galatia.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   And then he left to move on to continuous work for God.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   And other people followed him.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   The book of Galatians refers to them as a group of agitators.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   And so they come in after him, and they're telling the Galatians that Paul is not truly preaching or sharing the gospel.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   That he left out half the part because he's a people pleaser.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   And he didn't want to share the part that was difficult.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   And that part was like observing, in addition to believing in Jesus and what Jesus has done, that there was additional stuff that was needed.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Like observing the law.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   So they were worried about ethics.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   That they wanted the life to be ethical.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   And then the second thing they accused Paul, and Pastor Andrew touched on that last week.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   That he was a second-rate apostle.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   That his credentials didn't quite measure up.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   And so then Paul, in this letter, he knows that what these teachers are doing, they're leading the Galatians astray.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   You know, they're leading them away from the truth.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   And Paul knows that this type of thinking, it's a spiritual dead end.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   That it doesn't lead to the life that Jesus wants to unfold in his people.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   It's a dead end.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   And so he writes this very, probably the most passionate letter in the New Testament.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   And very strongly defends this gospel message, the essence of the Christian faith.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   And so today, as we continue, this is a continuation of the defense of the gospel, that text that we're going to look at.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   But before we read it, I want to provide a little bit of context as well.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   There is a name that's being used, Cephas.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   Now Cephas is the Aramaic name for Peter.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   So actually, when we read Peter, so just keep that in mind as I'm about to read the passage.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   It's the Apostle Peter that this is talking about.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Okay? You ready? Sounds good?
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   Alright, let's do this.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   So Galatians 2, starting in verse 11, says this.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   "But when Cephas came to Aniak, I posed him to his face, because he stood condemned.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   For before certain men came from James, he was eating with Gentiles.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   But when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing the circumcision party.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   And the rest of the Jews acted hypocritically along with him, so that even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   But when I saw that their conduct was not in line, not in step with the truth of the gospel,
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   I said to Cephas, 'Before them all, if you, though a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew,
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   how can you force Gentiles to live like Jews?'
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   We ourselves are Jews by birth, and not Gentile sinners.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   Yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law,
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   but through faith in Jesus Christ.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   So we also have believed in Christ Jesus in order to be justified by faith in Christ,
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   and not by works of the law.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   Because the works of the law, no one will be justified.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   But if in our endeavor to be justified in Christ, we too were found to be sinners,
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   is Christ then a servant of sin?
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   Certainly not.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   For if I rebuild what I tore down, I prove myself to be a transgressor.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   For through the law I died to the law, so that I might live to God.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   I have been crucified with Christ, and the life I now live--
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   I have been crucified with Christ, it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   And the life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God,
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   who loved me and who gave himself for me.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   I do not nullify the grace of God.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   For if righteousness were through the law, then Christ died for no purpose.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   That was a lot.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   But this is some of the most powerful words in Scripture, and I want to unpack those.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   So the first thing is, there is an incident, and it's between Peter and Paul.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   So Paul, he says that, "I opposed them to his face."
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   And he also says that he did that before them all, so he did it publicly.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   Now I don't know about you, but when somebody confronts someone else to their face
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   and does this publicly, it's a pretty big deal, right?
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   Yes.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   And so what's going on here?
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   So what happened, and why is this a big deal?
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   Why is Paul making such a big fuss?
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Well, let's explore that. What happened?
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   Well, Peter, he's a Jewish man, so that's his background.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   And he had this powerful experience where God revealed to him that it was okay to eat certain foods,
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   and then servants from Cornelius came, and then he ended up eating with them.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   And so it was in the Book of Acts, the Scripture of the Mount,
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   because most Jewish people, because of their food laws and customs,
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   they don't eat with other people because they don't follow the same food laws.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   But Peter, he was eating with Gentiles, so he had gotten past this.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   But now a group of people came, the circumcision group, they came from Jerusalem,
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   and Peter caves into pressure, he caves into fear of them.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   Out of fear of them, he stops eating with Gentiles.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   And Gentiles, by the way, just means everyone else who's not a Jewish person,
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   so it would be most of us here.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   And so he stops having table fellowship with them, he stops sharing meals.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   And so that's what happened. But why is this a big deal?
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   Why can't Peter just eat with whoever he wants to eat with?
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Isn't anyone free to just eat who they want to eat with?
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   Well, let me explain that a little bit.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   Now, I don't know if you have ever had the experience, maybe it's like with your company,
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   you want to go to lunch, or there's a company party and you try to sit at a table,
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   and even though people can make space for you, they choose not to.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   And there's some communication that they really don't want you to sit at their table.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   Now that doesn't feel good, right?
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   I also have to think of my own family story.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   My father, he grew up and he was the target of my grandfather's anger.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   And so a lot of times my father was not allowed to eat with the family.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   He had to eat by himself as a little kid.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   Now just think of how traumatic that is,
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   because ultimately what it's saying is, you're not really part of the family. Right?
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   Well, that's kind of what's happening in this incident.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   Because when Peter stopped eating with the Gentiles,
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   they're all Christian brothers and sisters,
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   he's saying, you're not really part of this family.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   There's something wrong with you. That's what his actions say.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   That's a pretty ugly, ugly thing, right?
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   Now sharing a meal together has always been, and still is today,
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   a powerful symbol of association.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   And there's still so much division around who we eat with.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   There's still today lots of people who would not eat with a person
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   from a certain ethnic or cultural background,
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   or from somebody who's from a different socioeconomic class.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   So all this stuff still happens today.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   And so that's part of the issue that Paul is calling out.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   But in Peter, there's also some, he's reverting back to his old ways.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   There's also some pride from a people group,
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   where he's acting in that pride over against another group.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   Now in verse 13, we're told that Peter acted hypocritically.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   So he actually didn't believe what he did was true, but he did it anyhow.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   So it doesn't make it any better, right?
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   If you make people feel like they're not truly human,
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   and they need to eat somewhere else,
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   even if you don't truly believe that, but you act that way,
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   that's not good.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   Now, what made all of this worse, you have to think of who Peter is.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   Peter is one of the disciples of Jesus.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   He is one of the main leaders in the early Christian movement,
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   and he's acting this way.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   Wow.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   And then suddenly, all these other people are starting to follow him,
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   all these other Jewish Christians, they're following his example.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   That's a lot of times when leaders act wrongly,
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   and others follow because they think that person should know.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   And so his actions divide the body of Christ.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   It says in verse 14, it says this,
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   "But when I saw that their conduct was not in step with the truth of the gospel,"
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   so he's talking about all of them following along,
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   "I set to see if it was before them all,"
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   actually, that's the part I want to look at, the first part,
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   "but when I saw that their conduct was not in step with the truth of the gospel."
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   So this is the heart of the problem.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   Peter's action was not in step with the truth of the gospel,
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   because the truth of the gospel is this,
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   that God loves every single person equally,
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   that every single person is created in the image of God,
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   and that also every single person is saved equally.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   Like we all stand 100% sinful before God,
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   and we all need 100% of Jesus to rescue and deliver us.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   And then he makes us family, he makes us a spiritual family,
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   brothers and sisters in Christ,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   and that's always powerful when a church lives that out,
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   when people from different socioeconomic backgrounds,
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   different ethnic backgrounds, different cultural backgrounds,
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   when they are a family and they love each other,
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   because that's usually not what we find in surrounding culture.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   Maybe we find it officially as slogans from companies,
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   but it's so many times not lived out,
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   and sadly sometimes it's not lived out in the church.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   That's why for us this is so important.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   We're an intentionally diverse church,
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   and we want to live out this truth of the gospel,
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   but here Peter was undermining it through his actions.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   But that was not the only way.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   The other way was that his actions also indirectly communicated
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   that Jesus' saving work is not enough,
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   that something else was needed,
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   that you needed to observe the Mosaic Law,
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   men had to go through circumcision,
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   so you had to do these extra stuff to have right standing with God.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   That's what I was communicating, and Paul says no.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   It's just Jesus. It's nothing else.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   It's just Jesus.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   So Paul takes Peter,
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   so they're still continuing this conversation, this conflict,
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   and he says this in verse 6,
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   and he says, "Yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law,"
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   so he says, "Peter, you know that, but through faith in Jesus Christ."
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   So we also believed in Christ Jesus in order to be justified.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   You and I, we did the same thing, man.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   We believed in Jesus so that we can experience this right standing with God,
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   because by the works of the Lord, no one is justified.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   You know, we know that.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   So Peter's actions were undermining the truth of the Gospel.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   His actions were not in line with the truth of the Gospel
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   when he was pushing people through his actions to observe these laws.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   Now, we are not saved because of something that we do,
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   but because of what Jesus Christ has done on the cross.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   And Christianity is kind of weird in this way,
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   because it says that there is nothing that you can do to earn right standing with God.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   It sounds pretty depressing, right?
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   It doesn't matter how many good deeds you do.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   It doesn't matter,
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   because the human problem is there's just sin in our hearts and our lives,
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   just like I shared in the beginning of my story.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   There's just stuff in us, and that sin separates us from God.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   And it's so serious that Jesus came to die for us
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   and to deal with this problem that we cannot deal with,
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   so that we can have new life in him,
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   that we can experience forgiveness,
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   that we can become righteous people, truly righteous,
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   not out of our own strength,
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   but by the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   So Paul confronts Peter to his face,
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   because his actions are not in step with the truth of the gospel.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   So that's what's going on here.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   So this is a very critical observation, I believe, for us.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   As Christians, we need to do our best to continue to ensure
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   that our lives are in step with the truth of the gospel.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   God wants to bring alignment.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   He wants us to reflect Jesus more.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   So Paul is recounting all this stuff in this confrontation,
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   in his writing to the Galatians,
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   because they are losing their way.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   They're getting unaligned with the truth of the gospel among themselves.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   So that's why Paul shares a story with them, about this incident.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   And he's calling them back to align their lives with the truth of the gospel.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   So what does it point to this...
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   What this all points to is that the gospel is not just something
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   that we believe to begin our Christian life.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   A lot of times, as Christians, we think, "Oh, I graduated from the gospel.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   I believed, and now I moved on to discipleship and other stuff.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   I'm more mature. This was like the beginning."
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   But the gospel is something that we have to work out continuously in our lives.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   So our thinking, our feeling, our actions
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   are more and more in step with the truth of the gospel.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   And I just wonder,
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   what are some of your thoughts, some of your feelings,
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   some of your actions right now
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   that are not in line, not in step with the truth of the gospel?
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   You know, where are we off?
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   So that brings me back to a question I asked at the beginning of the message.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   How can I more fully align my life with the truth of the gospel?
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   You know, how do you do that?
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   Well, we find some guidance from Paul in this passage that we're looking at today,
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   too, in verse 20, he says this,
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   "I have been crucified with Christ.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   And the life I now live in the flesh,
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and who gave himself for me."
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   So there's a paradox here. There's a paradigm here for us.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   That there is a dying that opens up a new way to living.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   There is a dying that opens up a new way to living.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   So Paul talks about being crucified with Christ.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   That means his sinful self, his pride, his selfishness,
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   those things have been nailed to the cross.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   They've been put to death by what Jesus has done.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   And he's been raised to a new life where it's now Christ who lives in him.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   And then what does that mean?
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Well, now, because of that has happened in Paul's life,
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   he now can live by faith in the Son of God who loves him and who gave him,
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   what does it say?
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   Oh, look, here.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   "Who loved me and gave himself for me."
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   So he can do that now.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   He can do that by the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   And so for our own journey,
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   how do we live this life of faith in the Son of God?
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   How do we live this life of faith in Jesus?
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   That's the Son of God.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   And how does that bring us to align our lives more with the truth of the gospel?
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   Well, our journey always begins with dying to our old sinful self.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   And yes, there's a once-and-for-all element to that for us
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   because Christ has won a victory for us, we're declared righteous.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   It's like a verdict over our lives that stands for the rest of our lives.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   Like we are justified because of what Christ has done.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   But then Jesus doesn't stop there.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   There's an ongoing process.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   It's called sanctification, where God wants to make us holy.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   He wants to make us more and more like him because, let's be honest,
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   even in our lives, there's still a lot of stuff that needs to be worked out.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   And so there needs to be a continuous dying to our selfishness,
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   to our pride, to our sinful ways,
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   so that it opens up a new way to living differently,
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   to living in a powerful way that reflects the love of Jesus,
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   that Christ becomes alive in our lives, that he's visible in your life,
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   that he's visible in my life.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   And the Holy Spirit will lead us as we live that life of faith.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   And he will also convict us of the things
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   that still need convicting in our lives.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   And so ultimately, how do we align ourselves with the truth of the gospel?
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   Well, it actually flows out of a personal relationship with Jesus
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   that we engage in continuously.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   And I want to explain this a little bit through a story.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   So, another time at a university,
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   there was this guy that just really rubbed me the wrong way.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   Like, I just had a hard problem with him.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   He was a good guy, he was nothing, he was not an evil person.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   I just really struggled with his personality.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   I'm not going to ask if anyone can relate, right?
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   So on one occasion, he comes into my room,
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   he had been gone for the weekend, he forgot his toothbrush,
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   and he asked me if he can borrow my toothbrush.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   And I was like, "Dude, you don't borrow people's toothbrush.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   Let me buy you one."
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   Another time, he was blocking the hallway, I needed to go to class.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   I'm going to class, and he's like,
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   "You first got to fight me before you get through here."
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   Now, he was as big as me, so just putting that in context.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   But I was like, "I'm sorry, I just really need to go to class.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   Can you just please let me go to class?"
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   And he didn't understand I was serious, and I tried multiple times,
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   I was like, "Please, I'm just trying to go to class.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   I don't want to fight you."
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   And then finally, he's like, "No, you got to first fight me."
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   I was like, "Okay."
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   So I put my--I don't know what you call this,
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   I know the German word--you put your leg behind him,
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   I put him on the ground, and I was like, "I'm sorry, I need to go to class."
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   So I went to class.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   But there was also a lot of judgment and pride in my heart towards him,
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   and talking bad behind his back.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   So it was not pretty.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   Fast forward a year.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   I sign up at this university for a Christian community group.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   I have no idea who's going to be placed in my community group.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   Guess who's in my community group?
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   It's him.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   And so as soon as I see him, I'm like,
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   "I think I'm going to quit this community group."
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   But then something happened.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   The Holy Spirit convicted me that my thinking and my feelings
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   were not what honored him.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   And so then I knew that God wanted me to stay in this community group,
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   even though it was so difficult for me, and I really lacked the patience.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   So I stayed in this community group.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   I prayed.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   I prayed for myself.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   I prayed for him.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   I prayed for God to help me to listen, to be loving, to be caring.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   And so that's the dying part.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   You know, we have to die to my thinking, my feelings.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   They're just not in line with Jesus, with his love.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   And it doesn't happen overnight.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   It's a process.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   It's like a constant, like surrendering, "Jesus, take this.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   Help me.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   Help me, Jesus."
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   So then this went for two years.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   One year was not enough for me.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   I needed two years.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   And I can truthfully say that after two years,
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   I genuinely loved and appreciated my brother in Christ.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   I really did.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   And I didn't feel annoyed anymore.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   I didn't have those feelings, and God really changed my heart.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   He aligned my thinking and my feelings with the truth of the gospel.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   But there's another aspect to this.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   Now, why would you do that?
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   Why would I -- you know, when you go on Instagram and you look at the influencers,
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   they tell you, "You do you.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   You just do what you feel like," right?
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   So if I were to do what I felt like, I would never stay in that group.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   But it's because Jesus is in my life, and the Holy Spirit is at work.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   He's like, "Uh-uh.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   You're not who I've created you to be, Tim.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   I want you to be more fully -- be conformed to my image.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   I want you to be a more true reflection, expression of my love."
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   And, of course, we can say no to that, even as Christians.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   So it's a daily -- our aligning ourselves with the truth of the gospel,
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   with our thinking, with our feelings, with our actions,
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   but there's a daily living out that relationship with Jesus
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   and just relying on his grace, coming to him in prayer,
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   dying to all parts of ourselves so that we can be raised,
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   so that there's a new path for new living.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   You know, that's what he wants to do.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   He wants some parts to die so there's a new way of living,
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   there's true transformation.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   So those are things that we can't do on ourselves.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   This is the work of God in our lives, 100%.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   This was not me.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   All I can say is, "Okay, Jesus, yes, I hear what you're saying.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   Help me."
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   You know, and that's what that means.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   That's what it means to live by faith in the Son of God who loved me
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   and who died for me.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   I want to summarize things here.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   The realigning of our thoughts, feelings, and actions to the truth of the gospel
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   happens as we consistently live out our personal relationship with Jesus.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   And I believe that's what Jesus is calling us.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   If you're a Christian, I believe that's what Jesus is calling you this morning.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   Just to draw back into that relationship with him,
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   to say yes to what he's saying to you.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   He's speaking to you.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   I don't know what he's saying to you, but you know.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   You have the Holy Spirit living in you.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   You know, to say yes to that, to say, "Yes, Jesus, I want what you want,
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   not what I want.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   Not my way, but your way.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   Not my will, but your will."
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   And we surrender, say, "Jesus, take my life and lead me into this life that you have."
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   And we can trust that whatever Jesus has is always better than our own plans.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   It's always better.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   He created us.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   He knows.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   So I want to invite the worship team to come up.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   Now, as I was reading over this powerful statement from Paul,
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   "I have been crucified with Christ.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   And the life I now live, I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   and gave himself for me."
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   I love how personal Paul puts us here.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   This is not a general truth.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   This is deeply personal to Paul.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   And it's really this love, you know, when we know Jesus,
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   that's out of--because he loved us so much, that's why we even care to do this stuff.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   That's why instead of just doing you do you, you know, do your thing,
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   we actually say, "Jesus, I want to do what you want to do," because he loved us.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   He poured out his life for you, for me, on his cross so that we can be forgiven,
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   that we can be brought in relationship.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   So he loved--the letter of John says, "We love because God first loved us."
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   And so he wants to move us today deeper into his love
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   from people whose faith is expressed in love towards other people.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   And God gives us the grace. He gives us the forgiveness.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   I shared all this ugly stuff about my life, right,
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   all this inner dialogue that most people never see.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   But even in that, God meets us with grace.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   He meets us with forgiveness because he loves us.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   And so I just wonder, you know, how is Jesus inviting you to respond to his love today?
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   How is he inviting you deeper into what he has for your life?
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   What are some areas in your life where you're thinking,
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   your feelings and actions are not aligned with the truth of the gospel?
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   Where is the Holy Spirit leading you to do some dying so that he can open up a new way of living for you?
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   This is good news. You can truly change.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   You can become a more loving, beautiful person, not because of you,
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   but because of Jesus working in your life, because of the Holy Spirit moving you, transforming you.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   But it's our choice to say yes to that.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   And so I just want to actually invite you right now into a prayer time.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   Just what's God been saying to you throughout this service?
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   And just to talk to him.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   So you can ponder on those questions that I asked there, and in about two minutes I'll pray for us.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   So let's pray right now.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   Let's commune with Jesus.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   (Prayer is sung)
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   (Prayer is sung)
