[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Merry Christmas, everyone.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Alright, alright.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   You didn't have to. That's so nice.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   So, a week before Christmas in 2014,
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   a friend of mine who works for Nike reached out to me and she said,
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   "We're having an event, a special lunch event,
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   to say thank you to all our clients, our customers,
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   our friends of the brand."
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   She said, "I'd love you to come to the lunch."
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   And I said to her, "Look," you know,
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   "my thinking was, look, Christmas is a busy time for us pastors.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   I don't always can fit in lots of social stuff around Christmas.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   This lunch was really not something that really was a priority for me."
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   So I reached back out to her and I said, "Look, I thank you so much for your invite.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   I'm not really sure if this is going to work for me."
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   And she's like, "Andrew," she's like,
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   "there's a very, very famous person coming to this lunch."
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   She says, "This person is so famous
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   and I will arrange it that you will get to personally meet with this famous person."
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   I was like, "Who is this famous person?"
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   She's like, "I'm not going to tell you who the famous person is.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   All you need to know is that they're very, very famous
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   and you will want to meet them."
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   This is like a marketing technique of Nike, okay?
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   This is how they get people to their lunches, right?
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   So I was intrigued. It worked, right?
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   I was intrigued. I'm like, "This priority has now gone up in my priority list."
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   So I signed up for the event and a week or so later, I went along to the event.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   I got there early and it was one of those really fancy events
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   where there's lots of tables and you're assigned a specific table.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   When you get to your table, there's a little name tag for you on the table.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   So I got to my table, I walked around, I found my name tag
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   and I looked at the name tag next to me and I could not believe what I saw.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   The name tag next to me read "David Beckham."
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   David Beckham, people!
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   David Beckham is going to be sitting next to me for an--
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   He's so lucky. Can you imagine how lucky David Beckham is?
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   To sit next to me? Wow!
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   What a day for Beckham.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   But I couldn't believe that David Beckham was going to sit next to me.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   My heart rate started to go up. My heart rate was pounding.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   I was like, "What am I going to talk to David Beckham about?"
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   And I thought about all my sporting hero moments of my life.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Very short list.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   But I did actually play international football.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   I actually played international football for Hong Kong and I scored a goal.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   I'm like, "I'm going to tell David Beckham about my international football experience."
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   And then I realized that's the dumbest thing to ever say
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   because he's just going to come back with, "Well, the time that I played in the World Cup."
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   So I was super nervous.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   I was like, "I'm not sure what I'm going to say to this guy,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   but how exciting that I'm finally going to meet David Beckham."
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   I've been a fan of David Beckham for a long, long time.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   He's a British sporting icon, of course.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   I don't support Manchester United.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   But I do support Newcastle United, and they are the greatest football club ever.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   But even though he wasn't from my team, he was a sporting icon.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Couldn't wait to meet him.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   So anyway, everybody was coming into this lunch.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   I'm feeling like I'm the guy who's sitting next to the famous guy, so I'm feeling like all cool.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Everybody's coming in, taking their seats.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Obviously, the seat next to me is staying empty.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   I figured David would just come up on stage, they'd introduce him, maybe take some photos.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   He might share some words.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   And then he was going to come and sit down next to me.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   So we all sit down for lunch.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Everybody else on my table sat down.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   The space is next to me.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   And this guy rushes in. He's kind of late.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   He's a little bit overweight, kind of a white guy.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   And he comes in, and he's looking for his place.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   And he comes to our table, and he's walking around the table trying to find his name tag.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   And he comes to exactly where I am and right next to me.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   And he looks at it, and he turns to me.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   He goes, "Oh, hello. I'm sorry I'm late. My name is David Beckham."
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   I'm like, "No, it is not! Your name cannot be David Beckham!"
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   It turns out that David Beckham is not an international football star.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   He's a chartered accountant.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   That was the David Beckham that sat down next to me for lunch.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   I won't even tell you who the famous person was because they weren't really that famous at all.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   And I got to sit next to a chartered accountant who told me over lunch about his three, what I thought were quite spoiled kids.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   And it really was an absolute nightmare.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   It was probably the most biggest disappointing lunch that I've ever had.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   It was a huge disappointment.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Why am I telling you a story about a huge disappointment on Christmas morning?
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Because Christmas morning surely is about the most amazing thing, right?
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   It's about the fact that Jesus was born.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   It's about the fact that our Savior's come.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   That it's a time to glorify and celebrate and worship as we are gathered here today.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Why would I talk about the disappointment of meeting somebody that you thought you were going to meet,
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   but it didn't turn out to be the one that you were hoping to meet?
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   It's because actually on the original Christmas day, some 2,000 years ago,
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   a sense of disappointment was actually how a lot of people in Israel felt when Jesus was born.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   So you've got to remember that they were waiting for a very long time for their Messiah.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   They were so excited about meeting their Messiah.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   They had a David Beckham, if you will.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   The one who would come in and take over the world.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   The one that they believed would actually finally get rid of the Romans once and for all.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   In fact, their prophets from old had spoken about the day when the Messiah would come.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   They had a term for it. It was called the Day of Yahweh.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   And when the Messiah came, the way they spoke about it was,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   He's going to be like a mighty warrior, like a warrior king who will ride into Jerusalem on a chariot filled with flames.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   And as He comes in, He will bring an everlasting peace to the world.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   So the evil Greco-Roman Empire will be banished forever.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   And it will be like this Messiah will come with an army of angels,
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   and they will fight a battle against the Romans.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   The Romans will be defeated.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   And what will be established will be the Jewish and Israel Empire forever and ever. Amen.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   That's what they were looking for.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   That's what they were expecting.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   They were looking for a Messiah who would be a warring king.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   Now, you can understand why they were expecting this.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Imagine what it would be like to be a minority group in a majority culture
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   that is constantly telling you that power is held in those who are the strongest,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   who have the armies, and who are oppressive in how they do that power on everybody else.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   In the first century, the Israels were under the oppressive regime of the Roman Empire.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   They were suffering under that regime.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   They didn't have the freedoms that they wanted to have,
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   and they wanted their Messiah to come and overthrow an empire that was around them.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   And because that empire was all built on war, on violence, on oppression,
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   and the use of power to oppress,
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   it's understandable that the Jewish people were looking for a Messiah
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   who would be able to war himself, defeat the battles and the armies of the Romans,
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   and establish Israel forever.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   So if that was the David Beckham you were expecting to meet,
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   imagine how surprised you were on Christmas Day.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   When there wasn't a warring king that broke from the clouds on a chariot
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   to overthrow the Roman Empire,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   and instead there was a child, a baby,
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   but not just any baby, not a baby born in a castle
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   or a baby born in an incredible temple somewhere,
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   but a baby born in a smelly, stinky cave under a house.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   That's apparently the Messiah.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   So the Jewish people struggled to understand this.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   Now interestingly, the way that Luke presents the arrival of the Messiah,
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   he plays on this tension that there is
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   between what the Jewish people's expectations were
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   and what the reality was in the coming person of Jesus as a child.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Let me pick up the story for you from Luke 2,
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   part of the story that Elizabeth just read to us a moment ago,
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   starting in verse 10.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   "But the angels said to them, 'Do not be afraid, speaking to the shepherds.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   For today in the town of David a Saviour has been born to you.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   He is the Christ, the Messiah, the Anointed One, the Lord.'
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   The angels do come on that day, just as the Jewish people were expecting,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   but not an army of angels to overthrow the Romans,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   a choir of angels singing songs.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   And these angels speak to a group of shepherds,
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   not again the famous people that you'd expect God to speak to,
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   but outcasts, nomads, those that were almost rejected by their own people.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   It is these outcasts that God decides to make the first announcement
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   of the arrival of His Son to.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   And the angels show up and say all the right things about the Messiah.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   First of all, they say, 'This is good news.'
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   They declare good news because the news is of hope,
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   and the ancient prophets of old had spoken about the news
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   being a good news for all people.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   They mention that He's born in the town of David, the city of David,
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   which was their belief, that the Messiah would come from the Davidic dynasty,
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   the line of King David.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   Eventually the Messiah would come from the bloodline of David,
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   and here they are telling the shepherds that the Messiah has come
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   in the town of David.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Then they say the Messiah has arrived, has come, this anointed one, the Lord.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   So you can imagine that the shepherds are super excited at this point,
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   and they're still expecting to go into Bethlehem, the town of David,
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   and meet some mighty warring king who's about to kick off some violent war
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   so that the Romans would be defeated.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   Notice what then, in the midst of that tension and expectation,
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   the shepherds say.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   Verse 12, "This will be a sign to you.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   You will find a baby wrapped in cloths, lying in a manger."
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   You could almost imagine the shepherds going,
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   'Oh my gosh, the Messiah has come. I can't wait.'
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   'This will be a sign to you. You will see a baby wrapped in cloths
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   and lying in the manger.'
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   I'm sorry?
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   Sorry, can you just say that last bit again?
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   We got you up to that point, but what was that last part?
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   The Messiah is going to be a baby?
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   A baby wrapped in cloths, lying in a poor manger?
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   That's not quite what we ordered.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   You ever been to a restaurant and received something that you have not ordered?
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   I can almost imagine the shepherds going,
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   'Could we speak to the manager, please?'
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Like this is not what they expected.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   Now, I want you to see that actually this is everything
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   that God is trying to communicate on Christmas Day.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   And as we gather to celebrate Christmas Day today,
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   it's actually this that we are gathering to celebrate.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   Notice what the angels say right at the start.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   It says, "This will be a sign to you."
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   "This will be a sign to you."
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Now, how we so often interpret that normally
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   is that the angels are basically saying,
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   "Here are some divine directions to get to Bethlehem
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   so that you can find the right person who's the Messiah."
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   "This will be the directions for you. You'll find a baby in wraps in cloths."
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   That's not what they're saying.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   They're not trying to give them some like directions to Bethlehem.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   In fact, the word that's in the Greek, the original language for sign here,
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   literally translates to something that is beyond,
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   something that points to something beyond.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   It's the same word that Luke's going to go on to use
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   to speak about Jesus' miracles.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   He'll say, "These are a sign."
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   He does these miracles as a sign
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   because they point beyond themselves to the coming power of the kingdom
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   and the nature and the character of God.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   Well, the angels use the same word here.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   They say, "Here is a sign to you."
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Something that points beyond the reality of what it is.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   In other words, the Messiah hasn't come as a warring king as you expected.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   He's actually come as a baby,
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   wrapped in cloths, lying in a manger,
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   and that is a sign to you.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   It's a message to you that points beyond what it is.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   And the question we should ask ourselves on Christmas Day is,
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   what's the message?
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   What's the sign?
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   Well, think about it for a moment.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   What is the sign of a child being born?
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   I mean, a child comes into this world completely defenseless,
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   completely vulnerable.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   A child is born into this world completely at the mercy of its parents
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   to be fed, clothed, cared for, looked after,
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   completely vulnerable and exposed.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   A child comes into this world completely at the need of others.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   You could not get a more different picture
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   between a warring Caesar on a chariot
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   and a poor, defenseless child.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   And that, the angels are saying, is a sign to you.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   A sign to you that God's ways are different from the ways of this world.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   A sign to you that actually power is different in God's kingdom
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   than the power that is seen in this world.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   In fact, I would put it like this,
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   that the Christmas story is that true power, victory and hope
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   is not found in the expected strengths of the powers of this world,
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   but the unexpected fragility of the innocence of a child.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   That, my friends, is the heart of the Christmas story.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   That if you want to know where true power lies,
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   if you want to know where actually hope and salvation can come from,
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   it doesn't come from the worldly structures and definitions of power.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   It doesn't come from political context.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   It doesn't come from armies and bombs and guns and drones and war.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   That's not where power is found.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   The true power that sets people free, that raises from the dead,
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   that resurrects people, that gives people hope,
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   that pays the price for sin,
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   that power is found in the innocence of the weak,
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   and it's the weak who become strong in God's kingdom.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   That's a sign to you, the angels say.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   A sign to you that you need to shift your thinking about where power lies.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   A sign for you to understand that if you're a Christian,
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   if you hold the name of Christ,
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   then you have to be on the side of the innocent,
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   on the side of the vulnerable, on the side of the marginalized,
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   on the side of the poor,
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   on the side of the ones that are rejected by everybody else,
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   because that's how Christ came into the world.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   And if Christ comes into the world as a sign to us,
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   we have to lean into that side of the world.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   We are the ones who should stand against
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   the ways in which power is manipulated in the systems of this world
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   and instead glorify in the subversive, table-flipping nature
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   of God's kingdom and the trueness of power.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   Think of it this way.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   God's way of saving the world is a child wrapped in cloth,
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   not a warrior wrapped in armor.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   And that, my friends, is a very important message for our world today.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   If you think about over the things that are happening in 2023
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   as we draw this year to a close,
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   if you have a look around the world at the wars and the political infighting,
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   if you look at the divisiveness of communities,
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   if you look at the way that hate is being used more and more,
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   if we look at some of the darkness that there still is here in the world,
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   this message of Christmas should ring true for us more now
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   than perhaps ever before.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   And although the expectations of the Jewish people in that day
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   was to find something that fitted more into the world's perspective,
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   God shows up and says, "No, we Christians do things slightly differently.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   There's an alternative way of thinking, an alternative way of being,
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   an alternative way of living."
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   And that should still be a sign to the world that Jesus has come.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   And so in a way, there's a fire that gets placed within us
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   if we're Christians at Christmas time,
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   that any time we actually reach out to a vulnerable, marginalized community
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   and we help them and serve them and love them,
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   it's a sign to the world that Jesus has come.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   Any time we help the oppressed get freedom and new life,
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   any time we work with the innocent
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   and help them to be found that they are not guilty,
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   we are a sign that Jesus is here.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   Any time war ceases,
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   any time power that is being abused is stripped from someone,
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   any time the vulnerable find safety and home,
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   it's a sign that Jesus is still here.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   I love the way that the Apostle Paul speaks of the incarnation of Jesus at Christmas time,
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   writing to the church, and a church that was heavily oppressed,
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   and actually a church that was under a huge amount of persecution.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   Here's how Paul writes to his church.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   He says, "Your attitude," in Philippians 2, "should be the same as Christ Jesus,
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   who being in the very nature of God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped,
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   but instead made himself," notice this, "nothing,
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   taking on the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness,
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   and being found in the appearance of a man," notice, "he humbled himself
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   and became obedient to death, even death on a cross,
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   the very weapon that the Greco-Roman Empire used to keep themselves in power,
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   would become the very thing that Jesus would humbly submit himself to,
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   so that he could reveal true power to the world.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   Therefore God exalted him to the highest place,
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   and gave him the name that is above every name,
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord,
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   to the glory of the Father."
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   Isn't that so beautiful?
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   He's saying, "This is the incarnation.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   This is a sign to you," he's saying, "Church,
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   that God decided not to hold power like the world holds power,
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   but to humble himself, strip himself of power, if you will,
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   come down to this world as a defenseless child,
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   to be a man amongst us, so through that he would submit himself
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   to the will of his Father, be raised from the dead,
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   take the sins of the world on his shoulders,
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   pay the price so that we would be free."
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   This is the story of the gospel,
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   and it starts not with a warring king in a fiery chariot,
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   but with an innocent child in a dirty stable.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   It's a profound invitation for Christians on Christmas
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   to declare a different spirit in this world,
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   a different way of understanding power.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   I wonder if you could think about it this way.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   Imagine if the angels came today,
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   maybe here's some of the sort of things they might say.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   "This will be a sign to you.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   You will find a church wrapped in the pain of its community,
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   lying in the poorest of the poorest communities, bringing hope."
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   Or maybe the angel would say, "And this will be a sign to you.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   You will find believers in Christ Jesus
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   wrapped in the hope of the gospel, lying in the marketplace
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   and the workplaces and their families
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   and their spheres of influencing, offering hope."
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   Or maybe I would say, "And you will find me,
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   and this will be a sign to you.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   You'll find me wrapped too often in the cares
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   and the worries of this world,
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   but lying in the nurturing arms of my Father
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   and finding my shalom and peace there."
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   This, my friends, is the story of Christmas.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   And Paul says, "Your attitude, your mindset,
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   the way you think should be like this,
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   not the warring, powerful, mighty thing that the world would say,
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   but the innocent, weak thing that through God is made strong."
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   This is why Jesus's beatitudes are so important to us.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   Those who mourn will be comforted.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   Those who've been rejected will be welcomed.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   Those who are poor will be found rich in Him,
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   but those who are rich will be stripped down.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   The reversal of the heart of God
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   to take the broken things of this world
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   and make them true and strong.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   That's what we gather together today to celebrate.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   And so my encouragement to you on Christmas Day,
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   and I pray that this would inspire you and fill you with hope,
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   is that if you are to live out the Christmas message,
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   it is to live out that message,
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   that we are people who see power in a different way.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   We are people who see love in a different way.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   And we are people who carry a message that is truly good news.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   May we walk towards the vulnerable, marginalize the poor.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   We walk towards those who need the message the most
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   and offer them true hope.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   That's the mission of Christmas.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   It's what we gather to celebrate today.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   And as we worship Him and sing,
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   and as we open the presents later on
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   and have the incredible food for lunch that we'll have,
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   may we do so in a spirit of true gratefulness
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   for the humility of a God who shows us a different way.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   That, my friends, is Christmas.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   Amen.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   Would you stand with me?
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   I would love to pray with you.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   Let's stand together.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   Father, I'm just so grateful for each person here today,
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   on Christmas Day.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   And Father, while of course we long
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   to meet the David Beckhams of this world,
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   we're grateful.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   We're grateful for every person.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   The people who are standing around us right now,
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   the people in our neighborhoods,
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   our apartment buildings, our communities,
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   the people in our offices and our workplaces,
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   the people that you've surrounded us with,
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   we are grateful for them.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   Father, I pray that you would put a fire in the vine
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   and a fire amongst us as your people.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   To be people who love justice,
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   people who fight for the vulnerable,
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   people who stand for the nonviolent gospel
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   that you have given to us in the infancy of a child.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   Lord, I pray that this would be our Christmas message,
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   that there is the great hope in the world,
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   that the darkness is dark,
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   but it has not overcome us.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   That there is, because of Christmas,
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   a light that has come into this world
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   in the form of an innocent, vulnerable child
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   to show us that despite everything happening for us,
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   God can meet us too.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   In our own vulnerability,
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   in our own brokenness,
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   he can be there.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   Father, I pray for anyone here in this room
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   that maybe doesn't know you,
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   but maybe today they've been invited
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   by friends and family and they've come here
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   and they've heard a story and a message
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   about a God who does things differently
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   to what we see in this world.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   Lord, I pray that that message
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   would be an encouragement to them.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   And I pray that you would bring many
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   in this room today towards you.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   Father, we thank you that at Christmas,
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   we have this joyous sign
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   that you have not left the world
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   to spiral out of control,
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   but you have stepped in to bring hope.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   That Jesus himself would go on to say,
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   I've not come to kill and destroy,
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   but I've come to bring life and life abundant.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   I wanna pray, Lord, for every person
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   here at the Vine this year
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   that they would know and feel life and life abundant.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   And Lord, if there is anyone in here
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   who's feeling lowly,
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   who's feeling an outcast,
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   who's feeling vulnerable,
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   who's feeling overwhelmed,
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   I pray that they would know
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   that Jesus has humbled himself
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   and has stepped into the lowliest of places
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   so that he would know exactly
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   how they're feeling right now.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   And so that he would bring a comfort to say,
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   I've been there, I know what that's like.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   And if you come to me, I will give you peace.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   Thank you that the angels would declare
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   over the shepherds, peace on earth.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   And Lord, that's what we desire.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   With all the wars that are happening,
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   with the political angst that is amongst us,
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   with so many divisive perspectives
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   that spew hate rather than love,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   we pray peace on earth.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   And we pray this in the name of Jesus.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   Everyone says, amen, amen.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   Can we worship together?
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   Let's continue to worship as a community.
