1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 (speaking in Cantonese)

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 (speaking in Cantonese)

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 (speaking in Cantonese)

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 (speaking in Cantonese)

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 made a difficult decision.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,600
 We decided to move to Singapore from another point of view.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,840
 Of course, leaving the country had a permanent impact

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,760
 on our life and our daily lives.

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,360
 In a way, we were in a second place,

10
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,280
 facing a new beginning and a new challenge.

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:48,200
 But my wish was to make a breakthrough in my work and personal life.

12
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,520
 So I had a feeling of walking on this path without regret.

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,680
 But on the road of life,

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,960
 we may go to different places in different directions.

15
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,920
 We may worry about our future.

16
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,080
 We may be confused about choosing another path.

17
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,160
 We may worry about missing out on certain benefits.

18
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:17,520
 Of course, if we decide to walk on a certain path,

19
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,200
 to some extent, we may be walking on a path that is not our own.

20
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,680
 I would like to share an English poem with you.

21
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,680
 It is called "The Road Not Taken" by Robert Frost.

22
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,960
 I will read a bit of the English content.

23
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,000
 You can check out the Chinese version.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,680
 It is coming.

25
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,600
 Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,

26
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,760
 And sorry I could not travel both,

27
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,520
 And be one traveler long I stood,

28
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,200
 And looked down one as far as I could,

29
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,840
 To where it bends on the undergrowth.

30
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,320
 It is a four-line poem.

31
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,160
 Let's skip to the fourth paragraph.

32
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,200
 I shall be telling this with a sigh,

33
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,760
 Somewhere ages an ages hence,

34
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,680
 Two roads diverged in the wood,

35
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,120
 And I, I took the one less traveled,

36
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,120
 And that has made all the difference.

37
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,360
 I think it is a bit romanticizing the choice.

38
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,360
 The "road less traveled" is a path chosen by fewer people.

39
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,640
 But what I want to share with you today is

40
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,920
 how we deal with the consequences of our choices

41
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:40,120
 when we have chosen a path that we have never taken.

42
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,600
 The author of this poem is a bit of a conspirator.

43
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,840
 He is a friend who is always in doubt.

44
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,680
 He always wonders

45
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,720
 why he did not choose another path.

46
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,920
 When he is walking in the woods,

47
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,640
 he wonders if the scenery of another path would be more beautiful.

48
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,400
 For this author,

49
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,400
 no matter how we choose the two paths,

50
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,920
 it is still an ideal choice.

51
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,560
 If we keep on pondering

52
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,760
 the "what if"

53
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,080
 in our regrets,

54
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:23,080
 we are actually losing the pleasure of walking this path.

55
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,120
 Why?

56
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:30,200
 Why not devote ourselves to the beauty of this moment?

57
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,200
 For me, I chose to emigrate.

58
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,080
 But what is special is that I met Jesus on the other side of the world.

59
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,600
 My life has undergone a great change.

60
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,400
 Since the first quarter of the century,

61
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,000
 since that encounter,

62
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,680
 I have redesigned the path I am going to take.

63
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,680
 Including how I view my work, my life, and my service.

64
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,120
 Today, I am giving my life to Jesus.

65
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,280
 I want to share with you in today's 20 minutes

66
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:10,800
 how Paul experienced Jesus on the way back from Jerusalem.

67
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,000
 You will remember that in the whole New Testament,

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,200
 the two most important characters, Jesus and Paul,

69
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,960
 had a very special encounter on the way.

70
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,840
 I can say that it was a very dramatic encounter.

71
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,480
 Paul really walked on a path of no return.

72
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,840
 At that time, Paul, or we can call him Saul,

73
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:40,960
 was a follower who wanted to persecute Jesus.

74
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,720
 He received a written commandment from the Council of Jerusalem.

75
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,120
 He took this commandment to Damascus

76
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,400
 to arrest the local people who believed in Jesus.

77
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,080
 But it was very dramatic and amazing.

78
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,000
 He met Jesus on this path.

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,240
 Jesus not only showed himself to him,

80
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,880
 but also instructed Paul to pass on this good news to the people of the outside world.

81
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,000
 So Paul, in the scripture we are going to read today,

82
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,320
 how did he describe this dramatic change?

83
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,480
 In the first chapter of the Scripture,

84
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:20,200
 Paul said, "Have you heard of my life in the Jewish community?

85
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,840
 How did I exert my strength to oppress and persecute the Church of God?

86
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,640
 In the Jewish community, I am more aggressive than many of my fellow countrymen,

87
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,400
 and I am more passionate about the tradition of my ancestors.

88
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,760
 Yet, that one distinguished me from the unbelievers,

89
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,960
 and called me by his name,

90
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,480
 and has given me his son,

91
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,560
 and has made me a messenger in the outside world."

92
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,440
 Here, there is a little response,

93
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,680
 like what Jeremiah said in the Old Testament,

94
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,760
 "I have known you when I was in my mother's womb,

95
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,000
 and I have to distinguish between the two."

96
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,320
 This distinction, calling, and the God's revelation to us,

97
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,200
 are actually the ways of faith in the Bible.

98
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,600
 How does he distinguish us,

99
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,880
 call us, and give us advice?

100
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,560
 This opens up a completely different perspective.

101
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,760
 The path that each of us has to take is actually in the divine will.

102
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,080
 The "uncertain" and "uneasy" that we just shared,

103
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,800
 the direction of "uneasy" is naturally different.

104
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,160
 What we are sharing today is Paul's personal autobiography.

105
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,800
 He mentions how he met Jesus,

106
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,240
 and how he went about his mission.

107
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,000
 Why? Because he wants to remind the believers of the Galatians

108
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,240
 that the original message he shared with them was this,

109
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,960
 the gospel of Jesus Christ,

110
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,360
 so that they can have complete freedom,

111
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,440
 and enter the holy city of Jesus Christ,

112
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,880
 without having to meet the strict requirements of the Jewish faith,

113
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,240
 especially the rite of passage.

114
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,800
 I will give a little explanation

115
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,120
 to help you understand the first chapter,

116
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,520
 and the second chapter, which is a long chapter in the Bible.

117
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,640
 We call it "Year Zero."

118
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:12,120
 Year Zero is the moment when Jesus and Paul met.

119
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,760
 In the next chapter, Paul describes

120
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,880
 the vision of his original Jewish love.

121
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,200
 He served in Damascus for three years.

122
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,120
 In the second chapter,

123
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:31,320
 he talks about the situation when he was once again able to cross the Jordan River.

124
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,320
 Let's see what the Bible says in chapter 1, verse 11.

125
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:40,280
 "Brothers, I want you to know that the gospel I preach is not according to human means,

126
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,800
 because I am not led by human beings,

127
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,040
 and no one is teaching me,

128
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,560
 but by the instructions of Jesus Christ.

129
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,160
 You have heard of my actions in the Jewish faith,

130
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,000
 and how I have been desperately persecuting the Church of God.

131
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 But this one has made me come out of the womb,

132
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,280
 and has called upon my God,

133
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,360
 and has willingly cast his Son into my heart,

134
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,400
 so that I may preach him among the people."

135
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:15,320
 Paul describes how he met Jesus Christ.

136
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,680
 Three years later, he went to Jerusalem to meet Peter,

137
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,280
 and stayed with him for a dozen days.

138
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,320
 He also met other disciples.

139
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,920
 He didn't have a chance to meet other believers.

140
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:33,360
 He wrote a letter to Jesus, and told him that he had not lied to God,

141
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:40,480
 and that he had not met other believers in the area of Jerusalem and the Galilee.

142
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:45,080
 But they heard and knew that the faith that had persecuted them before

143
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,800
 had now spread to the area of the faith that had been destroyed.

144
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,760
 They gave their glory to God for his forgiveness.

145
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,720
 Why did Paul need to spend so much time to talk about his own self-transformation?

146
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,320
 It is actually a thesis.

147
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,360
 First, he said that the core of his response, his faith,

148
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,760
 came directly from Jesus Christ.

149
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:11,280
 Second, he did not have any special contact with the believers in Jerusalem,

150
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,800
 and he did not receive their teachings there.

151
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,800
 Why? Because for the believers of the Galilee,

152
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:23,480
 they began to doubt whether Jesus really revealed himself to Paul,

153
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,000
 and whether Paul's message was a true gospel,

154
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,880
 a gospel that was blessed by the core of the Galilee.

155
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,600
 But let's first look at Paul's own experience.

156
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,920
 We generally call it the road of Damascus.

157
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,680
 It is a very special scene.

158
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,720
 Sometimes we will have a firm heart and be determined to walk that road.

159
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,600
 Paul or Saul had to decide to persecute the Jews.

160
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:02,840
 Of course, it was a very important decision for his career and his life.

161
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:06,560
 But God had a higher purpose.

162
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,800
 At that time, Jesus would reveal himself,

163
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,960
 and for his holy purpose,

164
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,720
 he could completely subvert our lives.

165
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,080
 Was he opposing the gospel or spreading it?

166
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,480
 When Paul thought about his struggle,

167
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,160
 and when he had the opportunity to share his experience,

168
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,160
 he said this.

169
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:34,480
 He described the situation from his own mouth.

170
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,120
 He said that when he met Jesus,

171
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,960
 he fell to the ground,

172
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,360
 heard a voice speak to him in Hebrew,

173
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,960
 "Saul, Saul,

174
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,920
 why are you persecuting me?

175
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,920
 You are kicking a stick with your feet,

176
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,760
 and you are suffering.

177
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,400
 It is very special.

178
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:57,600
 This kind of struggle is actually present in every believer's experience.

179
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,080
 Sometimes we want to kick Jesus,

180
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,760
 and we are struggling.

181
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,000
 Why?

182
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,880
 Why?

183
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,800
 Jesus said,

184
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,760
 "Actually, I have given you a very special mission.

185
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,520
 In your life, in the road ahead of you,

186
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,040
 Jesus will have a special arrangement."

187
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,480
 Back to the Catholic faith.

188
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,680
 Saul wanted to share his experience with the Catholic faith

189
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,440
 because he was really shocked

190
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,320
 why the Catholic faith

191
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,520
 could so quickly have a backlash

192
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:32,400
 against their original faith.

193
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,040
 It is actually a very interesting comparison.

194
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,640
 Paul or Saul

195
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,720
 were originally the most orthodox followers of the Jewish faith,

196
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,200
 but as he encountered Jesus,

197
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,800
 his life changed completely.

198
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,720
 He completely believed in the salvation Jesus Christ could bring.

199
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,000
 But when he preached the gospel

200
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,240
 to the followers of the Gentiles,

201
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,960
 they accepted the gospel at first,

202
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,160
 but they were misled,

203
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,560
 and they rejected Christ,

204
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,280
 and embraced Judaism instead.

205
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,560
 It was a huge contrast.

206
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,040
 So Paul hoped that through his own experience,

207
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,440
 he could be an encouragement to the followers.

208
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,120
 Paul's experience was completely out of grace.

209
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,680
 If you look back at Paul's life,

210
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,200
 I don't know if you are like me,

211
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,800
 sometimes you are worried.

212
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,480
 It is best if God does not speak to me.

213
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,280
 Because if God really shows himself to me,

214
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,080
 it may change the course of my life.

215
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,880
 But don't worry.

216
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,000
 God will really speak to you.

217
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,320
 God will really speak to you.

218
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,760
 At the right time,

219
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,600
 at the right moment,

220
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,640
 he will distinguish you.

221
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,800
 He will remind us of the calling in our lives,

222
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,680
 and show us the way.

223
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,640
 But everyone can rest assured,

224
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,240
 his gospel is enough for Paul to use,

225
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,840
 and enough for each of us to use.

226
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,720
 On the path of our life,

227
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,920
 we will always return to the starting point.

228
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,720
 Sometimes we will reach the crossroads of life,

229
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,160
 and we will have to face a new level of choices.

230
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,560
 We call this a difficulty.

231
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,600
 Sometimes it is really difficult.

232
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,000
 We settled in Singapore,

233
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,720
 and we were part of the local community,

234
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,280
 especially the church life.

235
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,960
 But after about 8 or 9 years,

236
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:29,200
 I received an invitation to work in Hong Kong.

237
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,800
 Long story short,

238
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:38,680
 I was invited to work in a local university.

239
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,600
 I was wondering if this was God's guidance,

240
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,600
 and if I could open up a new path

241
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,880
 to enter the Hong Kong environment.

242
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,800
 I also made a contribution to my profession.

243
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,400
 But the process was very long.

244
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,200
 I was in the hospital for two years,

245
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,040
 and I still didn't get a job offer.

246
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,840
 I was the last person to get a job offer.

247
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:10,360
 We set off for a short mission in India.

248
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,560
 India is a very hot country.

249
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,720
 It was really very hot.

250
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,640
 It was about 37 degrees.

251
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,840
 It was only 35 degrees on that day.

252
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:24,560
 We went to the last day of the mission,

253
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,360
 and we had a rest and relax.

254
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,040
 We visited the local church,

255
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,760
 and we walked up the hill.

256
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,240
 The church was on the hill.

257
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,440
 We listened to a very special song.

258
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,760
 It was a worship song by Hill Song Kids.

259
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,040
 The song was called "Rainbow in the Sky."

260
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,640
 "Rainbow in the Sky"

261
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:51,120
 We had to teach the kids how to sing it.

262
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,720
 "Rainbow in the sky to tell God's promises is true."

263
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,880
 "Rainbow in the sky"

264
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,960
 It was a rainbow in the sky

265
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:05,920
 to tell us God's promises are true.

266
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,920
 We looked up,

267
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,840
 and we saw a rainbow.

268
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,320
 It was a 35-degree sunny day.

269
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,360
 We saw a double rainbow.

270
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:25,080
 We knew that this was a sign and a reminder from God.

271
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,880
 We finished the trip and went back to Singapore.

272
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:31,440
 I opened my mailbox and received a job offer.

273
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,640
 So today we are in Hong Kong.

274
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,160
 We went back to Hong Kong 16 years ago.

275
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,360
 We are also very happy to be able to meet you

276
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,680
 in the Church of the Apostles in Pudong today.

277
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,160
 The grace of God.

278
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,440
 We read the second chapter of the Book of Galatians.

279
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,920
 Paul said that he was inspired by God

280
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,040
 and went to Jerusalem.

281
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,240
 Why? Because he knew that the faith of the whole Church

282
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,680
 was facing a very important hurdle.

283
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,080
 To a certain extent, they had to decide

284
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,400
 how to clarify the status of the faith of the whole Church

285
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:12,480
 and the original Jewish faith.

286
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,200
 This can even be said to be the most important turning point

287
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,520
 in the history of early Churches.

288
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,680
 What does the second chapter say?

289
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,680
 He said that after 14 years of the faith of the Apostles,

290
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,080
 he went to Jerusalem again.

291
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,960
 Barabbas accompanied him and brought Titor with him.

292
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,440
 Titor was a foreigner.

293
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,200
 He was inspired to go up there

294
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,120
 and to explain the gospel that was spread among the foreigners

295
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,760
 to the brothers in Jerusalem.

296
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,040
 He also secretly explored the faith of the other famous people,

297
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:51,000
 including Aaron, Peter, and John.

298
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,920
 In case his previous work became a rumor,

299
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,200
 he went with Titor, a Hebrew,

300
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,480
 but he did not force himself to accept the gospel.

301
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,640
 But the brothers in Jerusalem who had sneaked in

302
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,000
 encouraged us to get freedom in Christ,

303
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,040
 to be slaves.

304
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,920
 But in order to let the truth of the gospel

305
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,680
 remain in the hands of the Church of Gethsemane,

306
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,200
 Barabbas did not give in at all.

307
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,920
 Then it goes on.

308
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:34,400
 On the contrary, when the Jews were in the hands of the Church of Jerusalem,

309
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,000
 they saw that the Lord entrusted Barabbas

310
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,480
 to pass the gospel to those who had not yet been justified,

311
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,400
 just as he entrusted Peter to pass the gospel to those who had been justified.

312
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:50,960
 The one who moved Peter to ask him to be a disciple of those who had been justified

313
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,080
 also moved me, Paul, to ask me to be a disciple of the foreigners.

314
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,160
 So the Church of Gethsemane witnessed

315
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,720
 the grace of the Lord in me, Paul,

316
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:09,640
 and the right hand of Barabbas to bless and cooperate with me.

317
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,840
 And also to let our team continue to serve among the foreigners.

318
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:20,120
 This is a very important decision in the history of the Church.

319
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,960
 To some extent, it is a way to distribute the gospel.

320
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,440
 To some extent, it also accepts the believers of the foreigners

321
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,120
 to worship God freely.

322
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:34,200
 We use the theory of the "Nam Galatia" to explain the history at that time.

323
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,560
 Because it is similar to the 15th chapter of the "Torah"

324
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,320
 but there is a little conflict.

325
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,920
 We can roughly understand it this way.

326
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,880
 Paul first preached to the people, including the place where Galatia was.

327
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,920
 Then he had the opportunity to write a book on Galatia

328
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:51,800
 to encourage the Galatian foreign believers who were mobilized at that time.

329
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:57,320
 Then he attended the General Assembly of Jerusalem that followed

330
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:05,120
 to decide whether the foreign believers should obey the Jewish law.

331
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:12,360
 The Pope at that time proposed that all foreign believers should accept the national anthem.

332
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:17,200
 Their suggestion was passed on to the Antiochian and Galatian churches

333
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,080
 and even shook the believers of Galatia at that time.

334
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,960
 What did they actually advocate?

335
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,160
 It's actually very simple.

336
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:31,120
 Their formula is that the grace of God plus the law of obedience

337
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,000
 is equal to the grace of God.

338
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,880
 Paul was very determined to resist this view.

339
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,840
 For Paul, for our message today,

340
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:48,400
 we believe that the real anthem is the grace of God.

341
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,480
 There is no other.

342
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,880
 It is equal to the grace of God.

343
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,720
 Grace, no other, is already the grace of God.

344
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,120
 This is exactly what Paul wanted to adhere to.

345
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:07,160
 He wanted to advocate to explain to the Antiochian the anthem.

346
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,320
 What he explained to the Antiochians was grace.

347
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:16,760
 Only grace can witness the grace of God.

348
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:20,280
 Sometimes when we discuss, it's very strange.

349
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:26,120
 Why is there such an important dispute in the so-called national anthem?

350
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,400
 I also try to help everyone understand what the national anthem is.

351
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,320
 The national anthem is actually the national anthem we usually talk about.

352
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,800
 Now there are many new national anthems.

353
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,880
 Just follow the tradition and you can do it.

354
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:46,920
 The national anthem was a very important social meaning at that time.

355
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:52,160
 I try to help everyone understand a different direction from this perspective.

356
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,040
 In the original faith of the Jews,

357
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,880
 the national anthem was of course Abraham and God's covenant.

358
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,400
 All the Israelites accepted the covenant on the eighth day.

359
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,200
 Of course, later it was introduced to Jeremiah.

360
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,240
 He said that we must also practice the covenant in our hearts.

361
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,560
 That is, we must experience God again.

362
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:14,000
 It is a metaphor to show a new form of covenant.

363
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,680
 But how to adhere to this on the social level?

364
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:20,800
 Everyone should know that Israel was a nation that was lost.

365
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:25,040
 For a while, Heliopus ruled the place of the Jews.

366
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:31,920
 One of the most cruel rulers in Heliopus was Antiochus.

367
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,600
 He had a commandment.

368
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,560
 All the herds that accepted the covenant

369
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:43,720
 and all the mothers that were given to these herds had to be killed.

370
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:48,120
 Because he wanted to completely control this nation in culture and society.

371
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,400
 So everyone can understand the reaction.

372
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,600
 It means to emphasize that we must continue to adhere to the covenant.

373
00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:00,200
 In fact, it is a very important identity mark.

374
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,240
 They are standing upright to carry out this covenant

375
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,880
 to show that they are the children of God.

376
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:14,680
 And later, it emphasizes the Leviticus and the end of the world.

377
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,880
 All of this is at the height of the New Testament.

378
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,880
 It means to look forward to the coming of Messiah.

379
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,520
 But the prelude to Messiah's coming

380
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,200
 is that the whole of Israel, the whole of the Holy Land

381
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,720
 will no longer have non-Jews who do not obey the covenant.

382
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,840
 It means that everyone must have this identity mark

383
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,720
 so that you can enter God's perspective.

384
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,760
 The coming of Messiah.

385
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,280
 So there is a very strong social background

386
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,360
 that affects why there are so many Jews

387
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,000
 who emphasize the need to obey the law and the covenant.

388
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,840
 Because they feel that everyone must return to the most traditional

389
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,440
 and authentic Judaism

390
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,960
 before the Savior of God descends.

391
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:02,520
 This is what we call the "new identity marker" in the New Testament.

392
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,560
 But the New Testament reminds us

393
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,600
 that Christ set us free

394
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,360
 to give us freedom.

395
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,760
 So we must stand firm.

396
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,600
 Do not be controlled by the demons of the Lord.

397
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,120
 I, Paul, remind everyone

398
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,520
 that if you accept the covenant,

399
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,880
 Christ will not be against you.

400
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,840
 The believers of the Galatians may have been

401
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,360
 disturbed by the Jewish party.

402
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,160
 They return to their original position,

403
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,640
 a crossroad,

404
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,960
 a place that needs to be diverged.

405
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,720
 Between Jesus, the way of Christ,

406
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,280
 and the way of the law,

407
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,880
 they are thinking whether they should go back

408
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,520
 to the path they never took.

409
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,120
 Why?

410
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,640
 Because they are eager to confirm

411
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,800
 that they have already obtained salvation

412
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,800
 through their own efforts.

413
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,680
 They seem to have forgotten

414
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,240
 that they have already obtained freedom by the covenant.

415
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,680
 This also involves the topic of identity recognition.

416
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,240
 What is interesting is that

417
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,280
 in the Roman society at that time,

418
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,560
 a group of foreign believers

419
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:12,600
 accepted the Christian faith that originated from Judaism.

420
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,920
 In terms of identity recognition,

421
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,080
 we can imagine how they are in a room.

422
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,960
 They are called "hypocrites."

423
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,320
 They want to go back to their original position,

424
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,520
 to do more

425
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,480
 to fight for their own identity recognition.

426
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,680
 This is understandable.

427
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,760
 In fact, it is not surprising

428
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,680
 that we need to find identity recognition

429
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,160
 in today's situation.

430
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,040
 Even if we are believers today,

431
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,040
 we have received the grace of Jesus Christ,

432
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:39,800
 but on the other hand,

433
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,040
 we want to use our own efforts

434
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,920
 to establish our identity.

435
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,120
 In the Church,

436
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,000
 in the perspective of Jesus Christ,

437
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,480
 I believe that through our own efforts,

438
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,320
 we can better control our lives,

439
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:59,040
 and we can be more delighted with God.

440
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,520
 We all have times when we are shaken.

441
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,160
 I am no exception.

442
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,400
 I came back to Hong Kong to work.

443
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,240
 I also had times when I was disillusioned with my work.

444
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:16,000
 I felt that my career was declining.

445
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,480
 In addition to my physical condition,

446
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,440
 I was stuck.

447
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,040
 I felt that I could not

448
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,400
 move forward in my career.

449
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,160
 At that time, I was wondering

450
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,840
 what would happen if I stayed in Singapore.

451
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,400
 What achievements would I have?

452
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,880
 What legacy would I leave behind?

453
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,720
 How would my life be different?

454
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,520
 Would it be better?

455
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,960
 Even my own personal belief,

456
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,480
 if I am in this situation today,

457
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,120
 in this physical condition,

458
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,440
 how can I continue to serve God?

459
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,600
 How can I continue to hold on?

460
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,320
 There are many reasons.

461
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,680
 At this time, I actually returned my focus

462
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,400
 to myself.

463
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,200
 What do I want to achieve?

464
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,840
 What do I want to do?

465
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,200
 More than the original God's indication to me

466
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,320
 that I have to do something,

467
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,160
 or even Jesus told me

468
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,560
 that I don't need to do anything,

469
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,280
 or that I don't need to be lazy.

470
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,240
 As followers of Jesus Christ,

471
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,480
 we should know clearly

472
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,360
 that we are being distinguished,

473
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,480
 being called.

474
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,200
 Jesus Christ also showed us

475
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,720
 that we should not retreat.

476
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,000
 We should not retreat to the path

477
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,760
 that we thought was safer.

478
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,800
 Paul has a legacy

479
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,560
 that I think can be our encouragement.

480
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,440
 Fast forward,

481
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,840
 after this encounter,

482
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,560
 Paul had another chance to catch Jerusalem.

483
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,800
 He had already completed three missionary journeys.

484
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,040
 He had to go to Jerusalem

485
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,680
 to report his missionary work.

486
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:00,080
 But he was arrested in Jerusalem.

487
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:05,360
 After that, he was interrogated at the Jewish Council in Jerusalem.

488
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,800
 It seemed that his service,

489
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,640
 even his life,

490
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,040
 would come to an end.

491
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:17,400
 Because he might face death.

492
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:23,080
 There, he protested against the Jewish Council.

493
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,520
 After the protest,

494
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,720
 something very special happened that night.

495
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,400
 That night, Jesus was by his side again.

496
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,320
 He said, "Don't worry."

497
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,720
 Jesus told Paul, "Don't worry.

498
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,840
 No matter how you testify for me in Jerusalem,

499
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:49,080
 you will certainly testify for me in Rome."

500
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,080
 It was amazing.

501
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,960
 Paul seemed to have lost his way.

502
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,760
 But Jesus helped him again,

503
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,080
 opened a new path.

504
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,840
 In an unexpected situation,

505
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,760
 Paul was arrested in Jerusalem.

506
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,520
 But because he appealed to Caesar,

507
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,920
 the court of justice in Rome,

508
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:16,320
 he was able to embark on a miraculous journey.

509
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,120
 He went through the Mediterranean storm

510
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,240
 and finally arrived in Rome.

511
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,480
 And because he arrived in Rome,

512
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,040
 he brought the gospel to Rome.

513
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,760
 In the three chapters,

514
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,240
 "Paul, Saul, and John"

515
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,960
 "On the Way Back to Jerusalem,"

516
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,360
 Jesus told him in detail.

517
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:39,400
 First, he told him about Jesus' plan in his life.

518
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,400
 Second, he told him to defend his faith

519
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,840
 and encourage the Galatians who were in turmoil

520
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,720
 not to go back on their way.

521
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,840
 Third, when Paul felt that he was going nowhere,

522
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,040
 Jesus comforted him,

523
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,800
 "I will still open a way for you."

524
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,560
 I hope this can be a source of encouragement

525
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,760
 for all the viewers.

526
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,760
 You have a special destiny.

527
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,080
 At some point in your life,

528
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,080
 God will reveal to you

529
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,200
 his plan in your life.

530
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,920
 We all know that sometimes

531
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,200
 we feel shaken.

532
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,560
 We want to go back.

533
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,160
 But Jesus reminds us

534
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,840
 that his grace is enough for us to use.

535
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,520
 Finally, when you really

536
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,520
 reach a certain point in your life,

537
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,280
 you feel like you are going nowhere,

538
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,240
 Jesus is willing to comfort you.

539
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,680
 He will open a way for you.

540
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,320
 I wish you all the best.

541
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,960
 I invite our worship team

542
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:39,360
 to respond to this message.

543
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,480
 I have chosen an old song

544
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,480
 but I think it can be an encouragement.

545
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,760
 "I have decided to follow Jesus,

546
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:55,320
 no turning back, no turning back."
