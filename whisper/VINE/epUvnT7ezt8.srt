1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
 Thank you, Benedict.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Why don't we put our hands together for Benedict?

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 (audience applauds)

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 Just want to say up front, just want to say thank you.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 Thank you for your love and support.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 I could feel that while I was sitting there.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Please continue to pray for us,

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 for this project, for our church,

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 as we are learning to serve and minister

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 to the younger generation in this city.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 What a coincidence that in the last couple of weeks,

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 our sermon series was centered on

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 a particular person in the Bible.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 And we're not just focusing on him.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 We're focusing on a very particular period of life in him.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 And that's 17 to right now,

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 we're coming to about 30 years of his age.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 We've been looking at the young adult

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 like timeline in his life, Joseph.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 And we're going to continue.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 When the Bible started describing him

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 or when his narrative started, he was 17 years old

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 in Genesis chapter 37.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 And now we're at chapter 41, and he's turning 30s.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 It's a little bit, you have to feedback.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 You have to lower the volume.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Thank you.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 I don't dare to talk right now.

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Okay, okay, much better.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Thank you.

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Can we put our hands together for Toby and the production team?

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Thank you so much.

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 You guys are my hero.

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 And so although this guy, Joseph,

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 he lived like a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away,

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 like not a galaxy, just another country far, far away

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 in a very different culture.

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 But we know that as we could see in the story,

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 there are challenges, there are struggles in his life,

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 just as like you and me in a young generation

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 in this city right now,

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 there are challenges and struggles in their life.

43
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 And so often we could see these kind of brokenness

44
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 or challenges or struggles.

45
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 They start to become part of who we are.

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 They start to shape our identity.

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 For example, there are people in everywhere, basically.

48
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 There are people who drink too much,

49
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 and we call them alcoholic.

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 We gave them a name,

51
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 and that starts to become their identity.

52
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 And people who maybe when they're in front of people,

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 they're so insecure that they have to say something

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 that is not true to protect themselves.

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 They have to tell a lie,

56
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 and we name these people liars.

57
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 We name them.

58
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 That becomes their identity.

59
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 So sometimes the brokenness and our struggles in life,

60
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 they do become part of who we are or part of our identity.

61
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 When I was 18 years old,

62
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 that's quite long ago now, okay.

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 When I was 18 years old,

64
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 I did my A-levels exam.

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 I remember the last subject,

66
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 the last exam I had to sit was the Chinese oral exams.

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Oh, I can see there are people

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 who went through the same thing as me.

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Good for you.

70
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 You don't have to review your age.

71
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 So in the Chinese oral exams and the A-levels,

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 there are two parts.

73
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 The first part,

74
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 I'll be given a particular topic on a slip of paper.

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 I've got 10 minutes to prepare,

76
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 and then I have to give a three-minute speech.

77
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Second part is a group discussion.

78
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 And the topic I received that day was this on the screen.

79
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 The best gift for my childhood self.

80
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 That's my topic.

81
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 So when my three-minute started,

82
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 this is how I began that speech.

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 If it were possible for me,

84
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 the best gift that I could ever receive

85
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 as a three-year-old kid or child would be my mother.

86
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 I could tell immediately the entire room,

87
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 all the audience,

88
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 their eyes were on me.

89
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 By the way, I mean, by audience,

90
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 I mean there were like two examiners there,

91
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 a male and a female.

92
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Both of them immediately looked at me.

93
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 And I started sharing a little bit about myself.

94
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 And thanks to my youth pastor,

95
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 who had a counseling background,

96
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 when we were teenagers,

97
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 every week at a youth group,

98
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 he would come and lead some sort of like

99
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 self-reflective exercise.

100
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 We talk about a life,

101
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 like what are the ups and downs,

102
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 and you have to draw a lifeline,

103
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 that sort of things.

104
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 So by the time when I turned 18,

105
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 I was okay.

106
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 I mean, I'm decently aware of who I am,

107
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 what I've been through,

108
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 and I'm decently like, okay,

109
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 I know what's going on in my life right now.

110
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 I know this and that happened,

111
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 and so now I'm like this or that.

112
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 So for three minutes,

113
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 I started unpacking my entire 18-year life

114
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 to these two examiners.

115
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 I told them how I lost my mother to cancer

116
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 at the age of three,

117
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 and how that impacted my life in different parts,

118
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 how there's been constantly a void,

119
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 a loneliness inside of me.

120
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 I've been always struggling with that,

121
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 and how I always wish my mother would be there with me

122
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 when I'm going through all the storms in life.

123
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 And so I could see there's a countdown timer,

124
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 and when it counts down to three, two, one,

125
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 I wrap up my speech with that sentence again,

126
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 if it were all possible.

127
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 For the three-year-old kid,

128
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 I would love to have my mom back.

129
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 And I could tell when the clock stops

130
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 or start like ringing,

131
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 I could see there's a drop of tear

132
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 in the female examiner's eyes,

133
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 and I'm like, wow.

134
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 That's the story I told people when I was 18 years old.

135
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 But that was also the story I told my counselor

136
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 when I was seated in her office on the chair

137
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 a couple years down the road.

138
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 If you were here for a while,

139
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 you probably have heard my story,

140
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 how I struggled in uni and in seminary.

141
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 I struggled a lot, actually.

142
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 I had a little bit of depressive symptoms,

143
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 and I was actively seeing a counselor back then.

144
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 I remember every time I sat in her office,

145
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 we would just talk about things in my life,

146
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 how I'm doing.

147
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 But then I felt I was always constantly

148
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 trying to connect all the things I'm going through,

149
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 all my troubles, all my problems,

150
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 to all the tragedy I had experienced when I was younger.

151
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 I had always been trying to connect

152
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 my current problems to my past circumstances.

153
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 I've been trying to say, yeah,

154
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 because I've been a three-year-old kid without my mom,

155
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 and so I grew up this way, I was super insecure,

156
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 and that's why I had this or that kind of problem.

157
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 And I felt like I've been trying to prove myself,

158
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 or I've been trying to convince her, my counselor,

159
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 that in everything that happened,

160
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 I'm just a victim here.

161
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 I don't know if you've ever felt that in you before,

162
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 that you have to try and explain yourself

163
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 to prove or to show people that you are indeed a victim.

164
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 I've been trying to tell myself, to show myself,

165
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 and to show my counselor,

166
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 I was trying to make her agree with me

167
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 so that she would acknowledge,

168
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 "Yes, Chapman, none of this is your fault.

169
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 "You're just a victim, you lost your mom when you were young,

170
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 "so that's why you're going through all this."

171
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 I was trying to convince her and convince myself that.

172
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 Because after a while, I realized

173
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 I was not the only one having this kind of urge

174
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 to show or prove that I'm a victim.

175
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 Psychologists, they actually research on this,

176
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 and they call this the victim mentality.

177
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 Victim mentality is a learned psychological response

178
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 rooted in this idea called learned helplessness,

179
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 where individuals feel trapped in cycles of perceived victimhood,

180
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 hindering their ability to move forward.

181
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 Rather than being an inherent personality trait,

182
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 it develops through specific experiences

183
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 and cognitive frameworks.

184
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 So we learn that in life, that we're a victim.

185
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 This mindset is characterized by a persistent belief

186
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 that one is powerless against negative circumstances,

187
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 attributing hardships to external forces

188
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 and seeing attempts to change as futile.

189
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 And so psychologists, they did a lot of research on this,

190
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 and they have identified three fundamental beliefs

191
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 that sustain victim mentality.

192
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 Let's go through them one by one.

193
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 The first one, bad things happen

194
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 and will continue to happen regardless of my actions.

195
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 Whatever I do, bad things will just keep happening.

196
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 I can't control that.

197
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 Or number two, other people or external circumstances

198
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 are to blame for someone's misfortune.

199
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 Or in my case, I lost my mom. I couldn't help.

200
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 I cannot control that. I couldn't have her back.

201
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 So I am who I am. This is the way I live.

202
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 And I'm traumatized. I can't do anything about it.

203
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 Or number three, any efforts to create change

204
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 will inevitably fail, making attempts pointless.

205
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 I try to change, but I'm always insecure.

206
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 I can't be more secure because I don't have a mom in my life.

207
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 What do you expect from me? I'm a victim here.

208
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 I'm a victim here. Yeah, I know I fail.

209
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 I know I flunk my exams, but you shouldn't blame me

210
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 because I'm the victim here.

211
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 That's what I went through when I was younger.

212
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 So it says here, "These beliefs trap people in cycles of helplessness,

213
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 making them see challenges as permanent and beyond their control,

214
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 hindering positive change."

215
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 That's why they are always stuck in their tragedies.

216
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 They are always stuck in their struggles.

217
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 For example, perhaps someone feels they're never appreciated by their boss,

218
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 no matter how hard they try,

219
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 no matter how many nights they spend in the office,

220
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 you know, OT, and they're stuck in the career.

221
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 But if you ask them, "Why don't you get another job?"

222
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 They'll say, "No, no, no, no, no.

223
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 I don't know if I can find another job that easy.

224
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 I don't know if I will ever have any boss that will like me."

225
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 They'll say no to you.

226
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 Or perhaps someone has been rejected or hurt in a relationship before,

227
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 and they decided to avoid starting another meaningful relationship,

228
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 not just romantic ones, even normal social relationships.

229
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 They start to hide themselves behind closed doors and say,

230
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 "I'm not convinced that anyone would want to be my friend.

231
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 I don't think anyone would like me.

232
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 I think I'm such a person that nobody would want to be my friend."

233
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 So these people, they're just stuck in that kind of victimhood.

234
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 And when we dive back into Joseph's story,

235
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 and we can see, "Hey man, this is a real victim here.

236
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 Come on. Think about his life.

237
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 He was betrayed by his own brothers,

238
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 suggesting to him that even those who were closest to him in his life,

239
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 even his flesh and blood, his own family, could betray him.

240
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 They could not be trusted.

241
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 And then he was sold into slavery.

242
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 He lost his freedom.

243
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 He lost his power to control over his life.

244
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 He's powerless over his own circumstances.

245
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 And he was falsely accused by the wife of his boss.

246
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 He didn't lie, despite his integrity.

247
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 That led to his unjust imprisonment.

248
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 And even in prison, he met this guy, his fellow cellmate,

249
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 and he thought, "Oh, this guy had a dream.

250
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 I know how to interpret dreams. It just so happened.

251
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 Let me interpret his dream."

252
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 And so he got restored. He got out of jail.

253
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 And I thought, "This guy is going to help me.

254
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 This is my ticket out of here."

255
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 And guess what?

256
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 That cup bearer forgot about him the moment he left the prison.

257
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 So at the beginning of chapter 41 of Genesis,

258
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 the author wrote these words,

259
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 "When two full years had passed."

260
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 When two full years had passed means nothing happened in two full years.

261
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 He was in jail, seated there for the wrong reason.

262
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 He didn't do anything, and he didn't get any help.

263
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 He was there stuck in the prison for two full years by himself.

264
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 Joseph could have asked himself this question like a million times,

265
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 at least a couple hundred times.

266
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 "I wonder if my friend, the cup bearer, is going to mention my name to Pharaoh today.

267
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 Oh yeah, today, he just went out for two days.

268
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 Maybe he haven't really seen Pharaoh yet. That's okay.

269
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 Oh, it's been a week now.

270
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Maybe he's busy. Maybe Pharaoh is busy.

271
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Oh, it's been a month. I wonder how that guy is doing.

272
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 And then it's two years.

273
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 Where has he been?

274
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 Has he forgotten about me?

275
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 No news, no visitors, just disappointment in his life.

276
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 If I put myself in his shoes, I would be thinking this.

277
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 First, I wouldn't be sure if I could--

278
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 I'm not even sure if there's any faith left inside of me,

279
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 faith in man and faith in God.

280
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 I think I would have become a very cynical person.

281
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 I might assume the worst in every single one around me.

282
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 I might think that God has abandoned me, so I might as well just do the same to him.

283
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 Or maybe I would just come to terms with a lesser version of God,

284
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 who may still love me, but he's totally incapable of helping me

285
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 or at least getting me out of the prison.

286
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 Or I'll just have to live with it.

287
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 That's okay. I'm a slave. I'm a prisoner.

288
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 Probably I'll be a slave or a prisoner for the rest of my life.

289
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 There's no help. God is--

290
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 He abandoned me, or he's not great enough.

291
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 This is called learned helplessness.

292
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 I'm not sure when we're facing difficulties, challenges in life,

293
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 do we ask these kind of questions.

294
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 A while ago, I was facing some challenges in my life,

295
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 and I recorded some of my thoughts in a notebook,

296
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 and I literally wrote these down.

297
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 I said, "Has my favor run out?"

298
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 Like, "Is God not favoring me anymore? Has my favor run out?"

299
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 "Does he not love me anymore? Does he not want me anymore?"

300
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 "Is he done with me?"

301
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 I have all these dark thoughts in me that I have to battle every day,

302
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 and these are some of the learned helplessness in our lives.

303
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 And these thoughts, they start to change us.

304
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 They start to shape our perspective.

305
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 They will make us see ourselves as a victim or a prisoner all the time.

306
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 We can see ourselves as victim of a dysfunctional family sometimes.

307
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 We can see ourselves as victims of a bad economy

308
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 because there's a trade war going on.

309
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 I'm suffering. I'm the collateral damage.

310
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 And sometimes we can see ourselves as prisoners to physical or emotional abuse,

311
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 and we are caught in a victimhood.

312
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 We're caught in being a victim.

313
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 And so this victim mentality, it is indeed a prison of the mind.

314
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 Let me say that again.

315
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 When we're stuck in these kind of dark thoughts, these victim mentality,

316
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 it becomes a prison for our mind.

317
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 While a physical prison may limit someone's movement or freedom externally,

318
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 this mentality or this victim mentality, it limits someone's internal freedom.

319
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 And we may be walking outside, but inside we felt we're not enough.

320
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 We felt I can't do anything with my life because I don't have what it takes anymore,

321
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 because I'm not good enough anymore, because nobody wants me anymore,

322
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 because I'm a victim, because this or that happened in my life before.

323
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 That's why I am not entitled to a full life anymore.

324
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 It becomes a prison internally.

325
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 And even if circumstances change, and they do change sometimes,

326
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 the victim mentality can keep a person locked in their past.

327
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 Oh yeah, that happened in the past, so I can't imagine there's a future.

328
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 Before I was diagnosed with ADHD, that's exactly how I felt.

329
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 I thought I felt so many times before, I can't foresee there's a future for me.

330
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 I can't see there's any chance of success for me in the future.

331
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 We're stuck in the past.

332
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 It prevents us from stepping into healing or purpose or any new opportunities.

333
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 So Genesis 41 showed us how Joseph was brought out of the physical prison.

334
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 Let's continue with that verse just now.

335
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 It says Pharaoh had a dream.

336
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 In fact, he had two dreams.

337
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 The first one, seven sleek and fat cows came up from Nile,

338
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 they were just eating, and then suddenly there were seven ugly cows came up,

339
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 and they just ate those seven cows.

340
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 First dream, done.

341
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 And second dream, oh, there is this seven healthy grain growing up,

342
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 and then there is this seven ugly, like, scorched grain heads growing up,

343
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 and they kind of like eat it.

344
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 I don't know how grain can eat grain, so.

345
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 I've been imagining this so many times, I still can't understand this dream,

346
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 but anyway, it's a dream, so just live with it.

347
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 So the two dreams are basically the same dream, but they are also two dreams.

348
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 And Pharaoh woke up, and he tried to ask his staff,

349
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 "Hey, can anyone tell me, hey, magicians, hey, you guys,

350
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 you study the stars or whatever, and can you tell me what is this about?"

351
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 Nobody could answer that.

352
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 And suddenly this guy was holding his cup.

353
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 Oh, I remember a guy from the prison.

354
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 He interpreted my dream.

355
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 Oh, my Lord, maybe he could interpret your dream as well.

356
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 And so now we see Joseph was brought out of the prison,

357
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 and he stood before Pharaoh.

358
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 Great for him.

359
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 He was physically taken out of the prison.

360
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 And, of course, Pharaoh asked him to do what he does best,

361
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 dream interpretation, right?

362
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 And so now we know that all those seven, like, fat cows or, like, the healthy grains,

363
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 it represents seven years of abundance that's coming,

364
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 and then the other seven means seven years of famine coming.

365
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 So this is just Joseph doing his thing.

366
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 But here I would like to describe it as what I would call a combo of gifts and talents.

367
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 Joseph didn't just interpret it supernaturally, the dreams of Pharaoh.

368
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 That's a supernatural gift.

369
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 But he also told him, "Hey, Pharaoh, you know, I got a game plan.

370
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 You just have to, you know, during that seven years of abundance,

371
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 you just have to store up everything, and during those seven years of famine,

372
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 we can take care of that.

373
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 This is the game plan.

374
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 Come on, you just need someone who is so smart, who is so mature, who is a mastermind."

375
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 And just so happened he himself is one.

376
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 We see a combo of gifts and talents, supernatural gifts and natural talent.

377
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 The supernatural gift of dream interpretation and his natural talent,

378
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 he's an administrative mastermind, which I'm definitely not one.

379
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 But I know there are a lot in our midst as well.

380
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 But so he was using his God-given gifts.

381
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 He knows dream interpretation that comes from God.

382
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 God provided this ability to him.

383
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 And even his administrative mastermind, that skill, it also comes from God.

384
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 God provided him with the necessary skills and talents for him to get out of prison.

385
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 So immediately he transitioned from prison to palace,

386
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 or he transitioned from being a forgotten prisoner rotting in his cell

387
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 to the second in command in the entire nation of Egypt.

388
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 Two years, two full years of waiting in prison,

389
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 yet it only took a two-minute speech, a two-minute dream interpretation to get him out of there.

390
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Like, "Wow, God, why don't you give him that dream earlier?

391
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 It just took two minutes and see, I'm out here. I'm good again."

392
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 But here's the thing.

393
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 Although the palace had always been God's purpose and plan for Joseph,

394
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 let me say that the palace has always been God's purpose and plan for Joseph since day one.

395
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 He couldn't see it. Joseph couldn't see the palace while he was in the prison.

396
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 How could he? How could he imagine there's a palace waiting for him

397
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 while he's rotting in his cell, forgotten, nobody remembered him.

398
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 He couldn't see that when he was in his slavery.

399
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 He definitely couldn't see that when his brothers dumped him in that pit.

400
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 We also can't see God's purpose and plans in our life all the time,

401
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 especially when we're in our struggles.

402
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 When we lose a job and couldn't find another one,

403
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 when we were dumped, I guess,

404
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 like your beloved boyfriend or girlfriend decided to break up with you,

405
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 or when there's a serious problem in your health, in your family,

406
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 financially you're struggling,

407
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 when we're in that prison, when we're in that pit,

408
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 there's no way we can imagine we could see the palace that God has prepared for us.

409
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 There's no way that we could see the purpose and the plans that God has for us.

410
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 If I'm honest with you, a lot of times, well not a lot of times, sometimes,

411
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 a decent amount of time, I do feel that.

412
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 Before this Uncharted project came into being,

413
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 for the last couple of months I've been wondering,

414
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 "What am I doing here, God? What am I doing with my life right now?"

415
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 There are times that we're just simply stuck in the prison,

416
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 and in the prison it's so hard to see what's out there for me,

417
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 what God has planned for me.

418
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 And we're like, "God, what am I doing here? Where are you?"

419
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 We're sitting ducked, like we're just stuck here.

420
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 "God, where are you? Where are you?"

421
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 But there's one thing today perhaps we could learn from Joseph.

422
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 When we cannot see God's purpose and plans for us,

423
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 at least we could still hold on to his presence and his provision.

424
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 Let me say that again.

425
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 Joseph, he didn't see God's plans and his purpose for him,

426
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 yet he was holding on to God's provision and God's presence in his life.

427
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 That's what we read in the last couple of chapters.

428
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 We saw that Joseph knew the presence of God was with him.

429
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 He treasured that presence, and he honored God even in Potiphar's house,

430
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 so that he rejected that temptation.

431
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 He's not doing it out of his fear or his respect for Potiphar, his boss.

432
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 He was doing it out of his respect for God.

433
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 He feared God, and he treasured that presence of God that he knew was in his life.

434
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 He wanted to continue to steward that presence.

435
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 And, you know, in his life, we could see that.

436
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 We could see that when he was in the prison,

437
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 and he was interpreting dreams and doing all that,

438
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 he knew he's using heavenly resources, his ability from God,

439
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 allowing him to do so, to interpret dreams.

440
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 He could say, "I cannot do this, but the interpretation of dreams is with God."

441
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 What we know is God providing him that ability to do that.

442
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 He was holding on to the presence of God.

443
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 He was holding on to the provision of God in his life,

444
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 even though he cannot see the purpose and the plans of God in his life.

445
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 But sometimes we give up too soon.

446
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 "Sorry, I'm stuck right now. I thought my career would be taking off.

447
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 I'm stuck here right now.

448
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 I totally cannot see what God is doing, what He has planned for me.

449
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 Maybe I should give up now. Maybe I should walk away from my faith right now."

450
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 Sometimes we give up too soon because we cannot see the purpose and the plans from God.

451
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 But Joseph here, he couldn't see that too.

452
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 He simply held on to God's presence and His provision.

453
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 He asked me, "How do you do that, Chapman?"

454
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 Let me tell you, it is by spiritual discipline,

455
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 which I've talked about a couple of months ago.

456
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 You see, if you don't have spiritual discipline,

457
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 you'll be happily worshipping God in good days.

458
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 And in bad days, you're like, "God, I hate you. You've forgotten about me.

459
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 I don't want you anymore."

460
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 Sometimes my daughters tell me that, and I don't do what they like.

461
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 So I know.

462
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 Spiritual discipline makes sure we stay there in the presence of God.

463
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 We come in front of Him and worship Him every day.

464
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 Like regardless, God, regardless what happens, I'm here to worship you.

465
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 I'm here to draw near into your presence.

466
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 I'm here to stay with you.

467
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 And indeed, it's in your spiritual discipline, it's where you encounter God.

468
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 And when you encounter God, your faith levels start to rise inside of you.

469
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 Sometimes when we're looking at our circumstances, we thought,

470
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 "Okay, maybe I'm not quite sure if God is here. I'm not quite sure God is with me."

471
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 And it's harder even to say God has a purpose for me or a plan for me in my life.

472
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 I know when I'm in good days and I'm getting a promotion,

473
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 when I'm in church, you know, "Oh, Enoch is leading a great worship time.

474
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 Yeah, maybe I can feel that."

475
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 But when my boss says, "Sorry, I'm letting you go."

476
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 When my partner is saying, "Sorry, we have to break up now."

477
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 You certainly don't see that or you certainly don't feel that,

478
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 that God has a purpose, that God has a plan for you right there, right then.

479
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 If it's up to our feelings, we probably would have run away from God.

480
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 But if it's up to our discipline, if we discipline ourselves,

481
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 no matter how hard it is, we come before God and say,

482
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 "God, I'm struggling with this, but I know your presence is still here,

483
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 and I just want to be in your presence."

484
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 Then we meet Him.

485
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 There our faith will start to rise.

486
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 Sometimes it's so hard in our circumstances to say that God has a plan for me.

487
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 I know we need to declare by faith.

488
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 I know that I've read everything about it in the Bible.

489
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 I know that we live by faith and not by sight.

490
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 But if you've been there like I did, you would know it's extremely difficult

491
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 when a circumstance happens in your life that, you know, I'm doomed.

492
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 It's so hard to believe that God still has something for me.

493
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 But if you cannot see God's plan and purpose for you,

494
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 why don't you just simply come into His presence?

495
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 Hold on to His presence.

496
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 Hold on to His provision in your life and allow Him to meet you there.

497
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 Allow Him to speak to you.

498
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 Allow Him to fill you with His Holy Spirit once again.

499
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 It's not when you have stored up enough faith,

500
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 you come to God and declare all those great things.

501
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 It's when you are empty inside.

502
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 You come before God in His presence and you feel,

503
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 "Oh, God, you are filling up that tank of faith again

504
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 because in worship I start to see who you are.

505
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 I start to see your majesty. I start to see your glory.

506
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 I start to feel your love once again.

507
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 Your joy starts to flow in me so I can have faith to declare that,

508
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 yes, I believe there is a plan.

509
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 There is a purpose from God for me, although I don't see it now,

510
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 but I totally believe it."

511
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 It's not the other way around.

512
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 It's not you try to buff up and say, "Yes, I believe."

513
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 No, it's when you're weak, you just simply come before God,

514
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 just as who you are, and you allow the Holy Spirit

515
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 to fill you with faith and love, and you can--

516
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 so that you are able to say those words once again.

517
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 If there's something I'm learning from Joseph, this is it.

518
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 There's so many times in my life I can't see God's purpose,

519
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 I can't see His plans, but I know His presence is still here.

520
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 I know He's still providing for me, and I'm just going to hold on to that.

521
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 God brought Joseph out of the physical prison

522
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 the day Pharaoh summoned him, but that was not the end.

523
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 God wanted to free him from that prison of the mind as well.

524
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 I'm going to read the last bit of chapter 41.

525
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 It says, "Before the years of the famine came,"

526
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 so during that seven years of abundance,

527
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 "two sons were born to Joseph.

528
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 The firstborn, Joseph named him Manasseh,

529
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 and said, 'It is because God has made me forget

530
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 all my trouble and all my father's household.'

531
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 The second son he named Ephraim, and said,

532
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 'It is because God has made me fruitful in the land of my suffering.'"

533
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 God healed Joseph, his wounds in his family,

534
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 by giving him another family, giving him his own family.

535
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 When his first son was born, he named him Forget.

536
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 Who would ever name their kid like that?

537
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 Hey, I'm having a kid. What do you want to name him?

538
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 Forget. Forget him, forget me, forget who?

539
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 Forget.

540
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 But this name Manasseh, it is really significant

541
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 because it describes not just what God had done externally

542
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 to remove him from the prison,

543
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 it also talks about what God is doing internally

544
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 in Joseph to set him free from his past.

545
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 It says, "God has made me forget all my trouble

546
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 and all my father's household."

547
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 You see, forgetting in the Bible,

548
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 it's not just talking about the absence of your memory

549
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 or your memory being erased that you can't remember anymore.

550
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 It actually talks about refocusing.

551
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 It talks about a shift in perspective.

552
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 It talks about a change in focus and a new way to interpret his past.

553
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 So forgetting, it doesn't mean those memories in the past

554
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 suffering was lost or erased. Not at all.

555
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 This word in the Bible or in the Hebrew,

556
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 it could also mean like neglect or like overlook.

557
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 Now he has a new focus. That doesn't matter anymore.

558
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 He's looking at something else.

559
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 He's fixing his eyes on something else.

560
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 And that's the things that God has laid before him.

561
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 You know, we might have been victimized

562
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 in certain circumstances in our lives,

563
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 but we're more than that.

564
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 I don't look at myself and call myself,

565
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 "Yeah, I'm that guy who lost his mom when I was three."

566
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 I just keep reminding myself, "I moved on from that.

567
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 Yes, that tragedy happened in my life,

568
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 but there's so much more in my life.

569
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 I have friends. I have a community.

570
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 I have a family here who loves me.

571
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 I have a family inside that room who loves me as well.

572
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 I'm loved. I'm filled with love.

573
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 God has put all these friends and people,

574
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 I would call family, around me.

575
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 I'm not just that boy who lost his mom,

576
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 who's crying, who is lonely.

577
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 I'm not that boy anymore.

578
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 There's something else God has done in my life.

579
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 I can move on. I can forget,

580
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 not forgetting the fact that my mom did pass,

581
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 but I'm refocusing myself in a new identity.

582
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 That doesn't have to be the only thing

583
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 that defines who I am anymore.

584
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 When Paul wrote this to the Philippians,

585
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 he said, "I should forget what is behind

586
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 so that I could strain forward to what is ahead."

587
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 Again, Paul was not talking about

588
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 whatever happened in the past.

589
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 "I can't remember anymore. Amnesia.

590
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 I don't remember what happened."

591
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 He's not talking about that.

592
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 All those things happened in the past,

593
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 it's still in his memory,

594
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 but now he's not focusing on that anymore.

595
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 He's not trying to base his identity

596
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 on his past achievements or past failures.

597
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 He said, "Now I have a new identity.

598
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 God has called me. Christ has called me.

599
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 I'm running this race. I'm straining forward."

600
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 This is exactly the same, what Joseph is doing here.

601
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 He said, "I'll forget my past.

602
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 I'll forget all those troubles.

603
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 Those troubles, they don't define me anymore.

604
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 I'm not a prisoner anymore.

605
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 I'm not a slave anymore.

606
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 I'm not the abandoned one anymore.

607
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 Now I'm a trustworthy leader.

608
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 Now I'm a father,

609
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 and I'm going to walk in my identity.

610
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 I'm going to walk in my new destiny."

611
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 That's what he's saying.

612
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 And perhaps, some of us,

613
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 we need to remove some of these,

614
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 or forget some of these labels in our lives,

615
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 some of these identities that we held on to.

616
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 Maybe it's time for us to have a new identity.

617
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 That's not the end.

618
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 The second son, he named him Ephraim,

619
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 and said, "God has made me fruitful

620
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 in the land of my suffering."

621
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 It's beautiful.

622
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 The story of Joseph reminded us

623
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 something very important here.

624
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 You see this word, "fruitful,"

625
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 the first time it appeared in the Bible,

626
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 it was Genesis 1, verse 28,

627
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 when God created Adam and Eve.

628
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 He blessed them and said,

629
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 "Be fruitful and multiply."

630
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 You know, being fruitful is the first ever blessing

631
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 that humanity received from God.

632
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 It was always in God's plan for you and me,

633
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 for the entire humanity,

634
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 to be fruitful.

635
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 But because of our rebellion,

636
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 because of our sin,

637
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 sin entered this world,

638
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 pain entered this world,

639
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 suffering entered this world,

640
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 death entered this world,

641
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 and this world had become a land of suffering.

642
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 And yet, Joseph is saying here,

643
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 "God has made me fruitful

644
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 in the land of my suffering."

645
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 You know what? Yes.

646
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 Because of our sin,

647
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 because of the sin of others in this world,

648
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 this is indeed a land of suffering,

649
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 but God has not given up blessing us.

650
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 He has not given up His purpose.

651
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 His purpose is to see us being fruitful in our lives.

652
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 That's why when Jesus came, He said,

653
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 "Yeah, the thief would come,

654
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 he would still kill and destroy,

655
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 but the Son of Man has come,

656
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 and I'm here to give you life,

657
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 and life to the fullness.

658
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 I'm here to give you a fruitful life.

659
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 I'm here to restore the first blessing,

660
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 the first command of God in your life,

661
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 so that you would have a fruitful life."

662
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 So whatever you faced in the past,

663
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 whatever you suffered in your memories,

664
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 that does not matter anymore,

665
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 because God is here to give you a new identity.

666
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 He is here to give you a new future.

667
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 There is a purpose in your life.

668
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 There is a plan in your life.

669
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 Maybe you and I don't see that right now,

670
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 but God says, "I'm here to bring restoration

671
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 to our broken life,"

672
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 so that He's determined God will make you and I

673
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 fruitful in the land of suffering.

674
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 Can I get an amen for that?

675
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 This world is still a land of suffering

676
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 to a certain extent,

677
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 but God said, "I'm determined to make you fruitful.

678
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 I'm determined to be with you,

679
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 to pour out my Spirit in your life.

680
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 I'm determined to bless you."

681
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 And so, if you feel you're in a land of suffering right now,

682
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 like Joseph,

683
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 my prayer for you is that

684
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 you too will be able to stand in front of God one day

685
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 and say, "God has made me fruitful

686
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 in my land of suffering."

687
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 There's something we can learn from Joseph today,

688
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 that we don't always see God's plans

689
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 and His purpose in our lives,

690
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 but if we stick to our spiritual discipline,

691
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 we can still hold on to His presence,

692
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 we can still hold on to His provision,

693
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 and we'll ultimately see that when we walk with God,

694
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 He is the one who makes us forget,

695
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 who makes us refocus, reorientate our mind

696
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 on the new identity that He wants to give us.

697
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 We don't have to be stuck in our past,

698
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 stuck in our trauma.

699
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 Our trauma never gets the final word in our lives.

700
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 He made us forget, you know,

701
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 leave it behind so that we can move forward,

702
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 and we'll finally see that even in the land of our suffering,

703
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 God is going to make us fruitful here.

704
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 This is the good news that we're here to bring

705
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 to Hong Kong, to the next generation,

706
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 to those around us.

707
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 Shall we pray?

708
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 Why don't we stand?

709
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 [Pause]

710
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 I just want to begin praying by saying that

711
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 God knows your pain today.

712
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 Whatever I've said in the last 30 minutes,

713
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 it doesn't mean your pain does not matter to God.

714
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 I'm not saying that.

715
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 It does.

716
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 God is still the God who would hold your tears.

717
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 He's still the one who put His arms around you.

718
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 But He's simply saying,

719
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 "I do not reject your pain, but at the same time,

720
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 I don't want to let your pain define who you are."

721
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 And that's why I'm here,

722
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 and that's what I want to do in your life today.

723
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 Maybe for some of us today, it's time to let go.

724
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 It's time to forget, to reorient,

725
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 reorientate our thoughts and our identity.

726
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 Maybe you're still holding on to something

727
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 that you've experienced in the past.

728
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 Maybe that becomes part of your identity.

729
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 That's how you think of yourself.

730
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 That's how sometimes other people think of you.

731
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 God says it's time to forget and move on,

732
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 to leave it behind.

733
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 If you're willing to let go, He's ready.

734
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 He's ready to do that in your life.

735
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 If you give Him permission,

736
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 He's ready to come and give you a heart surgery today

737
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 so that when you walk out of these doors,

738
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 you see yourself as a new person.

739
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 You see yourself with a new destiny.

740
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 You see yourself with a new identity.

741
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 And we're more than willing to pray with you today.

742
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 I feel some of us, we just need to--

743
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 if you've been asking the question, "God,

744
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 what's your purpose?

745
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 What's your plan in my life?"

746
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 I need to see that before I can trust you.

747
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 Can I gently invite you to give that up as well?

748
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 As a matter of fact,

749
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 we don't always see His plans and purposes for us,

750
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 sometimes only from hindsight, like Joseph.

751
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 Like he could say, "Oh, God brought me to Egypt

752
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 to preserve all of your lives."

753
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 He only knew it from hindsight,

754
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 not that he got a vision or calling

755
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 before he was taken to Egypt.

756
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 No, he didn't.

757
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 Sometimes you will only understand God's purpose

758
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 and plan in your life on hindsight.

759
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 You will only understand after it happened,

760
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 are you okay with that?

761
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 Maybe you're stuck because you want God to tell you,

762
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 lay out the entire plan,

763
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 give you a timeline before you can move forward.

764
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 I invite you today,

765
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 just lean into His presence.

766
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 And His presence allowed yourself

767
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 to gaze upon Him to know how mighty He is,

768
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 so that even when you don't know the entire plan,

769
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 you trust Him enough.

770
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 You don't just trust His plans,

771
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 you trust Him.

772
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 I pray for breakthrough in faith.

773
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 I pray for healing in hearts.

774
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 Come Holy Spirit,

775
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 we make room for you to do what only you can do

776
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 and to do what only you want to do in our hearts.

777
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,360
