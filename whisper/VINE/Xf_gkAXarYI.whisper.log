[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Well, it's the beginning of 2025.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   What I want to do is first, actually do a little review of 2024 because God has been
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   amazing.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.060]   He's been so faithful and so good to us.
[00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.160]   And then I'll have a word for us for 2025.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:24.200]   Now in 2024, we had our one year birthday celebration as a church.
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.200]   That was a big deal.
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.840]   So praise God for that.
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.480]   Yes, very, very subtle.
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.520]   We also established a lot of partnerships and collaborations.
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.760]   So we had YOM Shanti as one of our mission partners.
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.060]   We collaborated with Branches of Hope, which also works with refugees and asylum seekers,
[00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.880]   with Young Lives, which works with teen moms.
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:55.120]   We've partnered with Oasis Counseling and Psychotherapy Center and some of our parenting
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.560]   workshops and also through counseling.
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:04.900]   And then we also partnered with a Chinese primary YMCA school in Tinchoy Y, where several
[00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.240]   of our Cantonese brothers and sisters, they go twice a week teaching three different classes.
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.480]   And so these are ways that we've been getting involved in community and just serving and
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.720]   loving those around us.
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:26.440]   Now another thing that I'm really excited about is that we started a youth group in
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.600]   August 2024.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.480]   And so I already see some of the volunteers sitting here.
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.120]   They're amazing.
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.120]   And this year, or towards the end of the year, I also asked Francesca and Andrew to actually
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.000]   lead the youth group.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.920]   And so I'm really excited about what God's going to do in 2025 in the youth group.
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.560]   I already saw even just in the month or so that they led it, the energy.
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.840]   And so I'm excited about what's ahead.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.160]   I also want to ask you church to pray for them and pray for our youth ministry.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.480]   So we're really excited about what God is doing there.
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:06.640]   Then at the beginning of 2024, we shared every year we actually need to grow in giving to
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.080]   cover our expenses because one child is supporting us.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.360]   And so last year, we were responsible for 20% of our expenses, but we said we need to
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.520]   move towards 40% because guess what?
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.040]   Right now we need to cover 40% of our expenses.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.280]   And we were able to do that.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.000]   So praise God for his financial provision for us.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.920]   And thank you for your generosity and giving.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.440]   And then we've also experienced incredible growth as a church family.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.880]   We started off last year with 166 adults and 31 children.
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:46.840]   And in November, we were 251 adults on average between our two services and 61 children.
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.720]   So God also has done some incredible work there.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.680]   Yes, praise God.
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.800]   And then most importantly, and that's sometimes not that easy to capture is that people have
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.560]   come to faith.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.840]   People have grown in faith, have moved from anxiety and fear to faith and trust and have
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.440]   experienced the healing of Jesus through Alpha, through our Sunday services, through community
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.000]   groups, through in K4C our children have experienced as well.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   And so I just wanted to take the beginning of this year to actually start off with just
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.800]   giving God thanks and praising him for the work that he's done.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:33.440]   So praise God.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.800]   And I also want to say thank you to you because the way that God works is that he works through
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.140]   his church.
[00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.140]   He works through his people.
[00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.600]   And what it actually takes is that people are willing to offer up their time, their
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.480]   talents, their gifts to serve him both inside and outside the church to do his work, to
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.040]   partner in his mission.
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.400]   And you guys have done that.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.380]   And so thank you for faithfully serving as well.
[00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.800]   So incredible.
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.400]   And right now I'm excited to talk to you about 2025.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.480]   And so today we're kicking off a new sermon series that we've entitled Bold in Prayer.
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.440]   So at the beginning of the year, we want to come boldly before God in prayer.
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.320]   There's four different prayers we're going to look at from Old Testament, New Testament.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.520]   And I believe those four areas are areas where God wants to do some work in our heart at
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.320]   the beginning of the year to prepare us for what he has for us in 2025.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.160]   So I'm really excited about that.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.080]   Now we purposefully overlap that with the fasting season.
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.480]   And I really do want you to join us in that.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.960]   So do have a look, do decide on what you're going to fast and what personal things you're
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.400]   going to bring before God.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.600]   Because I believe that when we come to him in prayer, when we come to him in fasting,
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.600]   you got meets us.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.220]   You know, he works.
[00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:59.040]   And so she would come expectantly as a church, expecting him to move us into his purposes
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.520]   and his destiny and to provide for us what we need in 2025.
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.740]   So please do join us for that.
[00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.440]   But now I want to share with you the word that God has impressed on my heart for us
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.360]   here at the beginning of the year, which I think will be a theme that will run through
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.360]   all of the year.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.000]   And it started with me walking home from church.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.400]   I was walking home from church.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.480]   I came, I was just had just learned the song Holy forever.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.920]   I didn't know it before.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.480]   So I'm worshiping Holy forever found on Spotify and put it on repeat.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.520]   And off I went on my walk back home.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:42.200]   And so I came to a park and I suddenly sense God asking me to get on my knees and worship
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.200]   him.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.040]   I was like, why?
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.900]   There's like, there's like people walking here all over the place.
[00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.920]   Why should I get on my knees and worship you?
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.200]   What's what's it about this?
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.520]   And I didn't do it.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.680]   So I kept walking.
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:03.480]   And then I even had a stronger sense that God was asking me to get on my knees and to
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.660]   worship him.
[00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:13.600]   So I got on my knees, people walking past me and I worship God in the street until I
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.960]   felt a release is like, okay, I can get up now.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.000]   And as I was walking the remainder of time, I was just walking home.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.280]   I was like, what was that all about?
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.280]   Like why?
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.280]   Why did I need to get on my knees and worship God in this place?
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.200]   Is there something special about this park?
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.800]   Is it something about that Jesus doesn't want us to just focus or want me to focus on just
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.320]   doing stuff inside this building?
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.040]   But he's telling me he's at work out in the streets.
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.980]   Like what is it?
[00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:47.680]   So I was wondering and I'm just walking home.
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.680]   I was like, this is kind of bizarre.
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.840]   And by the way, this is not my normal experience.
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.520]   I don't constantly have these experience where I feel God speak to me to get down on my knees
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.120]   and worship him or something like that.
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:05.680]   Now I also sensed that God was asking me to take a group of people there to worship and
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.180]   to pray.
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.880]   Now I have to admit this also took me a very long time to do.
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.240]   But in December, fast forward to December, we finally went there.
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:20.520]   So I invited, I asked Matthias to help me organize it.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:26.760]   And so I went with Matthias and some of you and we went to this park and we worshiped
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:31.960]   God in Cantonese and of course with Holy Forever since that was the song where I felt led to
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:32.960]   worship.
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:33.960]   I want to show you something.
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.360]   I want to show you a photo.
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:43.440]   So as we were worshiping and singing Holy Forever, suddenly we had people singing with
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.400]   us and worshiping with us.
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.620]   And it was a group that was like 50 meters or a hundred meters away from us was a group
[00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:54.240]   of Filipino ladies that have their Bible study there.
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.320]   And so then we walked over like, let's do this again.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.320]   Let's do this the right way.
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.600]   So we worship God saying Holy Forever.
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:05.480]   And you know, there's something, there's something powerful of just like, I have never met these
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:12.120]   ladies before, but right away, you know, there's a bond between believers.
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.640]   And it was so beautiful.
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.660]   And I think we, all of us who went, and I see some of you here, you know, we were so
[00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.720]   encouraged by that.
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.480]   And then we prayed, we prayed for them.
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.480]   They prayed for us.
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.080]   We also went on a prayer walk.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:31.920]   And I, as we were leaving to go to another park to do some outreach, I, there was this
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.760]   guy that I had noticed.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:34.920]   He was sitting there the whole time.
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:36.760]   He's watching us.
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:41.120]   So I go to the, I decided, Jess, Matthias' wife had baked some cookies.
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.760]   So I brought him some cookies, gave him some cookies.
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.520]   I wanted to give him a flyer to come to church.
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.960]   He didn't want the flyer.
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.400]   So then I talked to him for like half an hour about God.
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.000]   And he's like, where is your God?
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Show me your God.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Introduce me to him.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.400]   I was like, oh, it's not that easy that, you know, so just, he wanted a physical introduction.
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:07.960]   And so as we're talking, he's telling me that he is in charge of this park.
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.720]   So what does that mean?
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.400]   You're in charge of this park.
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.000]   And so then he tells me more about what he does.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.160]   And I was like, ooh.
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:22.460]   So it's actually quite dark and it's illegal.
[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:26.640]   And so what we kept talking about God, and I wish I could tell you that at the end, you
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:31.320]   know, he gave his life to Jesus right there and then it hasn't happened yet.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.400]   But I didn't leave him with a challenge.
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.600]   I said, you know, you asked me to, where is your God?
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:44.320]   I tell you, if you pray, if you say Jesus, reveal yourself, show yourself to me, that
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.800]   Jesus will show himself to him.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.800]   And so that's what I left him with.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:59.200]   Now stepping back from all of this, after some reflection, I really sensed that this
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:04.040]   experience that God took me through was actually something where he wanted me, where he was
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:08.160]   speaking to me about something for all of us.
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:16.520]   And it's that this year God wants us to see the people around us with the eyes of Jesus.
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:24.840]   In 2025, he is sending us out, leading us out into our neighborhoods, into our workplace,
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.640]   into our families.
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:33.080]   And he's going to highlight people to us that he wants us to care for, that he wants us
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:40.920]   to love and serve, and that he wants us to share the gospel message with.
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.400]   But the question is, how do we get started?
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.920]   You know, we're here at the beginning of the year.
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:47.920]   What do we do?
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:59.160]   How can we be filled with the compassion of Jesus and moved to care for those around us
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.800]   and share the gospel message with those around us?
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:06.240]   You know, how can we make ourselves available to that and get actually going and not just
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.800]   talk about it?
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.520]   So that's what I want to explore with you today through this message.
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:15.720]   We're going to go to the gospel of Matthew, to chapter 9.
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:21.040]   The disciples, they've been, to give you a little bit of context, they've been watching
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:28.240]   Jesus teach, they've been observing him ministering to people, healing the sick, driving out demons,
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:31.480]   proclaiming the kingdom.
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.680]   And then at the end of chapter 9, the part we're going to look at, there's a transition
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:39.880]   that takes place that I believe is significant for us because I believe this is a transition
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:44.660]   that this year in God's timing, he wants to lead us through.
[00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:47.440]   And so let me read this passage to you.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.240]   Matthew 9, starting verse 35, it says this.
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:54.840]   Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:59.160]   the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness.
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:06.720]   When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them because they were harassed and helpless
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:10.440]   like sheep without a shepherd.
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:16.000]   Then he said to his disciples, the harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:25.280]   Ask the Lord of the harvest to send out his workers, therefore, into the harvest field.
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:30.440]   And Jesus called his 12 disciples to him and he gave them authority to drive out impure
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:35.600]   spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.200]   And then these are the names of the 12 apostles.
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:43.000]   First Simon, who's called Peter, and his brother Andrew, James, son of Zebedee, and his brother
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.480]   John, Philip, Bartholomew.
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.600]   That one I always have to look up how to say that one.
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:55.840]   Thomas and Matthew, the tax collector, James, son of Aphias, and Thaddeus, Simon the zealot,
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:59.000]   and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.560]   And these 12 Jesus sent out.
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:07.800]   So there's two things right up front that I think are significant for us as we want
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:13.720]   to open our lives to be filled, to be let out in the compassion of Jesus to those around
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.560]   us.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:22.200]   And that is that Jesus wants to give us eyes to see others with his eyes, with the eyes
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.840]   of Jesus.
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:31.200]   And to give us the heart of Jesus for those around us.
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.320]   So let me look at verse 36 with you.
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:40.560]   It says this, "When he," so Jesus, "saw the crowd, he had compassion on them, because
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:45.760]   they were harassed, they were helpless, like sheep without a shepherd."
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:51.200]   And Jesus, he uses a metaphor that was quite well known to his contemporaries.
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:55.760]   It was one that you find throughout the Bible of sheep and shepherd Israel.
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.080]   The people are the sheep, the shepherds are the leaders.
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:03.440]   And I want to take you to the key, one key passage that I believe is a background to
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.120]   what Jesus is observing here.
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.600]   And that's in Ezekiel, the prophet Ezekiel.
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:12.520]   He's been given a word that he then declares to Israel and to the leadership.
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.640]   And so let me take you to Ezekiel 34.
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.440]   We're starting in verse two.
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:22.960]   It says this, "Woe to you, shepherds of Israel, who only take care of yourselves.
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.240]   Should not shepherds take care of the flock?
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:31.640]   You eat the curds, close yourself with the wool, and slaughter the choice animals.
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.280]   But you do not take care of the flock.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:41.040]   You have not strengthened the weak or healed the sick or bound up the injured.
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:45.680]   You have not brought back the strays or searched for the lost.
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:49.520]   You have ruled over them harshly and brutally.
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:54.680]   So they were scattered because there was no shepherd.
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:59.520]   And when they were scattered, they became food for all the wild animals.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:04.760]   My sheep wandered all over the mountains and every high hill.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:11.200]   They scattered them over the whole earth, and no one searched or looked for them."
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.200]   Wow.
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:20.080]   You know, those are quite some strong words, but they really reveal the heart of God for
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.080]   us.
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:28.560]   You know, "You have not strengthened the weak or healed the sick or bound up the injured."
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:32.680]   You know, as a church, we're actually meant to pastor people.
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.960]   It's not just a pastor who pastors people.
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:39.400]   We're meant to pastor and shepherd people around us.
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:44.400]   It's actually the job of the church.
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:49.520]   The pastor, the wounded, the hurting, the sick, the lost.
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:55.720]   And Jesus is saying, when he observed the crowds, when he has gone through all the towns,
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.900]   that this is happening again.
[00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:07.000]   That people are harassed, they are helpless, they lack leadership, they're vulnerable,
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.600]   there is pain, there is suffering, there is lostness.
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:18.720]   And that's what Jesus sees when he looks on the crowd.
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:24.280]   I believe one thing that's significant for us is that there's also a spiritual seeing.
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:27.320]   It's not just seeing physically what's happening.
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:31.560]   Now, of course, that's also part of it, and that is also important.
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:36.560]   But Jesus also sees the spiritual condition that people are in.
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:43.960]   And he wants us to be people who see with those same eyes those around us.
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:49.040]   He wants to open our eyes this year, to awaken, to not just be...
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:55.000]   I've walked that stretch in Yulong a million times, not a million times, a lot of times,
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   be accurate.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.920]   But I never noticed the people in the park.
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:06.120]   And he wants to highlight people to us who are suffering, who are in pain, who are struggling,
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:09.720]   who are lost.
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:15.220]   That really is a start for the work that God wants to do in our hearts.
[00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.800]   He wants to give us eyes to see.
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.160]   That's the beginning point.
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:24.240]   And what we need to be open for that.
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:30.040]   So then also in verse 36, Jesus, we're told that he had compassion on them.
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:39.040]   It's that seeing that then moves to compassion.
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.120]   And having compassion is different than having pity.
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.840]   Pity is like, "Oh, I'm sorry for you."
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:45.720]   And you walk on.
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:51.440]   But having compassion means that you do not let you pass by what's going on.
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:57.320]   It means entering the suffering and the pain and the struggles of those around us.
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:02.000]   And it means getting involved and doing something about it.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.720]   That's what compassion is.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:09.320]   And Jesus allows himself to be filled with compassion.
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:14.340]   He doesn't let the struggles and the pain and the suffering of the people just pass
[00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:15.340]   him by.
[00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:30.200]   But he allows himself to be impacted by those who are hurting, those who are lost.
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.760]   So Jesus gets involved.
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:35.640]   And that's what you've been reading in the Gospel of Matthew in chapter, especially eight
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.040]   and nine, right before this.
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:42.000]   Jesus gets involved with people's physical pain, so he heals people.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.760]   Jesus gets involved with people's emotional pain.
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:51.680]   He takes away shame and just brings healing to that and restores people and gives them
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:54.800]   dignity where dignity has been lost.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:19:03.920]   Jesus gets involved with our spiritual lostness, restores lost sheep back to the sheepfold,
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:11.600]   meaning he brings lost people back to a relationship with the Father and restores them.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:18.160]   And I love in the Gospel of John, Jesus says, "I am the good shepherd, and the good shepherd
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.240]   lays down his life for the sheep."
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:29.240]   Now, I don't know a deeper way of getting involved than laying down your life, self-giving
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:37.240]   love so that people can be restored back to the Father.
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:44.640]   And he wants us, his people, to be people who practice the same self-giving love, who
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:52.480]   be people who are filled with compassion, with the heart of God, moved by love, to not
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.560]   step away from people's pain and problems, which a lot of times you don't want to get
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:56.560]   involved, let's be honest.
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:01.920]   It's like, "Oh, there's pain, let me go a different direction.
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.240]   I don't want to deal with whatever this person's going through.
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.120]   I don't want to get involved."
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:09.560]   And I'm not saying that we are meant to be involved in everyone, every single person's
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:14.520]   pain, but it will be people's pain and people who are struggling that Jesus wants you to
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.320]   be involved in.
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.560]   And so the question is, are we available for that?
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:22.600]   Are we willing to go there?
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:27.600]   So Jesus, he does not stay away from our problems and pain, but he draws near to us, and he
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.640]   wants us to be people who draw near to others.
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:35.640]   And I think this is important for some of us here this morning as well, because actually
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.080]   some of us are struggling.
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.860]   Some of us are in pain.
[00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:41.920]   Some of us are hurting.
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:50.120]   And you need to know today that Jesus sees you, that he's filled with compassion for
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:55.480]   what is going on, that he's not running away from you like maybe other people in your life
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:21:03.360]   have been doing, but that he is drawing near to you, that he has the power to help you,
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:07.000]   to meet you, to provide you, to get you through.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:13.200]   And I believe that some of us need to hear this here this morning that are struggling
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:17.880]   and that are hurting.
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:24.200]   And he wants us also to come around those who are hurting and struggling here.
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:29.600]   But Jesus also has compassion for the guy in the park who's doing things that are destroying
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:31.040]   people's lives.
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:35.320]   He's not contributing to flourishing a life, but Jesus has compassion for that person as
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:40.560]   well because he sees his spiritual lostness.
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:45.960]   And he wants that person to also be restored back to the Father for his life to be turned
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:51.480]   around, that instead of bringing people down and destroying people's lives, that this person
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:58.480]   becomes a person who builds people up, who contributes to the good, and who finds life
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:03.560]   in Jesus, forgiveness, and healing, and restoration.
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:12.640]   And I just wonder, are we a church who wants people like that to come into our service?
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:17.280]   I think that's a real question.
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:23.120]   But the heart of the Father longs for the lost sheep, for those that are hurting, those
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:29.320]   that are in pain, to be restored, and he wants us as people to be filled with compassion,
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:35.720]   to move out, and to express his love, his care, share his good news with those around
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:39.040]   us.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:46.440]   So who do you see being harassed and helpless?
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:56.560]   Who is the Spirit of God stirring compassion for in your heart?
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:06.600]   Who does Jesus want you to see and be filled with compassion for in 2025?
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:10.600]   Now I notice this is quite heavy, right, because there is a lot of needs.
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:11.600]   There's a lot of pain.
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:12.600]   There are a lot of people that are lost.
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.240]   There's a lot of people that are hurting.
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:16.840]   And it's really overwhelming.
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:22.240]   But I love that Jesus tells us right away what to do about that.
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:26.520]   And that we see in verse 37 through 38, so let's look at that.
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:31.820]   Jesus says there, "Then he said to the disciples, 'The harvest is plentiful, but the workers
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:32.820]   are few.
[00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:37.720]   Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out his workers into the harvest field.'"
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.400]   And I love this.
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:41.080]   Jesus acknowledges this.
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:42.520]   Yes, the harvest is plentiful.
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:48.080]   There are people with needs who are ready to step into the kingdom, but there's a problem
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:50.760]   that the workers are few.
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:58.160]   But in the face of these overwhelming challenges and this lack of resources and lack of workers,
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:03.800]   come and pray to the Lord of the harvest, who has the ability to send out workers into
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.280]   his harvest field.
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:13.880]   And it's prayer that propels us forward in a powerful way to the needs that we see around
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:14.880]   us.
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.600]   It's the move of the Holy Spirit.
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:22.800]   Now as a pastor, honestly, my heart is like, I wish I could force us all to go and do this.
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.800]   I can't.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:25.800]   And it wouldn't be good.
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:28.080]   It would actually be bad if I tried to do this.
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:33.760]   But it's the Spirit of God moving and stirring in our hearts, moving us into compassion,
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:42.520]   giving us eyes to see that sends us out into your workplaces, into your neighborhoods,
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:52.800]   into your families to care, to bring his love to bear, and to share the gospel message.
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:25:00.080]   Now what I find very significant is that besides the Lord's prayer, this is actually the only
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:06.080]   time where Jesus tells us specifically what to pray for.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:10.760]   I think this is super significant, that he really is giving his church a word on how
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:17.720]   to pray.
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:21.840]   And he's saying, don't get overwhelmed with the big harvest.
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:26.320]   Don't get overwhelmed with all the needs.
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:32.400]   Don't get overwhelmed with pastoring the people around you that God has put around you and
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.560]   has highlighted to you.
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:36.880]   Don't get overwhelmed by that.
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.480]   Remember who the Lord of the harvest is.
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.480]   He's the living God.
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:43.840]   He's the God of all resources, all power, all authority.
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:51.600]   And he will provide for his people what we need to do the work he's inviting us into.
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:53.880]   So don't get overwhelmed.
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:57.760]   And he has gone before, he's already at work in the harvest field.
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:02.840]   He's already out there in the streets and in the city and in your family and in your
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:03.840]   neighborhood.
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:04.840]   He's already working.
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:09.680]   He's already drawing people to himself.
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:18.160]   But he's waiting for us, his church, to go.
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:28.880]   So when we get overwhelmed with these needs, and they are huge, we need to start with prayer.
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:31.780]   We start with prayer.
[00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:33.380]   And Jesus works through prayer.
[00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:35.480]   He will provide through prayer.
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:41.240]   He will do a work in our hearts through prayer.
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:45.160]   And when his church prays, we are sent out into the city.
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.280]   But it's not just us.
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:49.120]   God will also raise up other workers.
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:51.720]   It's not just that we pray and then he sends us out of the church.
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:55.480]   When we pray for workers to be sent out of the harvest, he will raise up other workers
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.280]   that we don't even know about.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:04.520]   We have visions, we have dreams, we have plans to do kingdom work.
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.400]   But he mobilizes people through prayer.
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.720]   So we are called to pray.
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:16.080]   Now what I also find fascinating is that the Greek word that Jesus uses when he tells us
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:22.160]   to pray to send out workers, the word send out, ekballo, it's actually a very strong
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:23.280]   word.
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.200]   And here are some of the meanings for it.
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:29.720]   Send out, cast out, flung out, drive out, thrust out.
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:38.520]   It's actually the same word that is used for driving out a demon in scripture.
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:39.520]   Thrust out.
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:40.920]   Now why is that?
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:46.080]   Why is Jesus asking us to pray in such strong language?
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.240]   Well here's what I believe.
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:54.320]   I believe that Jesus is asking us to pray that workers are thrust out because we are
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:57.120]   comfortable in our routines.
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:59.880]   And we're living in our comfort zones.
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:06.360]   And we need the spirit of God, the light of fire for us to actually go out.
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:12.560]   To be thrust out, we need a kick in the rear end.
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:18.200]   And it happens through prayer, through Holy Spirit moving.
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:25.300]   And what's also fascinating with this, this whole part just fascinates me, is that you
[00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:29.240]   and I, we are Jesus's prayer requests.
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:31.040]   But what do I mean by that?
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:35.720]   Well Jesus does not ask us to pray in this instance for those who are hurting, who are
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:36.720]   out in the street.
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:39.200]   But he actually asks us to pray for the church.
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.920]   He asks us to pray for workers to be sent out.
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:44.760]   Have you ever thought about that?
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:46.920]   Like we're Jesus's prayer requests.
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:49.400]   We need prayer.
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:59.720]   Because we need to be thrust out into the harvest field.
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:01.440]   So we're the ones who are stuck in the comfort zone.
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.160]   We're the ones who know the gospel.
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:08.440]   We're the ones who know that Jesus changes lives.
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:14.440]   But we need the spirit of God to move us out into the city, into the workplaces, into the
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:27.720]   neighborhoods to share the love of Jesus with those around us.
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:32.480]   Now I know that some of you are sitting here, yeah but it's not me.
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:37.520]   You know you're talking about these other Christians that like know the Bible and stuff
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.020]   really well.
[00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:44.040]   You're talking about those who have their life in order, who are living very holy and
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:47.920]   pleasing to God lives.
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:56.040]   You're talking about the NGO workers or the missionaries or the pastors that do this stuff.
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:30:06.800]   Jesus when he says pray for workers, the word workers in Greek ergates, it means day laborer.
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:10.820]   It's not somebody with special skills.
[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:15.880]   It's not somebody with a PhD in biblical languages.
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:20.240]   It's just a day laborer.
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:25.400]   So the tasks that we're sent out to do, that doesn't require any special skills.
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:27.080]   We all can do the job.
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.600]   You all can do the job.
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:32.280]   We all know how to listen to people.
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:35.200]   We all know how to give people a hug.
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:40.400]   We all know how to invite somebody over for coffee or tea or whatever it is that you drink.
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:45.760]   We all know how to practically help people with the resources that God has given us.
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:51.760]   And we all know how to share about Jesus and the work that he's done in our lives.
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:56.880]   Now we might not say that in the most beautiful way, but you know how to talk about Jesus
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:00.280]   and the work he's done in your life.
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:04.760]   So the most important part is actually willingness and available.
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:08.200]   Are we willing to go out and to be used by God?
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.680]   Are we available to God?
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:13.160]   Now a lot of times we focus on the things we don't have.
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:14.920]   I don't have my perfect life left.
[00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.640]   I don't know the Bible perfectly.
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:18.280]   I don't have this.
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:26.280]   I don't have that, but we need to focus on what we have.
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:29.320]   You know, we know how to love.
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:31.440]   We know Jesus.
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:40.200]   We have a testimony and we're sent out by the Holy Spirit to do this work.
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:43.080]   And when God sends us, we can do it.
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:44.080]   And guess what?
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:45.720]   Actually a lot of times you learn on the job.
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:46.840]   You learn by going.
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:47.840]   So we need to go.
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:51.480]   We're invited to go.
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:57.120]   Now I want to invite the worship team to come up.
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:03.480]   Now in chapter 10, so moving on in the text, supposedly the disciples, they prayed this
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:06.240]   prayer for God to send out workers.
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:12.040]   And then they are the answer to this prayer because Jesus then sends them out to the lost
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:18.040]   sheep of Israel at this time and to do his work, his healing and restoring work.
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:24.560]   That's interesting there too because there's a transition that takes place in the disciples.
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:27.520]   So first they're referred to as disciples.
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:30.560]   Then suddenly they're referred to as apostles.
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:35.600]   Now apostle, the Greek word literally means sent out messenger.
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:40.720]   Suddenly they become the sent out ones who are sent out into the harvest field that is
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:44.080]   ripe.
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:48.920]   And so they went from bystanders and people observed Jesus, which was okay because that's
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:54.960]   what they needed to do at the beginning, to being participants and it was redeeming work
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.360]   and healing work.
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:33:04.880]   And I believe that God this year is calling us into this transition of going deeper into
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:10.680]   being participants in his work, in this neighborhood, in the city, in your family, in your workplace,
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:21.120]   where he wants to use you to share the gospel message, to bring God's love, to bear in practical
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:25.440]   ways to the people around you.
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:28.400]   But the question is, are we available?
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:36.720]   And do we care to see lives restored to Jesus?
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:41.160]   Do we care to see this guy restored in the park to Jesus?
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:43.760]   Do we care to see the coworker restored to Jesus?
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:50.320]   Do we care to see the mom who's maybe overwhelmed with all that's on her plate to restore it
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:34:00.720]   to Jesus and experiences love and his care from his people, from God's people?
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:14.320]   Now as I was thinking about this word and I was picturing and imagining the end of 2025,
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:15.320]   what do I see?
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:19.960]   What if we all would make ourselves available?
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:25.760]   What if we all pray this prayer and ask Jesus to send us out, to thrust us out into his
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:26.760]   vineyard?
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:31.480]   What if we actually start doing this work and respond when God highlights somebody,
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:38.040]   we start caring for them and serving them and sharing the good news with them.
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:45.960]   And I really believe that if we make ourselves available, that God will do immeasurably more
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:49.400]   than we can ask or imagine.
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:55.760]   That at the end of 2025, we'll have many people in this room, we have been touched by the
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:35:00.760]   love of Jesus.
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:06.760]   When we communicated about the church plan, one of the things we said right from the beginning
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:14.000]   is that it is our heart's desire that it is a regular occurrence that people are coming
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.720]   to know Jesus.
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:19.440]   I want to see that happening.
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:22.240]   That's my desire.
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:23.240]   I desire that.
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:24.800]   I long for that.
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:33.760]   I want to see people who are hopeless, who are hurting, find hope, find healing.
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:39.840]   But the question is, are we going to pray this prayer to ask the Lord of the harvest
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:44.040]   to send out his workers into the harvest field?
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:49.400]   And when he sends us, are we going to be willing to go and do this work?
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:55.120]   Now I actually want us to start off with praying this prayer.
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:56.920]   So start off this year with praying this prayer.
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:00.600]   And we actually pray what Jesus asked us to pray.
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:05.160]   So I want to invite you to turn to somebody around you to ask them, is it okay if I pray
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.160]   with you?
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:09.440]   Maybe somebody you know, maybe somebody you just met, maybe somebody you never met, but
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:11.760]   now you're going to talk to them.
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:16.880]   And you just ask them, hey, can we pray together for this, for Jesus to send out workers into
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.120]   the harvest field?
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:24.520]   And then while you're at it, I also want to encourage you, if you want to do this, just
[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:26.520]   say, Jesus, this is my heart's desire.
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:27.520]   I long for this.
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:28.520]   I'm available.
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:29.520]   Just express that.
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:32.760]   So we're going to take a few minutes to do that, and then I'll pray for us.
[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:34.760]   So let's turn to each other right now.
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:40.400]   Let's pray for each other, pray with each other, and then I'll bring us back.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:41.400]   So let's do this, church.
[00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:42.400]   Amen.
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:42.400]   Amen.
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:52.400]   Amen.
