1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,720
 - In your name, Jesus.

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,200
 - Amen.

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,040
 - Amen.

4
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,920
 When I was in university, my senior year of university,

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:14,760
 I had quite an amazing senior year.

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,600
 And it was a lot of spiritually quite rich experiences.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,200
 And one of them was, I started this conversation

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,720
 with a childhood friend.

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,480
 Now, he was not a Christian, but we were talking about faith

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,560
 and this was almost weekly.

11
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,200
 And he asked a lot of like challenging questions.

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,160
 This was, were not easy conversations,

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,060
 but they were very enriching.

14
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:42,160
 And it culminated with my friend coming to know Jesus,

15
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,560
 which was amazing.

16
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,120
 And actually he's a pastor here in Hong Kong as well.

17
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,620
 So I got my German buddy here.

18
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:53,800
 And so for me, my senior year was something

19
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,200
 where I grew in faith and it was just incredible.

20
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,560
 Then I graduated, I started a job with Sherman Williams,

21
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,380
 a paint and coating manufacturer distributor,

22
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:07,280
 one of the largest ones in the world.

23
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,680
 And at first things were going well.

24
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,360
 Then the company moved me from Central California.

25
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,300
 We had a lot of friends, I had a network.

26
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,720
 I went one year to high school there.

27
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,620
 They moved me to the California coast, to Monterey.

28
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,560
 And Monterey, if you don't know California,

29
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,040
 it's along the coast, it's a beautiful place.

30
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,400
 But for me, it actually turned out to be

31
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,080
 a really challenging time in my life

32
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,880
 where I made a lot of bad choices

33
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,840
 that I'm not very proud of.

34
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,040
 You could also say I was living in habitual sin

35
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,800
 and just brokenness.

36
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,800
 And so I went from this mountain peak experience

37
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,720
 my senior year in university,

38
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,560
 and this first year of working coming out of college,

39
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,560
 I found myself in this bottom pit in the valley.

40
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,460
 And I was not the person that I wanted to be.

41
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:04,280
 I knew this was not the life I wanna live,

42
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,380
 but I just was there and I was stuck there.

43
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,020
 And it was also not the life that God called me to live.

44
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:16,340
 And I wanted to change, I wanted things to change,

45
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,780
 but I didn't really know how or what to do.

46
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,000
 So what do you do when you find yourselves in those places,

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,560
 when you're not living the way

48
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,680
 that you know God is calling you to live,

49
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,000
 when you're not the person that you wanna be?

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,600
 You know, what do you do?

51
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,320
 Well, as you have been going through the series on Ephesians,

52
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,440
 God's word is quite clear,

53
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,240
 that especially in the chapters one through three,

54
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,800
 it talks about how Jesus is saving,

55
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,160
 healing work in our lives.

56
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,720
 You know, that we were dead in our sins,

57
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,040
 but that we have been made alive in Christ.

58
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,660
 And then last week, Pastor Andrew,

59
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:59,880
 he talked about that God was shaped a community,

60
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,880
 a church community, that it has become a maturing community

61
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,900
 where we can grow, where we can change,

62
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,800
 where our lives can be transformed,

63
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,180
 where we can attain to the full measure

64
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,800
 of the wholeness of Christ Jesus,

65
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,640
 that we can start reflecting his character.

66
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,880
 You know, and that is amazing news, if you think about it.

67
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,880
 Like, we can really change.

68
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,800
 We don't have to stay the same.

69
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:31,200
 Now, I think that some of us here,

70
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,480
 you know, maybe we have family history of,

71
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,720
 you know, whatever is broken, relationship, addiction,

72
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,360
 and maybe we find ourselves stuck in that as well.

73
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,040
 And perhaps we've bought into this lie

74
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,600
 that life cannot change.

75
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,160
 This is just the way it's going to be.

76
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:54,160
 And so what God's word says, and also the church community,

77
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,640
 and the testimonies of people says that you can change.

78
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,120
 And so here at Divine, we believe that Jesus has the power

79
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,680
 to transform and change your life.

80
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:13,200
 And one thing I love in Ephesians 2.10, it says this,

81
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,760
 for we are God's handiwork created in Christ Jesus

82
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,760
 to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us.

83
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,680
 So that means that when God looks at you,

84
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,220
 he sees all your potential.

85
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:36,200
 He sees all that you can be that he created you for,

86
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,880
 and his heart longs for that in your life to unfold.

87
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,620
 He desires to see that unfold in you.

88
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,160
 And so he can bring that about this transformation

89
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,520
 and change, so just really sense for the day

90
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,080
 that some of us, some of us maybe have gotten comfortable

91
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,520
 where we are, and today maybe the Holy Spirit

92
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,160
 is gonna bring some conviction

93
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,160
 and just calling us to something better.

94
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,760
 But for others of us, we've bought into the lie

95
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,680
 where we're like, you know, I don't know if I'll ever change.

96
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,200
 I tried, but nothing happened.

97
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,960
 And I believe that Jesus wants to say,

98
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,200
 I can bring true change in your life.

99
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,120
 You do not have to continue in this way.

100
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,220
 You know, I can bring wholeness,

101
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,160
 where there's brokenness, where there's pain.

102
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,000
 And so what I wanna do with you today in this message,

103
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,840
 I wanna explore a question with you,

104
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,520
 'cause we all have a choice.

105
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,020
 Do we remain in immaturity?

106
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,900
 You know, as Christians where we live ineffective lives,

107
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,520
 actually last week, Pastor Andrew said something

108
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,400
 quite powerful, he said this.

109
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,840
 He said, if the enemy can't keep you from being a Christian,

110
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,280
 then the next best thing for him to do

111
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,140
 is to keep you from being a mature and effective one.

112
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:03,560
 And so what I wanna look with you at today is,

113
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,160
 you know, how can we be a mature and effective Christian

114
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,840
 and continue the conversation

115
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,980
 that Pastor Andrew started last week?

116
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,000
 You know, how can we say yes

117
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,480
 to the Holy Spirit's transformed work in our lives?

118
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,980
 Now, what does that look like?

119
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:24,000
 How do we engage this change process

120
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,040
 where Jesus just wants to bring wholeness

121
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,900
 into your life, into our lives, into my life?

122
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,200
 Well, let me take you to Ephesians 4,

123
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,240
 we're starting with 17, it says this.

124
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,920
 So I tell you this and insist on it in the Lord,

125
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,860
 that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do

126
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,740
 in the futility of their thinking.

127
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,760
 They are darkened in their understanding

128
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,100
 and separated from the life of God

129
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,100
 because of ignorance that is in them

130
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,660
 due to the hardening of their hearts.

131
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,900
 Having lost all sensitivity,

132
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,460
 they have given themselves over to sensuality,

133
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,300
 so as to indulge in every kind of impurity

134
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,480
 and they are full of greed.

135
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,920
 That, however, is not the way of life you learned

136
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,920
 when you heard about Christ and were taught in him

137
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,040
 in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus.

138
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,760
 You were taught with regard to your former way of life

139
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,680
 to put off your old self,

140
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,720
 which was being corrupted by deceitful desires,

141
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,720
 to be made new in the attitude of your minds,

142
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,680
 and to put on the new self,

143
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,560
 created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.

144
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,280
 Now, this all starts out with Paul saying, "So."

145
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,300
 So all of this builds on what Paul has said before,

146
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,380
 and this is really important

147
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:52,180
 because in the first three chapters of Ephesians,

148
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,700
 Paul talks about the incredible saving work

149
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,460
 that Jesus has done.

150
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:02,460
 He talks about all the blessings that flow from Jesus.

151
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,820
 We're adopted, we're justified, we're made righteous,

152
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:09,180
 we're brought together as one family of God,

153
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,340
 and you create a new humanity

154
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,020
 where people from all walks of life

155
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,620
 become a spiritual family.

156
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:18,500
 And it's all these incredible things that Paul talks about

157
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,140
 because he wants Ephesians

158
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,540
 to understand their identity as Christians.

159
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,420
 They have a new identity,

160
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,300
 and they need to understand the love of Jesus

161
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,180
 before he moves into how to now live.

162
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,300
 Because how we live is always a response

163
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,820
 to the love and the work and the grace

164
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,460
 and the mercy of Jesus.

165
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,980
 So that's always a starting point.

166
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,900
 We have to keep that in mind

167
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,800
 as we go through the message today.

168
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,100
 So Paul is now telling the Gentile Christians

169
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,100
 that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do.

170
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,340
 Now, that's interesting.

171
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,460
 He's talking to Gentiles.

172
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,540
 He tells them you must no longer live as Gentiles do.

173
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,820
 So what does he mean by that?

174
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,340
 He doesn't want them to return to their old life,

175
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,060
 their old way of living,

176
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:05,740
 their old patterns of brokenness, of sinfulness.

177
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,620
 He wants them to make a clean cut

178
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,940
 and to live in a new way

179
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,740
 'cause Jesus has done something new in them.

180
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,380
 They are a new creation.

181
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,860
 They've been given a new identity,

182
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,660
 and he wants them to live out that new identity.

183
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:23,020
 So verse 17 through 19,

184
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,580
 it describes basically their life before they knew Jesus.

185
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,780
 And one of the main characteristics that Paul describes

186
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,420
 and is asking them not to return to

187
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,660
 is the futility of their thinking

188
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:40,300
 because he knows that futile thinking

189
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,260
 leads to futile living.

190
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,980
 Like how we think about something

191
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,500
 actually impacts how we live it out.

192
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,140
 And he doesn't want them to go back

193
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,540
 to their old ways of thinking.

194
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,900
 Now, the word futility, the Greek word,

195
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,740
 (speaking in foreign language)

196
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,140
 means three things.

197
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:59,300
 Futility, meaninglessness, and empty.

198
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,220
 And Paul does not want Ephesian Christians

199
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,580
 to go back to empty, meaningless ways.

200
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,620
 But if you think about the word futility,

201
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,380
 there's actually a lot of pain in that word

202
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,540
 'cause if you're striving, if you're trying,

203
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:18,020
 but you never are satisfied, you never arrive,

204
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:21,260
 man, that's tiring.

205
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:24,700
 It's not a fun journey.

206
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,660
 And so Paul's saying, why would you return to that,

207
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,060
 to this striving,

208
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,660
 where you're never truly satisfied?

209
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,180
 Maybe think, if I reach this achievement,

210
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,540
 then I'll be truly satisfied.

211
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,940
 So we chase after it, and then we have it,

212
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,780
 and there is some satisfaction in it,

213
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:48,100
 but then soon we want the next achievement

214
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,740
 because that one's not enough.

215
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,860
 Or maybe it's, we engage in,

216
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:58,140
 a relationship, we think that this relationship

217
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,140
 is gonna satisfy us,

218
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,860
 but then there's still, it doesn't fully satisfy us,

219
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,540
 and so then we go into the next relationship,

220
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,860
 and so on and on.

221
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,780
 So it's this empty chasing.

222
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:14,220
 And so Paul says, why would you return to that?

223
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,820
 Why would you go back to that?

224
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,980
 I've given you a new life.

225
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,660
 I've given you a new identity.

226
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,900
 So then in verse 19, Paul says that ultimately,

227
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,180
 this life, when we live in futility,

228
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,980
 and we go down that route,

229
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,820
 is a life that is a life where we're living

230
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,740
 in separation from God.

231
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,100
 It's a life apart from God.

232
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,660
 And again, why would you go back to that?

233
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:42,140
 Now for me, when I was in Monterey,

234
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:46,340
 I went into an environment where I didn't know anyone,

235
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,580
 and so I went back to my old life,

236
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,380
 to my old patterns, my old ways of living.

237
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,220
 And sometimes there is comfort in that,

238
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,260
 but it never truly satisfies,

239
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:59,340
 and so I went back to these patterns of brokenness,

240
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,500
 of selfishness, of sinfulness.

241
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,300
 And then for some of you, that might be that way as well,

242
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:08,140
 that you've become a Christian,

243
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,940
 you've been given this new identity,

244
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,900
 but for whatever reason,

245
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,340
 you've been going back to your old way of living,

246
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,420
 and you're also like, I was at that point,

247
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,020
 you're not who you want to be,

248
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,140
 and you know you're also not who God is calling you to be,

249
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,660
 who has created you to be,

250
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,660
 'cause you're a new creation,

251
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,220
 he has something good, something beautiful for you.

252
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:32,140
 Now, let's continue verse 20 and 21.

253
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:32,980
 So there it says,

254
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,900
 "That, however, is not the way of life you learned

255
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,620
 "when you heard about Christ,

256
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,140
 "and were taught in him accordance with the truth

257
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,860
 "that is in Jesus."

258
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,340
 So Paul and other leaders,

259
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,700
 they were teaching the new Ephesian Christians,

260
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,060
 they were teaching them what it means to follow Jesus,

261
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,980
 they were not teaching them a bunch of rules to observe,

262
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:58,540
 but it was centered around the person of Jesus,

263
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,500
 'cause our faith has to do

264
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,980
 with a personal relationship with Jesus,

265
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,700
 and so they were teaching them

266
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,380
 how to live in a relationship with Jesus,

267
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,820
 instead of going back to,

268
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,620
 like we're not in a relationship with Jesus.

269
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,420
 Now, this did involve the aspects,

270
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,780
 it talks about truth that is in Jesus,

271
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:24,020
 that does refer to his historical life,

272
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,140
 where he's fully human, fully divine,

273
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,180
 but he did his miracles, his ministry,

274
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,900
 he died, he rose,

275
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,740
 all those things we do need to learn about,

276
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:36,180
 but ultimately, Paul was saying,

277
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,060
 why, that's not what we taught you to go back to your old ways,

278
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,940
 we taught you to live in that relationship with Jesus.

279
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,780
 So that's what he's inviting them.

280
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,460
 Start relating again,

281
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,500
 start engaging that relationship again.

282
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,180
 I think that's perhaps something

283
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,100
 that God is saying to some of us today,

284
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,860
 start engaging again that relationship with Jesus.

285
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:02,460
 Don't go back to that old way, it doesn't make any sense.

286
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,860
 So the essence of the Christian life

287
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,820
 is not a rigid set of rules,

288
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:11,060
 but a vibrant, transformative relationship with Jesus.

289
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,220
 So as we grow closer to him,

290
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,060
 and seek to honor him in all we do,

291
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:19,700
 we'll discover the true freedom and purpose

292
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,380
 in found and walking with him.

293
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:27,780
 So that's Paul, he's like reminding them of their identity,

294
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,780
 he's reminding them, hey, this is what you learned,

295
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:32,620
 this is what we taught you, this way of life,

296
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,820
 now live this way of life,

297
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,740
 don't go back to the old way of life.

298
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:40,460
 But then he turns to, how do we put on the old self,

299
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,900
 the new self, and renew the attitude of our minds,

300
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,940
 so he turns to all of that,

301
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,620
 and that's really what I wanna focus on today,

302
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,820
 because I think that's really where this transformation,

303
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,980
 this change is found,

304
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,180
 where God's really telling us something.

305
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,100
 So let me read that, verse 22.

306
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,060
 "You were taught with regard to your former way of life

307
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,820
 "to put off your old self,

308
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,380
 "which was being corrupted by its deceitful desires,

309
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,180
 "to be made new in the attitude of your minds,

310
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:10,260
 "and to put on the new self created to be like God

311
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,860
 "in true righteousness and holiness."

312
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:19,580
 So Paul, in this, he's actually,

313
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,260
 I think, making a really important point,

314
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,140
 because he talks about putting off and putting on.

315
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:30,060
 What it points to is that even though we become Christians,

316
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,060
 there is still stuff in our lives

317
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,540
 that needs to be worked out.

318
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:40,020
 There are still things that are not fully there yet,

319
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,020
 there is still brokenness in our lives,

320
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,220
 there is still sin in our lives,

321
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,860
 and this is true for everyone.

322
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:50,780
 We're living in this already but not fully yet part.

323
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:54,540
 So this is what Paul is talking about,

324
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:58,300
 and the word, the theological word for that is sanctification.

325
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,700
 So what I wanna do is I wanna talk about that,

326
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,420
 but I wanna put it in a broader theological frame

327
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,460
 or conversation.

328
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:08,460
 The Bible talks about that we are saved,

329
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,380
 or we were saved, we are saved,

330
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,020
 we are being saved, and we will be saved.

331
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,980
 So like past, present, future.

332
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,540
 And so when it talks about you were saved,

333
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,020
 it's talking about justification.

334
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,500
 When it talks about we are being saved,

335
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,220
 it talks about sanctification.

336
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,700
 And when it talks about we will be saved,

337
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,660
 it talks about glorification.

338
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,900
 Now let me unpack those a little bit.

339
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:31,900
 So justification is what Ephesians chapter one through three

340
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,660
 covers a lot.

341
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,380
 It's like Jesus died for your sins,

342
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,460
 you were dead in your sins,

343
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:42,700
 you were made alive in Christ by grace through faith,

344
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,460
 and you are declared,

345
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:48,020
 you're justified, you're declared righteous.

346
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,500
 So there's like a legal metaphor

347
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,260
 that God has spoken this legal sentence over your life.

348
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:56,060
 When God now looks at you,

349
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:59,180
 he sees the righteousness of Jesus

350
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:03,860
 in place of your sinful self that he has forgiven you for.

351
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,380
 So that's justification.

352
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,820
 And let's move to glorification.

353
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,780
 Glorification is when Jesus,

354
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,180
 when Christ has completed his saving,

355
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,020
 his healing work in your life.

356
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:18,580
 You know, one day God's work with us will be completed,

357
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,700
 will be completely whole,

358
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,220
 there will be no more pain, no more tears.

359
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:26,540
 And so that's glorification.

360
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,100
 But then right now,

361
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:31,780
 most of us we're living in a sanctification space

362
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:35,060
 where we are more and more

363
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:38,620
 becoming who Jesus is calling us to be.

364
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:42,460
 We're not fully yet who we know we're meant to be,

365
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,300
 but God is not finished with us yet.

366
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,420
 He's not finished with you yet,

367
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,300
 and he's working things out.

368
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:52,820
 And sanctification is really about being made holy.

369
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:57,940
 It's about putting on the character of Christ

370
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:01,540
 that we reflect Christ's character more and more

371
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,820
 in all the spheres of our influence,

372
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,820
 you know, on all parts of our lives.

373
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,100
 That when people look at you,

374
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,340
 they can see a bit more and more Jesus in you

375
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:16,140
 because you can see your love, your grace,

376
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,180
 how you treat people.

377
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,260
 So that's what sanctification is about.

378
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:24,780
 And that's what this passage is really talking about.

379
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,540
 So let's unpack that a little bit.

380
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,300
 So first in verse 22 talks about,

381
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:33,620
 "You were taught with regard to your former way of life

382
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,620
 "to put off your old self."

383
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,740
 Now, putting off the old self

384
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:42,660
 can also be translated, put off the old humanity.

385
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:46,860
 Like we're, you know, we were saying earlier,

386
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:51,220
 death to death, you know, we died to being dead in our sin.

387
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,980
 We've been raised to new life.

388
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,740
 And so we're meant to keep putting that off.

389
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,540
 We don't always live in the victory that Jesus has won,

390
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,020
 but we're meant to put this off.

391
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,660
 Now, what does it mean to put off our old self?

392
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,660
 And what does that actually mean?

393
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:10,660
 Well, it's like turning away from our sinfulness,

394
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,700
 our brokenness.

395
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,620
 It's like coming to Jesus, say,

396
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:16,100
 "Jesus, this is what's going on in my life, help me.

397
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,420
 "I know I'm not who I wanna be.

398
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,740
 "I know I'm not who you want me to be,

399
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,460
 "but help me to be that person."

400
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,100
 It's also has to do with the word repentance

401
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,660
 where we turn from whatever we're doing

402
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,980
 that we know doesn't honor God and say,

403
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,020
 "Jesus, I don't wanna live this way anymore.

404
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,780
 "Forgive me, help me now from this point forward

405
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:40,580
 "to live by your grace, by your power, by your strength."

406
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:44,380
 That's what putting off our old self means.

407
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:47,220
 And it happens in that relationship with Jesus

408
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,300
 that Paul taught the Ephesians.

409
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,380
 You do that in a relationship.

410
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,620
 It happens with that intimacy of Jesus

411
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,300
 that we've been talking about.

412
00:19:55,300 --> 00:20:00,860
 But notice verse two also talks about the old self

413
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,340
 as being corrupted by deceitful desires.

414
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:07,660
 So it's a life that seems to be good and enjoyable,

415
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,980
 but really it leaves us empty-handed and broken.

416
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,860
 It's like false advertisement.

417
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,140
 You think you're getting something good,

418
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:20,420
 but you find yourself in shambles and more pain.

419
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:26,500
 And some of you may feel that way.

420
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,260
 Now, on the one hand, you're excited to be here.

421
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,140
 You're like, "Man, I love worship.

422
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,260
 "I love Jesus.

423
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,900
 "I love this community,

424
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,260
 "and it's so good always to be here."

425
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,660
 But then on the other hand,

426
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:42,620
 you're still stuck in patterns of the past.

427
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,300
 You've returned to part of your old life,

428
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,540
 and you're living in some of that brokenness.

429
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,940
 So what do we do?

430
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:54,100
 Well, this passage actually provides an answer,

431
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:57,020
 a solution for us, and I wanna continue to unpack that.

432
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,340
 That's also where we can address our question.

433
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:04,540
 So how do we say yes to the Holy Spirit's transforming

434
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,420
 and healing work in our lives?

435
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,820
 How do we say yes to that,

436
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,300
 that we can experience that change,

437
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,780
 that we can become more Christ-like,

438
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:17,180
 that we don't have to stay the same person?

439
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:21,580
 Maybe the ugliness that's in our heart or in our actions,

440
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,060
 maybe it's anger, whatever it may be,

441
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,460
 we don't have to stay there,

442
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:27,740
 and we can experience this transformation.

443
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,380
 So here it goes.

444
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:35,300
 While Christ has defeated sin on the cross,

445
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,180
 we don't always live in that victory.

446
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,860
 And so putting on and putting off

447
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,420
 is actually daily discipleship,

448
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:44,180
 it's daily relationship with Jesus.

449
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:47,420
 And so we've already talked about the putting off part,

450
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,820
 but then in between the putting off the old self

451
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,380
 and putting on a new self, there's another line,

452
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,260
 so I wanna look at that with you.

453
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,020
 It says that we,

454
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:58,460
 it says this, "To be made new in the attitudes of your mind."

455
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,300
 So God wants to do some renewing of our mind

456
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,100
 so that we're not stuck in the futility of our thinking.

457
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:09,060
 And the Greek verb, "To be made new,"

458
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,820
 it's in a passive voice,

459
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:16,820
 and what that means is that we're not the agents

460
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,900
 that make ourselves new.

461
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:23,460
 We do not renew ourselves,

462
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:27,620
 but God is the agent of renewal.

463
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:30,340
 And I think that's really important for us to know,

464
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,140
 that whether it's with justification,

465
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,900
 sanctification, glorification,

466
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:39,580
 it is always 100% the work of God in our lives.

467
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:42,100
 And He's the one that changes and renews us.

468
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,940
 It's His power, it's not us, it's not your effort.

469
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,780
 And I think sometimes we get stuck in our own efforts,

470
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,580
 where we try to make stuff happen out of our own

471
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,460
 and we fall short.

472
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,380
 But we need to learn to surrender

473
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,740
 and rely on the power of God

474
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:59,020
 to bring about this change,

475
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,460
 'cause He's the one who changes us.

476
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,220
 We don't do that ourselves.

477
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:05,060
 But we are given part in the process

478
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:08,540
 where we can say yes to the Holy Spirit's work,

479
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,900
 and that's the putting off and the putting on.

480
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,820
 Now what does putting on mean?

481
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,940
 A putting on, just very simply,

482
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:20,940
 means putting on the new self as obedience to Jesus.

483
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,380
 You know, that we do what Jesus says,

484
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:29,340
 that we do what the Holy Spirit is revealing to us.

485
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,020
 And we don't always feel like that at first,

486
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:35,380
 but that's what putting on the new self means.

487
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,420
 So God has given us this picture,

488
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:41,020
 and this actually comes from our daily putting on clothes

489
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,780
 and taking off clothes.

490
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,580
 Take off the dirty clothes, put on the fresh clothes.

491
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:50,020
 And that's what this imagery is about and comes from.

492
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,340
 And when we do that,

493
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,660
 we start reflecting more and more

494
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:59,100
 that the true righteousness and holiness

495
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,220
 that we've been created for,

496
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,260
 and we give God, we give the Holy Spirit

497
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:06,940
 a space in our lives to move and to transform us

498
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:10,940
 as we put off the old self and we put on the new self.

499
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,820
 And in that process, the Holy Spirit renews us

500
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:17,460
 and conforms our image more and more to Him.

501
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:21,420
 And that's how we say yes to the Holy Spirit's work.

502
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,620
 It's through daily putting off our old self

503
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,300
 and putting on the new self.

504
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,860
 Now, through the imagery of putting off the old self

505
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,700
 and putting on the new self,

506
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,500
 Paul is saying, become what you are.

507
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,100
 Live in line with your new identity

508
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,940
 that you have been given.

509
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:42,500
 You're children of God.

510
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,820
 Now reflect God, reflect your heavenly Father.

511
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:50,420
 That's your identity, your new identity.

512
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,100
 Now, you might again still wonder,

513
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,380
 like, well, what does that look like?

514
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:56,820
 So I wanna share a little bit with you.

515
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,460
 When I was in university,

516
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:03,700
 I struggled really with one person that I knew.

517
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,500
 Different personality, there was nothing wrong with him.

518
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,860
 Just different personality, personality clash.

519
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:13,700
 And there was a lot of judgment in my heart towards him.

520
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,340
 There was a lot of lack of grace.

521
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,420
 You know, as Christians, we've been shown grace,

522
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:22,100
 we've been shown grace by Jesus,

523
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,140
 but then sometimes we turn around,

524
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,580
 we don't show grace to other people.

525
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,780
 Well, that was what was happening.

526
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,740
 And I knew I had a bad attitude,

527
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:32,580
 a bad way of thinking and feeling about this other person.

528
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:35,660
 And it wasn't honoring God,

529
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,220
 and I was not the person I wanted to be.

530
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,340
 But at that point, I wasn't admitting that to myself yet.

531
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,380
 I hadn't gotten to that.

532
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:47,100
 So I received a package from my parents from Germany.

533
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,500
 It was around Christmas, a little bit before Christmas,

534
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,220
 it was amazing, German chocolate.

535
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,620
 And so he comes into the room,

536
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,660
 and I'm eating some chocolate,

537
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,740
 and he's like, "Ooh, I love chocolate."

538
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:02,300
 It's like, "German chocolate is my favorite chocolate."

539
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,060
 And I said, "Nein!

540
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:07,060
 Du kriegst keine Schokolade,

541
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,980
 you're not getting any chocolate."

542
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,420
 So I didn't say that.

543
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:14,060
 But I knew what he was asking for,

544
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,860
 but I pretended like I didn't understand.

545
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,820
 So I just kept eating my own chocolate.

546
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:21,060
 It was not very nice.

547
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:24,660
 Another occasion, I was trying to walk to class,

548
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:27,780
 and I was rushing to get there,

549
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,100
 and so he was blocking the hallway,

550
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,420
 and he's like, "You first gotta fight me

551
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,180
 if you wanna get past me."

552
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,540
 Now, he was saying this in a playful way.

553
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:37,220
 So this was not like he was not really trying to fight me.

554
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:40,460
 So he was just trying to relate to me and engage me.

555
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,580
 And he's like, "You first gotta fight me."

556
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,700
 And I was like, "I don't wanna fight you,

557
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,860
 I just actually wanna go to class."

558
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:48,300
 Again, this German anxiety about not being late.

559
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,780
 It's like the biggest sin in Germany is to be late.

560
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,580
 So I'm so anxious.

561
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,420
 And so I asked him several times,

562
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:59,540
 and he didn't understand that I was serious.

563
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:02,060
 And so I was like, I put him down on the ground,

564
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:05,780
 I was like, "I'm sorry, I really need to go to class."

565
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,340
 And so I went to class.

566
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,860
 So it was just some personality things

567
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,860
 where I was just really struggling with that relationship.

568
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,660
 Now, fast forward a year.

569
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:18,660
 I signed up for a Christian community group on campus.

570
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:21,300
 So I had no idea who I was gonna be placed with.

571
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,900
 So I show up to our first meeting,

572
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:26,100
 the leader had called me, I show up, guess who's there?

573
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:31,340
 I felt like quitting right there when I saw him.

574
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:34,060
 But then the Holy Spirit convicted me in my heart.

575
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:38,540
 I knew that my feeling and my attitudes

576
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,860
 towards him were not right,

577
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,940
 and I was not who I wanted to be.

578
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,740
 And it was not who God had called me to be.

579
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:48,380
 And so I knew that God was asking me to stay in this group,

580
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:51,140
 and that there was something I needed to learn,

581
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,140
 even though I didn't feel like it.

582
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:56,060
 But in this instance, I said yes.

583
00:27:56,060 --> 00:28:00,780
 So I ended up bringing my feelings, my thoughts,

584
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:04,540
 and prayer before Jesus, asked for patience,

585
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:07,500
 and grace over all of this.

586
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,940
 And I also did what God was asking me to do,

587
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,980
 which was go to those meetings.

588
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:17,100
 And so you see in this, there's the putting off.

589
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,820
 Like I was acknowledging my feelings that were not right,

590
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,500
 and I was asking Jesus, help me with this.

591
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,180
 I'm giving this to you.

592
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:27,380
 I know I'm not feeling, thinking about this the right way.

593
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,420
 And then there was the putting on,

594
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:32,460
 the actually doing what was right,

595
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:36,260
 to keep going, to be there, to listen.

596
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:40,020
 And this went on for two years.

597
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:43,260
 And I can truly say that after two years,

598
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,980
 like it wasn't a chore for me

599
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,700
 to go to this community group anymore.

600
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,220
 Like I loved the people there.

601
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,700
 I loved my brother.

602
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,660
 And my heart had genuinely changed.

603
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,140
 It was transformed.

604
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:59,900
 Now I could not do this out of my own strength,

605
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,820
 but it was the power of God working in my life,

606
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,180
 changing my heart and my attitude.

607
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:09,140
 Now, if I would listen to IG influencers,

608
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:13,580
 or YouTube influencers, they just tell you, do you.

609
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:16,700
 Now, if I would do me in this instance,

610
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,820
 I would not go through all of that stuff.

611
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:21,220
 I would not make myself do something

612
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,220
 I don't feel like doing.

613
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,180
 And so we have to remember,

614
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,700
 what does all of this flow out of?

615
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,660
 Well, it's because of the love and grace of Jesus

616
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,060
 that he has shown me.

617
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:34,220
 It's the work of the spirit of God in my life,

618
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,540
 and me just wanting to love Jesus back,

619
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:39,500
 and being the person that he has called me to be.

620
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,860
 That's where all of this always flows from.

621
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,380
 It always flows from there.

622
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:46,980
 And so I want to invite the worship team

623
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,060
 to come up right now.

624
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:55,660
 And I just want to invite you here today,

625
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:59,340
 as I have been sharing about putting off

626
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,980
 and putting on a new self, putting off our old self,

627
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,700
 like what things the Holy Spirit

628
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,620
 has been bringing to your mind?

629
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,340
 What he's been speaking to you about?

630
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:16,020
 And I just want to create some space right now

631
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:20,620
 where you can come yourself before Jesus,

632
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:23,100
 can respond to him in a way

633
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,260
 that he's inviting you to respond.

634
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:29,740
 And I don't want you to play down this moment.

635
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,980
 Like we sometimes, we treat things like this casually,

636
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,380
 yeah, whatever.

637
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:38,420
 No, Jesus has the power to change and transform your life.

638
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:43,060
 He has the power to change and transform your heart.

639
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:49,740
 I believe he wants to release some faith in us

640
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,620
 that he can do this work.

641
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,380
 So I have two questions up there

642
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,460
 to help us prayerfully reflect.

643
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,900
 What are some areas in your life

644
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,740
 where you need to put off your old self

645
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,020
 and put on your new self?

646
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:03,980
 And the second one is, what are the parts of your life

647
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:06,860
 we are longing for God's healing and transforming work?

648
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:12,540
 'Cause a lot of times where we're living in our old self,

649
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,940
 there's actually a lot of brokenness.

650
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:17,300
 We just want, we need God's love, we need God's healing.

651
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,340
 So I just want to invite you right now

652
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,900
 for a couple of minutes just to pray,

653
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:24,660
 to come respond to the Holy Spirit's leading,

654
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,940
 and then I'll pray over us.

655
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,780
 So let's do that right now.

656
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,340
 Let's take this time to pray.

657
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,940
 (gentle music)

658
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:48,300
 As we're praying, I'm reminded of the prodigal son

659
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,860
 in that parable in the Bible,

660
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:53,820
 where the prodigal son just returns to the father

661
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:57,020
 and he's expecting the father to scold him

662
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,500
 and tell him all sorts of things,

663
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,780
 but that's not what the father does.

664
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:04,180
 The father fully reinstates his son

665
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:06,380
 and putting a robe on him,

666
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:09,740
 just welcoming back in grace and mercy.

667
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:12,180
 So as we're coming right now, there was just a sense

668
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:15,300
 that God is just pouring out his grace and mercy.

669
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,660
 And as we're bringing the things,

670
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:20,300
 where we're not fully who we want to be,

671
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,220
 who God is calling us to be,

672
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,260
 and he's just pouring out his grace

673
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,740
 and mercy over us right now.

674
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,380
 We say, thank you, Jesus.

675
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:31,220
 I wanna invite everyone to stand.

676
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:42,460
 And if you long for this renewing,

677
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,380
 for this transforming work of Jesus in your life,

678
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,220
 just wanna invite you to stretch out your hands

679
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:50,700
 just as a sign of Jesus, I need you.

680
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,620
 I desire for you to work

681
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,420
 to make me reflect your character more.

682
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,580
 Let me pray over you.

683
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:03,940
 Jesus, you know all the words

684
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,860
 that were just spoken right now,

685
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,540
 all the things that were shared.

686
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:12,980
 Thank you for you that you meet us with grace and mercy

687
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:15,620
 and with your love and your kindness.

688
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,660
 That's what makes it safe to come to you.

689
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:22,220
 And Jesus, I pray for those of us here

690
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,620
 who've been struggling for a long time with something,

691
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,420
 or we've lost hope.

692
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:29,460
 Jesus, I pray for transformation.

693
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,580
 I pray that, you know, that sin,

694
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:36,660
 the power of sin is broken, that chains are broken,

695
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:41,260
 that you release people into a new and beautiful life

696
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:44,860
 that you have saved them and rescued and redeemed them for.

697
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:51,980
 I pray for your beautiful work of sanctification,

698
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:55,460
 of making us more holy, of making us more righteous,

699
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:59,460
 not because of what we're doing, but because of you.

700
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,620
 And so we bring all this to you,

701
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,980
 and I pray this in your name, Jesus,

702
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,420
 and all God's people say, amen.

703
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,020
 (gentle music)

704
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,600
 (gentle music)
