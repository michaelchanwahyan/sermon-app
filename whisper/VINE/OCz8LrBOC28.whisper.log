[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640]   For what you've done in us, we give you praise.
[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.840]   In Jesus' name, everyone says, Amen.
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:09.840]   Amen.
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.600]   Hey, can we thank our worship team as always, as always.
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.280]   Why don't you have a seat, have a seat.
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.280]   Brilliant.
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:46.200]   Well, we're excited to continue our sermon series, Blowing Water, which Pastor Ellis
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.120]   and I started last week, and this week we're looking at this idea of testimony and the
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.280]   testimonies that we hold.
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.760]   And I'm so excited because we have Pastor Jess with us today.
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.760]   Can we put our hands together as we welcome Pastor Jess?
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.760]   Yes.
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.680]   I'm going to pray for you.
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.720]   Let's stretch out our hands as we pray for Jess.
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.560]   Father, I thank you that so much of what Jess is about to share really is her own personal
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.840]   testimony.
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.320]   The passion that sits inside of her to share the good news of Jesus through Alfer and a
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.280]   number of other ways that she leads here at The Vine.
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.440]   And Father, you've done so much in her, and I know that through her you are doing so much.
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.040]   And Father, she opens up Scripture today.
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.240]   Lord, we now pray for ourselves.
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:38.080]   And Father, we are anxious in a good way to hear your word, to receive that little thing
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.320]   that you have for us today.
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.120]   And Lord, I believe that you want to speak personally to every person in this room, in
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:49.920]   the overflow, online right now, a personal word through what Jess is about to share.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.200]   So Lord, we just pray that our hearts would be fertile soil for what it is that you want
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.200]   to do.
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.520]   And we thank you so much for this.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.920]   In Jesus' name, everyone says.
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.920]   Amen.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.920]   Thank you, Pastor Andrew.
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.040]   Hi, everyone.
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.440]   My name is Jess, as Andrew said.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.760]   So one of the recurring conversations I have when I go about town, one of the "chui sui"
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.160]   things that happen as I go about Hong Kong is my Cantonese.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.840]   And sometimes when I'm just ordering something or buying something in a shop, and if someone,
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.320]   you know, is really friendly and I'm speaking in Chinese, they go, "Wow, your Cantonese
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.320]   is quite good."
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:35.200]   And if I'm in a good mood and I want to engage in conversation, I'll say, "I'm a proud
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.440]   Hong Konger."
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.440]   And then we continue to chat.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.560]   If I'm in a grumpy mood, which I confess maybe sometimes is more than me wanting to chat,
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.440]   I'll just offer them my life story on a plate because I know what's coming.
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.440]   They want to know why I speak Cantonese.
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:56.000]   I'll say, "I grew up here in Hong Kong.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.600]   I went to my mom's Hong Kong Chinese, my dad's English.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.240]   I went to a local school when I grew up."
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.680]   Now I've told you, so I don't have to tell, I have conversations with you again about
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.680]   that.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.000]   If I'm in a really, really don't want to engage in conversation, I just speak in English.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.440]   I can just not engage.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.000]   But that's not how we should have conversations.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   That's not what this sermon series is about.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.560]   Because conversations now, perhaps they're even more important during this period as
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:29.100]   we come out of COVID, a time that was defined by distancing, by isolation.
[00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.600]   So we're looking at some conversations that Jesus had in the Bible and how that can show
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.760]   us, teach us, mold us about some conversations that we can have.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.820]   And like Andrew said, my role here as a pastor is I have the privilege of overseeing community
[00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.640]   groups and Alpha.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.760]   And we just had another round of Alpha finish.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.080]   But before this round, we had Sharena come here and share her testimony.
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.400]   And her testimony was that she came as a lifelong Hindu.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.900]   She didn't believe in Jesus.
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.840]   And on the Alpha day, which was the day we look at the topic of the Holy Spirit, she
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.100]   gave her life to Christ.
[00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:12.920]   She subsequently received a miraculous healing from some back pain that still remains.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.340]   And after that day, after the Alpha day, I went home and I was just excited, thankful
[00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.460]   for all that God had done.
[00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:26.100]   I found myself saying to God, "God, I'm so grateful for what you did.
[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:32.020]   I'm so excited you did this in Sharena's life, but that's not enough.
[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.740]   I would like to see way more people come and experience your love."
[00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.380]   And he broke my heart for Hong Kong and I prayed, "I would love everyone in Hong Kong
[00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.500]   to see your love."
[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.460]   And I was like, "God, what are you talking about?"
[00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.660]   Like realizing this is not from me.
[00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:47.980]   I felt actually God was a bit cheeky.
[00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.500]   It's like, "This is not from me, but you're making me sound like this is from me.
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.940]   But this is a desire from God, I believe in."
[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.740]   I'm like, "I don't understand.
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.300]   What are you talking about?
[00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.780]   My remit is the vine.
[00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.660]   I'm a pastor of the vine.
[00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.540]   It's not Hong Kong.
[00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:02.540]   What are you saying?
[00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.340]   Are you asking me to go and work for Alpha Hong Kong?"
[00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.300]   And the answer is, "No, I'm not leaving.
[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:14.060]   You're stuck with me because I do believe my calling here is to you."
[00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:19.460]   And I believe actually what God was saying was something for all of us here.
[00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:27.100]   God is speaking to us about our call to be representatives of God's love outside of the
[00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.260]   four walls of this church.
[00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:36.580]   And so today we're going to look at a passage in John 4 that is about a woman that Jesus
[00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.380]   chats with.
[00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:44.820]   Jesus reveals who he is and she then go and tells others about her testimony.
[00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.300]   Now you might be a bit like me, sometimes sharing about our faith with people outside
[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:58.100]   of the church can be scary, but it also can be one of the most powerful ways we can have
[00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.740]   conversations.
[00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:06.340]   So looking at this scripture in John 4, up until this point in Jesus' ministry, he was
[00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:12.580]   ministering in Judea, but he left Judea to head back up to Galilee.
[00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:18.140]   And the most direct route goes through the middle, which is it goes through Samaria.
[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.140]   We've got a map there.
[00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.500]   It's the white route.
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.980]   And this would take three days on foot to get there.
[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.940]   And this appears to be the route that Jesus took.
[00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.980]   However, many devout Jews wouldn't take that route.
[00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.140]   They would take a longer route.
[00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:39.360]   They would take the red route or the green route because they wanted to avoid Samaria.
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.340]   And what happened then was that there was a lot of bitterness and hatred between them.
[00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:51.900]   And in the biblical context, in 702 BC, Samaria was invaded by Assyria.
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:58.500]   And a lot of the Jews were exiled, but those who stayed, many of them married Assyrians.
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.260]   And they created this new race.
[00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.640]   They were half Jewish, half Gentile.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.020]   And so the Jewish people called them half breeds.
[00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:13.940]   And it was particularly unpleasant or even disgusting because the Jews understood that
[00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:23.100]   God sent the Assyrians to conquer them because of their sin, because they sinned against
[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:24.180]   God.
[00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:30.980]   And because the people in Samaria adopted the ways of the Assyrians, there was just
[00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.180]   huge discrimination.
[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.780]   People looked down on them.
[00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:42.700]   So there was a lot of theological and historical reasons why the Jews didn't like the Samaritans.
[00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:48.220]   And by the time Jesus was on earth, this had been built up for a thousand years.
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:55.460]   And this is why John 4, 9 says, "Jews have no dealings with Samaria."
[00:07:55.460 --> 00:08:00.100]   But it appears that Jesus and his disciples didn't avoid the Samaritans.
[00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.680]   They went through Samaria.
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:07.940]   And by the time we come to John 4, this passage, we believe they'd been traveling on foot for
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:08.940]   six hours.
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:10.220]   It was noon.
[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:13.260]   Jesus was thirsty and tired.
[00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.220]   His disciples went into town to buy food.
[00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.940]   So Jesus was alone and he needed a break.
[00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:21.100]   So he sat by a well, and it's a famous well.
[00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:25.220]   It's Jacob's Well, which is fed by an underground spring.
[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:29.020]   It was a very reliable source of water.
[00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:35.860]   And so as Jesus was sitting down by himself by the well, this is what happens.
[00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:39.700]   A Samaritan woman came to draw water.
[00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:44.100]   And Jesus said to her, "Will you give me a drink?"
[00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:46.500]   Now this is radical for several reasons.
[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:51.060]   We've just heard that there's bad blood between the Jews and the Samaritans.
[00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.500]   They were not friends.
[00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:57.180]   But secondly, for a Jewish man to initiate a conversation with a woman alone was actually
[00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.660]   frowned upon.
[00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:04.380]   It was known that a man would go to a well if they wanted to look for a spouse.
[00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:09.380]   It was a bit like maybe a man trying to chat up a woman at a sleazy bar here.
[00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:13.980]   And then a Samaritan woman, we've just heard how Samaritans are considered unclean.
[00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:19.380]   The women are considered even more unclean because of blood.
[00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:24.660]   And they were considered so unclean that even the vessels that they've touched, if Jesus,
[00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:31.140]   if anyone drunk from it, they would be defiled and they would be unclean.
[00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:38.460]   So no surprise, the Samaritan woman responded to Jesus asking her for water, saying, "Really?
[00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.060]   You're asking me for water?
[00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:41.060]   Don't you?"
[00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:42.060]   This is not in Scripture.
[00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.100]   This is how I'd imagine she's saying, "Really?
[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.780]   How can you?
[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:50.540]   Don't you know there's bad blood that you look down upon us?"
[00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:54.380]   She doesn't know who this person is asking for water.
[00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:57.460]   And so let's take a deeper look at Scripture.
[00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:01.580]   The whole story is covered in John 4, which spans 42 verses, which we won't go through
[00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:05.500]   today, but I really encourage you to read through it this week.
[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:10.140]   So we'll pick it up in verse 10.
[00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:13.180]   So she's saying, "Why would you ask me for water?"
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:19.940]   And Jesus answered her, "If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink,
[00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:24.340]   you would have asked him and he would have given you living water.
[00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:28.860]   Anyone who drinks of this water, the water from the spring, will be thirsty again, but
[00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:32.180]   whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst.
[00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:38.220]   Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal
[00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.500]   life."
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:44.780]   The woman said to him, "Sir, give me this water so I won't be thirsty and have to keep
[00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.140]   coming here to draw water."
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:48.420]   She still doesn't quite get it.
[00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:50.260]   She's like saying, "Jesus, what are you talking about?
[00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:51.680]   Give me this water."
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:58.420]   And he then told her, seemingly not answering anything she just asked, "Go, call your husband
[00:10:58.420 --> 00:10:59.420]   and come back."
[00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.300]   And she says, "I have no husband."
[00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:06.540]   Jesus said to her, "You are right when you say you have no husband.
[00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:12.220]   The fact is you have had five husbands and the man you have now is not your husband.
[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:15.480]   What you have said is quite true."
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:20.060]   So we've seen all the reasons that Jesus might have not wanted to engage with her, but now
[00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:23.540]   we know even she's living an immoral life.
[00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:29.020]   She's living with a man who's not her husband and that is considered immoral.
[00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:36.460]   But Jesus reaches out to her, initiates the conversation with her, and then later even
[00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:44.180]   declares to her quite boldly, "Then Jesus declared," verse 26, "I, the one speaking
[00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:45.980]   to you, I am he.
[00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:47.500]   I am the Messiah."
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.740]   Jesus tells her who she is.
[00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:59.100]   So over a conversation, she starts to realize who Jesus is and so she immediately couldn't
[00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.900]   help and go back to her town.
[00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.100]   Her response was brilliant.
[00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:05.580]   She runs back to her town.
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:10.660]   She leaves her water jar and he says this, let's look at verse 28, "Then leaving the
[00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:17.220]   water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to people, 'Come, see a man who told
[00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.380]   me everything I ever did.
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.580]   Could this be the Messiah?'"
[00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:25.720]   They came out to the town and they made their way towards town.
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:32.300]   Many Samaritans from that town believed in him, believed in Jesus because of the woman's
[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:36.260]   testimony, "He told me everything.
[00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.700]   He told me everything I ever did."
[00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.340]   Everyone from her town came out because of what she said.
[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.700]   And again, this is not in scripture.
[00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:45.820]   This is what I imagine she would say.
[00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:49.380]   She would, "Do you know, I just went about today about my normal routine.
[00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:50.580]   I was just going to get water.
[00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:54.860]   It was in the middle of the day and this Jewish man, this Jewish man was by himself and he
[00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:56.460]   started a conversation with me.
[00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:58.540]   Doesn't he know we shouldn't be talking alone?
[00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:03.620]   And he asked me for water and then he knew everything about my life and I think he is
[00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:04.680]   the Christ.
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:05.680]   Come and see him."
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.060]   That's what I think her testimony would have been.
[00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:14.940]   And she immediately shares that with her people because she's so excited.
[00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:20.720]   But it says that they came out to the town and they made their way to meet him.
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:26.300]   But it says that many of the Samaritans believed because of her testimony, because of what
[00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:27.420]   she said.
[00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:30.940]   So testimonies are powerful.
[00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:33.940]   So why are they powerful?
[00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:35.900]   What is a testimony really?
[00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:41.300]   A testimony here means to bear witness, to give evidence, to testify.
[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:44.500]   And witness is one of the key themes in scripture.
[00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:49.700]   And in fact, in ancient Israel in the early church, it carried a kind of forensic sense.
[00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:53.880]   It meant that it was someone who has seen the truth or heard the truth.
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:59.940]   They can testify to the truth in a court of law and they can declare what they've seen
[00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:04.900]   or what they've heard and give evidence to what they've experienced.
[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:10.180]   And witness throughout the Bible can certify facts and it's often related.
[00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:14.820]   It talks about how the church of God, the people of God bear witness.
[00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:18.560]   They can give witness to who God is.
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:27.380]   And witness is so important in John's gospel that it talks about seven ways that we can
[00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:29.100]   testify to who Jesus is.
[00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:32.280]   So seven ways that testify, yeah, who Jesus is.
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.040]   And the first is the Father.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:41.760]   The Father, it says in John 5, 37, "The Father who sent me, sent Jesus, he has testified
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:43.260]   concerning me."
[00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.640]   Jesus himself testifies who he is.
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:46.800]   We just heard that.
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.380]   He declared that to the Samaritan woman.
[00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:50.920]   The Holy Spirit.
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:55.540]   It says that the spirit of truth goes out from the Father.
[00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.960]   He will testify about me.
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:00.720]   The works of Jesus tell of who Jesus is.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.600]   The miracles, the power that he carries.
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.640]   Scripture reveals Jesus.
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:09.200]   John the Baptist reveals and testifies to who Jesus is.
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:13.560]   And last but not least, it's our human witness.
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:20.760]   Our testimony is one of the things that the gospel of John tells us speaks to and can
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:23.080]   certify who Jesus is.
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:26.020]   It speaks to his power.
[00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:28.560]   So why is this so powerful?
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:33.280]   The amazing thing is everyone in here has a testimony.
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:40.680]   Everyone in here who has encountered Jesus has a unique story that they can share.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:45.840]   And your unique story is about your details of how you experienced Jesus.
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.680]   How did you meet him?
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.640]   What are the amazing things that he's done for you?
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:56.640]   In a way, it showcases what you've personally seen.
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:03.960]   And it really is you sharing your witness and how God is personal to you, how you met
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.720]   God.
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:09.600]   So a testimony is personal and subjective.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:10.600]   It's your story.
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:14.120]   In a way, it's your love story with God.
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:19.840]   It's how you encountered the spirit of truth and how this truth took root in you.
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:25.840]   And so you are sharing this with joy with other people.
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.000]   A testimony is not a sermon.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.440]   It's not a theology lesson.
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.640]   It's not a Bible study.
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:33.920]   And it's not preachy.
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.360]   It's light.
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.980]   We share it, hopefully, without obligation.
[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:43.040]   We share it because we're so joyous of what Jesus has done in our lives.
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.040]   And we share it.
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:52.040]   And when we do, a testimony makes way for others to come and see who Jesus is.
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:17:01.120]   So it opens up an opportunity for other people to witness, to experience what you have experienced.
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.780]   So it's hugely powerful.
[00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:07.440]   And it's not without theological cause either.
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:15.360]   Because 1 Timothy 2.4 says God's heart is that he wants all people to be saved and to
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:19.260]   come into a knowledge of the truth.
[00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:28.280]   And so not only is God's heart that everyone wants to hear his truth, none of us, we've
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:31.960]   already heard, we all have a unique story.
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:37.000]   None of us is disqualified from sharing our testimony.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.960]   None of us have a boring testimony or an unimportant testimony.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:47.080]   All our testimonies are important.
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:54.580]   And actually 1 Peter 3.15 tells us to prepare our testimony.
[00:17:54.580 --> 00:18:01.520]   It says, "Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.800]   for the hope that you have."
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:11.920]   So if someone asks you, that's a brilliant way to share why you have a hope in Jesus.
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.760]   Why do you love Jesus?
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:20.440]   And so I really want to encourage you this week to take time to think of your testimony.
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:23.220]   Just now when we prayed, maybe something already came to mind.
[00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:29.320]   But to take time to craft your testimony so you can share it.
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:30.840]   And I love practical tips.
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.720]   So I love to give you a bit of a practical tip.
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.940]   You know, how do we put together a testimony?
[00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:39.100]   And it really consists of three simple parts.
[00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:44.840]   The before, the during, which is really the what and the how, and after.
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:50.220]   So the before, a testimony doesn't just have to be about how you came to faith.
[00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:54.000]   Although if that is your testimony, do you share what was life like before you came to
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   Christ?
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.480]   But for those of us who have been Christians, who have been walking in a relationship with
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:04.100]   Jesus for a while, it could be something recent that Jesus did for you.
[00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:10.220]   A prayer that you've been praying, a prayer that Jesus answered, a need that you had that
[00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:19.220]   Jesus came through for you, that caused you maybe to realise to a greater level the intimacy,
[00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:23.780]   the deepness of God's love for you.
[00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:26.140]   So it could be how you came to faith.
[00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:28.640]   It could be a recent testimony.
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.020]   And then so that could be the before.
[00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:31.600]   And then you just share what happened.
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:32.840]   What were you praying for?
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.720]   Or how did you came to faith?
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.480]   And then the after.
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.480]   How did your relationship with Jesus grow?
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:42.200]   Or what differences Jesus made to your life?
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.200]   That's it.
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.200]   That's a testimony.
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.760]   Before, during, after.
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:46.800]   Simple, yeah?
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.560]   We can all do it.
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:54.880]   And so your testimony, it will be personal, personal to you, your unique story.
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.760]   It's honest and it's true.
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.620]   It's true to what happened.
[00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:01.200]   It doesn't downplay anything.
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:06.080]   It doesn't exaggerate anything, but it speaks to the truth.
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.800]   Like I said, there's no bad testimony.
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:09.800]   There's no boring testimony.
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:15.540]   And we are all called to be prepared to share our testimony.
[00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:18.980]   Like I said, Alpha here just finished.
[00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:21.520]   And we know you love hearing the testimonies.
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:27.760]   So right now, we'd love to invite two people who were involved in the last Alpha to share
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:28.760]   their testimony.
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:29.760]   Should we do that?
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:30.760]   Yeah.
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:31.760]   So let's first invite Eric.
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:32.760]   Eric, come join us.
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:33.760]   Hi, Eric.
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:34.760]   Hi.
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:35.760]   Hi.
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:36.760]   Just have a chat.
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:37.760]   Sorry.
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:42.440]   So Eric here used to work here.
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:43.720]   Many of you might recognize him.
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:48.640]   He used to be part of the team that takes care of this building, this facilities.
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:51.880]   He was part of our facilities team.
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.400]   But recently you just left, which is sad.
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:21:00.600]   But tell us, before you came to the Vine, were you a Christian?
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:05.320]   And so how did you come to join us on Alpha?
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:08.320]   Because I work the night shifts.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:14.960]   I worked during the last menacos when Pastor Andrew preached on Genesis.
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:20.080]   When I heard it, I want to understand who Jesus is.
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:27.760]   It is a special chance that I was invited by Karen to join Alpha.
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:34.400]   This was an opportunity to join Alpha, and I don't know why I say yes.
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.000]   So I joined Alpha.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   And then what happened on Alpha?
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:45.760]   On week three of Alpha, the Alpha talk was, "Why did Jesus die?"
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:51.400]   It mentioned about some planes we carry inside.
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:56.800]   I have carried the plane since my mother passed away.
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:00.080]   I haven't been able to let the pain go.
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:10.120]   I was busy working at that time and overlooked many signs of my mother getting worse body condition.
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:17.720]   A series four accident happened that injured her brain, causing her death.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:25.520]   I felt so guilty for not paying close attention to her body.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:31.000]   And I thought I was responsible for her death.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.520]   I have been carrying this guilt for six years.
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:41.800]   During Alpha, I heard Jesus took away my sins.
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:48.280]   I don't know whether I sinned against my mother when she had her fall.
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:50.640]   I hope Jesus can forgive me.
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:53.560]   I believe He forgives me.
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:58.480]   But I'm still trying to forgive myself.
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:05.160]   I shared this to my group, and my group leader asked me, "Would you follow Jesus?"
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:07.160]   So what did you say?
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:17.480]   Yes, I said yes.
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:21.280]   I didn't know how to become a Christian.
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:23.480]   I didn't know the steps.
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:28.040]   I thought I have to be baptized first.
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:34.280]   I didn't know that if God comes to find you, you just respond.
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:39.680]   It's so simple.
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:42.720]   God comes to find me and I say yes.
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:48.560]   And so what difference has Jesus made to your life?
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:57.040]   This thing has set very deep inside my heart, and I never told anyone.
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:05.280]   Now because I've told Jesus about this and my small group, I have peace and strength
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:07.200]   to face this.
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:10.720]   I don't have to face this alone.
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:17.800]   I felt a power for me to confirm this and confirm the things of the past.
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:23.440]   I feel like I have a new start in life for the better.
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:27.440]   I have a lot of peace.
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:34.640]   Another strange thing is I feel like I have new creative ideas.
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:38.400]   I don't know what's happening.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:45.120]   I have new talents and gifts in cooking.
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:49.440]   And I don't have ideas and thoughts that just come to me.
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:53.800]   Even my wife is surprised.
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:25:03.120]   So after this experience, I share it with my family, with my wife and two daughters.
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:10.960]   I told them I became a Christian and I tell them we can pray together.
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:15.400]   My younger daughter asked me, "Where is Jesus?
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:18.680]   Where does Jesus live?"
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:23.720]   She will put her hand together to pray.
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:31.440]   When we are facing challenges, I say to them, "Why don't we pray together?
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:34.440]   Let's talk about it."
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:40.200]   When my wife can't sleep, I offer to pray her.
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:44.160]   Wednesday is a big day for our family.
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:50.120]   We are waiting to hear if my older daughter get into secondary school.
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:55.560]   I know I can trust God, so I put this in his hand.
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:56.560]   Thank you, Eric.
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:08.720]   Thank you so much for sharing your testimony.
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:12.560]   I would love to share another story, another testimony with you.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.920]   This is a testimony about Zoe.
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:17.760]   So Zoe has given us permission to share.
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:23.320]   She's not quite ready to stand here and share in person, but she has given us permission.
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.600]   So Zoe is originally from Beijing.
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:32.600]   She's from a country, a city where very little of Christianity or spirituality was spoken
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.600]   about.
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:40.680]   When she came here, she found that she had a curiosity about the Bible.
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:46.800]   She says this, "If the Bible is the most read book, how come no one in my circle back home
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:49.400]   read it or even talked about it?"
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:55.800]   So Zoe wanted to learn about the Bible, and so she emailed quite a few of the international
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:56.800]   churches.
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:57.800]   Guess what?
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:01.680]   The Vine was the first one that got back to her, so she came to The Vine.
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.800]   I know it's not a competition, but we won.
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:10.760]   Anyway, so it was at The Vine that she heard about Alpha, and so she joined Alpha.
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:15.360]   And so Alpha is made up of small groups, and each small group has a small group leader,
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.740]   small group hosts.
[00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:23.280]   And we've invited Jennifer to come and share Zoe's testimony and her own journey.
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:27.280]   So let's give a round of applause for Jennifer.
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:28.840]   How's she?
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:29.840]   Hi.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.440]   You've got a fan club over there.
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:33.440]   Hi.
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:34.440]   Hi.
[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:39.760]   So tell us, tell us Zoe's journey on Alpha.
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:40.880]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:43.840]   It has been such a joy walking with Zoe.
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:48.880]   She's always a special one with a very strong spiritual hunger for the truth.
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:54.320]   But I remember six weeks into Alpha, Zoe was telling our group, "I won't be so fast in
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:57.320]   calling myself a Christian when I'm not ready."
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:01.320]   And at that time, I was a little bit let down by it and thought, "Okay, this girl, I should
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:02.640]   never push her."
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:09.040]   But fast forward to Alpha day, during prayer ministry time, I asked Zoe, "So how can I
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:10.580]   pray for you?"
[00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:12.680]   And Zoe said, "You know what?
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:17.640]   I've actually been trying so hard to build a relationship with God, but to be honest,
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:20.440]   I feel like there's a huge disconnection.
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:23.020]   There's something blocking."
[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:28.160]   It was then that I felt prompted to say, "Oh, would you actually want that head knowledge
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.860]   to become a heart transformation?
[00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:33.920]   Do you want to invite Jesus into your life?"
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:34.920]   And she said, "Yes."
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:38.180]   So we did the sinner prayer together.
[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:44.140]   And after that, Zoe told me, "You know, it was when I had to repeat after you that it
[00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:48.980]   was the first time that I realized actually all along I might not think that I'm a sinner,
[00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:52.540]   but I should have messed up here or there.
[00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:58.140]   I've heard similar prayers in church before, but it was the first time that it dawned on
[00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:03.940]   me that I'm actually a sinner and Jesus has died on the cross for me and God really loves
[00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:05.300]   me."
[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:09.860]   And after the sinner prayer, actually the first thing she told me was, "Jen, I really
[00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:12.980]   want an English Bible, a physical copy.
[00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:18.860]   I feel like God has been wanting to talk to me, but I'm the one who kind of want to stop
[00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:24.340]   him shutting the door because I've not been reading the Bible consistently."
[00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:29.100]   And so right after Alpha Day, on that day, we went to a bookstore to get a Bible.
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:34.660]   And after that, I told Zoe, "Okay, let's just read one chapter of the Bible and the gospel,
[00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:38.100]   just one chapter, because don't overburden yourself, don't kill yourself.
[00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:44.220]   But remember to just pray before reading and invite the Holy Spirit to really open your
[00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:46.340]   eyes to the living Word of God.
[00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:49.820]   Otherwise, it's just like any other book."
[00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:53.620]   And so it was at that time that I felt, "Ah, it's kind of mean to just ask her to do it
[00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:54.620]   herself."
[00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:58.140]   So I really felt the Spirit said, "Read it together with her."
[00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:02.340]   And so I offered that and just said, "Maybe just what's that one line of reflection?"
[00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:03.340]   But guess what?
[00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:06.060]   Zoe said, "No, can I email you instead?
[00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:09.620]   I want to properly write down my thoughts."
[00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:13.180]   That's how we started the journey on reading the Word together.
[00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:19.100]   And now it has been a month and we just finished the book of John and we're reading Matthew.
[00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:24.980]   And I remember 10 days after Alpha Day, it was June 20th, it was then that I came across
[00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:27.180]   the baptism course.
[00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:29.420]   And I was thinking, "Should I ask Zoe to join?"
[00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:35.100]   But little do I know, on the exact same day when she emailed me on her reflection, she
[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:38.660]   said, "I've already signed up the course."
[00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:41.020]   So praise God for that.
[00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:46.420]   And Zoe also wants to take this opportunity to really thank everyone who has been so helpful
[00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:47.740]   in her journey.
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:52.060]   And she also wants to encourage you all to join Alpha.
[00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:59.100]   And she said, "Yeah, it would be nothing like what you've imagined until you actually participate."
[00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:05.720]   And can you share a bit about also your experience of walking with someone, sharing this conversation
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:06.720]   with Zoe?
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:07.720]   Yeah, sure.
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:08.720]   It has been such a joy.
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:13.500]   I've never thought that there would be such a joy experiencing firsthand.
[00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:18.220]   And the reason why I joined as a small group host is because I really want to learn.
[00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:21.220]   I'm really never the type that is good at evangelizing.
[00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:24.460]   I just feel super awkward sharing my faith.
[00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:29.180]   But at Alpha, it's such a relief because I don't have to speak much.
[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:34.500]   I just have to give a space for people to throw out their questions and just share.
[00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:40.060]   And the beauty of Alpha is that I don't even have to answer any difficult questions because
[00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:44.420]   all the teaching is done through the video and also the life talks.
[00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:50.300]   So all I have to do is be a friend, and that I can do, and explore life with them and trust
[00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:55.020]   that in time, it is the Holy Spirit who will guide them to the truth.
[00:31:55.020 --> 00:32:01.380]   So I just have to give them a space for them to feel loved, welcomed, and heard.
[00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:07.620]   And to be honest, at the beginning, I was a bit helpless, especially when people started
[00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:09.620]   dropping out in the first few sessions.
[00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:14.980]   But I really felt really lucky that it's not just me, but there are great helpers in my
[00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:16.220]   group.
[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:21.660]   And God also reminded me, after all, it's not my ability that matters.
[00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:28.140]   All I have to do is to purely rely on the Holy Spirit and to know that what God sees
[00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:31.820]   in me is just my willingness to partner with Him.
[00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:38.180]   If the focus is to give glory to God instead of myself, then I shouldn't have any pressure.
[00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:43.580]   My only role is to create a space for people to encounter Jesus directly.
[00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:46.820]   - Oh, let's thank Jennifer.
[00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:48.580]   Thank you so much.
[00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:49.580]   Thank you.
[00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:50.580]   Thank you.
[00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:58.420]   And so, as we come to a close, there's just one thing that Jennifer said that I would
[00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:00.180]   like to point out.
[00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:03.860]   And looking back at John 4, verse 14 says this.
[00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:08.100]   It said, "Whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst.
[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:14.980]   Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal
[00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:16.900]   life."
[00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:22.660]   And this water that's spoken here, it speaks of the Holy Spirit, that Holy Spirit that
[00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:25.020]   Jennifer spoke about.
[00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:30.320]   And really, it's the Holy Spirit that sustains our relationship with God, that draws us into
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:33.020]   relationship with God.
[00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:40.580]   But it's also the Holy Spirit that empowers us as He fills us with this spring of water
[00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:42.340]   to share our testimony.
[00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:47.900]   It's the Holy Spirit that empowers us and anoints us and goes before us as we do.
[00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:54.580]   Yes, we're called to prepare our testimony, to craft our testimony, but when we do share
[00:33:54.580 --> 00:34:01.700]   it with people, after we've shared, it is over to the Holy Spirit to testify as to who
[00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:02.700]   Jesus is.
[00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:08.000]   We heard just now, the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father, He will testify
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.260]   about me.
[00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:16.020]   So it's important for us to know we are encouraging each of us as we have a unique testimony to
[00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:18.660]   prepare that, but also to be released.
[00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:23.660]   It's not our responsibility whether someone comes to Christ.
[00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:28.220]   They may love your testimony, which is always great, and it's always disappointing when
[00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:29.500]   they don't respond.
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:35.820]   They might even think you're crazy, and we do risk that, and it does take courage, but
[00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:43.140]   we have freedom to just share what God has done in our lives so that it gives them an
[00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:46.660]   opportunity to experience God's love.
[00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:50.460]   And this really is what the River Vision is about.
[00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:56.340]   On Vision Sunday, Pastor Andrews spoke to us and reminded us that love and love alone
[00:34:56.340 --> 00:35:04.500]   is the gravity that moves the river of God's kingdom forward in a city.
[00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:10.580]   God has called us each to move the river of God's kingdom forward where He's placed you
[00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:14.020]   in your area, your sphere of influence.
[00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:15.980]   Your life is important.
[00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:24.100]   Your life in Jesus carries a weight that when you share speaks to the majesty, the greatness
[00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:26.020]   of Jesus.
[00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:31.980]   And so we are, as a church, we are called to make an impact on the city, and sharing
[00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:37.660]   your testimony hopefully is a way that you can share out of joy, out of what you have
[00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:45.940]   experienced with God without obligation, and share it where God has placed you.
[00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:52.460]   That's how the whole city can maybe start to impact, be impacted by Jesus' love.
[00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:57.100]   We heard how Eric shared that he became a Christian with his family.
[00:35:57.100 --> 00:36:03.580]   If we each share with one person, maybe in our workplace, in our school, in our gym,
[00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:05.660]   wherever we are, we share it with one person.
[00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:08.660]   We just heard from the Samaritan woman's testimony.
[00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:17.620]   Her one testimony caused that almost domino effect that brought the whole town to faith.
[00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:20.300]   So I really would love to encourage you.
[00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:22.860]   What is your testimony?
[00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:24.260]   What is your story?
[00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:25.380]   It's important.
[00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:33.060]   No one in here has an insignificant or bad testimony, and it's something that you can
[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:34.060]   share.
[00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:35.800]   It shares your hope.
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:42.940]   It shares the power of Jesus, and as we each go out and do this, may God bring revival
[00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:45.260]   just like we sang just now.
[00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:49.060]   May God transform the city that we love.
[00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:54.700]   So yeah, I encourage you to take time to craft your testimony.
[00:36:54.700 --> 00:37:02.060]   And as we come to a close, I'd just love to invite us all to stand, and I'd love to pray
[00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:03.540]   for us.
[00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:09.160]   God, we thank you for this story of the Samaritan woman.
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:17.340]   We thank you for the power of one woman's words, one woman's story.
[00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:24.260]   And we thank you that every person in here and every person watching online has a story.
[00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:31.520]   And so God, empower them, anoint them, show them how they can craft their story.
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:35.500]   And I pray that you'll empower them to share it with people.
[00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:38.060]   You'll give them opportunities to share.
[00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:45.980]   If anyone does feel your story is not important, that's not true.
[00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:46.980]   That's not true.
[00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:50.580]   I pray that Jesus, as they prepare, they'll draw close to you.
[00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:58.780]   They'll encounter you again, that your Holy Spirit will draw them close into relationship.
[00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:02.700]   And for anyone facing hardship here, we thank you, Jesus.
[00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:08.140]   We thank you that we can entrust everything to you.
[00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:10.260]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:10.900]   Amen.
[00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:20.260]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
