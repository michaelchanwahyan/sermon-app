1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,200
 - Thank you, good morning.

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,600
 Hi everyone online.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,880
 When I was preparing for this message,

4
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,720
 I also think of you.

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,480
 And so yeah.

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,880
 So welcome everyone.

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,040
 We are in week three of the Remedy for Relationships

8
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,840
 and it is a privilege to be here.

9
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,680
 I know I'm with you every week,

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,680
 but it is an honor to bring today's word.

11
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,560
 And so in this series, it's about one thing, right?

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,840
 It's about our relationships.

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,280
 And our prayer for us as a church

14
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,440
 is that we would grow and learn to be better neighbors,

15
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,400
 to be better friends, to be better lovers,

16
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,520
 to be better parents.

17
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,640
 And whatever it is, the relationships that we're in,

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,440
 I trust that God's gonna show us

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,200
 how to grow in our relationships and how to flourish,

20
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,840
 how to work through the difficult things

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,240
 so that we can grow together.

22
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,240
 And so last week, if you were here,

23
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,160
 Promise spoke about humble relationships

24
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,840
 and it was a challenging word because as Christians,

25
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,360
 we were reminded that we are called to minister

26
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,800
 by serving others so that we can make them greater, right?

27
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,800
 But not according to worldly standards,

28
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,920
 but make them greater in God's kingdom.

29
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,640
 And the hard part about this way of life

30
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,120
 is that it's not about us, right?

31
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,840
 How do we put the others before ourselves and our own needs?

32
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,920
 And so today's message is titled Gospel Relationships.

33
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,960
 And today we are going to talk about us, actually.

34
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,720
 We're gonna talk about and think about

35
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,440
 our relationship pertaining to the church.

36
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,080
 How do we relate to the church?

37
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,800
 How do we relate to the gospel?

38
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,800
 We are gonna look inwards,

39
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,400
 but we're gonna also look outwards.

40
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,800
 But I think the most important thing I want you to remember

41
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,880
 is that this message is for all of us.

42
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,760
 Can we say this message is for us?

43
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,880
 - It's for us.

44
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,520
 - Because it really is.

45
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,800
 And so we're gonna think also about

46
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,440
 what makes our faith real?

47
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,440
 What makes our faith meaningful?

48
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,960
 And we are going to be sharing out of the parable of the lamp

49
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,440
 in the gospel of Mark chapter four.

50
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,880
 But before we do that,

51
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,160
 I would like to ask you guys a question.

52
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,280
 I would like to ask you, okay,

53
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,000
 what, why is the gospel good news to you?

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,960
 Or in other ways, is what makes the gospel good news?

55
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,960
 And I think to think about this,

56
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,280
 you're gonna have to think, well,

57
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,600
 what is it about Jesus Christ that attracts me so much?

58
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,160
 Why am I a Christian?

59
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,320
 You know, what would you tell me

60
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,200
 if I begged you right now to tell me the gospel

61
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,960
 and I gave you an hour, what would you say to me?

62
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,800
 Right, and I want you to think about this

63
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,720
 and we're gonna come back to this throughout this message.

64
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,000
 So let us now read Mark four, verse 21 and 25 together.

65
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,040
 You can follow along.

66
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:02,360
 He, Jesus, also gave them, his disciples, this parable.

67
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,000
 No one lights a lamp only to place it

68
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,920
 under a basket or under the bed.

69
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,760
 It is meant to be placed on a lampstand.

70
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,840
 For there is nothing that is hidden that won't be disclosed

71
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,120
 and there is no secret

72
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,920
 that won't be brought out into the light.

73
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,720
 If you understand what I'm saying, you need to respond.

74
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,920
 Then Jesus said to his disciples,

75
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,920
 be diligent to understand the meaning

76
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,600
 behind everything you hear,

77
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,880
 for as you do, more understanding will be given to you.

78
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,720
 And according to your longing to understand,

79
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,320
 much more will be added to you.

80
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,360
 For those who listen with open hearts

81
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,520
 will receive more revelation,

82
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,880
 but those who don't listen with open hearts

83
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,280
 will lose what little they think they have.

84
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,520
 Can I just see a show of hands,

85
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,920
 how many of you have heard this parable before?

86
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,960
 Don't be shy, awesome.

87
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:58,280
 So I think most of us have heard this parable.

88
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,840
 And so I think it's really easy to take what we've learned

89
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,040
 and what we've heard before and just think,

90
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,680
 all right, Justin, I got it, I got it.

91
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,840
 But can I ask humbly that we would try

92
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,680
 to understand this parable afresh,

93
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,640
 that we would try to hear what Jesus' audience,

94
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,400
 his disciples would have heard

95
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,640
 when Jesus told this parable.

96
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,440
 And so with this, I'm gonna pray for all of us.

97
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,720
 So would you pray with me?

98
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:32,080
 God, we are here, we are ready to learn from you.

99
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,200
 So would you open up our eyes to this text?

100
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,640
 Would you help us to go deeper

101
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,400
 than what we thought is possible?

102
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,280
 Would you highlight this one new thing for us?

103
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:51,720
 And as we hear your word together today as your children,

104
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,520
 make your present known to us

105
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,760
 and reveal your heart through this text as we listen.

106
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,440
 Jesus, in your name we pray, amen.

107
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:07,320
 So I'm gonna start by giving us a refresh

108
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,440
 on what a parable is so that we can better appreciate

109
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,480
 what Jesus is saying here.

110
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,280
 Now, we don't often comprehend parables

111
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,560
 because we try to understand it through our human logic.

112
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,960
 And sometimes I think we really try

113
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,600
 to find ourselves within this parable.

114
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,720
 And I think we often miss the point

115
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,600
 because parables in essence is all about God's kingdom

116
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,560
 and not really about us.

117
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,640
 So parables are really about God's kingdom.

118
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,760
 And so when Jesus talks about parables,

119
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,960
 he's actually talking about God's kingdom

120
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,240
 and he compares it with ordinary daily aspects of life

121
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,240
 in which Jesus' audience would understand.

122
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,760
 So when we read parables, we read about banquets.

123
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,080
 We read about the king ruling a land

124
00:05:59,080 --> 00:05:59,920
 and what that looks like.

125
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,200
 We read about shepherding and planting seeds

126
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,880
 and what it's like being a farmer

127
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,960
 and how difficult it is to sometimes plant seeds.

128
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,360
 And so Jesus used these analogies and metaphors

129
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,120
 as a way to help his listeners understand concretely

130
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,280
 the intangible aspects of what God's kingdom is like.

131
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,160
 And for us, Jesus uses parables as a way of challenging us

132
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,840
 to change our earthly ways of thinking about God,

133
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,120
 about ourselves, about faith.

134
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,480
 And he causes us to look afresh

135
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,520
 about God's reality that is amongst us.

136
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,920
 And so with this understanding,

137
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,000
 let us read this verse by verse.

138
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,360
 You guys with me?

139
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,440
 Yeah?

140
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,280
 So verse 21, Jesus gave his disciples this parable.

141
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,960
 No one lights a lamp only to place it under a basket

142
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,800
 or under a bed.

143
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,160
 It is meant to be placed on the lampstand.

144
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,360
 Now this parable begins

145
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,440
 with a very obvious and rhetorical point.

146
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,000
 How many of us is going to light a candle

147
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,360
 or light a lamp only to immediately put it under a box

148
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,040
 or under your bed?

149
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,320
 Not many of us, right?

150
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,880
 And one commentator, I liked his sense of humor.

151
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,560
 He says that we don't do that

152
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,720
 because we might end up burning up the house, right?

153
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,360
 Now it is obvious that lamps should be placed

154
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,000
 in a place where it can illuminate the room.

155
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,160
 But more important than placement of a lamp,

156
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,360
 Jesus is perhaps suggesting through this parable

157
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,360
 that the mystery and how the kingdom of God works

158
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,400
 should no longer be a secret, but it should be proclaimed.

159
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,000
 And so for those who were yearning and listening

160
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,800
 in Jesus's day, this was good news, right?

161
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,800
 Because the lamp was then a clear sign for Jesus's audience

162
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,920
 that God's son had come into the world

163
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,520
 and he is going to illuminate the world.

164
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,200
 So Jesus continues in verse 22.

165
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,960
 He says, and he tells us,

166
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,720
 "For there is nothing that is hidden

167
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,200
 that won't be disclosed.

168
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,440
 And there's no secret that won't be brought out

169
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,400
 into the light."

170
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:15,360
 This verse references a lot of the proverbial wisdom

171
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,200
 that we have heard before.

172
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,840
 Something along the lines of,

173
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,560
 you can't keep things a secret

174
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,320
 because the truth will come out sooner or later.

175
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,560
 How many of you have heard that in different ways, right?

176
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,680
 Different sermons, or maybe we were taught that as a child.

177
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,560
 So I grew up in a very Chinese conservative,

178
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,680
 Baptist church.

179
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,760
 So that's where I found faith.

180
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,120
 And since then, since I was 16,

181
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,720
 I was taught that, "Justin, Christ will disclose

182
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,040
 all your secret sins for the world to know.

183
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,520
 And so don't sin."

184
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,200
 You know, that was basically the message.

185
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,360
 And you can imagine it struck a lot of fear.

186
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,560
 And to this day, I do live in fear.

187
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,680
 And I think it's a healthy kind of fear, right?

188
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,360
 And I think most of us may have heard that kind of message,

189
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,640
 and I do wanna make a side note

190
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,040
 that I think we have to take sin seriously.

191
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,520
 We have to confess sin because it does affect

192
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,760
 not just our spiritual lives,

193
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,440
 it affects every part of how we live life.

194
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,560
 But remember, what are parables about?

195
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,680
 God's kingdom.

196
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,000
 So if, for those of you like me,

197
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,320
 have heard this parable taught to strike fear in us,

198
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,040
 I want us to just put it aside for now.

199
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,480
 And once again, I wanna come back

200
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,200
 and let's think about this parable.

201
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,080
 What is this parable saying about God's kingdom?

202
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,120
 And so for Mark's audience, for Jesus' audience,

203
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,760
 this verse is clear that Jesus' coming is no longer a myth,

204
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,200
 and it's not a secret, but a fulfilled reality.

205
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,920
 But another, I feel like, another secret

206
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,600
 that Jesus was trying to convey through this parable

207
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,760
 is that He Himself is the lamp on the lampstand.

208
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,680
 He is the light that we can personally see,

209
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,400
 we can touch, we can know, and this light,

210
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,720
 the living Son of God walks with us.

211
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,400
 And church, this is the good news

212
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,720
 that Christianity proclaims.

213
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,160
 So when Jesus was telling this parable,

214
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,120
 He was in effect telling everyone,

215
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,120
 "Hey, hey, hey, hey, whoever has ears, listen to this.

216
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,280
 "God's kingdom is here.

217
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,280
 "And all are welcome, whether you're a Jew,

218
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,480
 "whether you're a Gentile, whether you're a sinner,

219
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,480
 "come and be a part of my Father's kingdom,

220
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,060
 "and also come to know the light of the world Himself."

221
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:52,240
 However, despite how good news this was for those listening,

222
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,440
 there were tragically that many refused to listen,

223
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,680
 including God's chosen people,

224
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,000
 as well as many of the religious leaders in that day.

225
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,300
 And so because of the people's hardness of heart,

226
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:09,200
 the kingdom of God and Christ Himself remains hidden to them.

227
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,900
 And it is only to those who know how sinful, how desperate,

228
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,380
 how lost, how sick they were

229
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:20,100
 that could come to know Jesus Christ Himself.

230
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,540
 So guys, in preparing this message,

231
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,900
 I experienced a very beautiful shift

232
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,700
 towards how I think about the gospel.

233
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,300
 I asked you guys at the beginning,

234
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,540
 "What is the good news to you?"

235
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,900
 And so for most of my Christian life,

236
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,240
 I thought the gospel was something I had to communicate.

237
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,780
 I had the impression that I had to say certain things

238
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:47,500
 in certain order in order to properly evangelize.

239
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,980
 So I had to tell people that Jesus died for our sins,

240
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:55,540
 He was crucified, and three days later, He rose again.

241
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:59,340
 And somehow from that point, I had to tell my testimony.

242
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:02,300
 And then I had to ask them to church

243
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,620
 or else it's not complete.

244
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,300
 But of course, in retrospect, in reflection,

245
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,300
 that is only a small, small, small part

246
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,420
 of what it means to be a Christian.

247
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,260
 And I think what's more important is for us to think about,

248
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,060
 well, it's not just our words,

249
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,060
 it's not just what we say, right?

250
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,880
 But it's how we live.

251
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,620
 Are our actions congruent with the things we tell people?

252
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,700
 Is our belief congruent with how I treat you guys?

253
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:35,540
 And I think that causes that, that is worth thinking about.

254
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,860
 But coming back to this parable,

255
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,360
 when I was preparing, I came to see and realize

256
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,740
 that Jesus did not just come to communicate good news.

257
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:51,340
 The gospel is not merely words or great ideas

258
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,900
 or a profound theological concept,

259
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:58,460
 but that Jesus himself, the person, the son of God,

260
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:02,300
 who is both man and God, He is our gospel.

261
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:07,480
 And so the good news is that Jesus Christ has come.

262
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,000
 The good news is that Jesus Christ embodies the essence

263
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,880
 of God's kingdom and every good thing associated with God.

264
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,220
 So when we share the gospel,

265
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,620
 when we tell people of the gospel,

266
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,140
 we are effectively telling people about Jesus Christ.

267
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,860
 And as we share about Jesus Christ,

268
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:30,220
 people will come to know who the Father is,

269
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,340
 what the Holy Spirit is like,

270
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:36,460
 what it means to live in God's kingdom here on earth.

271
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,180
 And when we as Christians say

272
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,220
 that we have accepted Jesus Christ,

273
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,460
 it means that we've encountered Him.

274
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,620
 We've seen Him, we've touched Him.

275
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:50,460
 He's spoken to us and we know by experience that He's good,

276
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:54,260
 He's trustworthy, and He is true.

277
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,340
 This is the good news.

278
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,940
 And also what's good news is we realize

279
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,420
 that He walks with us.

280
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,140
 He's given us His Holy Spirit

281
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,700
 through whatever season we walk in.

282
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:08,020
 And He gives us the courage to live in this dark world

283
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,600
 so that it may be more bright.

284
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,460
 And He also gives us one another,

285
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:18,380
 and He gives us the word so that we may not be lost.

286
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,620
 And church, this is good news, yeah?

287
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:24,740
 And I want to read Colossians 1:8,

288
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,460
 and this is where Paul summarizes his mission.

289
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,300
 I know in Philippians and Ephesians, he does that,

290
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,320
 and we share that a lot, but this verse,

291
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,420
 Paul tells us what his life is about.

292
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:39,300
 His life is all about proclaiming Jesus Christ.

293
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:43,660
 His whole life, all the energy and strength

294
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,940
 that God has given him,

295
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:49,820
 Paul says that I want to make my life about teaching Him,

296
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,460
 sharing about Him so that all may know

297
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,580
 and come to know Him.

298
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,800
 And I really want this for us as well.

299
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,700
 I want us to embody this mission over time in our lives.

300
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,900
 And so Jesus continues in verse 23.

301
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:10,300
 He says, "Hey, guys, if you understand what I'm saying,

302
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,640
 then you need to respond."

303
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,100
 This kind of urgency is repeated throughout the Gospels

304
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,500
 and throughout the New Testament

305
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,260
 because the Lord calls His disciples, that is us,

306
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:25,420
 to go beyond a superficial kind of hearing.

307
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,900
 This is not a metaphor.

308
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,740
 This is a call to respond.

309
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:33,240
 And when we read this today, when we hear this right now,

310
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,420
 it's like Jesus saying, "Vine church,

311
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,820
 if you understand what I'm saying,

312
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,560
 would you respond today?

313
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,900
 Would you respond right now?"

314
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,160
 Because Jesus is saying, "Vine church,

315
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,980
 you cannot afford to take the lamp off the lampstand.

316
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,880
 We don't have time for you to put your lamp under a box

317
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,240
 or to put it under your bed.

318
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,640
 For everyone that knows me, for everyone that follows me,

319
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,280
 for everyone that loves me," He says,

320
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,040
 "proclaim me, tell others about me."

321
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,980
 In one of his famous letters to Timothy,

322
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,500
 Paul reminds his young protege

323
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,180
 what dark and terrible times they live in,

324
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,980
 which is not very different than what we know now.

325
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,820
 In every generation after Christ's resurrection,

326
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:25,740
 the church has encountered its fair share of darkness,

327
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:30,500
 difficult times, but yet the church kept on proclaiming

328
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,740
 the Gospel, which is, it's Jesus.

329
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,780
 They kept on talking about Jesus.

330
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:39,360
 And what sustained them was living with Jesus,

331
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,120
 walking with Jesus.

332
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,080
 And so this morning, I want to read this passage to us

333
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,480
 because I want us to be aware of what dark times we live in.

334
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,440
 I want us to also know that since the flood,

335
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,880
 human nature has not changed much.

336
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,800
 We are still consistently terrible people

337
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,420
 and sinful by nature.

338
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,260
 So 2 Timothy says this.

339
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:05,480
 This is, by the way, one of my favorite passages.

340
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,520
 Andrew shared it with me once and I was like, whoa.

341
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,020
 To this day, I'm still thinking about this.

342
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,760
 So this is what the word says.

343
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,000
 "We are perpetually surrounded by people

344
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,620
 "who are lovers of themselves, lovers of money,

345
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:22,840
 "boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents,

346
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,700
 "ungrateful, holy, without love,

347
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,200
 "unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control,

348
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,200
 "brutal, not lovers of good, treacherous, rash, conceited,

349
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,520
 "lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,

350
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,680
 "having an outer form of godliness but denying its power."

351
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:45,640
 The reason why I love this scripture so much,

352
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,000
 the reason why I read it so much is it reminds me

353
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,280
 that I and you and I are not far from this.

354
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,360
 These things that Paul is listing out,

355
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,920
 they are godless postures of the heart,

356
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:04,000
 which is in our nature, which is at work in society,

357
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,440
 which is at work.

358
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,120
 I mean, you read this, it's painful,

359
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,560
 but you know what I'm talking about.

360
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:15,080
 And so what separates us from inhabiting and being

361
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,920
 and having these godless postures of the heart

362
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,960
 is whether we respond to today's word or not.

363
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,620
 It's a very thin line.

364
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:28,520
 But the good news, the gospel, Jesus Christ,

365
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,020
 what he would say to us is, "Yes, church, you may stray.

366
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,720
 "You may do evil against our Father.

367
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,100
 "You may do evil against one another.

368
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,320
 "We may be selfish.

369
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,240
 "We may sometimes choose to live in the dark."

370
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,240
 But Jesus reminds us today that he himself,

371
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,920
 the lamp on the lampstead is not too far within our reach.

372
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,960
 And that he shows us a way out of the darkness

373
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,480
 to live in the light, not looking down on people,

374
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,720
 but to live with people, to live with Christ.

375
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,780
 And so perhaps today to respond

376
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,860
 beyond a superficial kind of hearing

377
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:08,340
 is maybe for us, for some of us, is not to be afraid.

378
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:11,340
 It's not to be afraid of the darkness.

379
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:15,520
 For some of us is not to lose hope in our relationships.

380
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,220
 And I think one of the more challenging things

381
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,980
 for all of us is maybe to respond concretely

382
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:27,380
 is to not allow our hearts to be hardened

383
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:31,180
 because there are so many offensive things these days.

384
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,940
 I mean, our relationships, some of them offend us, right?

385
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,100
 A lot.

386
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,380
 And it's so easy to say, "You know what?

387
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,040
 "Forget this.

388
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,780
 "I'm gonna just put everything back under the bed

389
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,860
 "and I'm just gonna live my way."

390
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:47,220
 And I think all of us have gone through that before.

391
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,380
 And so Jesus says, "Church, if you understand

392
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,000
 "even a word of what I'm saying today,

393
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,340
 "you need to respond."

394
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:58,140
 And so the last two verses, Jesus leaves us

395
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,180
 both with an encouragement and also a warning.

396
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,720
 It's a double-edged sword.

397
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,380
 And he warns his disciples what happens

398
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:09,940
 when we don't respond, and he also encourages his disciples

399
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,860
 what happens when we do.

400
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,600
 So verse 24 and 25, "Then Jesus said to them,

401
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,660
 "'Guys, be diligent to understand the meaning

402
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,880
 "'behind everything you hear, for as you do,

403
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,540
 "'more understanding will be given to you.

404
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:26,520
 "'And according to your longing to understand,

405
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,040
 "'much more will be added to you.

406
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,060
 "'For those who listen with open hearts

407
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,540
 "'will receive more revelation.

408
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,480
 "'But those who don't listen with open hearts

409
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,780
 "'will lose what little they think they have.'"

410
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,820
 Now remember, we're talking about what here?

411
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,260
 God's kingdom, right?

412
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,940
 I want us to think about that.

413
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:49,600
 So as a simple summary so far, if you're just tuning in now,

414
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,940
 the good news is that Jesus Christ has come.

415
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,100
 He himself is the gospel,

416
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,220
 the embodiment of the kingdom of God,

417
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,980
 and he's asking us, "How are you gonna respond?"

418
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,420
 That's the summary right now.

419
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,140
 And so at this point, Jesus says,

420
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,900
 "Well, if you've understood,

421
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,620
 "if you understand God's kingdom,

422
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:13,020
 "you've experienced it, you've tasted it,

423
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:17,820
 "it's changed you, then you need to proclaim the kingdom.

424
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,500
 "You need to proclaim Christ.

425
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,580
 "You need to share and teach others

426
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,540
 "so that they may come to know the gospel."

427
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,460
 That is Jesus Christ.

428
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,140
 And so the promise in doing so,

429
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,780
 according to these two verses, which is an encouragement,

430
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:36,140
 is that much more will be added to us, right?

431
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,760
 Much more will be added to us.

432
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,180
 And what is Jesus talking about?

433
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:44,180
 Well, the much more is our continued ability

434
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:48,380
 to receive God's kindness, right?

435
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,600
 The much more, if we respond,

436
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:55,420
 is to continue to be able to be humble and to be aware

437
00:21:55,420 --> 00:22:00,420
 and to say that, "Lord, everything in my life is from you."

438
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:05,980
 You know, to be able to continue to love one another.

439
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,720
 I mean, that in itself is some form of miracle.

440
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,940
 I don't know about you, but for me, it is.

441
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:14,660
 And so Jesus is saying,

442
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:18,080
 "If you are diligent to understand

443
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,100
 "how my Father's kingdom works,

444
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,060
 "then yes, you will understand

445
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,540
 "because I will enable you to understand.

446
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,700
 "If you are diligent and you want healing

447
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,020
 "in your relationships, then yes,

448
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:33,660
 "I will give you the wisdom and the courage to say sorry,

449
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:36,740
 "to do whatever it takes to make things better."

450
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:42,300
 And so what we're talking about today,

451
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:46,100
 about the kingdom, is this is Kingdom Economics 101.

452
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,700
 You know, this is how our Father's kingdom works.

453
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,580
 When you give out, when you respond,

454
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:57,240
 more is given to us, right?

455
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,880
 And I think this parable helps us measure

456
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,020
 whether we're growing or not.

457
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:05,220
 You know, because if you are responding, you are giving,

458
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,820
 you're stepping out in faith, you're proclaiming Christ,

459
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,760
 then God will add more to us,

460
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,180
 and you know when God is adding more to us.

461
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:16,220
 And so when we testify about who Christ is,

462
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:20,220
 God's graciousness will be further added to us.

463
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:24,380
 And I want you to note this, not in proportion to our skills

464
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,260
 or not in proportion to all the great things we've done,

465
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:32,180
 but just purely based on the generosity and kindness of God.

466
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:37,060
 And so an analogy, if it helps you understand,

467
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,780
 is that when we became Christians,

468
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:42,340
 when we first experienced the grace of God,

469
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:45,060
 it's like within our hearts and in our lives,

470
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:48,340
 we created, we made this great reservoir

471
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,780
 to contain all of God's goodness.

472
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:55,500
 And we grow because we live out of this reservoir.

473
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,420
 Everything that God has done, we remember.

474
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,220
 Everything that God has said, we remember.

475
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:02,620
 His promises, we hold here in this reservoir.

476
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:06,180
 Every time we give, we give out of the overflow

477
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,340
 of what God has given us.

478
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,660
 And I think that is what it means to respond.

479
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:14,420
 Now, this is the warning, right?

480
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,580
 Conversely, Jesus is saying, well,

481
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,300
 those who don't listen,

482
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,900
 those who don't respond with open hearts

483
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,460
 will lose whatever little or whatever they think they have.

484
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,460
 And Jesus is referring to those

485
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:31,100
 who have once experienced God's goodness

486
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,860
 and those ones who knew what God is doing,

487
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:37,060
 but they don't immediately share it

488
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,300
 or they don't proclaim it,

489
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,260
 they will find that everything that they had,

490
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,660
 everything that was in this reservoir

491
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,940
 will be taken away by Satan.

492
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:50,780
 In other words, it is possible for us

493
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:54,460
 to actually forget the good and merciful acts

494
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,940
 that God has done in our life.

495
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:59,620
 So it is possible that this great reservoir

496
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:04,620
 that we rejoiced in gets dismantled and it falls apart

497
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:08,140
 and we have nothing to hold God's goodness.

498
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:13,020
 And so when we forget what God has done,

499
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:16,780
 our desire to proclaim him, our desire to love others,

500
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:21,100
 our desire to worship and to support one another

501
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,940
 diminishes in proportion to our forgetfulness.

502
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:27,300
 And spiritual forgetfulness doesn't, once again,

503
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:30,580
 just impact our faith, it impacts every aspect of our life,

504
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:33,340
 our beliefs, our convictions, how we treat each other,

505
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:36,300
 how we spend our time, what we think about,

506
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:40,340
 how we deal with life's crisis and challenges.

507
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:43,460
 Do we respond in fear? Do we respond in anxiety?

508
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,460
 It affects everything.

509
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,220
 And actually, what I'm talking about

510
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:52,460
 is both a tragic and common human experience.

511
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,500
 But I think the saddest and most tragic thing

512
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:58,620
 about not responding is that we actually have a choice

513
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:02,380
 and a say in whether we forget or not.

514
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:05,620
 'Cause God doesn't hold us to comply, right?

515
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,660
 He doesn't force us and command us,

516
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,740
 you have to do this right now.

517
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:13,100
 We do have a choice, and I think that also expresses

518
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,340
 why there's such an urgency in this message,

519
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:20,100
 because God is calling us to respond, least we forget.

520
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:23,260
 And as I said at the very beginning,

521
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:26,060
 today's message is for us, the church.

522
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:31,060
 And so I wanna encourage us to approach this parable

523
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:34,540
 as our responsibility and our privilege

524
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,420
 to proclaim Christ with our life.

525
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,620
 This is not an option for those of us

526
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,940
 who are so courageous here.

527
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:45,340
 This is not an option for the few of us who feel called.

528
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,340
 This is for everyone.

529
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,020
 It's for all of us in this room,

530
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,780
 for all of us who are listening right now online.

531
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:54,860
 As long as you call yourself a Christian,

532
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,260
 if you say that you love God,

533
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,620
 then it is on us to proclaim him.

534
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,500
 It's not on Andrew, it's not on the pastor,

535
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,620
 it's not on those who serve, but it's for all of us.

536
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,460
 And this is our cross to bear.

537
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,380
 You know, when the gospels talk about bearing a cross,

538
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:16,420
 I think this is one of them to show people who Jesus is,

539
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:20,620
 because he is too good for us to keep hidden.

540
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:25,460
 So church, I want to ask you,

541
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:29,660
 what is at stake if we fail to respond to this parable?

542
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:32,740
 On a personal level, I've already said that we might forget.

543
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,780
 You know, we might forget everything God has done,

544
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:39,500
 and that is gonna, that's a slippery slope.

545
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,100
 But another thing that is at stake

546
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,020
 is if we don't respond or heed today's message

547
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:47,220
 is that the church ceases to be.

548
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:50,100
 Now, let me explain what I mean.

549
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:54,460
 Right now, as we listen, as we sit here together,

550
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:58,420
 we are a living proclamation of who Jesus is.

551
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,980
 So I'm actually very happy when we go out of this place,

552
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:01,820
 when you guys leave,

553
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:04,700
 I'm happy because as you go back home

554
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,900
 to your different communities,

555
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,940
 we continue to proclaim Christ, right?

556
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:12,220
 And that's why it's so beautiful.

557
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:17,220
 Now, so if we today, at the end of this word, we respond,

558
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:20,660
 then wherever you go afterwards,

559
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:23,100
 people are gonna see Christ through you.

560
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,380
 They're gonna encounter the living Christ

561
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:29,100
 because you're proclaiming him.

562
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,220
 You choose to continue to remain faithful to him.

563
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:36,580
 But of course, the opposite is true is if the church,

564
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,940
 if we do not respond today, if we ignore,

565
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,340
 if we just go on living our life,

566
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,780
 then there's a chance that those that we encounter

567
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,460
 will not see the light today.

568
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:50,500
 And I think the scariest thing for me personally

569
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:54,660
 is that if we don't respond,

570
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:59,660
 we risk the church becoming cold and apathetic and forgetful.

571
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:02,620
 And the scariest thing I hear these days

572
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:06,140
 is when a pre-believer says to me,

573
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:06,980
 you know, Justin,

574
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,660
 I don't see a difference between you and I.

575
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,820
 I don't see a difference.

576
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,460
 Why should I be a Christian?

577
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,620
 Our values are similar.

578
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,980
 We live in a very similar way.

579
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,180
 But what is the difference

580
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:20,580
 is whether we respond to this word or not.

581
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,340
 That is what is gonna make the difference.

582
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:26,580
 And as I share today, I sense some of us are doubting

583
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,260
 and you're saying, Justin,

584
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:33,260
 how can I proclaim Christ when I myself am so broken?

585
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,380
 How can I proclaim?

586
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,220
 I'm not ready.

587
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,980
 I just accepted Christ yesterday.

588
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,700
 Now, I think that's fair.

589
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,540
 I think that's fair,

590
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:44,220
 but I do want to say that I think all of us are able.

591
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:48,540
 You know, it is precisely because we are broken

592
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,580
 that we can share Christ.

593
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,380
 Because our experience says

594
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,620
 that Christ is the one that saves us.

595
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,420
 Christ is the one that enables us.

596
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,100
 Christ is the one that gives us courage

597
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,820
 because apart from Christ, we can do no good thing.

598
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:05,780
 And so today, when we think

599
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:08,180
 about what our gospel relationships,

600
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:13,180
 I would say that this parable says that our healing,

601
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:18,500
 our healing that we are praying for in our relationships,

602
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:22,980
 our growth with one another as Christians

603
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:26,740
 is directly tied to whether or not we proclaim Christ or not.

604
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:30,180
 There is a direct correlation.

605
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:33,220
 And I don't think it can be separated.

606
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:36,180
 We can't just say, ah, you know, I'll ignore this one.

607
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,740
 And so it is my heart, church,

608
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:41,820
 that we would experience this parable for ourselves.

609
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:44,620
 Now, what gets me excited and what gives me hope

610
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:49,620
 is that I imagine all of us pledging our everything to God.

611
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:55,380
 And we ask him, despite our sin, despite the excuses,

612
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,780
 despite our strongholds that hold us back,

613
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,940
 despite our brokenness,

614
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:02,660
 Lord, would you enable us to proclaim you?

615
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,340
 I wonder what's gonna happen.

616
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:11,980
 And church, I want us because I believe with all of my heart

617
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,540
 that all of us have to respond.

618
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,780
 All of us are able to respond.

619
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,180
 So as a way of summarizing today,

620
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:22,620
 I want to share with us a few ways where we can respond

621
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,940
 with whatever little or much we have.

622
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:31,180
 I think in today's age,

623
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,340
 in light of everything that we have lived through

624
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:37,220
 as a city in Hong Kong,

625
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:41,020
 I think our kindness more than ever proclaims Christ.

626
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,340
 You know, things have been so binary lately.

627
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,980
 Everything's so black and white

628
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,580
 and there is zero kindness these days.

629
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:53,500
 And the thing that has just kept me humble in the last year

630
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:57,340
 is trying to survive the harshness

631
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:00,300
 is just to show people kindness.

632
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,220
 And that is how I've been preaching the gospel,

633
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,340
 just through going out of my way,

634
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,940
 doing something for someone,

635
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,780
 because people don't expect it.

636
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,940
 And through that, man,

637
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:12,340
 all the conversations that I've had with people,

638
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,540
 I mean, much better than saying,

639
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:17,700
 "Hey, sorry, can I tell you about Jesus Christ right now?

640
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,380
 "He died for our sins."

641
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,300
 I mean, that's one way.

642
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,420
 And there comes a time where we do share

643
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:28,740
 the basic aspects of why Jesus died.

644
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,900
 But I want to encourage you

645
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:34,220
 that all of us can show kindness to one another,

646
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,140
 especially those who are closest to us.

647
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,420
 I know that's actually the hardest sometimes.

648
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,900
 Forgiveness proclaims Christ.

649
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:45,980
 I think one of the most attractive aspects of Christianity,

650
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:50,940
 the most radical, and what makes Christianity so distinct

651
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,060
 is that a God would forgive us.

652
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,140
 And that forgiveness,

653
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:59,860
 it is the kingdom way to conquer evil with goodness.

654
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:04,820
 It is forgiveness that has melted the hardest of hearts.

655
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,260
 It's moved empires.

656
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,660
 It's changed us, right?

657
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:12,460
 Because we know to be a forgiven person

658
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:15,100
 means that we need help, we need a savior.

659
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,740
 And all of us are in the same boat.

660
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:24,340
 Another thing is that our faithfulness proclaims Christ.

661
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,860
 You know, a lot of times,

662
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:31,100
 we all want to do great things for God, including me.

663
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:34,180
 But more and more, as I grow a bit older,

664
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,500
 I realize that I don't have energy

665
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,260
 to do great things all the time.

666
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:41,180
 I can't just move to another country and serve somehow.

667
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,100
 I need to just work with what I have.

668
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:46,460
 And the conclusion is that, you know what?

669
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,900
 I think what's gonna speak louder

670
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,980
 than just me sacrificing everything in my life

671
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,500
 to make a point is if I can show faithfulness

672
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,100
 and steadfastness in my life.

673
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,260
 You know, one of the most beautiful things that I see,

674
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:02,220
 and that just completely melts me,

675
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,580
 is whenever I see an elderly couple,

676
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:07,740
 they're like 80, 90, 100, whatever,

677
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:11,500
 and they're walking down the street holding hands

678
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,620
 ever so slowly, and you know what?

679
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,820
 At that point, I say, "Lord, I want that."

680
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:20,660
 Not just I want to grow old with my wife or partner,

681
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,660
 but more so what they represent.

682
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,540
 They represent faithfulness.

683
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:28,540
 And I think if the world is going to think differently

684
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:31,500
 about Jesus and the church,

685
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,460
 then we need to somehow show

686
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:36,940
 steadfast commitment and faithfulness.

687
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:39,700
 You know, and I think it starts in our relationships, right?

688
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,820
 All of us, what do we want in friendships?

689
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:44,340
 We want faithfulness.

690
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,940
 We want some sort of commitment.

691
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,660
 We want just the other person to say,

692
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:50,540
 "Hey, I'm not gonna ditch you.

693
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,020
 "Let's just walk through this."

694
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:55,220
 You know, and of course we do, but that's not the point.

695
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,220
 Let's desire faithfulness.

696
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:02,540
 And I think another thing tied in with all this

697
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:05,020
 is every time we just show up

698
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,180
 and we look at someone in the eyes,

699
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,300
 look at them in the face,

700
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,340
 and we say, "Hey, let's have a chat,"

701
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,900
 our presence also proclaims Christ.

702
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,340
 By being present, by showing up,

703
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:18,060
 we're saying to the other people that you matter.

704
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,220
 Our time together matters.

705
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:23,740
 And as we meet, Christ is amongst us.

706
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,100
 Christ is being proclaimed.

707
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,420
 All of us can then interact

708
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:30,060
 and talk to Christ through one another.

709
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:33,180
 And lastly, our testimony proclaims Christ.

710
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,300
 To be a Christian is not to claim a title.

711
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,060
 It's not just to show up to church.

712
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:41,260
 It's not to be in an exclusive place where we come to.

713
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:46,180
 But to be a Christian along the same heart of today

714
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:51,060
 is to show why Jesus Christ matters.

715
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,900
 To be a Christian is to tell people

716
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:57,900
 what God is doing in this world through us.

717
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:02,100
 And I think 99.9% of us

718
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,420
 did not become a Christian in a vacuum.

719
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:09,460
 There is that 0.1% that, you know,

720
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,980
 God came to you in a dream, and I truly believe that.

721
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,500
 But for most of us,

722
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,580
 someone bothered to take the time to pray for us.

723
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,620
 Someone bothered to befriend us,

724
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:22,500
 to tell us and show us kindness,

725
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,300
 to have a conversation about who Jesus Christ is,

726
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:30,020
 and slowly, our hearts changed, our thoughts changed.

727
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,100
 And so I want to encourage you

728
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,820
 to not to look down upon your faith,

729
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:38,340
 not to look down on who you are and what you have,

730
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:41,420
 but trust that God is at work in you.

731
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:44,860
 And that just by waking up today,

732
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:48,140
 you are proclaiming Christ, we are proclaiming Christ.

733
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:55,620
 And so I want to just to conclude today,

734
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:59,660
 and just to say once again that the gospel

735
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:04,220
 that we are to share is not just resided in words,

736
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,780
 it's not great theology,

737
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:10,820
 but it has everything to do with Jesus Christ

738
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,260
 and how we relate to him.

739
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:18,620
 And as long as we have life, as long as we are alive,

740
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,220
 we are called to proclaim him.

741
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:24,300
 We are called to use a elementary school term.

742
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:27,380
 We are called to show and tell every single day

743
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,540
 with what we have.

744
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:34,180
 And as Christians, no matter how dark things get,

745
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:38,860
 we will always be relationally connected to Jesus Christ.

746
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:42,860
 We are always connected somehow to God's kingdom.

747
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,500
 God's kingdom is always at work in us,

748
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,500
 even when you forget.

749
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,500
 That is also good news.

750
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:53,180
 So church, let us not lose hope

751
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:57,300
 and let us all figure out creatively

752
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,540
 what it means to be diligent to proclaim him.

753
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,580
 Let's pray.

754
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:11,700
 Father, we are not as smart as we think we are

755
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:18,780
 and many times we cannot contain so much information.

756
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:23,860
 So Holy Spirit, just as we prayed

757
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,940
 before we came to church today,

758
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:28,180
 just as we prayed, as we worshiped you,

759
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:31,900
 Lord, show us your heart.

760
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,540
 Show us that one thing.

761
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:38,060
 Lord, this life is not about me.

762
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,180
 It's about you.

763
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:46,040
 And so Jesus, would your light shine through us?

764
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:51,500
 Would you be proclaimed through our words,

765
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,820
 through our actions?

766
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:55,380
 Every time we love someone, every time we forgive,

767
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,340
 every time we look at someone,

768
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,900
 Lord, would people see you through us?

769
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:03,180
 Father, would you give us the courage

770
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:09,980
 to just show up and know that you are working in us?

771
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:14,460
 And Jesus, shift our thinking.

772
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:17,600
 Father, it's not what we do,

773
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:23,300
 but it's the fact that we have the gospel, Lord God,

774
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,580
 and this is you.

775
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:28,620
 Lord, you are the good news.

776
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,180
 You are our greatest news

777
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,420
 and we want to share it with everyone.

778
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:37,360
 So Father, would you show up when I go to work tomorrow

779
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,300
 so my colleagues can meet you?

780
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:43,540
 Father, when I go home, when we go home today,

781
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:46,460
 would you show my parents who you are?

782
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:51,900
 Would you sit down with the kids and I

783
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,820
 and would you pray with us?

784
00:39:54,820 --> 00:40:00,460
 And Father, for the relationships

785
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:03,420
 that I'm actually very scared to deal with,

786
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:06,340
 would you also come with me?

787
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:11,280
 And would you give me the courage to just be there together?

788
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,740
 And we know that you are gonna show up.

789
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:20,060
 You're not just good news, but you, Jesus,

790
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,460
 you are our life.

791
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:26,120
 And so Father, hear our prayer.

792
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:30,020
 Would you become real to us?

793
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:33,300
 Would our words and acts be like

794
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:38,320
 a prophetic proclamation that we choose

795
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,620
 to put our lights on the lampstand so all may see?

796
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:45,380
 Church, can I ask you to stand?

797
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:50,140
 And I just wanna encourage you just to respond

798
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:52,540
 as God has touched your heart too.

799
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,900
 And let us worship together.

800
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:58,260
