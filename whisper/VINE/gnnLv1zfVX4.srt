1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,880
 No one likes waiting. I was in the MTR last week at Tsim Sha Tsui. I ran down the

2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:23,040
 escalator to get my train to Central. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the

3
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:33,560
 platform sign. The train will arrive in four minutes.

4
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:54,760
 Aiyah! Four minutes! But what about the 400 silent years? The time between the last

5
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:02,060
 writings of the Old Testament and the appearance of Christ is known as the

6
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:10,080
 Intertestamental Period or Between the Testaments. It lasted from the Prophet

7
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:18,840
 Malachi about 400 BC to the ministry of John the Baptist whose birth we look

8
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:27,840
 forward today as we kick off our Advent series, Surprising Joy. Because there was

9
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:36,300
 no prophetic word from God during the period from Malachi to John, some refer

10
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:49,040
 to it as the 400 silent years. To set the scene I want to read a couple of verses

11
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,620
 from Luke chapter 1. Verse 13 "But the angel said to him, 'Do not be afraid

12
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:03,680
 Zechariah, your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son

13
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:13,120
 and you are to call him John.'" Good name that one. Verse 63 "Zechariah asked for a

14
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:20,100
 writing tablet." No iPads in those days. "And to everyone's astonishment he wrote

15
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:30,640
 this, 'His name is John.'" His name is John. Now the story of Zechariah and

16
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:38,540
 Elizabeth is quite personal to me. My father was 51 years of old when I was

17
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:48,100
 born and I was actually his firstborn. My mom had been widowed. Could you imagine

18
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:56,340
 the excitement of having your first child at that age? My father's name was

19
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:05,620
 John Henry Snelgrove to be precise. But I was born on the 23rd of

20
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:15,660
 April which in the UK is known as St. George's Day, our patron saint. So my mom

21
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:30,980
 decided to call me George. But dad had other ideas and promptly went out to

22
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:36,820
 register me I guess after a celebration drink or three. You guessed it he said

23
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:45,940
 "His name is John." John Henry Snelgrove Jr. made his entry into the world. And by

24
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:51,880
 the way no calling me George after the service. Anyway let's get back to the

25
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:58,260
 sermon. I think sometimes in church in our sermons we are guilty of what I

26
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:07,300
 call verse picking. Reading only verses that suit our sermon story. But today in

27
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,500
 our Advent series and Chapman has already told us about the first coming and the

28
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:17,780
 second coming of Jesus we ask ourselves three questions. The first one's this

29
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:29,660
 what does Advent mean? And the answer is coming. Who is coming? Jesus. What are we

30
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:38,860
 to do? Get ready. So as part of getting ready I'm gonna read the whole passage

31
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:49,100
 21 verses in one go. I'm reading from Luke chapter 1 starting from verse 5.

32
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:56,780
 In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah who belonged to

33
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:06,260
 the priestly division of Abijah. His wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron.

34
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:11,580
 Both of them were righteous in the sight of God observing all the Lord's commands

35
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:21,580
 and decrees blamelessly. But they were childless because Elizabeth was not able

36
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:31,100
 to conceive and they were both very old. Once when Zechariah's division was on

37
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:36,780
 duty and he was serving as a priest before God he was chosen by lot

38
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:41,980
 according to the custom of the priesthood to go into the temple and to

39
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:48,460
 burn the incense. When the time for the burning of incense come all the assembled

40
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:58,460
 worshippers were praying outside. Then I love that word an angel of the Lord

41
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:03,860
 appeared to him standing at the right side of the altar of incense. When

42
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:10,380
 Zechariah saw him he was startled and was gripped with fear. But the angel said

43
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:21,380
 to him do not be afraid Zechariah your prayer has been heard. Your wife

44
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:27,140
 Elizabeth will bear you a son and you are to call him George you are to call

45
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:37,820
 him John. He will be a joy and a delight to you and many will rejoice because of

46
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:42,740
 his birth. For he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take

47
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:50,100
 wine or any other fermented drink and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even

48
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:56,500
 before he is born. He will bring back many of the people of Israel to the Lord

49
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,820
 their God and he will go on before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah

50
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:06,500
 to turn the hearts of the parents to their children and the disobedient to

51
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:14,660
 the wisdom of the righteous and to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.

52
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:25,740
 Zechariah asked the angel how can this be? I'm an old man and my wife well

53
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:33,900
 well she's well along in years. The angel said to him I am Gabriel I stand in the

54
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:38,260
 presence of God and I have been sent to speak to you and tell you this good news

55
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:47,620
 and now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens

56
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:52,580
 because you do not believe my words which will come true at their appointed

57
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:58,660
 time. Meanwhile the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he

58
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:06,860
 stayed so long in the temple. When he came out he could not speak to them. They

59
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:13,460
 realized he had seen a vision in the temple for he kept making signs but

60
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:20,260
 remained unable to speak. When his time of service was completed he went home.

61
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:26,580
 After this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in

62
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:39,220
 seclusion. The Lord has done this for me she said. In these days he has shown

63
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:48,060
 his favor and taken away my disgrace amongst the people. So quite a long

64
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:55,100
 passage and there are three key themes in this passage. Firstly the first theme

65
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:03,340
 is Zechariah and Elizabeth's long years of barrenness. We can assume that

66
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:08,980
 Elizabeth and Zechariah are well past childbearing age we're not told their

67
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:15,140
 exact age or John's birth would not have been considered a miracle. We are told in

68
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:20,980
 verse 7 but they were childless because Elizabeth was not able to conceive and

69
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:27,100
 they were both very old. Anecdotally they would probably be in their 60s and if

70
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:31,440
 they were in Hong Kong they would qualify for a Joy U card and pay two

71
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:38,540
 dollars for travel. The second theme the key theme is the silence of God after

72
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:45,700
 centuries of prophetic absence. I've already described it the 400 silent

73
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:51,460
 years and thirdly the announcement of John's birth breaks the silence bringing

74
00:09:51,460 --> 00:10:01,900
 unexpected joy not only for Elizabeth and Zechariah but also for Israel. This

75
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:12,100
 leads me to ask ourselves have you have you ever experienced a significant

76
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:24,300
 desert season in your life? Let me repeat it. Have you ever experienced a

77
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:31,300
 significant desert season in your life? I've chatted to a few people recently

78
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:39,980
 who have described to me a long season of doubt, confusion, spiritual dryness or

79
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:49,500
 a long season of waiting for something that they long for in their life. I mean

80
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,900
 using my MTR analogy most of us don't even like the experience of short waits.

81
00:10:53,900 --> 00:11:00,460
 I mean have you ever been to McDonald's right you go into McDonald's and you go

82
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:04,100
 what's the shortest queue right? Did you do that? Yeah.

83
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:09,100
 Yes yeah can I get in the shortest queue and you feel so good that you've

84
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,820
 actually got in the shortest queue until the guy in front of you orders 14 Big

85
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:22,620
 Mac meals you know. I read that collectively people spend about 67

86
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:31,100
 billion hours a year waiting in lines and even this small task can be a test

87
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:41,700
 of our patience most days. Even in the short waits the feeling of uncertainty

88
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:47,500
 about their end and the feeling of it being unfair like the guy with the 14

89
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:55,100
 Big Mac meals makes a struggle but then there are experience in life that

90
00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:01,500
 involves not just minutes but months and even years of waiting. It can feel like a

91
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:12,020
 desert or like barrenness. This kind of waiting doesn't just test our patience

92
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:21,340
 it tests our hope. As pastors Sandra and I have walked with countless couples

93
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:31,500
 wrestling with childlessness. It's so hard especially those who are

94
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:40,300
 desperate to have a family of their own but barrenness can take many forms. It

95
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:53,460
 can look like a dryness in your life, a loss, loneliness, rejection. It can be

96
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:59,740
 some relationship not yet reconciled or something you've been asking God to do

97
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:07,900
 in your marriage or in your singleness. It can look like a pain or injustice

98
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:18,220
 you've endured and are asking for healing and restoration or some and I

99
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:26,540
 know this is many of us struggle like depression. You keep asking God to do

100
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:37,140
 something. God do something new but the change hasn't come yet. For many of us

101
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:44,580
 the waiting changes us and yet somehow some of us are able to keep our

102
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:49,660
 hearts alive in the barren places.

103
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:58,700
 Zechariah and Elizabeth were among a people who had experienced a lifetime

104
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:06,820
 waiting in desert circumstances. The nation of Israel was waiting for the

105
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:16,380
 promised Messiah and Zechariah and Elizabeth who were very old and barren

106
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:26,340
 were longing for a child. Their story shows us two ways of responding when God

107
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:39,180
 shows up in those dry hopeless places in our lives. One is skeptical. The other is

108
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:47,100
 full of wonder and we ask the question what is the difference between them? How

109
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:52,820
 can we keep our hearts soft and hopeful so we don't miss God when he shows up?

110
00:14:52,820 --> 00:15:03,300
 I wonder for Zechariah if maybe the experience of God with him in his

111
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:10,900
 waiting wasn't personal for him anymore. I can't imagine what it was like for him

112
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:19,620
 all the years, all the years of asking for a child. The waiting, the possible

113
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:24,940
 stigma of unfaithfulness that others would have felt towards them. Oh God

114
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:29,940
 hasn't blessed you because you're not faithful enough. Even though they had

115
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:36,980
 lived incredibly faithful lives. My friends waiting without answers and

116
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:44,500
 without an end in sight can be excruciating. I think of some of our

117
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:49,860
 asylum seeker friends here at the Vine. I was speaking at the Arise Fellowship

118
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:57,740
 last week and I noticed some of them who've been with us for up to 15 years

119
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:03,660
 without their case getting settled and to be honest nowhere near their case

120
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:11,480
 being settled. In a foreign country no access to an ID card and limited

121
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:21,740
 benefits and even more limited prospects. Waiting is so difficult and often the

122
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:31,820
 waiting changes us. Maybe Zechariah had changed somehow in the waiting. He

123
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:36,780
 clearly kept going through the motions. He was faithful in his duty. He continued

124
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:40,700
 to pray for the redemption of Israel and to believe that God would send Messiah

125
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:55,460
 but maybe he'd lost hope that God would show up in his own personal desert. So

126
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:01,540
 when God shows up in it I have to say an incredibly theatrical encounter to get

127
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:05,500
 his attention and give this personal announcement that he would

128
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:14,740
 indeed have a son. At first Zechariah misses what God is doing. I don't know if you

129
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:20,460
 know but there were nearly 18,000 priests who were each on duty two

130
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:27,780
 weeks a year. They cast lots to see who would burn the incense and offer prayers.

131
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:35,020
 If you get chosen you can never do it again. It's a once-in-a-lifetime

132
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:41,860
 opportunity and some people would never get chosen. Let's read what happened as

133
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:46,300
 Zechariah gets chosen. Verse 8.

134
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:07,820
 What we're going to see is while he is there performing this holy ancient

135
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:13,660
 service for Israel an angel of the Lord shows up to tell him he's going to have a

136
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,620
 son.

137
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,660
 Then the angel of the Lord appeared to him standing at the right side of the altar of

138
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:25,980
 incense. When Zechariah saw him he was startled and gripped with fear. But the

139
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:32,020
 angel said to him, "Do not be afraid Zechariah. Your prayer has been heard.

140
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:41,940
 Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son and you are called him John." God shows up

141
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:51,660
 and Zechariah, you can see it can't you, he's wondering, "How can I be sure?" He says this,

142
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:57,540
 "How can I be sure of this? I'm an old man. My wife is getting on a bit as well. Went

143
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:06,340
 along in years." We hear his skepticism. He has everything he needs to believe

144
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:12,820
 that God could do a great thing for him. Firstly he's a priest. He holds the

145
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:19,300
 stories of God's faithfulness to others like Abraham and Sarah. He has the

146
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:25,420
 stories of his own life and this supernatural encounter. It's pretty

147
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:31,220
 statistically reliable evidence that if an angel shows up and says that God is

148
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:39,700
 going to do a thing, God's going to do that thing. But what he experiences is

149
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:47,260
 skepticism. It's almost like he stopped believing that God will do anything like

150
00:19:47,260 --> 00:20:00,460
 this for him. It's not personal anymore. Maybe under all of our struggling with

151
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:09,620
 the deserts of our lives is this fear, this loss of faith. "Oh we can believe

152
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:16,220
 that God's going to come through for other people but maybe not just for us

153
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:23,940
 anymore." On the other hand, Elizabeth responds differently. She hears the news

154
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:29,860
 in a very different way. Possibly just her old mute husband scribbling a note

155
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:37,580
 or making hand gestures. She probably also notices a few changes in her body

156
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:42,580
 but there were no sonograms or ultrasound. There was no way to be

157
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:50,540
 certain. She could have thought she was crazy or maybe just ill. But somehow she

158
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:59,700
 believed not only that God could do such a thing, she believed he would do such a

159
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:06,380
 thing for her. Can you see that? It's one thing to believe that God could do it.

160
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:12,980
 Another thing that God will do it for me. And she said this, verse 25. I'll put it on

161
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:25,300
 the screen. "The Lord has done this for me." It's personal to her. It's not just about

162
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:32,620
 the redemption of Israel but it is also about God showing up in a very personal

163
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:38,460
 way for her and Zechariah. It has a feeling of intimate worship as we read

164
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:44,580
 how she stays in seclusion for five months and later when Mary visits her a

165
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:49,740
 song of worship pours out of her heart.

166
00:21:50,100 --> 00:22:03,020
 But it leads us to the question, what about us? What about us? The story of

167
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:09,460
 Elizabeth and Zechariah makes me wonder how can we, how can we keep our hearts

168
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:18,060
 soft and hopeful when we encounter deserts in our life? What are a few ways

169
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:24,740
 we can keep our life with God personal? I want to suggest a couple of things.

170
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:32,540
 Number one in this Thanksgiving week, remember and be thankful. It helps to

171
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:40,460
 remember ways he has shown up for us before and for those around us. Being

172
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:47,020
 thankful is a way of acknowledging his active work around us and reminds our

173
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:55,100
 hearts that he is not far away. Passively watching our lives involved. He is close and

174
00:22:55,100 --> 00:23:03,140
 he's acting on behalf of those he loves. To be honest if I had unlimited time

175
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:07,020
 today I would go around the congregation and ask you all to say one thing that

176
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:12,220
 you were thankful for. Maybe just think about that now. What are you thankful for?

177
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:17,580
 Remember it and be thankful. That's number one. Number two, nurture an intimate

178
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:25,340
 friendship with God. Everyone does this differently but any relationship

179
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:31,980
 requires time and presence, listening and learning in order to grow. Reading or

180
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:38,460
 listening to Scripture, praying, learning to listen to the voice of God, finding

181
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:45,740
 ways to glimpse how good and just how faithful God is often leads to worship

182
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:51,740
 because it's our natural response to be in awe when we are reminded of God's

183
00:23:51,740 --> 00:24:02,140
 greatness and his love. And the third one is be around spiritual family. When the

184
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:08,620
 desert is hard and testing our hope, we need people in our life who will remind

185
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:15,500
 us that God still knows our name. He still sees our life and that he will

186
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:20,620
 come through to us. And if you're not in a community group or a small group, get

187
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:30,020
 in one now. Be around spiritual family. We may not get to encounter with an angel

188
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:36,940
 but Jesus is always showing up in our lives. And if Jesus is always personal

189
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:45,660
 for us, we can find flourishing even in the desert. Let me finish with an

190
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:52,700
 illustration. There are parts of the Atacama Desert in Chile where no rain

191
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:59,420
 has ever been recorded. Scientists believe that portions of the region have

192
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:06,380
 been in extreme desert state for 40 million years, longer than any other

193
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:14,660
 place on earth. And yet more than 1 million people live in the Atacama

194
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:20,260
 currently. Farmers have found way to extract enough water from underground

195
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:26,860
 water supplies and snow melt streams to grow crops and raise llamas and alpacas.

196
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:39,020
 In 2015, a portion of the desert received a historic rainfall just under one inch

197
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:47,380
 of rain in one day. It may not seem very much, particularly those of us who come

198
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:56,740
 from England, but it was the equivalent of 14 years of rainfall for this region

199
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:04,700
 all in one day. And this desert that had already found a way to thrive and

200
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:12,660
 sustain more than 1 million people was now also covered in a beautiful layer of

201
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:21,100
 pink and purple bloom after the rain. Let's look at the picture.

202
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:33,100
 My friends, this is a picture of your life. Yeah, take it. Share it. Post and tag.

203
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:46,460
 Go on. This is in the driest place on the whole earth. What a picture. My friends,

204
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:54,260
 the message of this Advent is that Jesus has come to take away the barrenness of

205
00:26:54,260 --> 00:27:02,580
 the world. He can make us flourish and bring beauty even in the deserted places

206
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:16,380
 of our lives. If you are in a season of waiting, how is the waiting changing you?

207
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:25,660
 Maybe today, yes today, Jesus wants to renew your hope that he is showing up in

208
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:33,820
 the barren places of your life. As I ask the band to come up, I'm going to ask you

209
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,940
 just to close your eyes for a moment.

210
00:27:36,940 --> 00:28:00,460
 We're going to pray now as a church for anyone here who is waiting. I suspect it's

211
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:07,220
 many of us. Maybe you're like Zechariah and Elizabeth. You're a couple waiting for a

212
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:16,700
 baby, waiting to get pregnant. It hasn't happened. Maybe you're waiting for that

213
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:27,140
 relationship. When is God going to bring that person into my life that will allow

214
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:34,660
 me to walk through life with? Maybe you're waiting for a job or a job

215
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:41,220
 opportunity. Maybe you're waiting for a time just to get out of the depression

216
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:45,860
 you're in. You've got that sort of mood around you and it's around you

217
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:50,420
 the whole time. How long is this going to go on for Lord? When am I going to see

218
00:28:50,420 --> 00:29:02,220
 joy again? Whatever it is, if you're waiting today, we're going to pray for you.

219
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:09,980
 So keep your eyes closed for a moment. If you're waiting for something, whatever it

220
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:14,900
 is, just put your hands up and we're going to pray for you. If you're waiting for

221
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:22,180
 something.

222
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:26,460
 Alright, now just open your eyes everyone and keep your hands up. Can the people

223
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:33,380
 around these people just go and lay hands on them? It's not too late. People who have

224
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:37,460
 got their hands up, can you just go around? This is not me praying for

225
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:40,380
 everybody. This is not the way we do church. The church prays for the church.

226
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:44,860
 Find a person with their hands up. There are people all over the place. Please

227
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:50,620
 look and if you haven't got your hands up, go and pray for someone.

228
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:58,180
 Come on guys, I need you to be part of this.

229
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:09,980
 If you're waiting, I'm not going to ask you what you're waiting for. It'll be different

230
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:13,620
 for each one of us. There's a lady at the back waiting. Some people at the back

231
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:17,100
 waiting. Can people go and pray for them?

232
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:23,340
 Come on, this is part of us growing as a church, growing as a family. When we see

233
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:27,700
 people in our family struggling with something, to go and reach out to them.

234
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:32,580
 Just reach out your hands to them. You don't have to pray the most wonderful

235
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:39,340
 prayer, but just lay your hands. Just say, "I care. You're my family. The vine, you and

236
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:45,620
 long." We're building a family here. If you're waiting, we're waiting with you.

237
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:50,140
 We believe that God is going to come through.

238
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:54,700
 Just continue to pray.

239
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:59,380
 I'm going to pray a prayer.

240
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:06,460
 Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord. Let's just take a couple minutes on this. This is

241
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:13,020
 important. Don't miss anybody out. Thank you Lord.

242
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:28,580
 There's a wonderful sense of the Spirit's presence with us now. Let's just not rush

243
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:35,100
 out of this. Let's not rush out down to lunch, down to Q and McDonald's, or

244
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:42,780
 everybody else. Let's take this time to ask God to come and meet us. Lord, just as

245
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:48,060
 you came and met Zechariah and Elizabeth, just as you came and met the nation of

246
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:56,300
 Israel and sent Jesus, just as you sent John the Baptist to this couple that

247
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:02,420
 were barren, Lord take the barren areas of our lives, the things we're waiting

248
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:07,300
 for, the relationships, the jobs.

249
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:14,300
 Just that approval for that thing.

250
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:25,220
 When we pray Holy Spirit, You just come right now. You're already here. Yep. But Lord,

251
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:34,660
 we ask for more of Your presence, more of Your reassurance that You are in control

252
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:38,300
 even when we are not.

253
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:51,180
 Take away the pain of waiting and replace it with the birth of a new

254
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:58,380
 season, a new opportunity, a new calling.

255
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:08,260
 I believe there are people here who are wrestling with a new calling. God is

256
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:16,220
 calling you to do something. It may be here in the church just volunteering for

257
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:22,380
 something. It may be going into some full-time ministry. And you've been

258
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:30,820
 wrestling with it. God says, "I'm here." John the Baptist is here. Israel is here.

259
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:40,100
 Receive your calling. Walk into your calling. Use this season of Advent to

260
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:49,100
 move into what God has for you. John the Baptist changed Elizabeth and Zechariah's

261
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:57,700
 life forever. Jesus Christ changed Israel forever, the promised Messiah.

262
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:03,860
 There is a promise over you.

263
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:13,860
 I want all of you now to actually visualise the place where you work.

264
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:21,060
 Right? I want you to visualise your workplace and your colleagues.

265
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:29,980
 My friends, that is your church. That is your calling. As you go into work

266
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:38,380
 tomorrow morning, you go as a representative of the Lord Jesus Christ.

267
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:45,300
 You have authority. You have power. You have a calling. And I pray for every

268
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:49,820
 workplace that is represented here today.

269
00:34:52,060 --> 00:35:01,180
 I pray, Lord, for the opportunity we have. I'll be honest with you. I reached

270
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:04,660
 more people for Jesus when I was working in an insurance company than I do

271
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:10,340
 working at a church. Because I spend too much of my time with Christians now.

272
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:17,860
 Those people that you are going to see tomorrow at work, those people in your

273
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:22,580
 family, God is calling you to.

274
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:36,180
 The cast of Disney. It's a big mission field. I bless you.

275
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:43,180
 Manage to go and just be Jesus to them.

276
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:58,180
 And we pray in this Advent season that you will use us to draw people to Christ.

277
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:05,140
 Yes, we have services on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. What an opportunity

278
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:11,540
 for you to ask people to come with you if you get there early.

279
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:23,100
 Church is not about coming here for an hour and a quarter on a Sunday morning

280
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:31,780
 to hear a sermon. You are being empowered. You are being commissioned.

281
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:40,220
 Why would God use me? God would use you. God used Zechariah and

282
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:47,460
 Elizabeth to bring about John the Baptist, who was the forerunner of Jesus.

283
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:57,260
 Tim wants to share a word.

284
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:07,420
 Thank you. Actually John was there, it was a few weeks ago, there was a prophetic

285
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:15,180
 word in a pastor's prayer meeting. And the prophetic word was that, you know a

286
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:19,100
 lot of times with Christmas we just rush through the season, we look for the next

287
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:28,780
 year. But it was the story of Canaan, where Jesus, He at the end of the wedding,

288
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:34,020
 not at the beginning of the wedding, He turned water into wine. He took something

289
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:37,940
 ordinary and He did something extraordinary, something unexpected. It

290
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:42,740
 was the good wine, the best wine. It came at the end of the year. And there was a

291
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:50,060
 sense that God wants to pour out His good wine at the end of the year. That He

292
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:58,020
 wants that the best is to come right now. And not to miss Him, not to miss

293
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:05,580
 what He wants to do. He wants to turn that water into extraordinary, delicious

294
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:14,460
 wine. And so we can miss Him, we can rush through the season. But He wants

295
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,660
 to work in your life. And I felt as John was sharing, I felt this word was

296
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:23,500
 actually for now. You know God wants to pour out His goodness on you now.

297
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:30,620
 Do you understand? As we prepare to sing our final song, I just want you to hold

298
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:35,260
 your hands open and offer Him your water.

299
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:43,580
 The wine's run out, but we know the best wine is yet to come.

300
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:48,580
 I just want to confirm that word that Tim's just shared with us. That God wants

301
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:53,060
 to take your dirty, smelly water. That water was actually the ones that the

302
00:38:53,060 --> 00:39:00,100
 servants used to bathe their feet in. And it became the best wine.

303
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:10,420
 Holy Spirit come to us. Come to this church. Come to Yuen Long. Come to Hong Kong.

304
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:17,040
 Help us not go through the motions of Christmas. Help us not to talk about the

305
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:24,140
 decorations in Landmark and all the other things that we see. Good as they are.

306
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:31,500
 Turn our water into wine. And I've just got a vision as this is, that wine is

307
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:37,260
 being turned out and poured down the stairs of this church. And poured onto

308
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:43,020
 the streets of Yuen Long and into Hong Kong. People need to hear this.

309
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:49,740
 That's why I prayed for you earlier. The people in your office tomorrow are gonna hear this.

310
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:54,420
 You might just say something, "Hey, do you know what we did in church yesterday?

311
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:59,700
 Seemed really odd, but we took the water because we believe. We believe that the

312
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:06,060
 best wine is yet to come. That this Advent season, you are pouring out new wine

313
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:13,900
 amongst us. Fill us Lord. Fill us afresh with the new wine. And Lord, we don't want a

314
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:22,660
 little taste. We want to be bathed. Bathed in the new wine of your Holy Spirit.

315
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:34,120
 Lord, send us out from this place in the power of your Holy Spirit to live and

316
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:37,500
 work to your praise and glory.

317
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:46,220
 Let's go and be filled as we sing this song.
