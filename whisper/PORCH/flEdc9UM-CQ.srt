1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:12,460
 - Hey, welcome friends in the room,

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,060
 friends in Fort Worth and in Houston

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,160
 and El Paso and Tulsa and everywhere joining us

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,920
 to find out other places that are joining us.

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,180
 And we actually have a new website that just launched.

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,120
 And if you go to the porch.live, which is the new website,

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,580
 you can find out all the different locations.

9
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,680
 People will email and say, is there a porch

10
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,140
 live streaming location near me?

11
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,840
 Now they're all consolidated on our new website.

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,020
 So if you go to our new website, you can go check that out.

13
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,600
 We are gonna continue the series First Comes Love.

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,960
 I'm gonna start with a little bit of confession.

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,960
 I have never seen the top two grossing movies of all time.

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,840
 The first one is Avatar, which is just blue people

17
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,200
 and it wasn't for me.

18
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,260
 And so didn't feel compelled, still don't really to see it.

19
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:04,260
 And the second one is a probably much more famous

20
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,880
 in this room movie known as the Titanic.

21
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,260
 Yeah, I know.

22
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,580
 I don't know where I was in 1997,

23
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,260
 but I apparently wasn't seeing Jack.

24
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:19,860
 And so here's why I'm not compelled even today

25
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,780
 to go see it and stay with me before you're like,

26
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,820
 oh my gosh, this guy hates love.

27
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,640
 Is because if you go and you haven't seen it

28
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,720
 and you're like, man, what's the big deal?

29
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,820
 I mean, this movie was the biggest blockbuster

30
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,640
 that the world had ever seen to the date.

31
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,980
 It's still in the top two.

32
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:35,200
 It was the first movie to ever break a billion dollars

33
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,980
 in gross sales and it broke it and did 1.8 billion

34
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,900
 in the first few months that it was out.

35
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,380
 I mean, it literally was a movie that everywhere,

36
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,140
 everyone was seeing once, twice, few times.

37
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,340
 And yet if you were to go back, if you didn't,

38
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,580
 if you're like me and you're one of the few

39
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,420
 and you go back and you're like, man,

40
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,420
 what was the big deal about this movie?

41
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,900
 And you go read the plot, it is not going to give you

42
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,220
 a compelling sell on why you should see the movie.

43
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,060
 In other words, I think if you kind of remove

44
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,340
 the Celine Dion from the background and the boat scene,

45
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,200
 it's not gonna be a really compelling plot line

46
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,040
 that makes you wanna go.

47
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:10,940
 'Cause here's what you'll discover.

48
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,580
 If you go read it without having seen it

49
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,500
 and you go read it like I did, which was this week,

50
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,100
 going, man, what was the big deal about this movie?

51
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:20,660
 You discover it's this tale of this guy named Jack

52
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,740
 who essentially gambles his way onto a boat

53
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,740
 by a poker hand and he gets onto this boat

54
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:30,740
 and there he meets a woman who's already engaged,

55
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,500
 but she's emotionally unstable and suicidal

56
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,700
 because of that engagement.

57
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,500
 And she attempts to give her life away

58
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,100
 and Jack stops her in the nick of time.

59
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,460
 And then the two of them hit it off.

60
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,420
 They begin to feel like there's some sort

61
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,500
 of love connection going on and she falls in love

62
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,260
 with this kind of jobless wanderer in life.

63
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,340
 And they have sex and then he dies like four hours later

64
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,340
 'cause she wouldn't scoot over on the raft.

65
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,100
 [audience laughing]

66
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:04,100
 And then she spends the next 80 years

67
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:09,380
 married to another guy, grieving the loss of her loved Jack

68
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:12,260
 who never let go until he did.

69
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,780
 And it's just not a big sell.

70
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,660
 I mean, if you think, in the movie, I know you're like,

71
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,580
 oh my gosh, I cannot believe you're saying this right now.

72
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,060
 Like if you just kind of strip away

73
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,180
 and just read the plot line, you're like,

74
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,300
 man, that sounds like a terrible plot.

75
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:28,900
 It is a romantic tragedy to say the least.

76
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,500
 And yet at the same time that if you kind of dissect

77
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,180
 and you pull apart some of the things that make it,

78
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,500
 music in the background and all the things

79
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,460
 that make it special, there's something

80
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,820
 about romantic tragedies in general

81
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,860
 that we're all just drawn to.

82
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,260
 Like none of us would want the story for our children

83
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,140
 or for a sister or for someone that we love

84
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,260
 to be the story of Jack.

85
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,820
 And then let me tell you how I met your mom.

86
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,280
 She was about to jump off this boat

87
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,180
 and I came down.

88
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,500
 I mean, nobody would want that for like a child

89
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,700
 or a daughter to marry someone who's kind of

90
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,460
 this jobless wanderer who has sex

91
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,380
 with his daughter on night one.

92
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,900
 I mean, nobody would want that story

93
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,940
 after painting her naked.

94
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,180
 It's just a weird plot line.

95
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,220
 And yet there's something inside of us that's drawn to it.

96
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,700
 There's something inside of us over and over again.

97
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,400
 We see just the way that we're drawn to,

98
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,800
 whether it's, you know, La La Land

99
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,100
 and these romantic tragedies.

100
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,060
 I mean, the most famous of Romeo and Juliet

101
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,380
 where these lovers destined to be together

102
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,080
 but not destined and die in one another's arms

103
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,160
 where we're just like fascinated as a society, culture,

104
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,900
 and really people have kind of always been

105
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,520
 by the idea of a romantic tragedy.

106
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,840
 And if we had time, we not even could stop at movies

107
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,040
 and just say, man, it's all over the movie screen.

108
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,800
 People are interested or fascinated by it.

109
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,880
 They may not want that story for, you know,

110
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,960
 someone they love, but they kind of have

111
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,240
 some part of them that's drawn to it.

112
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,600
 We see it inside of our music too.

113
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,980
 I mean, Taylor Swift has made a killing

114
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,560
 being able to monetize this

115
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,180
 where she is like, look, I knew you were trouble

116
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,820
 when you walked in and you got to ask,

117
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,080
 then why did you date him, Taylor?

118
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,080
 Why would he be interested if you're saying

119
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,320
 that you have, you know, a list of ex lovers,

120
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,560
 this long list and they all think you're insane

121
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,000
 and you're willing to write his name next to it.

122
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,400
 Why would that be appealing to us?

123
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,440
 Why are we drawn into that?

124
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,100
 Why is every song that it seems like Taylor or Adele

125
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,200
 or these musicians will put out that's related to romance,

126
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,320
 it all has this kind of twisted romantic tragedy

127
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,220
 involved in it.

128
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,120
 And I think if we're honest

129
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,880
 and we actually took time to really sit down

130
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,000
 and think about it, we'd probably discover that

131
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,440
 despite the fact that man, there's part of us

132
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,320
 that's drawn to it, if we'd really thought about it,

133
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,920
 in the same way we wouldn't want someone that we care,

134
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,880
 we wouldn't want our sister to have a love story

135
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,960
 that looks like Taylor's or like Romeo and Juliet's,

136
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,520
 we wouldn't want ourselves to have a love story

137
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,840
 that looks like that, where we meet someone

138
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,920
 and then they die a few hours later after we slept together

139
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,520
 and then we mourn them for the rest of our life.

140
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,600
 At the end of the day, I mean, it's like heartbreaking.

141
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,360
 And yet it's so common.

142
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,800
 The romantic tragedy is not a commonly

143
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,440
 in a way that looks like the Titanic,

144
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,560
 it's common that people step into romance

145
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,920
 and then just tragedy ensues.

146
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,040
 It's all over our country, it's all over the marriage rate,

147
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,760
 it's all over just the ways that the collapse of marriage

148
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,440
 is taking place in our country,

149
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,900
 where there's tragedy all over the romance,

150
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,480
 even inside of the romances inside of the church.

151
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,520
 So tonight, what I wanted to do as we continue the series

152
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,720
 is we're gonna look at a story,

153
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,560
 a romantic tragedy from the Bible,

154
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,340
 maybe the most famous romantic and the tragedies

155
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,720
 that were a part of his life, a guy by the name of Samson

156
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,100
 and Samson's girl named Delilah.

157
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,860
 We're gonna look not just at Delilah,

158
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,240
 but Samson actually, I mean, so we all know Samson,

159
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,560
 a lot of us know Samson, Samson's dude,

160
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,280
 super strong, super man, but Samson had a kryptonite.

161
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,480
 Samson liked the ladies and it was these ladies

162
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,340
 that we're gonna look at tonight

163
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,300
 that ultimately led to his downfall.

164
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,800
 'Cause he perfected, not just with Delilah,

165
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,960
 he perfected the romantic tragedy twice.

166
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,920
 And we're gonna look and learn from his example

167
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,080
 of really what not to do.

168
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,760
 Tonight, last week, we really talked to the ladies

169
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,680
 about what guy to look for and to the guys,

170
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,100
 hey, this is the guy to be, and ladies,

171
00:06:59,100 --> 00:06:59,940
 this is the guy to date.

172
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:00,940
 Tonight, we're really gonna talk about,

173
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:04,520
 hey guys, this is the lady to look for or to not look for,

174
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,160
 and this is the lady to date or to not date.

175
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,600
 So we're gonna be at Judges chapter 14,

176
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,480
 we're gonna pick up the story of Samson.

177
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,760
 As I said, Samson was the leader,

178
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,920
 or Samson was supernaturally strong, we know that part.

179
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,560
 You may not know, Samson was the leader

180
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,240
 of the nation of Israel at that time.

181
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,280
 Nation of Israel had an arch nemesis,

182
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,720
 enemy nation called the Philistines.

183
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,920
 And Samson, his job, ultimately, God said from birth,

184
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,360
 he showed up to Samson's parents,

185
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,400
 said you're gonna have a baby boy,

186
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,960
 he's gonna be supernaturally strong,

187
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,720
 he's gonna be set apart from me,

188
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,520
 a Nazarite is what that means.

189
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,400
 You can't cut his hair, he can't drink alcohol,

190
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,240
 and he can't touch dead bodies,

191
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,540
 because he's gonna be set apart from me,

192
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,280
 and he is going to lead his people

193
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,240
 to conquer the enemy of God, the Philistines.

194
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,640
 And so we pick up Samson's story,

195
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,020
 and right off the bat, learn from his example,

196
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,040
 really, of what not to do.

197
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,240
 So Judges chapter 14, verse one, we'll start right there.

198
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,560
 If you don't have a Bible, it would be up on the screen.

199
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,880
 Judges chapter 14, as we learn tonight's subject,

200
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,880
 how to avoid a romantic tragedy in your life.

201
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:10,880
 How to avoid a romantic tragedy in your life.

202
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,860
 Verse one, chapter 14.

203
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,640
 One day, when Samson was at Timnah,

204
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,940
 which is just a city in Philistine country,

205
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,380
 a Philistine woman caught his eye.

206
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:24,780
 When he returned home, he told his mother and his father,

207
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,940
 hey, a young Philistine woman in Timnah caught my eye,

208
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,980
 I wanna marry her, get her for me,

209
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,880
 which is an interesting approach.

210
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,140
 Think about this, if you leave the port.

211
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:35,280
 Hey mom, I saw this girl at the port, get her for me.

212
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,420
 Whatever works, Samson goes, tells his parents,

213
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,060
 here's what happens, verse three.

214
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,040
 His father and his mother objected and said,

215
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,000
 isn't there a woman in our own tribe

216
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,600
 or among all the Israelites that you could marry?

217
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,880
 They asked, why must you go to the pagan Philistines,

218
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,600
 pagan just meaning they don't share the same belief

219
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,960
 in God that we do.

220
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,800
 They're not among our people,

221
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,840
 they don't believe in the God that we do, to find a wife.

222
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,200
 But Samson told his father, get her for me,

223
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,760
 she looks good to me.

224
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,480
 Literally, your translation may have, dude, she's hot.

225
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,200
 I like the way that she looks, I want you to go get her.

226
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,820
 Now, the Israel nation had been told,

227
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,360
 commanded by God in Deuteronomy,

228
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,700
 which is one of the Old Testament books,

229
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,800
 hey, you're not to marry outside of the people of God.

230
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,060
 Not for racial reasons,

231
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,000
 or not for just God being angry reasons,

232
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,620
 because I want you to be devoted to the one true God.

233
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,020
 And Philistines and other nations,

234
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,140
 they don't believe in the one true God,

235
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,220
 so you're not to marry outside.

236
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,460
 And his parents go, Samson,

237
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,920
 we're not supposed to marry outside.

238
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,340
 Samson says, I don't care, she's hot,

239
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,640
 I think I got a shot, go get her.

240
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,580
 Samson would have loved, I mean,

241
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,840
 it's essentially like the tender form of dating, isn't it?

242
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,460
 He's like, man, she's hot, swipe right,

243
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,460
 that's all I need to know.

244
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,900
 And so Samson looks, sees a girl,

245
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,740
 says, mom and dad, go get her.

246
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,760
 And he gives us really, inside of this,

247
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,040
 what will soon become just a pain-filled marriage,

248
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,880
 the first principle,

249
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,560
 if you wanna have a romantic tragedy in your life,

250
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,720
 that you look for a lady who's outside of God's people.

251
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,600
 Or, if you wanna avoid a romantic tragedy

252
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,440
 inside of your life,

253
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,020
 you look for someone who is inside and among God's people.

254
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,920
 Our first point from the text is men.

255
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,140
 If you wanna look for,

256
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,480
 or if you wanna have not a romantic tragedy in your life,

257
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,060
 'cause I know the fellas in the room,

258
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,440
 if anybody doesn't want a romantic tragedy, it's you.

259
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,380
 You don't wanna see a romantic tragedy on a movie screen,

260
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,600
 let alone live a romantic tragedy.

261
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,440
 And the first thing we can learn from Samson

262
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,320
 is you and I are not called, don't,

263
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,480
 are called by God to not look outside of God's people.

264
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,520
 In the nation of Israel, for Samson,

265
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,000
 or in Samson's time, it was the nation of Israel,

266
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,840
 for us, what does that mean?

267
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,280
 The church.

268
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,840
 That, in other words, if you are a follower of Jesus,

269
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,180
 you and I are called not to look for a spouse

270
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,520
 outside of God's people.

271
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,260
 And this flies in the face of what you're gonna hear

272
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,180
 from the culture around us that are gonna say,

273
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,180
 look, love knows no boundaries.

274
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,980
 Don't put love in a box.

275
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,920
 You can't just confine romance.

276
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,740
 Let the heart lead you where it will lead you.

277
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,160
 If they're Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, whatever it is,

278
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,740
 let love lead you there.

279
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,900
 Don't confine yourself to this small group.

280
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,660
 And the Bible would say, if you do that,

281
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:59,120
 you are inviting pain into your life.

282
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,940
 And you are a fool.

283
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,100
 You're gonna raise children out of the perspective,

284
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,540
 or you should be raising, out of the perspective

285
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,700
 of the faith that you have in Christ.

286
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,900
 You can't just say, man, whatever faith will make it work,

287
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,580
 you will be at odds daily with the most important

288
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,980
 human relationship you have, a spouse.

289
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,500
 Beyond your master, who's gonna be your God

290
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,100
 is choosing your mate.

291
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,620
 And the Bible says, man, don't go outside of God's people.

292
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,580
 And yet, at the same time, it also gives us, man,

293
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,420
 this is gonna be encouraging,

294
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,660
 'cause like we talked about last week,

295
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,100
 the Bible doesn't teach that you're looking for a one.

296
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,900
 Like, the idea of the one, this mythical person

297
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,520
 who's out there right now, and she perfectly completes you,

298
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,700
 or the guy who's out there who perfectly completes you

299
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,540
 is a myth.

300
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,940
 It's out there with the unicorn and the abominable snowman

301
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,820
 and the leprechaun off the Lucky Charms box.

302
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,260
 It doesn't exist out there.

303
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,780
 That it's not a one that you're looking for,

304
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,780
 and stay with me, stay with me.

305
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:52,540
 It is someone from among God's people.

306
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,260
 In other words, there's not one person that you could marry.

307
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,140
 There is a group of someones that you could marry.

308
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,860
 That someones, and the name of that group is the church,

309
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,760
 the body of Christ, not cultural Christians

310
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,980
 who are willing to go to church on a Tuesday night,

311
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,240
 not even people who go to the ports,

312
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,720
 someone who's wholeheartedly following Christ,

313
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,520
 that you and I are not to look for the one

314
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:17,240
 out there somewhere, but for someone

315
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,160
 from among God's people.

316
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,000
 Here's what this means.

317
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,400
 Inside of the room, this is gonna be like,

318
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,620
 I'm gonna hammer this home.

319
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:25,560
 If you're single, seated around you right now

320
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,560
 are hundreds of girls you could marry and make it work with.

321
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,860
 Seated around you right now, inside of where you are.

322
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,700
 And I know you're like, yeah, I mean, maybe, I don't know.

323
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,580
 'Cause there's part of us that kind of wants to believe

324
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,660
 in the star-crossed lovers,

325
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,860
 and we found serendipitously each other.

326
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,420
 And the Bible says it's just not true

327
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,860
 that seated around you, what is gonna make

328
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:46,640
 or break your marriage is gonna be, do they follow Jesus?

329
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,300
 Are they following Jesus right now,

330
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,960
 seated all the way around you?

331
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,540
 Are different people that you could work,

332
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,840
 or that you could marry and make it work with?

333
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,540
 And I think part of us just goes, no,

334
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,520
 but I need to find the person that I'm most compatible with,

335
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,460
 even within the small group of God's people.

336
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,040
 I haven't checked all the churches around here,

337
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,260
 and I need to make sure that I find the person

338
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,100
 who's most compatible.

339
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,440
 Here's, let me just burst the bubble

340
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,740
 for anybody who believes that.

341
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,180
 You will not find the person who's most compatible.

342
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,100
 It is literally impossible.

343
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,200
 And you may be going, oh, all right,

344
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,660
 well, I like a challenge, bring it on.

345
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,580
 It's literally impossible.

346
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,060
 Here's what I mean.

347
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,300
 If you were to take, so there's 80 million millennials,

348
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,780
 stay with me, this is gonna be a lot of numbers.

349
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,920
 But if you just took, hey, inside of that,

350
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,340
 the percentage of people who claim to be evangelicals

351
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:34,140
 and followers of Jesus, let's call it around 7 million

352
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:37,620
 of the opposite sex, and that's even like a conservative,

353
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,860
 that maybe there's seven, maybe there's 10,

354
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,900
 but even if you said, all right, there's 7 million,

355
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,020
 in order for you to find the one most compatible for you,

356
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,220
 you've gotta meet all of them.

357
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,860
 Do you know how long it would take you

358
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,260
 to spend five minutes with all of them out there?

359
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:54,340
 47 years.

360
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,500
 That's how long it would, it literally is an impossible,

361
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,020
 if you're like, man, I'm just looking for the person

362
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,620
 who is a follower of Christ,

363
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,420
 who's most compatible for me, I'm looking.

364
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,940
 You will not find her.

365
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,980
 You will never find her.

366
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:07,020
 You are going to marry someone who's incompatible for you,

367
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,100
 not only 'cause of time's not on your side,

368
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,340
 but you're a sinner, and so will she be.

369
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,300
 And when you take two sinners, they're incompatible

370
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,320
 for every person on the planet.

371
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,600
 The Bible doesn't teach to look for a one,

372
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,860
 it doesn't even look for the one

373
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,100
 who's best, most compatible to complete you.

374
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,100
 Let me use a personal example.

375
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,420
 Could my wife, Callie, have married someone

376
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,960
 more compatible for her?

377
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,580
 Yes, absolutely.

378
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,860
 We are so night and day different.

379
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,740
 If we do any sort of like personality tests,

380
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,360
 anybody ever done personality tests in here,

381
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,740
 like StrengthsFinders or Myers-Briggs?

382
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:44,300
 Our Myers-Briggs, they literally are perfect opposites.

383
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,740
 She's an introvert, I'm like an extra extrovert.

384
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,500
 She is a feeler, I'm a thinker.

385
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,460
 I mean, everything's different.

386
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,920
 Even the way that we like think about food,

387
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,280
 like her ideal scenario for going out to eat

388
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,520
 would be a different place every time

389
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,820
 and never go to the same place.

390
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,040
 I could eat at Chick-fil-A every meal

391
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,780
 for the rest of my life

392
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:04,380
 because I'm a Christian and an American.

393
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,660
 (audience laughing)

394
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,500
 That's not true.

395
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,820
 Oh, that is true, but that's not the reason.

396
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,660
 But Chick-fil-A, if you're out there,

397
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,700
 we're open to sponsorships.

398
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,020
 Kidding, okay.

399
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,900
 Hey, we're just, of course you could have found somebody

400
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,900
 even within God's people.

401
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,180
 The reason why she and I, or she is the one

402
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,220
 is because we're married, not because she's the one

403
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,360
 who's most compatible for me.

404
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,700
 And the person that you marry

405
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,220
 will not be the person on the planet

406
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,780
 who's most compatible for you.

407
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,780
 And the decision that you and I have

408
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,000
 is are we going to listen to God's command,

409
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,020
 which is, hey man, the way to avoid a romantic tragedy

410
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:42,440
 is to not let love lead, but let God's word lead,

411
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,040
 and to marry not the one, but someone

412
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,420
 from among God's people, and to follow Jesus together

413
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,300
 all in wholeheartedly.

414
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,460
 Samson gives us the first example.

415
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,700
 If you wanna love life, that's a train wreck.

416
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:59,240
 You go pursue, date somebody who's not a believer,

417
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,300
 who doesn't have the same faith that you have,

418
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,020
 and the same God, and you are setting yourself up

419
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:05,840
 for disaster.

420
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,420
 So what happens next is Samson goes

421
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:12,700
 and they have his parents bring about

422
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:16,820
 and go bring this woman to Samson,

423
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,680
 and basically the marriage is arranged,

424
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,520
 and they show up to her hometown, Samson and his family,

425
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,000
 and they come and they get everything together,

426
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,740
 and they're about to get married.

427
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,060
 And Samson, honestly, he's not a great guy

428
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,340
 when you read this part of the story.

429
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,900
 Like he clearly has some character problems,

430
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,500
 he clearly loves me some me, and he clearly

431
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,520
 is not a guy who's walking humbly with the Lord.

432
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,980
 And so while he's at the wedding, he picks a fight

433
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,620
 with the people from the town, the men from the town,

434
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,260
 these Philistine men, and he basically says,

435
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,260
 look, hey, I'll give you a riddle.

436
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,140
 If you can solve my riddle in seven days,

437
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,660
 I'll give you 30 outfits of clothes,

438
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,820
 which is just random, but there were 30 guys.

439
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,100
 And so I'll give each one of you a set of clothes.

440
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:58,040
 If you can't solve my riddle in seven days,

441
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,640
 then you give me 30 pairs of clothes.

442
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,000
 They take the riddle, they're like,

443
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,360
 of course we'll be able to solve it.

444
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,640
 He's just, he's the riddler.

445
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,720
 He does this over and over again,

446
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,580
 but he does this riddle, and the guys can't figure it out.

447
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,520
 And so one day goes by, two days, three days, four days,

448
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,800
 and they go to Samson's wife.

449
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,120
 I mean, they're on the honeymoon, and they're like,

450
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,560
 hey, if you don't tell us the answer to the riddle,

451
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,260
 we're gonna kill you and your dad.

452
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,500
 And Samson's wife goes into a panic mode.

453
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,780
 She doesn't do what you would think she would do,

454
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,660
 which is like, I'm married to the Hulk.

455
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,500
 What do you want?

456
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,660
 Come for it, let's go.

457
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:35,660
 She, in fear, tries to take control of the circumstances.

458
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,380
 And she tries to manipulate and get Samson

459
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,900
 to give her the answer, because in her fear,

460
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,100
 she just does what's irrational.

461
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,300
 I mean, she's married to Superman,

462
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,340
 but she's terrified of what possibly

463
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,500
 could happen in the future, and it leads her to do this.

464
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,420
 Here's what it says, verse 14 of chapter 14.

465
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,700
 Three days into this, they were still trying

466
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,640
 to figure out the riddle.

467
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,720
 On the fourth day, they said to Samson's wife,

468
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,020
 entice your husband to explain the riddle,

469
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,840
 or we will burn down your father's house with you in it.

470
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,500
 Did you invite us to this party just to make us poor?

471
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,000
 So Samson's wife came to him in tears.

472
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,540
 She's afraid of what they could do, and said,

473
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:08,840
 you don't love me, you hate me.

474
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,820
 You have given me a riddle, given my people a riddle,

475
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,320
 and you haven't told me the answer.

476
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,440
 Samson said, I haven't even given the answer

477
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,700
 to my father and my mother.

478
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,440
 Why should I tell you?

479
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,620
 And so she cried, man, his parents,

480
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,740
 they were thick as thieves, man.

481
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,940
 All right, verse 17.

482
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,500
 So she cried whenever she's with him.

483
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,820
 They're on the honeymoon, and she kept it up

484
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,580
 for the rest of the celebration, that's the honeymoon.

485
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,700
 At last, on the seventh day, he told her the answer,

486
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,980
 'cause she was tormenting him with her nagging.

487
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,880
 And then she went and she explained, man,

488
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,060
 that girl, that girl's poison right there.

489
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:43,440
 And she went and explained the riddle to the Philistines.

490
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,560
 And Samson eventually realizes what had happened,

491
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,380
 and he gets all upset, he picks a fight with him.

492
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,980
 And all of a sudden, like everything goes into turmoil,

493
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,660
 and his wife ends up leaving him.

494
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:59,940
 In the midst of all the confusion and all of the chaos,

495
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,300
 she wasn't driven towards her husband.

496
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:06,660
 She didn't allow her faith, if there was any faith in God

497
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,260
 to direct her life, she was driven and led by fear.

498
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:12,940
 If you want to have a wreck of a romance,

499
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,100
 if you wanna have a romantic tragedy,

500
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,900
 the second thing you do is follow Samson's example

501
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,640
 as it relates to a lady to look for,

502
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,020
 and look for someone who's driven by fear.

503
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,740
 Or if you don't wanna have a wreck of a romance,

504
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,400
 is to look for someone who is not driven by fear.

505
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,060
 If you do not want to have a romantic tragedy,

506
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:34,320
 a dating life where, man, it's not just filled

507
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,560
 with breakups, it's breakups that break you,

508
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,260
 if you don't want that, God says,

509
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:44,600
 don't look for someone who is driven or ruled by fear.

510
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,180
 Look for someone who's ruled by faith.

511
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,920
 Man, I think this is so much more common

512
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,120
 than we even realize, especially men.

513
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,420
 Now, like a few of the ways you can see

514
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,600
 if a woman is ruled by faith,

515
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,940
 is the way that they will do anything to catch a guy.

516
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,380
 And they're gonna use whatever they can,

517
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,180
 whatever they have to, to catch someone.

518
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,180
 They're gonna put their body as bait.

519
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:07,800
 They're gonna use the way that God has made them

520
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,000
 and showcase it in the pictures that they take.

521
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,860
 That modest is, or modesty is not something

522
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,360
 that's gonna mark them, they're gonna use whatever they can

523
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,620
 'cause they're gonna try to take control.

524
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,540
 Whatever I have to do to catch a guy,

525
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,420
 whatever bait I need to use to catch a guy out there.

526
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,060
 We've said before, man, ladies,

527
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,080
 if you catch a guy for your body,

528
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,820
 you will lose him for the exact same thing.

529
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,720
 And a girl, men, who is marked by fear,

530
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,300
 will allow whatever she needs to

531
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,660
 in order to catch a guy.

532
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,340
 And you see it, a lot of times,

533
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,220
 it manifests itself like this.

534
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,300
 There's girls who are like,

535
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,900
 they'll just try to take control and grab the wheel

536
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,340
 and do whatever they can to get a date.

537
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,120
 I'm so afraid of being single

538
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,660
 that I'm just gonna get onto 18 different dating websites

539
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,180
 and profiles, so I'm on maps.com,

540
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:56,020
 Christian Tingle, Christian Mingle, eHarmony,

541
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,860
 Farmers Only, whatever I gotta do.

542
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,540
 I got Bumble, I got Tinder, I got it all.

543
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,380
 I'm gonna get me a man.

544
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,860
 And they're ruled by fear

545
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:09,080
 that's moving them to reach out and control.

546
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,360
 And the Bible says, Samson's example says,

547
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,880
 men, do not date a woman who's ruled by fear.

548
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,600
 Not only will they do anything to catch a man,

549
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,300
 they'll do anything to keep a guy.

550
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:24,340
 And the fear of losing a guy or a man in their life

551
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,760
 will lead them to introduce sex into the relationship

552
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,560
 or allow sex to be in the relationship.

553
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,080
 They'll think, man, I'm afraid.

554
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,820
 If I don't put out, he'll leave.

555
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,320
 And they allow fear

556
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,880
 to lead them to introduce even sexuality

557
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,080
 or to allow it to take place.

558
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,360
 Bible says, don't follow someone who's ruled by fear.

559
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,680
 Don't step into a covenant or relationship

560
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,440
 or dating relationship with someone who's ruled by fear.

561
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,540
 Step into it with someone who's ruled by faith.

562
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:56,280
 A lot of times, man, this is probably the most common,

563
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,680
 and maybe they're all really common, honestly,

564
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:04,040
 where a girl will be so consumed

565
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,760
 with fear of being single,

566
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,240
 consumed with the idea of, man, what if I never get married

567
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,760
 and I'm waiting for some guy to come along

568
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:17,760
 and finally give me a relationship or hand me that ring,

569
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,400
 and they'll see themselves as just sitting on the sideline

570
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,360
 waiting for life to begin because they're afraid,

571
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,840
 because they don't think that life,

572
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:30,040
 man, it really just doesn't begin until you get married.

573
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,800
 And they've bought a lie.

574
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,900
 If you're inside of this room,

575
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,360
 the best thing that you can do

576
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,480
 is to not feed that discontentment of,

577
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,640
 hey, when am I gonna get married?

578
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,560
 When am I gonna get married?

579
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,480
 And allow that root of bitterness to spring

580
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,440
 but to run hard after Jesus, all in with him.

581
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,320
 It is that promise that you're going to get a solution

582
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,460
 and your singleness is gonna end, no.

583
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:52,440
 But it does promise that much of your discontentment

584
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,380
 that you're feeding is going to begin to erode

585
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,160
 as you find the superior satisfaction,

586
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,680
 and that's in Jesus 'cause newsflash,

587
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,400
 marriage doesn't really bring the satisfaction

588
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,260
 that many people, or maybe you, think that it will bring.

589
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,840
 And don't allow that fear to drive you to thinking,

590
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,540
 man, life doesn't begin until I get married someday.

591
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:14,280
 Guys, don't buy the lie or don't pursue a girl

592
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,500
 who's sitting on the sidelines,

593
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,860
 who's not running after Jesus in the season

594
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,120
 in the way that they use their time,

595
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,460
 the way that they are living their life

596
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:28,620
 'cause they're waiting to get in the game.

597
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,900
 Don't buy it in or don't buy into it.

598
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:35,300
 And don't look for someone who's led and ruled by fear.

599
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:39,420
 The third idea that we see really from the text

600
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:44,420
 is an observation that we see

601
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:47,780
 from Samson's most famous love fling,

602
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:50,300
 which happened with his girl Delilah.

603
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,280
 Here's what happens next.

604
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,900
 So Samson's married, she ends up leaving him,

605
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,940
 and it's just kind of one train wreck after the next.

606
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,520
 If you go read Judges 15 of what happens,

607
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,460
 and then in Judges 16, he meets Delilah,

608
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,660
 and here's what happens.

609
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:07,780
 Sometime later, Samson fell in love

610
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,880
 with a woman named Delilah,

611
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,860
 who lived in the valley of Soreks.

612
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,300
 So he falls in love with a girl named, a valley girl.

613
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,020
 She's a valley girl named Delilah.

614
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:20,180
 He falls in love, and the rulers of the Philistines

615
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:22,380
 went to her because they knew that he was in love with her,

616
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,500
 and they said, "Entice Samson to tell you

617
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,120
 "what makes him so strong."

618
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,220
 Like we see his strength,

619
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,020
 entice him to tell you the secret of it

620
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,540
 so that he can be overpowered and tied up securely,

621
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:36,380
 and each one of us will give you 1,100 pieces of silver.

622
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,460
 We know that there are five of them

623
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,860
 from my other place in the text,

624
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,580
 and it's 5,500 pieces of silver.

625
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,420
 So they come up, they do,

626
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,420
 "Hey, look, we're gonna give you what today would be

627
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:46,120
 "the equivalent of between 15 and $20 million.

628
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,260
 "We're gonna give you enough to retire tomorrow

629
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,560
 "if you will find out from your boy Samson

630
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,040
 "how much it will take, what it will take

631
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,460
 "in order for him to be subdued.

632
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,100
 "What's the secret of his strength?"

633
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,900
 So Delilah, immediately we see,

634
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,420
 she ain't just any girl, she's a gold digger,

635
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,040
 and she wants that money.

636
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,620
 So Delilah responds.

637
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:06,000
 "So Delilah said to Samson," verse six,

638
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,960
 "Please tell me what makes you so strong

639
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,840
 "and what it would take to tie you up securely."

640
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,680
 Man.

641
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,400
 You gotta think if you're Samson,

642
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,840
 then you're like, uh.

643
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,360
 (congregation laughing)

644
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,960
 I don't think Samson was the brightest crown in the box,

645
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,000
 because this happens a few times,

646
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,260
 and he still just goes with it.

647
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,640
 Man, he says this.

648
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,960
 "If I were tied up with seven new bow strings

649
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,580
 "that have not been dried,

650
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,440
 "I would become as weak as anyone else."

651
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,320
 So he just lies, gives her some fake answer.

652
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,440
 So he says, "Man, if you tie me up with these bow strings,

653
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,560
 "I'll be as weak as anyone else."

654
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,000
 So she goes and gets the bow strings.

655
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,240
 He takes a nap over at her place.

656
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,600
 She ties him up with the bow strings.

657
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,040
 And then the same thing happens over and over and over again

658
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,880
 with these three different things she uses to tie him up.

659
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,500
 She goes, "Samson, the Philistines are here.

660
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,400
 "They're upon you."

661
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,880
 He jumps up, breaks the rope like it's nothing,

662
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,840
 and essentially he's like, "Huh, huh, where are they?"

663
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,760
 And she goes, "Oh man, they just ran out of here.

664
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,600
 "It's fine."

665
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,080
 So it happens again.

666
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,620
 She says, "I can't believe you lied to me.

667
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,800
 "Why are you so strong?

668
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,640
 "What's the secret?

669
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,400
 "How could you be tied up and subdued?"

670
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,580
 It's so like, how can you be that dumb, Samson?

671
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,080
 And he tells her again.

672
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,360
 And here's why I don't think he's dumb.

673
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,500
 Here's why, if you're a guy, man, you've been there.

674
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,440
 Because Samson is love drunk.

675
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,560
 Like likely at this point, he's sleeping with her.

676
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,400
 Why do I say that?

677
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,500
 'Cause he's sleeping at her house.

678
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,960
 That's probably our first clue.

679
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,280
 And he's love drunk, whether it's from the sex

680
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,360
 or whether it's from the way she looks, whatever it is.

681
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,480
 Like he's like, "Yeah, I'll tell you that.

682
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,840
 "You know, it's cute."

683
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,640
 And so he tells her again,

684
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,120
 "If you tie me up with fresh new ropes, I'll be subdued."

685
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,720
 So he goes to nap, takes another nap.

686
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,840
 She ties him up.

687
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,680
 And then she does the same thing.

688
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,840
 "Philistines are here, jump up, save yourself."

689
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,320
 Jumps up, rips him apart,

690
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,520
 and essentially goes, "Where are they?"

691
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,960
 And she goes, "You're lying to me again."

692
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,780
 Happens again.

693
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:55,020
 He says, "Oh, you gotta put my hair in this loom

694
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,000
 "or in this like weave."

695
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,200
 So he goes to sleep, takes another,

696
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,640
 I mean, Samson's a napper.

697
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,480
 (laughs)

698
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,320
 Now he can see this.

699
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,760
 He loves a nap.

700
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,080
 (laughs)

701
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,360
 And she's weaving his hair in the loom.

702
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,200
 Same thing.

703
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,680
 "Philistines are here, they're upon you."

704
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,000
 And he jumps up, pulls his hair out.

705
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,720
 And again, nothing changed.

706
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,880
 And eventually it says that she tormented him

707
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,040
 over and over and over and over again.

708
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,480
 Tell me, why won't you tell me?

709
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,040
 It says that, literally it says that she pouted to him.

710
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,900
 It says, "How can you say I love you

711
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,080
 "and not tell me?"

712
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,160
 And she nagged him until he finally shared.

713
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:32,020
 And he said, "My hair has never been cut.

714
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:35,240
 "I was dedicated to God as a Nazarite from birth.

715
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,860
 "If I were to shave my head, my strength would leave me

716
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,960
 "and I'd become as weak as any other man."

717
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,160
 And Delilah lulled Samson to sleep

718
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,840
 with his head in her lap.

719
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,920
 And she called in a man to shave off

720
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,360
 the seven locks of her hair.

721
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,820
 And this way she began to bring him down

722
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,400
 and his strength left him.

723
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,900
 And then she cried out, "Samson, the Philistines

724
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,760
 "have come to capture you."

725
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,380
 When he woke, he thought, "I will do just as I did before

726
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,480
 "and shake myself free."

727
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,700
 But he didn't realize that the Lord had left him.

728
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,920
 So the Philistines captured him.

729
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,300
 They gouged out his eyes.

730
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,600
 They took him to Gaza, the capital city,

731
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,320
 where he was bound in bronze chains,

732
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,860
 which essentially is just extra strong chains, just in case.

733
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:19,020
 And forced to grind grain in the prison or in the dungeon.

734
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,900
 Samson, and really Delilah, illustrates

735
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,540
 the third lady to not look for.

736
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,440
 If you wanna have a romantic tragedy, man,

737
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,480
 you wanna look for a girl who's poisoned.

738
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:33,520
 Look for someone who is self-seeking, self-serving.

739
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,040
 Or look for someone, or don't look for someone

740
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,400
 who sees you as a means to an end.

741
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,740
 That's our third idea from the text.

742
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,640
 Don't look for someone who sees you as a means to an end.

743
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,020
 And man, again, it's much more common than you think.

744
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:47,120
 Or a girl will see whatever guy that asked her out,

745
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,640
 that's taken her out, as just a means to an end.

746
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,800
 Look, hey, I would rather be with you than be lonely.

747
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,340
 Honestly, I just got out of a relationship,

748
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,660
 and I'm dating him 'cause it's a rebound,

749
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,820
 and it kinda helps me not feel as insecure.

750
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:04,960
 Honestly, I'm dating him mainly 'cause he's a doctor.

751
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,960
 Honestly, I'm dating him because it's better

752
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,980
 to hang out with him on a Friday than be lonely.

753
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,380
 I'm dating him because all my other friends

754
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,300
 have moved towards marriage,

755
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,860
 and I don't wanna be the only one who's left here alone.

756
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,820
 You don't date someone who uses you as a means to an end.

757
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,500
 If you wanna have a romantic tragedy,

758
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,060
 date someone who will use you as seeking to serve themself,

759
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:25,900
 not seeking to seize.

760
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,020
 That's exactly what Delilah's doing.

761
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,720
 She never loved Samson.

762
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,340
 She loved Delilah.

763
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,620
 Samson was a means to an end.

764
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,560
 I want that money.

765
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:37,160
 And sadly, all too common love stories

766
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,840
 that guys, you in this room will experience

767
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,060
 is that you're gonna date a girl

768
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:43,420
 who seeks to really use a guy as a means to an end.

769
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:47,220
 You don't look for someone who seeks to use you

770
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,620
 but someone who's met Jesus,

771
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,060
 who understands that marriage is not meant

772
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,820
 to be this consumer relationship

773
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,760
 but a covenant relationship.

774
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,860
 Like we have consumer relationships every direction you look

775
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,780
 if you know what I mean by that.

776
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:02,300
 In other words, you don't wanna step into someone

777
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,800
 who thinks of the dating relationship you have

778
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,100
 as a consuming relationship.

779
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,680
 Like hey, I'm here to get kinda my needs met

780
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,660
 or what I can from it.

781
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,500
 I mean, we have consuming relationships

782
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,900
 or consumer relationships all over the place.

783
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,620
 Your relationship to whatever car insurance place

784
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,480
 you have right now is a consumer relationship.

785
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,780
 Your relationship to the grocery store that you go to,

786
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,500
 it's a consumer relationship.

787
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,840
 Hey, I'm really here as long as they meet my needs.

788
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,500
 If I could find something better, I would probably move on.

789
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,500
 I mean, that's exactly what we do.

790
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,780
 Like if your insurance could be dropped,

791
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,320
 you would move on, so would I.

792
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,620
 That's a consumer relationship.

793
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,820
 I'm here to get my needs met.

794
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:39,020
 If I can find something better, time to move on.

795
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,580
 If I can find an upgrade, time to move on.

796
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,760
 The Bible teaches that when it comes to a man and a woman

797
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,060
 in a dating context and really in a marital context,

798
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,980
 it is not to be a consumer relationship

799
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,180
 but a covenant relationship.

800
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,300
 What is a covenant relationship?

801
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,580
 A consumer relationship has conditions.

802
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,860
 If you don't meet this, then.

803
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:04,020
 A covenant relationship is unconditional love.

804
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:06,140
 It's not hey, if you do this, then I'm in.

805
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:09,060
 It is no matter what you do, I'm in.

806
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:12,200
 The Bible says that every sort of marriage that exists

807
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,080
 is meant to be one of a covenant.

808
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,420
 Sadly, all over the place, we see people view it

809
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,460
 as a consumer relationship.

810
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,140
 Hey, if you get fat, if your body changes, I'm out.

811
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,220
 If I can upgrade you for a newer model,

812
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,900
 literally a model, I'm out, peace.

813
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,980
 And all over the place, our world feeds the message.

814
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:30,140
 I mean, look at Hollywood and you see the romantic tragedies

815
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:33,900
 of people who haven't embraced the biblical perspective

816
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:37,100
 of a covenant relationship but have embraced this idea

817
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,780
 of like man, a consumer relationship,

818
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:41,340
 I'm in it to serve and to get my needs met.

819
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:44,780
 The Bible says that marriage is to be a covenant

820
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,780
 where the person doesn't seek to serve themselves

821
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:51,060
 but seeks to put the needs of the man, if they're a woman,

822
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:54,460
 and of the wife, if they're a husband,

823
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:57,840
 in front of their own needs and to daily die to themself

824
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,420
 and to care for themself.

825
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,180
 You do not want a romantic tragedy.

826
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,680
 You honestly want, as we've said really

827
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,800
 almost every single week this week,

828
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,620
 you want a boring marriage.

829
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:09,620
 You want a marriage that will not make great TV,

830
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,380
 where there's no sleeping around,

831
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,620
 you don't have to worry, do I have an STD right now

832
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,220
 because I was cheating on my spouse?

833
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,980
 It's not exciting like Hollywood.

834
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:21,980
 You want an amazing one-on-one, one man, one woman marriage

835
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:26,380
 that is boring to Hollywood, it's not gonna make good TV.

836
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:29,460
 But let's be honest, the Bachelor in Paradise

837
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,180
 is our example of like what makes good TV.

838
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,140
 That is a train wreck, are you serious?

839
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:36,360
 One, there's no such thing ever as a Bachelor in Paradise

840
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,300
 that a single guy in paradise, those things do not exist.

841
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,660
 You saw in the garden, that joke is funny

842
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,100
 if you would read your Bible, people.

843
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,340
 (congregation laughing)

844
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:48,340
 I'm not even gonna explain it, I'm gonna let it just sink in.

845
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:52,860
 But you want a marriage that's not defined by that.

846
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:55,620
 In conclusion or in summary,

847
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,020
 as we learn from the life of Samson,

848
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,760
 men, gosh, I want this so bad.

849
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,440
 'Cause we pick on the guys a lot here.

850
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,380
 You wanna make sure you do not just look for someone

851
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,300
 who's hot.

852
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:12,140
 You wanna make sure you look for someone who knows Jesus,

853
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:15,060
 who knows by knowing him what it means to be a servant,

854
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,140
 who with you is gonna spend the rest of your life

855
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,980
 serving one another out of reverence, the Bible says

856
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,460
 in Ephesians chapter five for Christ.

857
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,140
 That the way that they are gonna be a servant

858
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,340
 in the context of marriage

859
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,060
 is because they're ultimately seeing themselves

860
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,660
 as serving Jesus.

861
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:30,620
 And it says both spouses are to do that together

862
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,940
 in the context of marriage.

863
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:35,140
 You wanna have a romantic tragedy, do the opposite.

864
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,860
 Do what Samson did.

865
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,260
 Let your heart lead you wherever love takes you.

866
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:43,260
 Allow yourself to step into a relationship

867
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,720
 with a lady who's ruled not by faith, but by fear.

868
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:51,020
 And step into a consumer relationship versus the covenant.

869
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,220
 Tragically, Samson

870
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:59,500
 didn't really get to experience

871
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,740
 a turning point until he had lost everything.

872
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,740
 But the good news is his story doesn't end

873
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,220
 like the stories inside of Hollywood

874
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:09,220
 or the romantic tragedies we see on TV.

875
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,980
 His story takes a twist at the end.

876
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:14,380
 He's taken away, he's put in this dungeon

877
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,940
 and he's placed in these bronze shackles.

878
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:18,220
 His eyes are gouged out, he can no longer see.

879
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,980
 And when his sight is taken away,

880
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:24,320
 he first, or he begins to turn towards God.

881
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:30,780
 That when his eyes are taken, he begins to see.

882
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,740
 And we're told for the very first time,

883
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,080
 you can read the end of the story on your own,

884
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:39,420
 that Samson begins to turn in those dark dungeon days

885
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,140
 towards God in prayer.

886
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,500
 And his heart turned towards him when he lost everything,

887
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,460
 when he lost his strength, in his weakness,

888
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,420
 he found humility.

889
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:49,780
 And despite having lost everything,

890
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:52,500
 having done everything wrong, he turned to God once more.

891
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,100
 And the Bible says something that I hope you hear me.

892
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:58,900
 If your story is filled with some of the brokenness

893
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,800
 that I know my story contains,

894
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,620
 of ways that I didn't lead girls well and dating,

895
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,980
 ways that sexuality and pornography

896
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,460
 were a part of my story, my experience.

897
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,300
 Like I know so many,

898
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,580
 maybe your story is filled with an abortion.

899
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:13,180
 Maybe it's filled with just a train wreck of relationships

900
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,120
 and one night stands, whatever your story is,

901
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,820
 the story of Samson and the way that it ends,

902
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:21,180
 breathes hope that God can take anything broken

903
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,220
 and breathe life to it.

904
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:25,380
 It says that in those dark days, he turned to God.

905
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:28,820
 And there's this verse, it's so powerful to me.

906
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,440
 It's verse 22 and it says,

907
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:36,340
 but before long, Samson's hair began to grow back.

908
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:42,120
 That whatever your story is, whatever you've done,

909
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:47,820
 that if in humility and weakness, you will turn to God,

910
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,820
 he will turn that weakness into strength

911
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:54,140
 and allow whatever passed to not be a problem,

912
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:58,180
 but to be a platform to which he shows his goodness

913
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,020
 to the world around you,

914
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,980
 to be a story that he allows you to tell

915
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,660
 and proclaim to people for the rest of your days.

916
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,740
 What happens next is Samson,

917
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,980
 he's sitting in that dungeon and he's let out.

918
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,340
 From time to time, they would bring him out,

919
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,300
 Philistines would bring him out and be like,

920
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,740
 "Hey, we're having a party, bring him out.

921
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:12,260
 "He's a party trick, bring him out."

922
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,740
 And he's let out and he's blind

923
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:16,600
 and they put him between these two pillars.

924
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,700
 And it says it's the pillars that are holding up

925
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:22,040
 essentially the temple that all these people were in.

926
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,540
 And Samson prayed to God and he prayed something

927
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:27,340
 he never prayed in his entire life.

928
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:30,380
 Once more, God, will you make me strong

929
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:33,500
 so that I can take out the enemies of God?

930
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,780
 And he pushed on the two pillars

931
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,740
 and the entire temple went down.

932
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:43,500
 And in his weakness, God did more in his weakness

933
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,380
 than any other time in Samson's life,

934
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,140
 than any time when he was strong.

935
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:50,460
 Whatever your story is, it is not a problem for God.

936
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,020
 Whatever your past is, whatever you see is like the thing

937
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,940
 that man, could God really accept me?

938
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:57,000
 Like I have a sexually transmitted disease.

939
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,180
 I have an abortion in my past

940
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,380
 I've never told anyone about.

941
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,020
 I'm addicted right now to pornography.

942
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,660
 If you and I will embrace the truth

943
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:05,380
 that Samson models so well, if you will turn to God

944
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:08,500
 and say, God, will you come make my weakness your strength?

945
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,580
 That in the midst of my brokenness, you're strong God

946
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,660
 and I'm trusting in you.

947
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,780
 And if you will in humility, surrender that to God,

948
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:18,780
 he will use you to do more than you can even imagine.

949
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,100
 Samson's hair began to grow.

950
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:24,660
 You, whatever your hair can begin to grow back

951
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,220
 if you will turn and allow God to take over.

952
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,880
 The Bible says in Proverbs 24

953
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,120
 that a righteous man falls seven times, but he rises again.

954
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,660
 Whatever your story is, however far you've fallen,

955
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:38,040
 however far you feel from God, he's not done with you.

956
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,680
 If you have a heart beating inside of your chest,

957
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,460
 the game is not over.

958
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,000
 If you will turn to him, if you will trust in him,

959
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,900
 if you will allow in your weakness,

960
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:49,540
 whatever that weakness is, whatever that sin is,

961
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:52,480
 his grace to rush in, his people to come around,

962
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,480
 love you, care for you.

963
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,300
 He will allow in that weakness, him to be strong

964
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:02,180
 and you to be strong and use you like you've never imagined.

965
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,020
 Let me pray.

966
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:06,880
 Father, thank you for the story of Samson.

967
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:11,680
 Thank you that you never done,

968
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:17,080
 that no matter how far we've run,

969
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,960
 you don't give up on your people.

970
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,160
 And if we like Samson will turn to you,

971
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,040
 call out to you, ask for your strength,

972
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:34,580
 that despite all the ways that he just blown it

973
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,840
 time after time,

974
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:40,800
 you still use broken people like him,

975
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,720
 broken people like me.

976
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,840
 Would you stretch out your hand in this room tonight

977
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,160
 for people who feel a sexual past

978
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,920
 that is filling them with shame right now

979
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,620
 and set people free?

980
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,120
 Would you break shackles?

981
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,000
 And would you in our weakness be stronger

982
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 than we could ever think possible

983
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,040
 because you do more when we're weak

984
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,480
 than when we think that we're strong.

985
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,960
 Father, we worship you in song.

986
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,120
 Would you help us to build our life around your love,

987
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,220
 around your truth?

988
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:12,280
 And would you use us, Lord?

989
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,120
 Amen.

990
