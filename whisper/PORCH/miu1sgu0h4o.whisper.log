[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.920]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:42.920]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.640]   All right, Porch, how you doing tonight?
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.400]   We are about to start four or five weeks together.
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.320]   My name is Todd Wagner.
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.600]   Some of you guys don't know me.
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.680]   I get to hang out with everybody here on staff.
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.640]   I spend more time probably with large groups on Sunday mornings
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.800]   than I do on Tuesday nights.
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.440]   But every now and then, they let me dive in here with you all.
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.040]   Can't wait to dive in with you at the launch retreat
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.640]   this year for the 1,000 or so of you that are going to join me
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.440]   there.
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.680]   Get on the waiting list if you're not,
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.960]   because it always opens up in some way.
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.440]   You'll never be surprised on that.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.080]   But we're about to take four or five weeks here.
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.640]   And we're going to talk about questions that all of us have.
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.360]   If you've got any kind of intellectual integrity,
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.680]   you're going to ask questions.
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.080]   One of the things that absolutely frustrates me
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.640]   to no end is that people think that faith is believing
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.560]   something you know not to be true.
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.900]   And people think if you're really
[00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.700]   going to be a person of faith, that you've
[00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.960]   got to be an individual that commits intellectual suicide.
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.040]   But if you're a thinker, man, if you're a skeptic,
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.960]   if you challenge this supposed reality
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.800]   that this idea that has been passed down
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.320]   by men who want to rule you and control you and just kind
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.720]   of help you in your imbecilic state,
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.920]   kind of limp through life, then you'll ask questions.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.540]   And when you ask questions, man, you'll
[00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.840]   find out it's not what you think.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.560]   And you'll start to learn and live on your own
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.920]   and make your own reality.
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.080]   That's what the world often tells you.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.640]   That's what the intellectual elite wants you to believe.
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.140]   Let me just tell you something, man.
[00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.340]   The fact that the world thinks that faith is believing
[00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.500]   something you know not to be true isn't surprising.
[00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.580]   But the fact that so many people who hang out
[00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.340]   around a place like Watermark or a church
[00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.540]   still believe that is tragic.
[00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.260]   I want to tell you guys something.
[00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.560]   If something is true, then no amount of scrutiny
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.100]   can affect it.
[00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.020]   People that have something to hide don't like questions.
[00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.380]   I was talking to a guy who is part of a Hindu heritage.
[00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.580]   And he told me that when he was 10,
[00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:47.740]   he started asking questions.
[00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.980]   And his dad said, we don't ask questions.
[00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.820]   And they sent him to some different leaders
[00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.100]   within that specific expression of faith.
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.780]   And they go, hey, no one asks questions.
[00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.180]   It's a sign of disrespect to ask questions of your elders.
[00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.100]   Nobody's asked questions for 5,000 years.
[00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.340]   And this guy started asking questions.
[00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.760]   And as he started asking questions,
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.820]   he found out that the faith of his Hindu belief system
[00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:10.780]   didn't hold up.
[00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.180]   But he asked questions.
[00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.740]   And he found out that the explanation that
[00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.780]   was provided by the God who reveals himself
[00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.300]   through the scripture, the God who reveals himself most fully
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.100]   through Jesus Christ, did make sense.
[00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.460]   And that brother is no longer Hindu.
[00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.540]   Let me just say something.
[00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.980]   The opposite of faith is not reason.
[00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.060]   You know how you know that?
[00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.100]   Let's just work our way backwards, OK?
[00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.000]   What is the antonym of reason?
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.700]   It is irrationality.
[00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.260]   It is not faith.
[00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.700]   The opposite of faith is disbelief.
[00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.900]   Now, here's the question.
[00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.020]   We all believe something.
[00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.820]   The question is, have you asked yourself,
[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.940]   why do I believe what I believe?
[00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.900]   Is it reliable?
[00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.020]   Is it true?
[00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.420]   If something is true, no amount of scrutiny will affect it.
[00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.660]   So we're going to dive in, man.
[00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.420]   We don't dance around stuff here,
[00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.500]   because we believe we live in reality.
[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.900]   We believe we live in truth.
[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.100]   Now, I'm going to tell you as we go that I
[00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.180]   can't prove everything to you.
[00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.680]   I mean, there's people who are going to argue with you about
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.940]   whether or not I'm really here, or if I'm just
[00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.820]   a figment of your imagination, and you're not
[00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.260]   in some Leonardo DiCaprio movie, and this is all an illusion.
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.740]   And you're going to have to sort that one out on your own.
[00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.240]   What I'm going to tell you, though,
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.740]   is that you can make a decision based on the preponderance
[00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.820]   of the evidence.
[00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:34.780]   And what you're going to find out
[00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.280]   is that we've got a faith, if you're
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.620]   a believer in Jesus Christ, and you follow his ways,
[00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.260]   and you understand the Bible as God's revelation,
[00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.300]   you're going to find out that you have a faith that
[00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.780]   does not go against reason.
[00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.140]   It is super rational.
[00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.860]   It goes beyond reason.
[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.660]   It does require some belief.
[00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.580]   But I'm going to show you that your belief--
[00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.260]   we're going to talk about it in these weeks ahead--
[00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.300]   is we're going to show you that what you believe in
[00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.460]   is the most logical, and consistent, and congruent
[00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.820]   philosophy that you can have.
[00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.620]   It is the right way to perceive reality
[00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.060]   because it's real and true.
[00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.020]   Now, what we're going to do tonight
[00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.700]   is we're going to ask ourself this question.
[00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.100]   How in the world can we believe in a God that is good
[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.260]   and a God that is God if this world is so screwed up?
[00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.220]   In other words, it's what's called the problem of evil.
[00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.940]   Theologians will call it theodicy.
[00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.140]   It makes up two Greek words-- the problem for justice
[00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:37.340]   and the problem of God.
[00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.780]   In other words, God is not just if he
[00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.140]   is sovereign over this world.
[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.100]   Because if you haven't been paying attention,
[00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.860]   this world is rather screwed up.
[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.380]   Amen?
[00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.700]   Amen.
[00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.100]   Watch this video.
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.060]   This is the world that the gods got in his hands.
[00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.860]   Check it out.

[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.900]   Well, that's the kind of movie you
[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.820]   would expect for a skeptic to show before he stands up here
[00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.940]   and tells you why you are a fool if you believe there
[00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:41.060]   is a loving God who created this place, who cares about you
[00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.940]   and cares about this world.
[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.820]   How are you going to answer that?
[00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.940]   What's your answer to that question?
[00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:51.180]   I mean, follow the logic here.
[00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:54.780]   If God is good, he would get rid of evil.
[00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.660]   If God was God, he could get rid of evil.
[00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.060]   Evil still exists.
[00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:02.540]   Therefore, either God is not good or he is not God.
[00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:04.700]   And quit wasting your time.
[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.700]   And JP and Wagner and anybody else
[00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:09.580]   can stand up here and tell you all day long how good he is
[00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.060]   and how he's your shepherd, how he
[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:14.220]   wants to leave you behind beside still waters and green pastures.
[00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.900]   But you are kidding yourself, and you've
[00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:19.500]   got your head in the sand if you believe that God is good
[00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.180]   or God is God.
[00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:24.420]   Right?
[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:26.580]   Well, I don't think so.
[00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:30.260]   I'll take the other side of that position.
[00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.740]   What I want to do tonight is just give you
[00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:37.860]   what is called an apologetic, a reasonable explanation
[00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.620]   for believing that God is good and God is God,
[00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.540]   even while evil is still here.
[00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:44.820]   In fact, I want to let you know that God would tell you
[00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.220]   to not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you.
[00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:53.460]   God has said when he was here, hey, listen, in this world,
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:54.460]   you will have trouble.
[00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:56.660]   God explains where trouble comes from.
[00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:58.260]   And what I want to say to you is that I
[00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.580]   believe in a sovereign God who created everything.
[00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:04.340]   And evil is real, but God is not the author of evil.
[00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:05.340]   Now, wait a minute, Todd.
[00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:07.480]   That sounded logically inconsistent.
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.300]   I thought you told me that my faith didn't go against reason.
[00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.380]   You just told me that God created everything
[00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.420]   and that evil is real, and it's not an illusion
[00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:15.900]   like the Eastern mystics say.
[00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:17.860]   And yet, God didn't create evil.
[00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:19.860]   If evil is something and God created everything,
[00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:22.460]   therefore, God is the author of evil.
[00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.620]   And why would I want to worship a God who
[00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:25.500]   is the author of evil?
[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.860]   One man said, if God is there, then he is my devil.
[00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:35.300]   What I want to do is let you hear from Thomas the Engine
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:36.020]   for just a second.
[00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:41.700]   That's an abrupt shift, right?
[00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.060]   No, from Fillmore in the movie Cars, right?
[00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.140]   You know who that is?
[00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:48.220]   From Rufus in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure,
[00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.040]   you with me?
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.300]   All the same guy, his name is George Carlin.
[00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:57.900]   George Carlin, to a guy like me, when I was buying albums,
[00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:01.060]   yes, and was listening to great comedians,
[00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:03.020]   George Carlin was one of the great comedians
[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.300]   of my generation.
[00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:06.580]   And I love George Carlin.
[00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:09.580]   He was hilarious.
[00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:13.740]   And he also prided himself in helping people in his humor.
[00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:15.660]   And he exposed government.
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.740]   He exposed corruption in his humor.
[00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:21.620]   And he exposed religion.
[00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:23.540]   Now, I want you to hear for about a minute 30
[00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:24.280]   from George Carlin.
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:28.500]   George also was very famous for a little bit
[00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:32.660]   that he did called Seven Words You Cannot Say on Television.
[00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:36.620]   And he was fond of all seven of those words.
[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.900]   And so we have demarved this video,
[00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.580]   if you know what I mean, if you were here for the announcements.
[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:44.100]   And so follow through.
[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.740]   I think you'll follow the logic.
[00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:48.260]   But what I'm going to do is answer Thomas the Engine.
[00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:49.180]   I'm going to answer Rufus.
[00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:50.140]   I'm going to answer Fillmore.
[00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:51.740]   I'm going to answer Mr. Carlin.
[00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:53.100]   And I'm going to provide answers for you,
[00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.140]   because you're going to run into these questions.
[00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:57.340]   And frankly, the truth is, you've probably already got
[00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:57.900]   them.
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:58.580]   And here's the deal.
[00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:00.260]   You might just say, well, I just believe in God, man.
[00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:01.380]   The Bible says that I believe it.
[00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:02.220]   That settles it.
[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:02.900]   That's wonderful.
[00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:05.380]   But you're going to run into an atheistic, nihilistic person
[00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:06.060]   someday.
[00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:07.420]   And they're going to look at you and belittle you.
[00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:08.340]   And what's going to happen is, if you
[00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:10.820]   don't have good answers to their good questions,
[00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:12.780]   it's going to create doubt.
[00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:16.260]   God says in the scripture, come, let us reason together.
[00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:22.580]   God says, I don't mind you asking me questions.
[00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:23.500]   It's OK.
[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.260]   In fact, let me just say this before I get to Mr. Carlin.
[00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.060]   God's always had people asking questions.
[00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:30.540]   If you're a country music fan, right, you know Clay Walker.
[00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:32.420]   I don't think God was angry with Clay Walker.
[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:35.540]   Walker wrote his song, "A Few Questions."
[00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:36.740]   That song starts this way.
[00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:39.060]   How in this world can we put a man on the moon
[00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:43.380]   and still have a need for a place like St. Jude's?
[00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.660]   I don't know if you know it or not, but this last week,
[00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:47.660]   about 150 kids from Watermark went up and worked
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.420]   at a place called Camp Barnabas.
[00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:54.060]   It was Adult Disability Week, where they cared for people,
[00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.060]   many of them nonverbal, who had been a wheelchair
[00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:57.340]   their entire life.
[00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:00.060]   My little 15-year-old girl was given stewardship
[00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:04.740]   over a 225-year-old, 225 pound--
[00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:06.020]   that would be really amazing.
[00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:10.700]   In fact, you probably wouldn't have to care for her very much,
[00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:11.580]   right?
[00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:15.260]   No, a 225 pound, 30-something-year-old woman
[00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:19.100]   that she fed, they had to put filler in her water
[00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:21.620]   because she had swallowing issues.
[00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:24.060]   She had to use a hydraulic to lift her up out
[00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:26.340]   of her wheelchair, put her in bed, put her in the shower.
[00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:32.100]   She had to help her every time she used the restroom.
[00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.300]   And I went up there, and I was watching those kids work
[00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:36.640]   and serve, and I looked at that camp full of people
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:41.700]   who their entire life has been very, very broken.
[00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:43.540]   And you go, man, I don't need a chaos video.
[00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:44.580]   I see chaos right here.
[00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:45.820]   Where are you, God?
[00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:49.460]   How in the world can this be if you're a loving and good God?
[00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:51.380]   You know, we took care of those kids for a week,
[00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:54.020]   and then all the parents that cared for them 24/7,
[00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.200]   51 weeks out of the year, showed up.
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.340]   You think they asked this question?
[00:14:58.340 --> 00:14:59.660]   Well, let me just tell you this.
[00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:02.100]   The very first guy that I know asked the question eloquently
[00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:03.480]   was not a country-western writer.
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:06.060]   He was a Middle Eastern writer.
[00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:06.680]   Listen to this.
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.860]   This is the words of a guy named David in Psalm 13.
[00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:10.500]   He says this.
[00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:15.220]   "How long, O Lord, will you forget me forever?"
[00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:17.780]   Have you ever felt like that?
[00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:20.180]   "How long will you hide your face from me?
[00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.300]   How long shall I take counsel in my own soul,
[00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:24.700]   having sorrow in my heart all the day?
[00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:27.060]   How long will my enemies be exalted over me,
[00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.100]   that evil people are prospering, while me,
[00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.980]   who tries to do good, is suffering?
[00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:33.780]   Consider and answer me, O Lord, my God, and light my eyes,
[00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:35.780]   or I will sleep the sleep of death."
[00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:38.060]   In other words, despair will so overtake me
[00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:40.140]   that it's going to kill me.
[00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.700]   My enemies will laugh and will say, we've overtaken him.
[00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:45.380]   My adversaries will rejoice.
[00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:47.020]   Now, what you don't see behind me
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:49.340]   is that right here in that Psalm,
[00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:53.380]   there is this little Hebrew word, silah, which just basically
[00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:54.740]   means interlude.
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:57.460]   And what David did is he played on his harp at that moment.
[00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.860]   What I'm going to do tonight is play on the harp for you.
[00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:03.220]   We're going to take a musical interlude.
[00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:05.580]   And I'm going to speak to you with some melodious sonnet.
[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:08.380]   I'm going to speak to you words of truth
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:11.300]   that I want you to meditate on, because God doesn't mind
[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:12.420]   when you ask him questions.
[00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:13.380]   But here's the deal.
[00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:15.100]   God doesn't want you to rail on him.
[00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.860]   There's a difference between coming to him
[00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:19.220]   and asking questions and railing on God
[00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:24.220]   and telling him what you know about what he should be doing
[00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:27.700]   and giving God orders, because you know better than God
[00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:29.940]   what's going on.
[00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:32.140]   What David did is he asked the question,
[00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:36.820]   and then he just took a little time.
[00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.660]   And he meditated.
[00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:43.220]   And he went back over the character and nature of God.
[00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:45.900]   And he basically ended that little Psalm, and he said this.
[00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:48.460]   "I have trusted in your loving kindness,
[00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:50.340]   and I will rejoice in your salvation.
[00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:54.460]   I will sing to you, because you have doubt bountifully with me."
[00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:56.140]   And so there's a lot I don't understand,
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.660]   a lot that's going on I don't see.
[00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:59.460]   But at the end of the day, when David really
[00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:02.060]   considered all that God said and all that God had done,
[00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.460]   he said, "I will trust you, and I will follow you."
[00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:07.660]   And my belief is if you pay attention tonight with me,
[00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:10.820]   you'll end up in the same place that David ended up and not
[00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:13.740]   Thomas the Engine.
[00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:15.660]   But let's listen to the questions
[00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:20.380]   that sometimes we wish we had the permission to ask.
[00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:20.880]   Roll this.
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:27.700]   If we follow that as a humor bit,
[00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:30.580]   he says he believes in Joe Pesci, right?
[00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:32.780]   Because Joe Pesci always gets the job done,
[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:35.860]   is what Carlin goes on to say.
[00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:38.220]   Now some of that's just funny.
[00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:39.620]   And a lot of it just rings true.
[00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:40.780]   We look around, and there's not a lot
[00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:42.500]   to argue with him when he says that.
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.580]   But let me just take some time with you,
[00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:46.380]   and let me just tell you what we're going to answer tonight.
[00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:47.840]   We're going to answer the question,
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.620]   is this the best that God can do?
[00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:55.020]   This world that we're in is evil on God's resume.
[00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.140]   Remember how we said that?
[00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:58.860]   This looks like the work of a bad office temp,
[00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.540]   an office temp with a bad attitude.
[00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:01.980]   Is evil on God's resume?
[00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.900]   Is God incompetent?
[00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:06.780]   Why doesn't God give a rip?
[00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:11.380]   Are you mindless if you believe in God
[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:13.340]   with so much evil continuing under his rule?
[00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:19.540]   And is God short on compassion?
[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:23.100]   You know, another movie that deals with this
[00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:24.620]   is a movie that Robin Williams is in.
[00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:28.380]   Robin Williams has a rant very similar to that.
[00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:29.380]   The movie's Patch Adams.
[00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:30.860]   I don't know if you've seen it.
[00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:33.060]   But in the movie Patch Adams, this guy
[00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:36.420]   who's a real figure in history, who loved people,
[00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:38.460]   was compassionate, and broke through some
[00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:40.980]   of just the stoic nonsense that's
[00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:42.740]   associated with so much of our medicine,
[00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:44.940]   was a really caring, compassionate person,
[00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:47.140]   who brought joy to people in the midst of suffering,
[00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:50.220]   loved this little girl, and she was tragically
[00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:54.300]   raped and murdered by just some expression of evil
[00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.980]   that he couldn't get his arms around.
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.300]   And there's this moment where Patch Adams,
[00:18:58.300 --> 00:18:59.720]   and the person of Robin Williams,
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.980]   stands on the edge of this cliff, and he says to God,
[00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:05.140]   what do you want from me?
[00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:06.380]   Answer me.
[00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:07.620]   Tell me what you're doing.
[00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:10.020]   Let's look at the logic.
[00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:11.620]   You create man.
[00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:14.300]   Man suffers enormous amounts of pain.
[00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:16.700]   Man dies.
[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:18.540]   Maybe, just maybe, you should have
[00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:22.220]   spent day seven on compassion.
[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:24.460]   Maybe you should have brainstormed just a little bit
[00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:26.060]   before you rolled this thing out.
[00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:31.300]   You are not worth it, he says.
[00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:34.260]   And he walks away.
[00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.780]   So again, there's the problem, right?
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:38.140]   And so we want to deal with this.
[00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:39.780]   And so I want to walk you through just
[00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:42.420]   some basic syllogisms, some logical constructs,
[00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:45.220]   and I want to answer them.
[00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:47.980]   People start by saying what Carlin says.
[00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:48.900]   Look, I reject God.
[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:50.400]   If this is the best that you can do,
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.780]   I want nothing to do with him.
[00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:54.020]   And they start by saying things like this.
[00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:58.940]   There is no good purpose for evil and suffering.
[00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:00.980]   And they say that because they say
[00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:04.180]   that an all good, an all perfect, an all powerful God
[00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:08.020]   must have a good purpose for everything.
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:10.340]   And since there's no good purpose for evil and suffering,
[00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:13.020]   therefore there cannot be an all good, an all powerful God.
[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:15.260]   That's another way to get at what I said a little bit
[00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:16.580]   earlier.
[00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:20.460]   Let me just tell you how to answer this.
[00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:21.780]   Carlin said, I tried.
[00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:23.340]   I really tried.
[00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:24.500]   I just couldn't do it.
[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:26.700]   And for you to say you really tried,
[00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:29.620]   you've got to start by acknowledging something
[00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:32.980]   that's true about yourself.
[00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:34.460]   If you're really going to try, you've
[00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:38.980]   got to really acknowledge your limitation, right?
[00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:40.500]   Which basically starts with this.
[00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.100]   I don't know everything.
[00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:44.940]   There are some things outside of my scope of knowledge
[00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:48.040]   that I can't get my arms around because I'm a finite creature.
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.100]   I've got 70, 80, 90 years to figure this thing out.
[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.780]   Look, Einstein, who clearly was one of the brightest minds
[00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:56.780]   that ever lived, he understood that he didn't even
[00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:58.580]   access all the brain that he'd been given,
[00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:00.220]   but he knew he didn't know everything.
[00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:04.460]   He, though, did reject the character of God
[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:05.620]   as revealed in the Bible.
[00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:07.060]   And here is why.
[00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:09.200]   Einstein was what is called a determinist.
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:12.580]   He did believe in a creator.
[00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:14.660]   Einstein looked around and he goes, look,
[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:21.060]   this world that we're in, creation and design
[00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:22.300]   demand a designer.
[00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:23.220]   There is a mind.
[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:25.700]   He understood that every effect has a cause,
[00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:29.220]   and he believed in a divine causer.
[00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:30.700]   But he had a real problem.
[00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:32.380]   Understand, Einstein was a Jew.
[00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:35.220]   He saw what was happening in his lifetime to his Jewish people.
[00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:37.620]   He saw wicked men have immense power.
[00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:39.980]   He saw incredible suffering.
[00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:41.780]   And what Einstein became was a person
[00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:43.720]   who rejected the mind or the character
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:44.860]   of the God of his people.
[00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:49.140]   And he became what's called a determinist.
[00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:52.900]   And he believed that men were just basically wind-up toys.
[00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:54.980]   And we did exactly what we were just
[00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:58.740]   created to do by this God that he rejects because he doesn't
[00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:00.900]   have a good character because God would never wind up
[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:02.420]   people to do this.
[00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:05.060]   He believed that men basically did what they did for the same
[00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:06.340]   reason that rocks lay where they lay,
[00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:07.580]   that somebody placed them there to do it,
[00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:08.660]   and that's just the way it is, and you just
[00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:09.540]   got to make the best of it.
[00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:11.580]   That's what a deterministic or fatalistic
[00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:16.680]   or a person who would take that philosophical explanation
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.500]   for evil, that's where they would come out.
[00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:19.440]   And that's really what I want to do.
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:20.560]   I want to start by just saying this.
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:22.740]   Look, you've got to start, if you're going to really try,
[00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:24.360]   you've got to start by acknowledging--
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:27.060]   I don't care if you're Einstein-- that you are not God.
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.240]   It's like in the movie Rudy.
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:29.180]   Remember that?
[00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:30.800]   When Rudy was struggling with why he wasn't getting
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:32.360]   to Notre Dame, why his body wasn't big,
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.440]   why he wasn't strong, he went to that little priest
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:35.460]   and he was wrestling.
[00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:37.760]   And the priest said, look, Rudy, I only know two things.
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:41.080]   There is a God and I'm not him.
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:42.640]   And I might suggest to Mr. Carlin,
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.160]   and I might suggest to Mr. Einstein,
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.400]   and I might suggest to you that that's not a bad place
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:46.920]   to start.
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:51.560]   Look, if I can explain everything God does--
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:54.120]   in other words, if my mind gets around everything that God
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.920]   does and why he does it and when he does it,
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.300]   then I don't need to worship him.
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:58.000]   I can explain him.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.480]   I, in effect, own him.
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.280]   I don't worship my watch, even though I don't really
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:02.000]   understand how to build it.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.780]   Somebody does, and if I spend enough time,
[00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:04.760]   I could figure it out.
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:07.920]   But it's arrogant of me to say to a Nobel laureate
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:10.120]   that his mathematical equation can't be true
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:13.400]   because I can't get my arms around it.
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.240]   And therefore, his math is science.
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.520]   I mean, his math is nonsensical because it
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:18.600]   doesn't make sense to me.
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:19.860]   And he's not a Nobel laureate.
[00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:22.440]   He's a Nobel idiot.
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:24.720]   What would you say to me if that was my reasoning?
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.320]   You would go, well, Todd, there's a possibility
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.040]   that maybe you don't know what he knows.
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.320]   And what looks like just a bunch of numbers and letters
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:32.680]   up on a chalkboard is really brilliance.
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:34.520]   And it looks like nothing to you because you
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.440]   don't have that mind.
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.960]   See, I need to take a position of humility
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:41.200]   because I'm not a Nobel laureate.
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.440]   And I want to tell you what, Nobel laureates
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.940]   need to take a position of humility
[00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:47.240]   because they're not God.
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:50.840]   There is no way that I can pour my five decades of learning
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:53.240]   into the mind of a three-year-old.
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:55.640]   Six-year-old, it starts to get a little close for me.
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:58.880]   But a three-year-old, I don't expect for them
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:23:59.680]   to understand it.
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:02.080]   And it would be crazy if that three-year-old said,
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:05.360]   I reject what you're saying because I can't understand why
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.640]   you wouldn't feed me ice cream for breakfast, lunch,
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:08.960]   and dinner.
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.160]   Therefore, you are a bad God.
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.560]   And I reject you.
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.520]   And I will worship the God of Blue Bell
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.560]   and serve him with all my heart.
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:19.640]   Now, I don't understand why a three-year-old would
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.080]   want to do that, the God of Skittles and Mountain Dew,
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:25.320]   if you put that in a sippy cup.
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.440]   But we would say the problem with a three-year-old
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.640]   is he's not taking a position of humility
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.480]   because there is nutritional value
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:36.040]   to what that 50-year-old father is saying.
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.880]   If you're really going to try, you
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:40.720]   have got to start by acknowledging that just maybe,
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:44.040]   maybe, there's somebody who knows more than me.
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:45.040]   And I'm not God.
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:48.200]   And just because I can't see the purpose for evil and suffering,
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:52.920]   it doesn't mean there is not a purpose for evil and suffering.
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:25:02.240]   If you're going to really try, what you need to do
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:06.760]   is go and look at what the other explanations for evil are.
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:08.960]   Let me just give you a few of them, OK?
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.400]   I'll take some of the major views.
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.280]   I've already talked about Einstein's determinism,
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:15.720]   that he believed that evil was here because people were
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:18.120]   made to just do what they do.
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.560]   There is a God that's out there.
[00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:20.760]   He just didn't want to worship him
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:22.960]   because that God clearly created wind-up toys that
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:24.240]   did nasty things.
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.840]   And Einstein was glad that he didn't
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.360]   get created to do nasty things.
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:32.080]   He was created to build things that blew up nasty people
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.560]   and that helped others.
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:37.040]   But some people are what are called nihilists,
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:40.840]   that they believe-- or rather, naturalists and atheists.
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:44.160]   They believe in a closed system.
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.880]   They're really the reason that we're here.
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.640]   Einstein didn't say this, but many people
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:51.320]   believe that we're here just because of time and nothing
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:56.160]   and chance all of a sudden turned into something
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:01.360]   and order and design.
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:02.860]   And they're saying it just happened.
[00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:04.640]   We don't know why.
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:05.760]   It just is.
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.920]   And what they say basically-- and this
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.720]   is what Richard Dawkins, who is a Nobel Laureate, or at least
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:14.160]   is a well-known prof at one of the leading schools in all
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:16.960]   of England, says basically this to you.
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:21.920]   He says that you need to know that DNA just is.
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.320]   It neither knows or cares.
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.360]   It just is.
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:28.880]   And we dance to its music.
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:32.480]   And so atheistic or naturalistic people
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.680]   who think that there is no real explanation,
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:38.680]   it's just time plus nothing plus chance,
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:41.240]   and somewhere in there some matter came from somewhere
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.320]   that they don't know why.
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.400]   They can't explain.
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.960]   Dawkins, by the way, who's one of the leading
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:50.680]   new atheists of our day, when really pressed and asked
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:54.840]   where something came from, his best explanation--
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:57.720]   and I kid you not, go get the movie expelled
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:02.560]   if you don't believe me-- is aliens.
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:07.160]   To which, listen, maybe, maybe, but I would just
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.760]   say to Mr. Dawkins, what is your evidence for aliens?
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:14.760]   And let's talk about whether or not your faith,
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.960]   that that's your best explanation,
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.760]   is rooted in reason.
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:21.080]   Or maybe there's a better explanation for the God
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:24.880]   that I say that I love and serve.
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:28.760]   But third basic solution to evil is just shut up and take it.
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.160]   Survive if you want to.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:33.320]   By the way, can I tell you, if I wasn't a Christian,
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:36.000]   I would be close to this.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.700]   And what I would really be is a hedonist.
[00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:38.660]   And here's the problem.
[00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:42.080]   There's not enough intellectually consistent
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.400]   atheists, an intellectually consistent atheist that
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.200]   says DNA just is.
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:46.880]   It doesn't know.
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:47.760]   It doesn't care.
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:49.120]   You dance to its music.
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:52.600]   My question for them is, why are you putting up with any pain?
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:54.600]   That's why I would.
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.600]   I would be a hedonist.
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.920]   I would do everything I could to milk all the pleasure I
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:59.600]   could out of life.
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:03.920]   I would abuse people, hurt people, take from people,
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:06.520]   use you for my own pleasure and my own advancement
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:10.320]   as long as I could in a way that I probably in some way
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:13.920]   govern so that you wouldn't lock me up or want to kill me.
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:19.520]   And then when it just got too hard for me,
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:20.720]   I would just check out.
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.920]   I would just check out.
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:24.640]   And by check out, I mean I would just
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:26.720]   move back to be food for the worms
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:30.360]   and get in whatever naturalistic cycle is coming next.
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:33.800]   I mean, why suffer at all if we're not here for any purpose
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:37.720]   and we don't really have any reason to hang around?
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:41.240]   Now look, Ernest Hemingway is an intellectually consistent
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:41.760]   atheist.
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.160]   Ernest Hemingway was an atheist.
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.460]   And that's exactly what he did.
[00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:48.080]   When wine, women, fame, and song no longer satisfied him,
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:50.320]   he put a shotgun in his mouth and he pulled a trigger.
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:53.200]   And he just moved on.
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:56.240]   But here's the problem.
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.080]   Is Ernest was making a wager that he
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.480]   was right in his philosophy.
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:04.720]   And I would have begged him to listen to his heart that
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.280]   told him there was more to this life
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.640]   than just wine, women, and song.
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:11.200]   And that in fact, death is not an end.
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:12.620]   It's an eternally fixed beginning.
[00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:16.800]   And I would have told Ernest, don't do that.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:19.000]   By the way, that's why suicide is the greatest
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.600]   lie of the deceiver who doesn't want
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:23.000]   you to know the God that created and the God that is good.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.280]   Because what he'll do is he'll tell you, don't listen to God.
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:25.980]   Don't follow God.
[00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:27.880]   Look at all the chaos in the world.
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:29.920]   Look at all the narrowness of God's claims.
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.560]   Look at some of the inconsistencies.
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:32.840]   He says this in the Old Testament.
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:33.640]   No one does that anymore.
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.280]   And now he's got these new ideas and all the different kind
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:36.720]   of stuff we're going to deal with.
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:39.440]   With you, science is much, much more reliable than his faith
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.480]   system and everything that we'll try and help you
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:42.640]   with in the weeks ahead.
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:45.160]   But here's the deal.
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.840]   What he'll do is he'll tell you to do what you want to do.
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:48.340]   Right?
[00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:51.840]   The Satanic Bible, the main idea in it is do what thou wilt.
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:52.480]   Right?
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:54.840]   Jesus would tell you that the golden rule
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:57.320]   is do unto others as you want them to do unto you.
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:59.200]   By the way, Confucius said it backwards.
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.760]   Confucius said, don't do to others what you
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.440]   don't want them to do to you.
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.160]   In other words, don't be a mean person.
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.480]   Jesus said, no.
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:08.440]   You be a lover, because I made you in my image.
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:09.100]   And I'm a lover.
[00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:10.840]   And you must care for others.
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:12.240]   So don't not do.
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:16.400]   I want you to do to them what you wish they would do to you.
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:17.120]   Serve them.
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:17.720]   Love them.
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:18.320]   Care for them.
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:19.540]   Be compassionate.
[00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:20.200]   Help them.
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:25.160]   But what happens when you don't do that, you live your life,
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.960]   and you get filled with a lot of despair.
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:27.440]   OK?
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:29.560]   And you start to find out that this life that you thought
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.100]   you would have by making yourself God
[00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:34.160]   and doing what you wanted didn't work out so well.
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:35.700]   That the Bible was true when it says
[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.840]   that those who despise the word will be in debt to it.
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:39.460]   That the way of the treacherous is hard,
[00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:41.980]   like it says in Proverbs 13.
[00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:44.320]   And you'll start to want to go, well, what am I going to do now?
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:45.720]   Because now I'm filled with guilt and shame.
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.520]   Maybe I've got a long history of pain around me.
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:49.280]   Maybe there's some consequence coming to me
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.520]   I don't want to face.
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:52.720]   And then the enemy lies to you one more time and says,
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:54.400]   well, I'll tell you what you should do.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.920]   You should be sovereign over your life.
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:57.560]   And don't believe that God's numbered your days.
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:59.220]   Why don't you just play the role of God?
[00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:01.840]   And why don't you check yourself out right here?
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:02.960]   And the reason he does that is because he
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:03.840]   wants to destroy you.
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:07.440]   He has come to kill, steal, and destroy you.
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:08.880]   Now, what I'm not saying right here
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:11.640]   is that suicide is ultimately the sin that you
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:12.960]   can't be forgiven from.
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:14.600]   But what happens is the scripture
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:18.560]   does say that it's appointed for man to die once.
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:19.840]   And after this comes judgment.
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:21.720]   And if you're a person who's made a decision
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:24.200]   that there is no God, and you shouldn't follow him,
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:26.900]   and you're going to do what you want right down to checking out
[00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:30.720]   when you are experiencing pain, then what he's trying to do
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:33.200]   is close the deal on the destruction
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.320]   that he has in mind for you.
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.560]   Which is why God is always saying, he who confesses
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.440]   and forsakes his sin will find compassion.
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:42.280]   But he who conceals it will not prosper.
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:44.080]   And so come.
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:46.960]   The solution to the atheistic naturalistic mindset
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.800]   is just, hey, grin and bear it.
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:51.760]   Hope you get more good than bad, but shut up and take it.
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:53.120]   That can be one solution for evil.
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.600]   They don't have a problem with evil,
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:56.160]   because in many ways, there's some
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:58.280]   of that Einsteinian idea of just deterministic evil
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:31:59.240]   that's in this world.
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:00.000]   And off they go.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.240]   The second group is a deist.
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:02.240]   I'll do this very quickly.
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:03.840]   One of the things that you could say if you really try
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:05.760]   is you could evaluate the deistic idea.
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:09.160]   A deist is basically, in my mind, it's a chicken atheist.
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:13.240]   They really don't want to be an atheist.
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:16.040]   But what they say is, we may as well be here without God,
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:18.080]   because what God did is he created the world,
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:20.000]   and then he just left it.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.280]   Determinism has some relationship to this.
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:24.800]   But it's the idea that what goes on out there
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:26.440]   is just what's going to go out there.
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:29.280]   And they wouldn't necessarily believe, like Einstein,
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.240]   that men are like wind-up toys, and some do this
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.160]   and some do that.
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:34.760]   What they would say is that men were here,
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:37.400]   and they've just got to figure it out.
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:40.040]   And so the idea of the enlightenment or rationalism
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.960]   would fall up underneath this.
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:45.080]   And the solution that they would offer for evil
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:46.800]   is education and advancement.
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:50.520]   And what we really need to do is we work our way
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:52.720]   through this, that the God who was good,
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:54.280]   who created us and left us in a good place,
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:56.200]   we screwed it up, and now we just got to figure it out
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:57.720]   on our own, okay?
[00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:01.960]   We're just here in this lab of life by ourselves.
[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:03.800]   There's no one to rescue us.
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.040]   And so education and advancement is the best way
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:06.960]   to go about this.
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:09.440]   Some people might even say what we got to do is get rid
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:12.720]   of people that are not perfect and manage it that way.
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.400]   And so we get into eugenics and other kinds
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:15.400]   of things like that.
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:18.640]   Here's the problem.
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:21.960]   Would you guys agree with me just for a second
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:24.920]   that we've advanced in technology and science and industry?
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:30.200]   That we've advanced intellectually over the last
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:32.960]   couple of thousand years?
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:37.240]   How many of y'all think this is a better place?
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:39.060]   Is it working?
[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:41.780]   Can we create our own utopia?
[00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:47.700]   Or do we just keep using more industry and technology
[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:50.660]   to just further destruction and pain?
[00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:53.820]   Frankly, we use some of it to numb ourselves
[00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:55.300]   from the reality that pain is there,
[00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:56.540]   and that's one of the most dangerous things
[00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:57.380]   that you can do.
[00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:00.180]   Because pain is a gift, and I'm gonna explain that.
[00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:02.580]   I'm gonna tell you that there is a purpose to evil.
[00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:05.180]   Remember the very first little syllogism I said
[00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:06.620]   in this little section right here,
[00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:08.180]   which is that there is no good purpose for evil
[00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:09.260]   and suffering, I'm gonna tell you,
[00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:11.420]   there is a good purpose for evil and suffering.
[00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:12.740]   And some of you are in this room tonight,
[00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:14.900]   and you're very empty, and you're very alone,
[00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:16.900]   and you're suffering, and you're angry at God.
[00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:18.740]   And I'm gonna tell you, this is not God's problem.
[00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:21.660]   Pain and suffering is God's gift to you.
[00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:23.340]   This is what it says in the Proverbs.
[00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:25.580]   It is not good for man to be without knowledge.
[00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:28.380]   He who makes his haste with his feet errs.
[00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:31.340]   The foolishness of man subverts his way,
[00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:33.540]   and then his heart rages against the Lord.
[00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:36.060]   Some of you guys are here and go, why am I pregnant?
[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:37.860]   Why do men use me this way?
[00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:40.660]   Why is my life filled with despair?
[00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:42.660]   Why can't I get out of bed?
[00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:47.620]   And God's saying, because you're living a life
[00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:49.460]   that's gonna always steal joy from you,
[00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:52.660]   because you're not listening to the one who loves you.
[00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:54.860]   And that pain that you're experiencing is a gift.
[00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:57.460]   It means something isn't as it should be.
[00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:02.620]   By the way, I'll just prove this to you.
[00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:04.540]   When something's working, you don't think about it.
[00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:07.260]   How many of you guys got here tonight, had no car trouble?
[00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:08.180]   Right, a bunch of you guys.
[00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:09.300]   You didn't think about your car at all.
[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:10.300]   You didn't think about your tires.
[00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:11.460]   You didn't spend any time thinking about it.
[00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:13.580]   Anybody here have a flat on the way here?
[00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:15.580]   Anybody here have car trouble today?
[00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:17.540]   Raise your hand in this room.
[00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:19.320]   Okay, a couple of you guys, right?
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:20.720]   You thought about your car, didn't you?
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:22.080]   You worried about your car.
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:24.940]   You spent time, because my car isn't right.
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:27.100]   When you are focusing on something,
[00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:28.620]   look, if you stub your toe,
[00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:29.880]   what all of a sudden you think about?
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.820]   Everything in you, like, I am thinking right now
[00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:33.780]   about my pinky toe.
[00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:35.500]   That's all I'm thinking about is my pinky toe.
[00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:37.160]   That pinky toe, the one that's going,
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:38.860]   (grunting)
[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:40.180]   That one, I'm thinking about it,
[00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:41.920]   because it's not working correctly.
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:44.780]   So let me just tell you something.
[00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:47.420]   Do you know why you're thinking about yourself so much?
[00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:50.020]   Because your self is broken.
[00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:54.660]   It's not operating the way it was designed to operate.
[00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:59.500]   You focus on yourself, your ego is wounded.
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:03.020]   And so you're trying to fix it.
[00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:04.940]   And what God is going to say is,
[00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:07.700]   hey, it is broken, and it is wounded,
[00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:09.980]   but why don't you not think about how to fix it?
[00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:11.460]   Why don't you listen to the one that created it?
[00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:13.060]   I didn't break it, you broke it,
[00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:15.300]   but I can fix it, because I'm a gracious God.
[00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:20.060]   If you want to say you really tried,
[00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:23.900]   you would have to study pantheism or monism,
[00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:25.900]   and see if that's the solution that you want to go into.
[00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:28.860]   Pantheism and monism is just basically
[00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:30.660]   the idea that not that God created,
[00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:32.340]   but that all creation is God.
[00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:35.460]   Okay, that all is God, and God is all.
[00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:41.860]   Eastern mysticism has some attachment to this,
[00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:44.620]   and there's many religions that have this idea
[00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:47.660]   that really God, though, is mind.
[00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:50.620]   God isn't real, and you can't touch God.
[00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:51.820]   God is spirit, they would say,
[00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:53.480]   which is consistent with what the scripture says.
[00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:55.940]   But they would say that all matter is illusion.
[00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:56.940]   And they would have something like this.
[00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:59.700]   They would say, God is mind, okay?
[00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:03.860]   Or they would go, no material thing exists.
[00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:07.240]   So you say, what is mind?
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:08.620]   They go, no matter.
[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:09.660]   And what is matter?
[00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:10.660]   They would say, never mind.
[00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:13.300]   Mark Twain, who I love, said that he came across
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:15.100]   an Eastern mysticist who believed
[00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:17.660]   that all reality was illusion.
[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:19.700]   And so that means they think evil is an illusion.
[00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:22.620]   It's not really real, which is why one of their solutions
[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:24.700]   for you to overcome evil is to meditate
[00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:27.300]   and get yourself out of this world that's broken
[00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:29.420]   that is an illusion, and just go ahead
[00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:32.300]   and move yourself to a nirvanic higher state
[00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:35.780]   where you can find peace, not subject
[00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:38.180]   to all the illusion of evil that you're in.
[00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:40.060]   Mark Twain said he came up against somebody
[00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:42.020]   who believed that, and he wrote him an imaginary check,
[00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:44.380]   and they sued him for very substantive dollars.
[00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:48.460]   In other words, that's a nice philosophy.
[00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:52.260]   I mean, one of the options you guys have tonight
[00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:53.400]   is to say that evil's not real,
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:56.580]   that none of this is real, it's just an illusion.
[00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:57.900]   And so you're gonna just kind of move
[00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:00.300]   to a higher state and get beyond it.
[00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:02.300]   And I'm gonna say to you that that's a fine philosophy,
[00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:03.900]   it's just not livable.
[00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:06.020]   Nobody lives like it's not real.
[00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:07.180]   You write me an imaginary check,
[00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:08.500]   and I'm an Eastern mystic, I'm gonna sue you
[00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:09.560]   for real dollars.
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:13.540]   You tell me that that hot oil you're pouring
[00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:15.860]   over my head is an illusion, and I don't care
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:17.420]   how much I'm meditating, I'm gonna have
[00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:19.380]   to do bidness with you at that moment.
[00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:23.860]   So pantheon and Moses, if you're gonna really try,
[00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:25.940]   you're gonna say I've looked at naturalism or atheism,
[00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:27.700]   I've looked at deism, I've looked at pantheism, monism,
[00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:30.000]   I've looked at finite godism or fatalism.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.460]   This, by the way, is what Harold Kushner did.
[00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:33.420]   Harold Kushner's a rabbi.
[00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:36.460]   Harold Kushner's son was born with this disease
[00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:38.980]   called progeria, it's a terrible disease.
[00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:41.540]   It is a rapid aging of the human body.
[00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:47.620]   And Kushner, who loved God and wanted to serve God,
[00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:52.620]   looked at his son, who was rapidly aging beyond his years,
[00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:55.540]   and said no, a good God wouldn't let this happen.
[00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:56.780]   And so he wrote a book called
[00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:58.340]   When Bad Things Happen to Good People.
[00:38:58.340 --> 00:38:59.980]   You ever heard of it?
[00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:01.940]   He is a finite goddest.
[00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:05.980]   And what he basically believes is that there is
[00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:12.540]   a God that's there, he's just not really God.
[00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:14.940]   He's creator, but he's not infinite in his power.
[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:17.500]   God loves us, but he can't stop evil
[00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:22.740]   from either existing or affecting us.
[00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:23.820]   Kushner's the one that said this,
[00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:25.540]   just because you're a vegetarian,
[00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:27.000]   it doesn't mean that the lion's
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.500]   not going to still attack you.
[00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:33.700]   And so basically, you've got a good God
[00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:35.600]   and you believe in him, but there's still this force
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:37.180]   that's out there that's gonna attack you.
[00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:42.180]   And so basically, Kushner's solution in all of this,
[00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:45.380]   the finite goddest solution is brace yourself.
[00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:50.700]   And it goes really to the other option that's out there,
[00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:52.720]   it's the polytheistic or the dualistic idea,
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:53.900]   which is there isn't just one God,
[00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:55.620]   there's a bunch of gods and they're at war with each other.
[00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:57.740]   There's good gods, there's bad gods,
[00:39:57.740 --> 00:39:59.120]   and they have conflicting plans,
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:01.180]   they're coextensive, they're coeternal.
[00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:03.380]   Evil is a necessary presence to struggle against,
[00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:05.020]   a force that we must reckon with.
[00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:10.180]   And you look at Greek mythology and Roman mythology,
[00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:12.420]   and what people basically do is they'll just say,
[00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:14.100]   look, what we gotta do is worship the good guys,
[00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:17.660]   cheer for them, feed them, and hope that they have
[00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:19.420]   more good days than bad days.
[00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:24.220]   And I would just tell you that none of those
[00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:29.220]   offer a logical construct that is congruent with our reality.
[00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:33.260]   What I wanna offer to you is this.
[00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:36.100]   There was another guy who I've been in the room
[00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:37.220]   with a guy named Christopher Hitchens,
[00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:38.700]   who wrote a book called God is Not Great.
[00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:40.680]   Christopher Hitchens was having a discussion
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:42.700]   with some friends of mine, and Christopher Hitchens
[00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:45.260]   listened to these guys give 10 logical reasons
[00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:47.920]   for the belief in the existence of God,
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:51.020]   including reasons that answered the problem of evil.
[00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:52.220]   And Christopher Hitchens, who wrote the book
[00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:54.940]   God is Not Great, much of it is filled with stories
[00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:56.540]   like in that little video, Chaos,
[00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:57.860]   that caused him not to believe.
[00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:00.020]   Hitchens said basically this, guys,
[00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:01.000]   can I just tell you this?
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.380]   What you said I cannot refute.
[00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:04.540]   What you said is congruent and consistent
[00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:06.420]   with the reality that I see.
[00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:10.660]   I can't argue with the resurrection
[00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:12.640]   as a historical, reliable event.
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:17.640]   I can't argue with divine stamp in creation.
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:19.720]   I can't argue with the cosmological,
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:21.140]   which is basically what I just said,
[00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:23.700]   the cosmological argument for the existence of God
[00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:24.860]   and a series of others.
[00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:27.360]   He said, but I just choose not to believe in it,
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:28.860]   even though I can't refute it.
[00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:34.780]   It's congruent with reality, it is consistent with logic,
[00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:36.620]   and it is supported by reason.
[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:40.180]   But he just said I reject it,
[00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:41.860]   because I don't want to believe that.
[00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:44.380]   And so what I would say to Christopher Hitchens,
[00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:47.880]   and I would say to Mr. Carlin, is you're really not trying.
[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:49.540]   You're what's called an obscurantist.
[00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:51.420]   You just want to suppress truth and unrighteousness.
[00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:52.420]   Now here's what we want to do.
[00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:54.060]   I just walked through some of the other solutions,
[00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:55.780]   but what about the Christian solution?
[00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:59.120]   I mean, what is that logical, congruent explanation
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:01.300]   that Hitchens heard?
[00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:03.140]   Because we've got to answer these questions.
[00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:05.080]   I just basically said this, this is the best God can do,
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:05.920]   and here's the answer.
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:07.340]   No, it's not the best God can do.
[00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:10.260]   God doesn't think this is the best that he can do.
[00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:11.860]   It's not what he intended.
[00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:14.340]   What the story of the scripture is
[00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:16.660]   is that we messed up what God intended.
[00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:19.160]   What God said was best for us, we jacked up.
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:21.100]   We didn't go his way.
[00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:24.020]   And he told us, listen, trust in me, I'm good.
[00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:26.340]   I've created a place that is called Edenic.
[00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:28.520]   It's paradise, it's perfect.
[00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:29.820]   You don't need to know good and evil,
[00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:31.700]   not because I'm afraid if you know good and evil,
[00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:35.220]   you're going to somehow run for mayor against me.
[00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:36.740]   But the reason I don't want you to know good and evil
[00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:38.340]   is because even when you know good and evil,
[00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:40.300]   you're not like me, you're not intrinsically good.
[00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:42.460]   You're made in my image.
[00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:45.340]   And I'll talk about why that's important in just a moment.
[00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:49.060]   But you're not me, you need me.
[00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:51.240]   I am the author and giver of life.
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:52.920]   Look, I created you, look around you.
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:54.280]   Is there anything that you lack?
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.460]   And the enemy said, oh yeah, there is.
[00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:56.800]   Is that good and evil thing you lack?
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:59.140]   And God said, there's a reason for that.
[00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:01.000]   And the reason is because if you know good and evil,
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.320]   you won't always choose what I choose.
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:03.300]   Let me guys ask you a question.
[00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:04.880]   Some of the pain you've caused yourself,
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.320]   you know the fifth time you slept with a guy
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:08.520]   to find support, encouragement, and meaning?
[00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:11.720]   And you thought he really did love you this time,
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:14.020]   and it just didn't work out again?
[00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:17.700]   And that because you called it an embryo or a fetus,
[00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:18.540]   you could just abort it,
[00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:19.480]   and you would maybe get away with it,
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:21.680]   and you realized, no, it wasn't an embryo or a fetus.
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:23.760]   I am haunted by what I did to my child.
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:25.000]   It didn't work out again.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.480]   See, yours is not an information problem, right?
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:32.320]   You know the right thing to do.
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:35.600]   You know overeating makes you not like yourself,
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:39.520]   feel lousy, and be filled with despair.
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:42.140]   You know that drugs and alcohol don't really deal
[00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:43.120]   with a hole in your heart.
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.520]   I mean, it numbs you for a while,
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:46.600]   but it doesn't make you feel powerful.
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:48.060]   In fact, you do things that make you feel
[00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:51.660]   even more powerless, and yet you keep making those choices.
[00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:53.540]   That's not an information problem.
[00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:55.260]   Knowing good and evil is not our problem.
[00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:58.860]   The problem is is that we aren't able
[00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:01.980]   to not do what we don't want to do,
[00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:03.460]   because we're not intrinsically good,
[00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:05.580]   but we have a God who loves us.
[00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:06.420]   Now listen.
[00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:14.400]   God does not have evil on his resume.
[00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:17.420]   Do you remember what I said?
[00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:20.580]   I said earlier this little statement
[00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:21.980]   that God created everything.
[00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:25.020]   This is James chapter one, verse 17.
[00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:26.900]   James 1, 17 says this.
[00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:30.080]   Every good thing and every perfect gift is from above,
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:31.560]   coming down from the Father of lights,
[00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:33.660]   with whom there is no variation or shifting of shadow.
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:34.620]   So wait a minute, Todd.
[00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:36.780]   You just said that every good and every perfect thing,
[00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:38.140]   but you said God created everything.
[00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:39.580]   You told me not to believe in Eastern mystics,
[00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:41.420]   where they tell me that evil's an illusion,
[00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:44.240]   because even evil is very real, so what do we do?
[00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:47.580]   Follow me on this.
[00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:48.500]   Here's the logic.
[00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:51.360]   God is the author of everything.
[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:53.460]   The Bible teaches that.
[00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:55.140]   The Bible talks about God's sovereignty.
[00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:56.620]   It talks about how God's sovereign over kings,
[00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:57.460]   or all people.
[00:44:57.460 --> 00:44:58.700]   He's sovereign over nature.
[00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:00.300]   He's sovereign over demons.
[00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:01.700]   He's sovereign over history.
[00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:03.060]   He's sovereign over nature.
[00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:05.060]   There's nothing he's not sovereign over.
[00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:08.940]   So I can't say he's not powerful,
[00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:10.460]   because the Bible claims God's powerful.
[00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:11.980]   The Bible claims it's good.
[00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:13.220]   God created everything.
[00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:14.140]   Evil is something.
[00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:16.780]   Therefore, God must be the author of evil, correct?
[00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:17.620]   No.
[00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:21.540]   I'm gonna tell you that God is not the author of evil.
[00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:23.580]   There's a guy named Augustine, and he said this to you.
[00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:26.260]   He said that what evil is,
[00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:30.780]   it's an ontological parasite that exists because God exists.
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:32.140]   And you're like, okay, Todd, that's really helpful,
[00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:34.660]   except I have no idea what ontological means.
[00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:37.780]   Ontological is the study of being.
[00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:41.740]   What's it mean to exist?
[00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:43.180]   And what he's saying is that God,
[00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:47.060]   who is eternal and always good,
[00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:50.460]   if God exists eternally and is good,
[00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:53.180]   there must necessarily be,
[00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:55.660]   at least in the beginning where there was nothing but God,
[00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:58.900]   eternally is good, the possibility of evil.
[00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:02.780]   In other words, if God isn't good,
[00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:06.140]   if God is just blah, then there is no anything but blah.
[00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:07.420]   But because God is good,
[00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:09.820]   the possibility of evil must exist.
[00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:11.580]   If you say something is big,
[00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:13.700]   what does that absolutely necessitate?
[00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:17.820]   That there must be something of a different size.
[00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:21.900]   And so what happened is there was a moment in history
[00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:24.860]   that the Bible explains that evil moved
[00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:29.700]   from a philosophical possibility to a practical reality.
[00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:32.060]   Now, follow me.
[00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:37.500]   Those of you guys that have studied physics understand this.
[00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:39.460]   How do you create cold?
[00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:42.100]   (audience mumbling)
[00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:45.060]   See, cold is not really something.
[00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:47.780]   It is the absence of something.
[00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:48.980]   It is the absence of heat.
[00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:50.820]   How do you create darkness?
[00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:54.180]   Darkness is not something you create.
[00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:58.020]   Darkness is the absence of light.
[00:46:58.020 --> 00:46:58.860]   What's hatred?
[00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:00.340]   It's the absence of love.
[00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:01.220]   What's rebellion?
[00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:03.500]   It's the absence of obedience.
[00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:08.700]   What evil is is the absence of what should be.
[00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:12.380]   When you take away God, what you have is non-God.
[00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:15.340]   If God is good and God is life and God is light
[00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:16.900]   and you say, "I don't want God.
[00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:18.540]   "I want to go my own way,"
[00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:20.620]   you have the absence of what should be.
[00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:22.940]   So evil is not nothing, but watch this.
[00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:25.540]   Evil is a no thing.
[00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:31.100]   It's like the hole in the sweater that the moth ate.
[00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:34.300]   We look at that and go, "That shouldn't be."
[00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:36.820]   And I'm gonna say, "Yes, it shouldn't be,
[00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:39.060]   "except there's these things called moths."
[00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:41.660]   And what I'm gonna make a case for
[00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:43.980]   is that moths, who have always existed
[00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:47.140]   because God created them, didn't always eat holes in wool.
[00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:53.060]   God, when he created, there was perfection
[00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:55.460]   and light and love and there was no death.
[00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:56.460]   What is death?
[00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:58.940]   It is the absence of life.
[00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:01.740]   What evil is, God is the author of everything,
[00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:05.060]   and evil is something, but what it is,
[00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:09.820]   it is the absence of what should be there.
[00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:13.580]   Now, we still gotta ask ourself, where did it come from?
[00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:16.700]   And the answer is, it came from,
[00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:20.580]   the story goes, that God created because God is a lover
[00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:22.420]   and one of the things that lovers must do
[00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:24.460]   is share its goodness with others.
[00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:27.660]   And so God created creatures
[00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:29.940]   that he could share his goodness and glory with.
[00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:31.700]   This is the story of the scripture.
[00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:34.900]   Initially, he created the angelic realm.
[00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:36.540]   And he shared his glory with them.
[00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:37.700]   He even created provision for them
[00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:39.740]   to be in the midst of his glory and not be consumed by it
[00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:41.660]   because his glory was so wonderful
[00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:43.460]   that it would be, they would be consumed
[00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:44.740]   if he didn't make provision for them.
[00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:47.500]   And yet, one of those creatures whose job,
[00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:49.020]   if you'll study and look at the scriptures,
[00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:50.100]   what theologians would say,
[00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:52.180]   probably was even to reflect the glory of God
[00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:54.940]   so other angels could see the image of God in them,
[00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:56.100]   started to say, "They're not worshiping
[00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:57.780]   "the image of God in me, they're worshiping me.
[00:48:57.780 --> 00:48:59.940]   "And frankly, I think I can do better than God."
[00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:02.260]   And so he tried to exalt himself above God
[00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:03.620]   and over the rest of creation,
[00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:05.500]   and God in that moment cast him out.
[00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:07.180]   Now when God did that, the scripture says,
[00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:10.500]   there was no question about his sovereignty and power.
[00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:12.020]   But there might have been a whisper in heaven
[00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:13.020]   with the two thirds of angels
[00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:14.840]   that weren't cast out during the rebellion,
[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:18.140]   that maybe he's not really as good as Lucifer was.
[00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:22.260]   And so what God did is he said he created again.
[00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:23.780]   He went into that chaos and void,
[00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:24.780]   into that area of judgment.
[00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:27.960]   He created beauty and order and life.
[00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:30.740]   And he placed into that beauty and order and life
[00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:32.660]   creatures made in his image.
[00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:34.220]   And he told those creatures,
[00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:36.760]   "Enjoy me, walk with me, be blessed by me.
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:38.240]   "There's nothing here that you lack.
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:39.180]   "Just know that I am good.
[00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:40.220]   "You don't need to know good and evil,
[00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:41.500]   "you just need to know me.
[00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:42.800]   "And I want you to love me.
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:46.060]   "But I'm gonna tell you, there's gonna be an enemy there
[00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:48.380]   "and he's gonna try and steal your heart from me.
[00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:49.820]   "And the day you move away from me,
[00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:51.160]   "you're going to move to death.
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:53.080]   "The day that you don't believe that I am good,
[00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:54.760]   "you will experience non-good."
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:50:00.500]   The story of the scripture is that we bought that lie.
[00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:02.220]   We believe that we could do better than God
[00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:03.540]   because the enemy told us we could
[00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:06.140]   and it fed our own little prideful self.
[00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:08.860]   Instead of enjoying God, we started to create our own world.
[00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:12.180]   And into that world comes all the things
[00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:13.220]   that you saw in that video.
[00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:15.160]   And it's not God's world, it's the world that we get
[00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:16.260]   when we leave God.
[00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:17.460]   This is not on God's resume.
[00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:20.560]   In fact, God even says that all of creation,
[00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:21.740]   which is now subject to us
[00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:22.980]   because we were made in the image of God,
[00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:25.620]   so he's given us a right to rule over this creation.
[00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:27.180]   When we fell, creation fell with it.
[00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:29.940]   And God said, "My creation is longing for redemption."
[00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:31.980]   Now follow me on this.
[00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:37.500]   You might say, "Well, God shouldn't have created
[00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:39.340]   "creatures that would rebel against him."
[00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:41.940]   And I'm going to explain to you why he did that.
[00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:42.780]   Are you ready?
[00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:44.040]   Follow this little syllogism.
[00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:47.860]   Every creature God has made is perfect.
[00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:51.020]   Perfect creatures can't do what's imperfect.
[00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:53.380]   Therefore, if God created perfect creatures,
[00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:56.300]   perfect creatures must only act perfectly.
[00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:57.820]   You just told me God created angels,
[00:50:57.820 --> 00:50:59.020]   they rebelled against him.
[00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:00.900]   You told me God created man, they rebelled against him.
[00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:03.020]   Those aren't perfect creatures.
[00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:03.860]   Yes, they are.
[00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:07.300]   Here's the solution to that little problem.
[00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:09.900]   God made everything perfect.
[00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:15.860]   One perfect thing that God created is free creatures.
[00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:18.500]   Why did he make free creatures?
[00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:22.420]   Because free creatures have the ability to make choices
[00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:24.980]   and they have the ability specifically to love.
[00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:25.820]   And let me say it this way.
[00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:27.620]   One of the things that perfect creatures must do
[00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:28.460]   is love.
[00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:30.420]   In order to be able to love, you've got to choose.
[00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:31.260]   You're not a robot.
[00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:32.860]   I can remember when I was talking to my little girl
[00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:34.340]   and she asked me when she was four years old,
[00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:36.460]   "Daddy, why did God let us sin?"
[00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:39.220]   And I just said, "Because he loves you
[00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:41.020]   "and because he wants you to love him."
[00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:43.100]   I said, "Ally, let me ask you a question.
[00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:44.500]   "You got lots of stuffed animals in your room.
[00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:46.100]   "You're the first kid, so all you got
[00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:49.340]   "is more stuffed animals than any kid could ever need.
[00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:51.900]   "Look around your room and I can tell you
[00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:53.060]   "that you play with your little stuffed animals.
[00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:54.300]   "You got names for all of them, don't you?"
[00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:55.940]   And she went around the room and she talked about the names
[00:51:55.940 --> 00:51:57.500]   she has for her stuffed animals.
[00:51:57.500 --> 00:51:58.340]   She has for them.
[00:51:58.340 --> 00:51:59.420]   I go, "What if I left you in this room
[00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:02.060]   "and I told you that you could be God
[00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:03.900]   "over these stuffed animals and you could always
[00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:05.140]   "make them sing songs to you,
[00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:06.380]   "you could always make them love you,
[00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:08.140]   "you could always make them hug you.
[00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:09.700]   "When you wanted to sleep with them and cuddle,
[00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:10.540]   "they would always do it.
[00:52:10.540 --> 00:52:11.380]   "They would never say no.
[00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:13.180]   "They would be at your beck and call
[00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:15.660]   "and they would never, ever once disappoint you.
[00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:16.820]   "But Ally, you need to know something.
[00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:17.660]   "They're not real.
[00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:20.060]   "They're just stuffed animals.
[00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:21.140]   "They can't really love you.
[00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:22.900]   "They won't hurt you, but they won't really love you.
[00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:25.220]   "But you can imagine they'll love you.
[00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:27.620]   "Or you can be friends with Sally, the street.
[00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:31.460]   "You can be friends with Maggie.
[00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:35.820]   "You can be friends with Susan
[00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:39.140]   "and you can be friends with Ginger.
[00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:40.740]   "But you need to know something.
[00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:43.780]   "Ginger and Susie and Sally, Megan,
[00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:44.780]   "they can really love you,
[00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:47.500]   "but they're also gonna maybe hurt you
[00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:51.020]   "and disappoint you and let you down
[00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:52.540]   "and not wanna spend time with you
[00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:54.260]   "and say mean things to you.
[00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:59.420]   "But which one do you want, Ally?"
[00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:00.500]   And she says, "I want friends.
[00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:01.340]   "I want real friends.
[00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:02.180]   "I love my stuffed animals,
[00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:03.020]   "but my stuffed animals don't really love me.
[00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:05.020]   "What I really want is real interaction."
[00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:07.060]   They go, "That's because you're made in the image of God.
[00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:10.020]   "And that's why God gave you the right to choose."
[00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:15.140]   See, one of the things perfect creatures must do is love.
[00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:15.980]   In order to be able to love,
[00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:16.860]   you've gotta be able to choose.
[00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:18.140]   So to follow this little syllabus,
[00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:20.060]   one perfect thing God made is free creatures.
[00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:22.300]   Free will allows for the choice to not love.
[00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:24.660]   We call that hate or rebel or evil.
[00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:27.060]   Therefore, it is possible that a God
[00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:28.220]   that created something perfect
[00:53:28.220 --> 00:53:30.620]   out of that imperfection could rise.
[00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:33.860]   I'm gonna move a little quickly with you here
[00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:35.020]   and wrap this thing up.
[00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:38.460]   What I wanna do is just share with you
[00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:41.500]   just this little excerpt that explains
[00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:43.660]   a little bit about why there is evil.
[00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:44.940]   Because remember at the beginning,
[00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:47.000]   I said to you that there's no good purpose
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:47.840]   for evil and suffering?
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:49.260]   I'm gonna tell you there is.
[00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:55.780]   But let me just deal with this issue of power and love.
[00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:58.320]   This is from a book by a guy named Philip Yancey.
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:53:59.860]   It's called "Disappointment with God."
[00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:00.780]   "Is God unfair?
[00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:01.620]   "Is he silent?
[00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:02.700]   "Is he hidden?
[00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:04.580]   "Such questions must have troubled the Hebrews
[00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:07.160]   "until in Moses' lifetime, God took off all the wraps.
[00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:08.780]   "He punished evil and he rewarded good."
[00:54:08.780 --> 00:54:10.740]   Just like we kinda want God to do.
[00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:11.640]   "He spoke audibly.
[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:14.340]   "He made himself visible, first to Moses in a burning bush,
[00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:16.740]   "and then to the Israelites in a pillar of cloud and fire.
[00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:19.420]   "The response of the Israelites to such direct intervention
[00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:22.260]   "offers an important insight into the inherent limits
[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:24.980]   "of all power."
[00:54:24.980 --> 00:54:27.260]   Power can do everything but the most important thing.
[00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:29.340]   Power cannot control love.
[00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:34.160]   "The 10 plagues in Exodus show the power of God
[00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:35.100]   "over a pharaoh.
[00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:38.660]   "But the 10 major rebellions recorded in Numbers
[00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:43.840]   "show the impotence of power to bring about
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:45.020]   "what God desires most,
[00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:46.720]   "the love and faithfulness of his people.
[00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:48.640]   "No pyrotechnic displays of omnipotence
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:50.820]   "could make them trust and follow him."
[00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:53.340]   We don't need the ancient Israelites
[00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:54.340]   really to teach us this fact.
[00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:56.740]   We can see it today in societies where power runs wild.
[00:54:56.740 --> 00:54:59.140]   In a concentration camp, as so many witnesses have told us,
[00:54:59.140 --> 00:55:01.780]   the guards possess nearly unlimited power.
[00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:03.700]   By applying force, they can make you renounce God,
[00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:06.940]   curse your family, work without pay, eat human excrement,
[00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:08.820]   kill and then bury your closest friend
[00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:10.120]   or even your own mother.
[00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:11.820]   All this is within their power.
[00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:15.580]   Only one thing is not, they cannot force you to love them.
[00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:18.200]   "The fact that love does not operate
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:19.780]   "according to the rules of power may help explain
[00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:22.380]   "why God sometimes seems shy to use his power.
[00:55:22.380 --> 00:55:24.340]   "He created us to love him,
[00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:26.740]   "but his most impressive display of a miracle,
[00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:28.520]   "the kind we may secretly long for,
[00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:30.540]   "does nothing to foster that love."
[00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:32.440]   As one guy put it, "God's problem is not that God
[00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:33.860]   "is not able to do certain things."
[00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:37.340]   Watch this, "God's problem is that God loves.
[00:55:37.340 --> 00:55:40.500]   "Love complicates the life of God,
[00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:43.800]   "even as it complicates every life."
[00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:49.140]   Let me tell you the purpose and beauty of evil.
[00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:52.100]   Because we have seen evil, it makes us love what is good.
[00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:53.240]   Pain is a gift.
[00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:55.420]   At the beginning, we talked about this idea,
[00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:57.260]   there is no good purpose for evil and suffering.
[00:55:57.260 --> 00:56:00.080]   I'm gonna tell you, I don't ever drop on some persons
[00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:01.580]   who are really in the midst of suffering,
[00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:03.380]   hey man, all things work together for good
[00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:04.980]   to those who love God and are called
[00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:05.980]   according to his purpose.
[00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:07.480]   By the way, that is very true.
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:10.700]   But the Bible does not deny me the right
[00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:11.780]   to mourn with those that mourn.
[00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:13.240]   In fact, it commands me to.
[00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:15.700]   It just tells me not to grieve as those who have no hope.
[00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:17.300]   It tells me to do what David did,
[00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:18.700]   to tell God, God, this is a beating.
[00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:20.420]   How long is this gonna go on?
[00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:21.940]   And then just to stop and rest.
[00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:24.340]   And for him to go, I'll tell you how long it's gonna go on.
[00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:26.340]   And I'll tell you why I haven't wrapped up
[00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:28.220]   judgment against evil completely yet.
[00:56:28.220 --> 00:56:31.540]   It's because I love people.
[00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:35.140]   And if I'm gonna get rid of evil,
[00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:36.780]   it's gonna be all evil, Todd.
[00:56:36.780 --> 00:56:38.920]   Not just the evil you want me to get rid of.
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:40.620]   In fact, everybody in this room would come in and say,
[00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:41.820]   I wish God would get rid of evil.
[00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:44.740]   And what you're really doing is if you have not
[00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:46.740]   had your evil atoned for and covered,
[00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:48.340]   you are wishing for your own destruction.
[00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:50.140]   Because evil is not what you think is evil.
[00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:52.160]   Evil is less than perfection.
[00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:57.040]   Anybody here still wanna get rid of all evil?
[00:56:57.040 --> 00:57:01.660]   If you're a fatalist or a nihilist, you should.
[00:57:01.660 --> 00:57:03.060]   But see, God has made you in his image.
[00:57:03.060 --> 00:57:04.180]   He said eternity in your hearts.
[00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:05.500]   And that's why you don't put a gun in your mouth
[00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:07.180]   and pull it like Ernest Hemingway,
[00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:08.900]   who was very drunk when he did it.
[00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:13.220]   Because you know something is true,
[00:57:13.220 --> 00:57:15.340]   and that is that life is not over at the grave.
[00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:16.580]   It's an eternally fixed beginning.
[00:57:16.580 --> 00:57:17.900]   And what God says, I don't want life
[00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:19.220]   to have to start for you at the grave.
[00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:21.320]   That's why I want you to start experiencing life right now.
[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:22.540]   And pain is a gift.
[00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:25.040]   It tells you something is not as it should be.
[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:26.920]   There's a guy named Paul Brand
[00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:29.140]   that I recommend you guys do some research on.
[00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:32.420]   And Paul Brand is the world's leading expert on leprosy.
[00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:34.380]   Leprosy is a really interesting disease.
[00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:37.460]   Do you know, by the way, if you go back and read
[00:57:37.460 --> 00:57:39.860]   in Exodus where it's talking about skin issues,
[00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:41.540]   it talks about leprosy and a disease
[00:57:41.540 --> 00:57:43.340]   where it has to be put outside the camp.
[00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:45.660]   When you see lepers in the Bible, it's a picture of sin.
[00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:46.660]   Let me tell you why.
[00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:49.300]   Leprosy is not a flesh-eating disease.
[00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:52.900]   Leprosy is a disease that attacks the nerve endings.
[00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:57.020]   And what it does is lepers can't experience pain.
[00:57:57.020 --> 00:57:59.820]   What happens to a leper is they don't do what you do.
[00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:02.440]   If you're sweeping a floor, you don't even know it,
[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:04.380]   but you just are constantly manipulating
[00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:06.720]   that broom in your hand 1,000 little times
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:08.620]   so it doesn't wear a groove into your hand.
[00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:09.540]   Lepers don't care.
[00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:10.680]   They never have to adjust the broom
[00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:12.620]   because they can't feel it.
[00:58:12.620 --> 00:58:15.100]   And what eventually happens is they rub their skin raw,
[00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:15.940]   but that doesn't hurt.
[00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:17.140]   Usually when you rub your skin raw,
[00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:19.340]   you get a blister and you kind of go, that hurts.
[00:58:19.340 --> 00:58:20.180]   And you address it.
[00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:22.060]   Lepers don't address it.
[00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:23.420]   And it gets infected.
[00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:24.700]   And they don't even care that it's infected.
[00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:26.460]   That infection is kind of ugly and slightly,
[00:58:26.460 --> 00:58:27.820]   they'll just wrap it up, but they'll let it go.
[00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:29.140]   Once it's out of sight, it's out of mind
[00:58:29.140 --> 00:58:30.460]   because it doesn't hurt.
[00:58:30.460 --> 00:58:33.820]   And what eventually happens, that infection then
[00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:35.440]   starts to not just go into the flesh,
[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:37.100]   but eventually makes its way into the bone.
[00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:38.700]   The only time a leper will call for help
[00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:41.240]   is when the stench overwhelms them.
[00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:46.320]   Then they'll go to somebody and say, this just stinks.
[00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:47.600]   Would you address it?
[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:49.800]   And usually at that point in lepers,
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:51.500]   it has gone all the way down to the bone.
[00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:53.000]   What literally happens is it affects the structure
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.880]   of the body and the skin pulls back.
[00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:58.000]   And what you see is that the body literally eats itself.
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:58.960]   It shrinks back.
[00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:00.840]   You become less of a person.
[00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:02.800]   Is that not a beautiful picture of sin?
[00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:07.040]   That disease affects you and you just pull back
[00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:09.260]   and you become less and less of who you were intended to be.
[00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:10.840]   That's what it means when it says in the scripture
[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:12.520]   that we all become less than the glory
[00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:14.020]   that God intended for us.
[00:59:14.020 --> 00:59:15.520]   And see, when we see that happening,
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:16.780]   God says, let me heal you.
[00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:18.480]   That's why the only person that could heal a leper
[00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:21.180]   in the Bible wasn't a doctor, it was a priest.
[00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:22.020]   That's why the very first healing
[00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:24.500]   that Jesus went through was a leper.
[00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:28.020]   'Cause God has made new what no one else can make new.
[00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:30.380]   What God does is he brings back
[00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:31.940]   into our dead hearts feeling.
[00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:36.940]   If you don't have pain, you don't know something is wrong.
[00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:42.640]   And God gave us the gift of pain and chaos and suffering
[00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:46.560]   so we would stop trying to create a utopia
[00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:50.920]   through philosophers and some new political movement
[00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:53.660]   or some new government messiah.
[00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:56.120]   And we would pay attention to God.
[00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:59.440]   Now what did God do in this world that turned away from him
[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:00.780]   that he brought judgment to?
[01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:02.260]   Just like he said, that's omnipotence.
[01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:04.960]   But what did we never see before evil entered in?
[01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:07.220]   We never saw the love of God.
[01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:09.020]   We knew nothing of mercy.
[01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:10.780]   We knew nothing of kindness.
[01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:12.780]   We knew nothing of rescue and redemption.
[01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:18.420]   And God is revealing his goodness and his glory
[01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:21.300]   in a way that we can go, rightly do we love you.
[01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:26.820]   And rightly do we run away from this thing
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:30.140]   that brings pain, this sin, this death, this deceiver
[01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:32.060]   who tells us you're not there.
[01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:34.680]   When in fact, the reason we're here
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:37.280]   is because we've acted like you are not
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:39.400]   what you claim to be from the beginning.
[01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:42.000]   And in your kindness, you let us and our world
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.120]   experience pain and death and child abuse and rape
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:49.680]   and this beautiful creation to have chaos
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:51.720]   because this world is not your home.
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:55.080]   Now you might say this.
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:56.800]   If God is all good, he would destroy evil.
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:57.920]   If God is all good, he could.
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.920]   Evil's not destroyed, therefore there's not an all good.
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:00.760]   If God is all good, he could.
[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:01.880]   Evil's not destroyed, therefore there's not
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:02.960]   an all good and powerful God.
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:04.880]   But there's another way to look at this.
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:07.640]   If God is all good, he will defeat evil.
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:10.320]   If God is all good, he can defeat evil.
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:15.320]   Evil is not yet defeated, therefore God will one day
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:18.000]   completely defeat evil.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.120]   That's the story of scripture.
[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:27.160]   Scripture says that God does hate evil.
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:28.340]   He's done something about it.
[01:01:28.340 --> 01:01:31.340]   When he was here, he wept over the grief and suffering
[01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:32.360]   that we experience.
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:34.800]   He was tempted in every way as we have been.
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:36.680]   He made provision for evil.
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:41.680]   He became sin on our behalf and that he might
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:44.940]   give us his righteousness.
[01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:47.080]   The story of scripture is this world is broken.
[01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:48.200]   God knows it's broken.
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:51.520]   He wept at the effects of sin and he wept over those
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:54.420]   that rejected him as the solution to their sin
[01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:55.560]   because he loves men.
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:02:00.300]   Do you know why God has not wrapped up judgment on evil yet?
[01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:03.600]   The answer is in 2 Peter chapter three verse nine.
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:07.700]   And it says this, God is not slow as some count slowness.
[01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:11.980]   But is patient towards you, not wishing for any to perish
[01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:13.740]   but for all to come to repentance.
[01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:15.440]   I'm gonna tell you why God has not gotten rid of evil
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:16.960]   because there's some people in this room tonight
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:21.320]   that have never had their evil covered, atoned for.
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:26.220]   And God loves you and the pain that's in your heart
[01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:28.380]   and the pain that's in your world is screaming to you,
[01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:29.820]   this is not God's world.
[01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:32.200]   It's a world spun out of control away from him
[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:33.820]   and he loves you personally in it.
[01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:35.420]   One day he's gonna redeem the world
[01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:37.860]   and he's gonna take redeemed people with him into it
[01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:40.860]   but for now, he is saying let me redeem you
[01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:42.100]   and then he does this.
[01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:43.940]   This amazing thing when you're redeemed by the God
[01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:46.220]   who rescues you from sin and death is he says,
[01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:48.540]   hey, now that you know that I'm good
[01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:50.040]   and now that you can trust me,
[01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:54.340]   I'm gonna leave you here in this world filled with cancer
[01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:57.880]   and loneliness and rejection and adultery
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:02:59.740]   and rape and poverty
[01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:04.760]   and I'm gonna ask you to do what you can do about it.
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:06.520]   I'm gonna ask you to be my hands and feet
[01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:08.920]   and when you do it, I'm gonna tell you to tell others
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:10.840]   that you do it not because you're doing some random act
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:12.760]   of kindness but because you're worshiping the God
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:14.320]   that wants them to know of his goodness
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:16.640]   and you are here as his messenger.
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:19.080]   And so Jesus says to you who have come to him,
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:21.340]   hey, in this world you will have trouble but take heart,
[01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:23.580]   I've overcome the world, this is not my world
[01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:29.120]   but you are my people if you have accepted my grace
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:32.020]   and provision for your sin and evil and suffering and death
[01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:35.260]   and I'm gonna ask that you serve me for a while
[01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:38.220]   and I'm not so unjust as to forget your kindness
[01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:39.180]   that you've shown to the saints
[01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:40.880]   and still ministering to the saints
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:44.500]   and there's gonna be a forever where it's gonna make
[01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:46.660]   this 60, 70, 80 years look like nothing
[01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:47.860]   and I know it's really hard for you
[01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:49.700]   and maybe your story is a wheelchair,
[01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:52.340]   maybe your story is barrenness,
[01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:54.300]   maybe your story is an abusive daddy,
[01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:57.760]   I didn't want abusive daddies and wheelchairs and barrenness
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:59.820]   but that's the effects of sin
[01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:01.500]   and my grace is sufficient for you
[01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:07.380]   and I wanna forgive you and I wanna make you heroic in it,
[01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:09.760]   a messenger of hope.
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:13.860]   That's the story, gang.
[01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:19.100]   Evil not only does not disprove God,
[01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:21.420]   it proves that there is a God
[01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:25.700]   who's doing exactly what he said would happen
[01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:29.860]   if we left him and God didn't just throw out some philosophy
[01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:32.820]   he anchored his story in the context of history,
[01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:36.580]   go check it out, the Bible isn't just some poetic idea,
[01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:39.260]   it is a historical narrative of what God is doing
[01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:42.380]   in revealing his glory so that you would want to know him.
[01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:44.340]   The story of the Bible is not behave
[01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:45.460]   and you might be saved,
[01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:47.500]   the story of the Bible is God loves you
[01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:51.460]   and is gonna rescue you from your disobedience.
[01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:56.100]   Don't perform for me, let me provide for you.
[01:04:56.100 --> 01:05:02.300]   I hate evil, I judge evil,
[01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:05.300]   I pour out all my wrath on evil
[01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:08.380]   and guess what, I know what it's like
[01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:12.360]   to feel like I've forgotten, been forgotten by God.
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:16.860]   Check this, God, why have you forgotten me?
[01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:18.040]   Why have you forsaken me?
[01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:22.580]   Because Jesus was found in the likeness of a man
[01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:24.340]   and being made in the appearance of man,
[01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:25.840]   humbled himself and became obedient
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:28.780]   even to the point of death, death on a cross, why?
[01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:31.740]   Because God hates death and suffering
[01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:33.220]   because he's a God of love
[01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:36.180]   and he wants you to accept his provision.
[01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:40.840]   He wants you to join him in declaring to the world his love.
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:46.340]   And he promises that one day he's gonna roll this thing up
[01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:50.700]   and there will be forever evil
[01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:52.580]   where there's nothing that will ever remind you of God again
[01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:54.820]   if you choose not to worship him
[01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:56.280]   and there will be forever good
[01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:58.880]   where we know that he's sovereign and good
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:00.780]   because the rescue has happened.
[01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:04.420]   Do you love him?
[01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:06.300]   Do you want to know him?
[01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:07.560]   Tonight can be your night.
[01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:10.820]   You just got to acknowledge that you're part of the problem
[01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:12.460]   of evil in this world
[01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:15.540]   and that you need rescue and atonement and provision
[01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:17.220]   and you're gonna find it in the person of his son,
[01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:19.580]   Jesus Christ, who was there in the beginning
[01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:21.180]   with God and was God.
[01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:23.760]   And because he loved you,
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:25.620]   entered into the sin and death of this world
[01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:27.380]   and he provided what only God can provide
[01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:29.280]   which is a perfect and complete sacrifice
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:32.860]   which appeased his perfect nature
[01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:36.200]   so that he might be just in judging sin
[01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:38.340]   and the justifier of those who love him.
[01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:42.140]   And so you can have a logical construct.
[01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:44.220]   Don't be surprised by the evil among you.
[01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:45.920]   It's exactly what you think you would get
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:47.820]   in a world that's run away from God,
[01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:52.760]   run with God and declare hope to others.
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:56.300]   Father, thank you for this night with these porch friends
[01:06:56.300 --> 01:06:59.180]   and I pray that they would be the rest of their life
[01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:02.100]   learning more about you and your character and your nature
[01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:03.640]   and I pray that you would rescue them
[01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:05.980]   from lies and sin and death.
[01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:07.380]   Thank you, Lord, that we can come in here
[01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:08.340]   and we can reason together
[01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:09.680]   that you're not afraid of our questions
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:12.620]   but you want us to really listen when we ask.
[01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:14.100]   And so God, tonight we ask this,
[01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:15.460]   that you would open the eyes of our heart
[01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:16.300]   and let us see you.
[01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:17.540]   We ask that you would allow those of us
[01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:21.620]   who don't know you to know you if you're that good.
[01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:23.200]   Would you let us not go to bed tonight?
[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:24.440]   Would you let us not leave this room
[01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:26.340]   until we do business with a God who rescues
[01:07:26.340 --> 01:07:27.900]   and if we came in this room knowing you,
[01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:29.180]   may we love you more.
[01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:31.020]   May we turn to the person to our left and to our right.
[01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:31.860]   Are you suffering?
[01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:33.140]   This is a beaten down world.
[01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:34.660]   How can I help you?
[01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:36.080]   How can I encourage you?
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:37.900]   How can I be a friend for you in a friendless world?
[01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:41.580]   How can I offer you hope in the midst of your hopelessness?
[01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:44.640]   I pray that believers in this room, Lord,
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:46.060]   would love as you love, do as you did,
[01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:47.660]   suffer as you suffer until that day
[01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:50.400]   when they will move to that world
[01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:54.660]   where they'll just receive your goodness forever.
[01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:57.320]   While we're here on this journey,
[01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:00.940]   help us to take on evil with the declaration of good news,
[01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:03.300]   the doing of good deeds by the power of your spirit
[01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:05.420]   because we live in relationship with you,
[01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:08.380]   not so you'll love us but because we love you.
[01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:11.300]   For the glory of God, the salvation of others,
[01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:14.060]   and for joy to our own hearts, I pray.
[01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:14.900]   Amen.
[01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:20.820]   God is powerful, but he's not a rapist.
[01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:25.460]   You know, money can buy you a good dog,
[01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:28.980]   it just can't buy you the wag of his tail.
[01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:31.980]   And what God has done in expressing his goodness to you
[01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:33.260]   through the redemption of this world,
[01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:35.700]   through the crucifixion of his son,
[01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:39.020]   is show you his love and he just says, "Come to me."
[01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:42.020]   But he's not gonna force himself on you.
[01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:43.900]   You're free to choose to follow him
[01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:47.540]   or you're free to choose to make this your heaven.
[01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:48.620]   But one day, mark my word,
[01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:49.780]   there's gonna be two kinds of people,
[01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:52.860]   people that says God to them, "Have as you want.
[01:08:52.860 --> 01:08:56.860]   "There'll be nothing that will ever remind you of me again."
[01:08:56.860 --> 01:09:00.660]   That means nothing but pain, no rest.
[01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:01.900]   Death would even be a gift
[01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:04.460]   and that's why there won't even be that.
[01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:06.100]   Just eternal loss.
[01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:09.380]   And then there's people that will come to him now
[01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:10.820]   and say, "God, your will be done.
[01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:13.460]   "Redeem me from death and sin."
[01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:17.420]   And to you he'll say, "Your will be done.
[01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:19.460]   "Let me give you all of me.
[01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:21.620]   "And there'll be nothing that will ever remind you
[01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:24.540]   "of the absence of me again."
[01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:26.980]   God's story is he wants you to start
[01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:28.420]   to live in that reality right now.
[01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:30.060]   That's why there are crazy people like me
[01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:33.420]   who sing in the midst of chaos and cancer.
[01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:35.940]   'Cause I'm not surprised by it.
[01:09:35.940 --> 01:09:37.420]   I know why it's here.
[01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:38.660]   I do what I can to mitigate it,
[01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:41.540]   but my God's sovereign over it.
[01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:43.460]   And if this is the end for me, I just move to glory.
[01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:44.740]   But while I'm here, I'm gonna be faithful
[01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:45.780]   and filled with hope.
[01:09:45.780 --> 01:09:48.380]   (gentle music)
[01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:58.380]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
