00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 [Music]

2
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Welcome to the porch. It's good to be with you guys this evening.

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Really excited about the message this evening.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 And I'll start just by talking about a conversation that recently occurred between my wife and I,

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 between Monica and I. I'm often reflecting back to my time in high school, okay?

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Which looked like me talking about, you know, my best friend. Yeah, my best friend and I.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 My best friend Travis and I, we were there. And then, you know, later on I'll tell her another story.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 My best friend Trey and I, you know, and then I'll tell her another story.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 My best friend Cullen and I, and then I'll tell her another story.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 I'm like, "Hey, my best friend Sean and I." Well, she starts keeping track.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 And she's like, "Hey, why did you have so many best friends? Like, were you just popular?

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Like, why did you have all these best friends in high school?"

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 And I'm like, "No, it wasn't that I was popular. It was that I couldn't keep them."

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 And I started, like, reflecting on this and kind of had this breakthrough moment.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 I'm like, "Oh, no." And I realized that I had this, like, explosive anger problem, which would, like, end.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 You know, there would be these explosions and then it would end a relationship.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 And then I would move into another friendship or a relationship, dating relationship or friendship, whatever that was.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 There would be another explosion. And then rather than, you know, figure out what was going on in the midst of that explosion,

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 I would move on to another relationship. And I'll give you a picture of one, okay?

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 There was a summer that I actually worked in a neighboring town, Victoria, if you've heard of it.

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 And so I would work there. I worked at Courtesy Car Wash.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 And rather than drive back and forth, I was about 30 minutes away, for the summer, I moved in with my friend and his mom.

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 And I just lived with them that summer so that I could work there.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 And so he was my best friend. And some other friends were going to go to Schlitterbahn.

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 If you don't know what that is, it's the closest thing to heaven on this planet.

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 And so they were going to go to Schlitterbahn, and I wanted to go to Schlitterbahn.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 And so I, you know, and I invite my buddy who I'm living with, "Hey, you want to go to Schlitterbahn with us?"

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Okay, and this is in high school. And I think we were juniors or seniors.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 And he's like, "No, man, I can't. You know, I don't have any money. I can't afford the ticket to get in."

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 And I'm like, "Oh, no, no worries, bro. You gave me a place. I'm banking up at Courtesy Car Wash. I got you. Okay?

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 No, you come. I will pay for your ticket. Man, I got you."

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 And he's like, "Really? You do that?" I was like, "Yeah, of course, man. You gave me a roof. Man, I got you. Let's go."

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 And so we all go to Schlitterbahn. Have an amazing time. Okay?

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Uphill water coasters. Who knew? It was fantastic, this Schlitterbahn.

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 And so towards the end of our wonderful time there, I see him go into the gift shop.

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 All right? And I'm watching. And he comes out of the gift shop, and he's got a new Puka shell necklace.

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 And I'm like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing?"

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 And he's like, "Well, I bought a necklace. Had a little shark tooth hanging down there in the middle."

39
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 I was like, "Say, idiot. I thought you didn't have any money."

40
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 And he's like, "Well, I didn't have money for a ticket in, but when I saw this necklace, I couldn't refuse."

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 You know, it's Puka shells. And I'm like, "No, no, no, no, bro. I paid. I paid for you to get in there.

42
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 You had money. You're spending it on dumb necklaces? And right there in the parking lot of Schlitterbahn, it escalated.

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 And you saw another explosion of JP's anger, and push came to shove, literally.

44
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 And what happened was I never talked to him again.

45
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 He very literally was like, "No, get your stuff out of my house."

46
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 And I called. No return phone call. I talked to his mom. "No, it's done, man."

47
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 I tried to embarrass him in that parking lot, and the truth is I succeeded.

48
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 And it cost me a friend. And what's crazy, over a shark tooth Puka shell necklace.

49
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 And I saw him years later. Now we're grown men, post-college, and we're at a party together, and it's still awkward.

50
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Because of a shark tooth necklace.

51
00:04:49,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 "Hey, man. Hey. Wife and kids. Oh, yeah. Wife and kids. Yeah, yeah. Cool. You doing what? You still got the necklace? Okay. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding."

52
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 And isn't that what conflict does? It causes these explosions in our life that sometimes we don't know exactly how to respond to?

53
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 See, explosions marked my life and cost me most of the relationships that I had.

54
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 And you know what the common denominator was? It was me.

55
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 It was me.

56
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 And so my guess is this evening that some explosions marked your life.

57
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 And so as we move through this series, Quarter Life Crisis, tonight we're talking about the crisis of conflict.

58
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 The crisis of conflict.

59
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 It is fun to watch these explosions from a distance, but it is not fun when you are a part of them.

60
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Like, I'll just give weight to what I just said. I remember when reality TV started, okay?

61
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 Like, there was no reality TV. Then all of a sudden there was the real world one.

62
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 And it was like watching a train wreck of an explosion.

63
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 You could not look away. And then all of a sudden, reality TV just exploded and everybody began to watch it.

64
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Why? Because we were entertained by these explosions.

65
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 In fact, you know what makes reality TV wonderful?

66
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 Constant conflict. Constant conflict.

67
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 Watching dysfunctional people not work through their problems.

68
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 And we watch from afar.

69
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 But the problem is, some of these explosions mark our lives.

70
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 It marks our career.

71
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 It marks our relationships.

72
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 It marks our friendships.

73
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 It marks families.

74
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 It marks holidays.

75
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 It marks roommate situations.

76
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 If you don't know how to navigate through this, your life will end up looking like one big train wreck.

77
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 One big explosion with a common denominator of you.

78
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 And you will take it into marriage. You will take it into future season.

79
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 You will take it into parenting.

80
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 Do you know the number one, I read this, that one of, I'll just say the number one from this particular source,

81
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 the number one determiner of success in marriage is ability to resolve conflict.

82
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 As Monica and I meet with people in premarital counseling,

83
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 they take a test called Prepare, it's a personality kind of profile,

84
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 and they grade you on your ability to resolve conflict.

85
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 It's the first thing I look at.

86
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Because I know how hard they're going to have to work at marriage based on what that says.

87
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 Their ability to resolve conflict is.

88
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 What I am going to teach you tonight, friends,

89
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 I have traveled to Africa to teach the governments there with friends.

90
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Presidents, and I'm not exaggerating, presidents of foreign nations have traveled here to this property

91
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 to learn the very things that I am going to present you with this evening from the scriptures.

92
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 If you apply this to your life, it will change your life for the better.

93
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 This is huge stuff. You have to have this.

94
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 So why do we put it in the quarter life crisis series?

95
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Because as I look at the crises that people face in their 20s and 30s so often,

96
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 right at the center of it is an interpersonal conflict.

97
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 An inability to get along with someone.

98
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 A roommate, someone that has hurt you, a parent, a co-worker, a boss.

99
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 And we have to understand what the scriptures say to this.

100
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 So we have covered career, crisis of career, money crisis, selfie crisis, singleness crisis, authority crisis.

101
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 Tonight we are going to talk about conflict crisis, which affects every relationship you have.

102
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 And the path that I want to take you down this evening through the scriptures is a change in perspective.

103
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 I want to give you a new perspective of conflict.

104
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 In the middle, my second point will be a part to own.

105
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 We are going to talk about your part in the conflict.

106
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 And before you leave here this evening, I want to present to you a very practical path to peace.

107
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 A path you can walk in to pursue peace.

108
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 And so I'm going to be all throughout the scriptures.

109
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 The Bible has a whole lot to say about this.

110
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 But I will camp primarily in Matthew 5 if you want to turn there.

111
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 It's the first book of the New Testament.

112
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 Chapter 5. I'll also be in chapter 7 and eventually chapter 18.

113
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 I will be in Ephesians 4.

114
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 But if you just want to turn to one place, you can go to Matthew 5.

115
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 It's the Sermon on the Mount.

116
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 It is the greatest sermon ever preached.

117
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 It was preached by King Jesus.

118
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 And here he says in chapter 5, verse 21.

119
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 "You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'You shall not murder.'

120
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 And anyone who murders will be subject to judgment."

121
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 Jesus is referencing the Old Testament Ten Commandments.

122
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 The commandments that were given to Moses as he came down from the mountain.

123
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 That were written with the finger of God.

124
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 And one of them was, "Thou shalt not kill" or "Thou shalt not murder."

125
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 Jesus is saying to the people, "Hey, you've heard it said as he's preaching his sermon.

126
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 Hey, you guys know you're not supposed to murder."

127
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 And so here at the Porsche today, 2014, we're nodding our head.

128
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 Like, "Yeah, man, you just don't kill people. That's not good."

129
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 We don't kill people. Okay?

130
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 As followers of Jesus, we don't do that.

131
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 That's like low-hanging fruit. Got it. Don't kill people.

132
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 Okay? So, man, that's good. We're passing that test.

133
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 Jesus says, "But I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister will be subject to judgment."

134
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 Okay, so I know I'm not supposed to kill, but if I get angry?

135
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister, "Raca," which just literally translates "worthless."

136
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 So you're giving them a degrading term.

137
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 You're trying to embarrass them.

138
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 You're trying to make them feel less than human or less than you.

139
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 "Anyone who says this is answerable to the court, and anyone who says you fool will be in danger of the fire of hell."

140
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 Whoa, Jesus.

141
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 Okay, I got, like, "Okay, so don't take a gun, put it in someone's head, pull the trigger."

142
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 Okay, got that.

143
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 You're telling me if I call somebody a fool, I'm in danger of the fires of hell?

144
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 That if there's anger in my heart, that I might be in dangers of hell?

145
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 Jesus is talking about a state of being.

146
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 You walk around just angry.

147
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 It can be evidence that you do not have his spirit.

148
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 Jesus is telling you something very important.

149
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 Your anger is an opportunity.

150
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 It is an opportunity to be given to that you would respond with anger,

151
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 or it is an opportunity to honor God in the way that you handle or control your anger.

152
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 He's talking about a response to anger.

153
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 He says, "Hey, if you call someone a fool or you internalize that emotion,

154
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 maybe you don't say it, but you think it,"

155
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 He says, "you're guilty of murder."

156
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 You're guilty of an offense as grave as murder.

157
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 And so being a Christ follower is retraining our response to anger by yielding to God's spirit.

158
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 It is dependence that he wants from us.

159
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 And so our problem, your and my problem this evening,

160
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 is that we see conflict as an opportunity to display our anger.

161
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 "Oh, yeah? You want to do that? Oh, yeah?

162
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 Oh, you want to buy that chartreuse necklace?

163
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 Oh, it's like that, huh?

164
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 Oh, no, I'm going to show her. Oh, I'm going to show him.

165
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 I'm going to tell him. Oh, I got a word for him."

166
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 And that's just not how followers of Jesus respond.

167
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 Conflict is not an opportunity to display your anger.

168
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Conflict is an opportunity to bring our anger under the Spirit's control.

169
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 And so my first point this evening is I want to talk about a perspective to change.

170
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 I want to change your perspective of the way that you see conflict.

171
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 I want you this evening to begin to see conflict as an opportunity to show who you are.

172
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Better said, to show who you belong to.

173
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 Conflict is your greatest opportunity to show the world who is in control of you,

174
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 who is your master, who is your father.

175
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 Let me show you from the Scriptures.

176
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 It's the same chapter, verse 9, the Beatitudes.

177
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God."

178
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 Who's children of God? Who is called God's children?

179
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 The peacemakers.

180
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 You want to look like God.

181
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 Like in the same way that my kids resemble a lot of me.

182
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 I'm in the freakishly weird tall category.

183
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 There's like normal tall and then there's weirdo tall.

184
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 I'm in the weirdo tall category.

185
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 So my little girl in first grade, she's also in the weirdo tall category.

186
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 I can say that. I'm her daddy.

187
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Those kids say that. It's going to be conflict.

188
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 But in the same way that she looks like me, we look like God in the way that we make peace.

189
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 Not fake peace.

190
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 The Scriptures are not calling you to be a peace faker.

191
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Someone who suppresses their anger.

192
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 It's there, but you just don't let the world see it.

193
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 You think you're not going to show the world?

194
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 It doesn't call you to be a peace breaker.

195
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 These are people who walk around and there's just explosions everywhere.

196
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 I can't wait to show you how angry I am.

197
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 I'm going to give you a piece of my mind.

198
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 Oh yeah? You just kind of have that attitude.

199
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 Oh, you want to do that? I'm going to get the best of me.

200
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 You know them. Don't nudge them right now.

201
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 I see some of you.

202
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 I'm looked down when I said that. It's safe.

203
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 And so some of our greatest opportunities as believers to display our faith

204
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 and display who our God is, is conflict.

205
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 We may not face real persecution in this day and age.

206
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 We may not get the opportunity to show our faith in the midst of someone wanting to cut our head off

207
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 or putting us in prison.

208
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 But in the midst of conflict, you have an incredible opportunity to show who your God is.

209
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 And so all healthy relationships are marked by conflict.

210
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 That might blow your mind.

211
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 All healthy relationships are marked by conflict.

212
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 I hear all the time, "We have a great relationship. We never have conflict."

213
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 That's not a relationship.

214
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 That's not a real relationship.

215
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 One of two things. Either it's a very new relationship

216
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 or it's a very surface-level relationship.

217
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 But healthy relationships in this fallen world have conflict.

218
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 That's just a fact.

219
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 But unresolved conflict marks the lives of unhealthy people.

220
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 If you go around and there is unresolved conflict,

221
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 there are these explosions that have not been mended.

222
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 That marks the life of an unhealthy person.

223
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 So let me just say this to you, that hard conversations are not fun.

224
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 If you're here and you're a peace-maker, I know that hard conversations are not fun.

225
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 They are also not optional.

226
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 It's not something that you can choose not to do as a follower of Jesus.

227
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 It is an opportunity that you cannot pass up.

228
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 Ephesians 4, verse 3 says it like this,

229
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 "Make every effort," maybe yours says,

230
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 "be diligent at, work hard at, keeping the unity of the Spirit and the bond of peace."

231
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 This is what we do.

232
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 See, anger drives a wedge between us, but we work hard to close that chasm.

233
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 We work hard to close that gap between brothers and sisters or our peers.

234
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 Whenever you are angry, this is what I want you to think about of your anger.

235
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 Your anger is like a warning sign.

236
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 Your anger is telling you, it is a bright red flashing light telling you there is a conflict to resolve.

237
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 When you see that bright red flashing light, you can respond in a number of ways.

238
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 It's just like a warning light on your dashboard.

239
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 You're driving down the road, your temperature light goes off or something goes off,

240
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 telling you something, your check engine light, telling you something is wrong with the car.

241
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 You can respond to that in a number of ways.

242
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 One, you can ignore it.

243
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 Two, you can fix the wrong things.

244
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 You can go after the wrong things.

245
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 If you're in anger, you're like, "I'm going to show them or I want to win.

246
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 I want to show them how right I am or how wrong they are."

247
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 These are the wrong things.

248
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 You're responding out of the flesh.

249
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 Or you can respond in the Spirit and say, "I want to fix this.

250
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 I want to, dependent on God's Spirit, bring peace here.

251
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 I want to resolve this conflict."

252
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 What does it look like to respond in the Spirit?

253
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 It looks like being eager, by keeping short accounts,

254
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 like not letting the sun go down.

255
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 Why? Why would you be eager to resolve, to close that gap?

256
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 Because that's someone Jesus died for.

257
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 That's someone God made.

258
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 That's one of his, the Scriptures say, that's one of his masterpieces.

259
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 A child of God, whom you have a problem with.

260
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 God desires you to pursue peace.

261
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 Ephesians 4, verse 26 says, "In your anger, do not sin."

262
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 So as you're angry, anger is the warning sign.

263
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 In that anger, do not sin. Respond in the Spirit, not in the flesh.

264
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 And do not let the sun go down while you're still angry.

265
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 Be eager to close that gap.

266
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 Be eager to pursue reconciliation.

267
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 Matthew 5, now, back in the Scriptures, says it like this.

268
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 "Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar,

269
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 "and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you,

270
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 "leave your gift there in front of the altar.

271
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 "First go and be reconciled to them, then come and offer your gift."

272
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 What is going on here?

273
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 This is in the old time, if we were seeking, or in this day, the first century,

274
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 if we were seeking God's forgiveness, we might bring an offering to the altar,

275
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 saying, "God, would you forgive me? Here's a sin offering."

276
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 And God's saying, "Hey, I don't want your sin offering until you've asked their forgiveness."

277
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 You take that, you leave that there, but you run now.

278
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 It says, "Run and go and be reconciled to your brother."

279
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 If someone has something against you, you run.

280
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Do you know what this means?

281
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 This is what this means. Some of you shouldn't be here next Tuesday.

282
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 Next Tuesday, you need to be on a plane flying home,

283
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 saying, "Hey, man, I forgive you for buying that shark tooth necklace."

284
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Oh, that's just me.

285
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 Some of you have something, right? There's someone that has something against you.

286
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 And you know it. You're sitting here, and you're like, "Man, I know.

287
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 I know that I did that the wrong way. I know I should have never said that to them.

288
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 They don't know they're God that I worship.

289
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 They don't know that I'm a child of the creator of the heavens and the earth.

290
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 I need to go and sit in front of them and ask their forgiveness."

291
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 It's like, "Stop singing Shane and Shane songs.

292
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 Stop singing worship, and run and be reconciled to your brother.

293
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 Like, don't sing, 'Hey, God, I love you.' No, no, no. Run."

294
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 I said, "I'm so sorry.

295
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 I've been worshiping God in vain because I realize there's been an infraction here that I haven't mended,

296
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 and you have this against me."

297
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 And so this is the part to own.

298
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 My second point this evening is a part to own.

299
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 What is the part you need to own?

300
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 And it's simply this. It's your part.

301
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 You have to own your part.

302
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 Let me say this. If you are a part of the conflict, you have a part in the conflict.

303
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 And it's really hard to get your mind around, because you might be sitting there,

304
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 "No, you don't understand. They dated my ex.

305
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 They slept with them while I was dating.

306
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 They used my toothbrush without asking me.

307
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 They said something about me behind my back.

308
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 They ruined your name. I don't care if they walked up and they punched you in the face."

309
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 You determine, "Hey, what is my mind to own?"

310
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Maybe you sinned in your anger.

311
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 Maybe you had a conversation in the car.

312
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 "Oh, yeah, you want to do that? I can't wait."

313
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 Maybe you're just sitting there getting all worked up in the shower.

314
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 No one else is there, but you're just having this dialogue, going back and forth.

315
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 And you can start with that.

316
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 "Hey, you know what? You know what? Before we go any further, I just want you to know,

317
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 man, I've been having this conversation with you in my head.

318
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 I've called you some really ugly things. No one else heard me.

319
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 But up here, I've been saying some awful things about you, and I want to ask your forgiveness for that.

320
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 That does not display who is my God."

321
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 You start there.

322
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 "Hey, I want to start by owning my part in this conflict."

323
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 But the problem is anger blinds you.

324
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 When you are angry, you can't see your part.

325
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 You can only see their part.

326
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 You can only see their part.

327
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 And so what happens is you want to lash out.

328
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 But before you lash out, I want you to look inward.

329
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 When you see that bright red flashing signal,

330
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 instead of lashing out, you look inward and say, "Hey, what is my part in this?"

331
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 What is my part in this?

332
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 Because when you begin to escalate in your mind and in your heart,

333
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 you sinned already.

334
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 You're already in sin.

335
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 You already have something that you can own, and you can start right there.

336
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 Let me read to you from the Scriptures.

337
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 Luke 27, verse 3.

338
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 "Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye

339
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?

340
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 How can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,'

341
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 when all the time there is a plank of wood, a two-by-four,

342
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 sitting in your own eye, you hypocrite?

343
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 First take the plank out of your own eye,

344
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye."

345
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 See, anger, when you're angry, you can't see their fault.

346
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 You can't see your own fault.

347
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 You can only see their fault.

348
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 You can't see the two-by-four sticking out of your forehead.

349
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 You can only see the flake of sawdust in their eye.

350
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 And so you have something to own,

351
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 and the challenge here from the Scriptures is for you to find it.

352
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 Stop thinking about what they did and start thinking about what you did.

353
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 And so what does that look like for me in Schlitterbahn?

354
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 It looks like, "Hey, bro, man, I know I paid your way in,

355
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 and I want to ask your forgiveness because there were clearly strings attached to that ticket.

356
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 I had some expectations that I did not express to you that you did not meet.

357
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 My expectations upon you is that you would not have spent any money

358
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 because you told me you didn't have money for the ticket,

359
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 and that's an unfair expectation because I never told you that.

360
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 So much of your conflict is an unmet expectation.

361
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 So much of the conflict that you experience is some expectation that you put on someone else

362
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 that they did not meet for you.

363
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 And so you can start there, "Hey, I had an expectation of you that was not fair.

364
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 It was not fair in that I did not express it to you.

365
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 It was not clear that that was my expectation.

366
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 You never agreed to meet that expectation, and I'm sorry.

367
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 But not only am I sorry, will you forgive me?"

368
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 There's power in those three words, "Will"--four words--"will you forgive me?"

369
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 Okay? Learn those four words.

370
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 "Will you forgive me?"

371
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 Not, "I want to ask your forgiveness." Good, I'm glad you want to. Do it.

372
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 Not, "I'm sorry." You are sorry. Yes, you are.

373
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 "Will you forgive me?

374
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Will you please forgive me?" Five words now.

375
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 It's funny, when you're a student in high school,

376
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 those relationships, they just seem different. There's a different depth there.

377
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 But man, I was a believer. I was on staff at a church.

378
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 Teaching the Word of God, my best buddy was also on staff at a church, senior pastor.

379
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 He discipled me. We sat down. We went through systematic theology together.

380
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 We met once a week. We traveled together. We vacationed together.

381
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 A really, really, really dear friend of mine I had placed on a pedestal in my life

382
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 as someone who had discipled me and shepherded me, someone who I really looked up to.

383
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 And in the midst of that, he began to make some decisions,

384
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 specifically financial decisions that I began to question.

385
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 And at one particular phone call--this is my best friend--

386
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 as I'm questioning these decisions as an adult, as grown men,

387
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 I began to call him things.

388
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 And so I believe to this day that questioning those decisions was the right thing.

389
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 Now, he wasn't doing anything--he wasn't stealing money.

390
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 I just didn't think he was spending it wisely as a pastor.

391
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 I didn't think he was above reproach in what he was doing.

392
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 And so what I told him in a moment of explosive anger is I said,

393
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 "It's like you're a prosperity preacher."

394
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 Those words came out of my mouth.

395
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 To which the phone call ended, to which I did not talk to him again for years.

396
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 And I pursued him, and I texted him, and I wrote him letters,

397
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 and I called him, and I left him voicemails, and I begged his forgiveness on voicemails.

398
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 I told him I was sorry. I said it was a moment of anger.

399
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 But again, this explosion had cost me a relationship now

400
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 that as an adult hurt very badly.

401
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 Very badly. And I began to resent him.

402
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 How could he write us off that fast?

403
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 Like, clearly, I was delusioned in what I thought the friendship we had was.

404
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 That he could just end it like that.

405
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 Like, are you serious? Like, you're just going to go your separate ways?

406
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 You're going to throw me that in the Bible? Where is that in--

407
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 "Be diligent in preserving the unity of the Spirit in the body of Christ."

408
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 Haven't you taught that? Haven't you stood up here and preached that message?

409
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 Where is that in Matthew 18, Matthew 5, Matthew 7?

410
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 And that's what was going on in my heart.

411
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 And what did that do? It just drove the wedge bigger.

412
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 Bigger and bigger.

413
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 I continued to call, I continued to text, I continued to write.

414
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 To which one text he responded and said, "I will meet."

415
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 God brought him back to Dallas. We met.

416
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Sat there.

417
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 And the first thing I said, I said, "Bro, thank you for meeting me.

418
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 "Will you please forgive me?

419
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 "When I said that, I said exactly this, I know what I said.

420
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 "I should not have said that.

421
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 "I spoke from a place of anger.

422
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 "And will you please forgive me?"

423
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 To which he said, "Well, I didn't expect that."

424
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 Which was odd to me because I had said that so many times via text, via email, via phone.

425
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 And I said again, "Will you please forgive me?"

426
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 To which he said, "Yes, I forgive you."

427
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 And then he said, "I think you're waiting for me to ask your forgiveness."

428
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 I said, "You know what, bro? I forgive you.

429
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 "I no longer hold any debt that you've caused in my life against you."

430
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 And he said, "I'm not ready to ask that yet."

431
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 I said, "You don't need to."

432
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 And so many would say, "Hey, that wasn't peace. That didn't look like peace."

433
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 You know what, I got in the car and I had peace, man.

434
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 Because as long as it was up to me, I lived at peace with my brother.

435
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 And that's it. You focus on your part. On your part.

436
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 And by the Spirit of God, we'll give you strength to move on, to step forward.

437
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 You focus on what you can do.

438
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 It doesn't always go well, but as long as it is up to you,

439
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 the Scripture says, you live at peace with your brother.

440
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 Being diligent at preserving the unity of the Spirit and the bond of peace.

441
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 Making every effort to do so.

442
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 It says in verse 25,

443
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 "Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court.

444
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 "Do it while you are still together on the way."

445
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 This is Matthew chapter 5, verse 25.

446
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 "Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court.

447
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 "Do it while you are still on the way to court."

448
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 As you're still on the way, and it goes on to say,

449
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 "Or else there will be greater consequences. The consequences will grow.

450
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 "The consequences will escalate. Settle matters quickly."

451
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 Now what's interesting is when people are on their way to court,

452
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 they're not thinking about settling matters, they're thinking about winning.

453
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 That's whenever somebody goes to court, they're thinking about,

454
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 "Hey, I want to win. I want to show them. I want to get the best of them."

455
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 And the Scripture says, "No, you are not concerned with winning

456
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 "because when you're concerned with winning in conflict, you lose."

457
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 Let me say that again.

458
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 When you are concerned with winning in conflict, you've already lost.

459
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 Okay? This is the mark, this is a mark of a mature believer.

460
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 You are not concerned with winning, you are concerned with peace, which is different.

461
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 You are not concerned with being right because then you're already wrong.

462
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 You're concerned with pursuing and preserving peace

463
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 on the way to the matter, being eager, being diligent.

464
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 Here's what I want to show you, that conflict is a crossroad.

465
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 When you are in conflict with someone, you are at a "why."

466
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 There is two directions you can go.

467
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 You can move towards a broken relationship, you can cause a fraction which grows over time.

468
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 It just gets weirder and more awkward.

469
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 You can pretend like it's not there, but it is.

470
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 Or you can take the path of peace.

471
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 The path that is worthy to pursue, the path of peace.

472
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 That's my third point this evening, a path to pursue.

473
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 The path to pursue is peace.

474
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 I'm going to walk you through a very practical verse.

475
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 I want you to turn to Matthew 18 in your Bibles.

476
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 I want you to underline this, I want you to circle it.

477
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 This is something you want to know and live by.

478
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 It is a process we call the Matthew 18 process or Matthew 18 principle.

479
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 Here it is, verse 15.

480
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 "If your brother or sister sins against you, go and point out their fault, just between the two of you.

481
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 If they listen, you have won them over.

482
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 But if they will not listen, step two, take one or two brothers along,

483
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.

484
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 If they still refuse to listen, step three, tell it to the church.

485
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 And if they refuse to listen to even the church, step four,

486
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector."

487
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 It starts out, step one, let's go now slowly through this.

488
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 I'm going to camp on step one for just a minute,

489
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 because most conflicts are resolved right here at step one.

490
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 If your brother sins against you or your sister sins against you,

491
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 if you feel anger towards someone, you go to that someone.

492
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 Without talking to anyone else, you go directly to them and say,

493
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 "I am here to resolve this conflict."

494
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 Should you pursue every conflict? Is everything wrong?

495
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 If they put a door ding in your car or accidentally stepped on your toe,

496
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 do you pursue every conflict that way? No, you don't.

497
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 The scriptures say that it is a person's wisdom yields patience.

498
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 It is one's glory to overlook an offense.

499
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 So if you can overlook an offense, you should.

500
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 How do I know if I can overlook offense? Because you can.

501
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 If you can move on and not think about it, not have the conversation in your head,

502
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 then you can overlook it.

503
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 Let me tell you like this.

504
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 When I eat something bad, it begins to gurgle in my stomach.

505
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 I know, usually, I know if that's going to go away and I'm going to be okay

506
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 or if that's coming back up.

507
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 Like if it just doesn't sit right, like I eat something, it just doesn't sit right,

508
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 and I'm sitting there and I'm like, "Man, this thing just doesn't sit right."

509
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 I usually know, "Man, I'm going to be all right," or, "No, no, no.

510
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 This is coming back up."

511
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 And conflict is the same way.

512
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 You sit there and you're like, "Oh, yeah. You know what?

513
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 I think I can overlook that," or, "You know what?

514
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 I'm going to have conversations in my head.

515
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 I'm going to get in the car. I'm going to get spun up.

516
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 I think this is going to come back up in my life.

517
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 I think I'm going to continue to think about this."

518
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 And so just be eager then.

519
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 Before the sun sets, run and be reconciled to brother.

520
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 Leave your gift there. Run to them.

521
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 "Hey, when you did this, it hurt me.

522
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 Can I just tell you something?

523
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 When you said that it hurt me, I heard this and it hurt me."

524
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 And I want to give you the opportunity to bring clarity to it.

525
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 Maybe what I heard wasn't true.

526
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 I want to give you the benefit of the doubt.

527
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 Can we talk about this because I heard it and it hurt me.

528
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 And so should you talk to someone else?

529
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 Sometimes it looks like, "Hey, Shane, let me talk to you for a second.

530
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 David, the other day did this, and I just don't know.

531
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 Should I go back and tell him about that?

532
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 I just don't know if I should or if I shouldn't."

533
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 And I just was thinking because I couldn't believe he said that.

534
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 "Okay, is it okay? I just want to vet this with you.

535
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 I just want to talk to you. I just want some wise counsel.

536
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 Hey, will you just pray for me and David because David did this really stupid thing the other day.

537
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 Will you just pray about it? Is that okay?"

538
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 No, no, no, no, no, no.

539
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 What you just did is you just invited someone else in.

540
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 So if somebody comes to you and says, "Hey, can I just talk to you for a second?

541
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 Man, stupid over there did something stupid," because that's what stupid does, right?

542
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 "And would you just pray for stupid?"

543
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 And I'm not talking about David now, David. We're not stupid.

544
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 "But would you just pray for stupid because I just can't believe it?"

545
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 And you know what? You just say, "Oh, you know what, man?

546
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 Hey, you need to go talk to stupid

547
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 because what you just did is you just painted my picture of them.

548
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 You just influenced my perception of them.

549
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 And man, I didn't ask for that.

550
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 You need to go talk to him, and by the way, if you don't, I will."

551
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 So we--oh, no, no, I'll talk to him. When?

552
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 Man, just when I see him, I'll talk to him. No, no, how about this?

553
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 Because you came to me with eagerness, how about you go to them with eagerness?

554
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 How about I say 24 hours? How about I call them tomorrow,

555
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 and I'm going to ask them if you've talked to them?

556
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 And if you haven't, then I'm going to tell them. I'm going to say, "Hey, this is what you said.

557
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 It's just so I'm clean."

558
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 You know what that does?

559
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 It makes this a really unsafe place for gossip.

560
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 Can I just tell you something?

561
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 This is a really unsafe place for gossip

562
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 because now you've all been trained to do that.

563
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 Somebody comes to you, "Hey, man, you wouldn't believe what stupid did."

564
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 Oh, man, I don't want to believe it, and let's just go talk to stupid right now.

565
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 Okay?

566
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 And could you imagine if the church was a really unsafe place for gossip?

567
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 Hey, you need to help make the church a really unsafe place for gossip.

568
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 Hey, you have 24 hours.

569
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 You go, and you be eager before the sun sets, it says.

570
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 Before the sun goes down, you go, and you tell them.

571
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 And so if they refuse, now, step two,

572
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 if they listen to you, awesome, praise God, right?

573
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 You're there. You're trying to seek to understand.

574
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 You don't know everything. You don't know everything that went on,

575
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 so you go there all by yourself.

576
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 Hey, you run to them, "Hey, when you did this, it hurt me. I want to give you the benefit of the doubt."

577
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 I want to seek to understand why you did that.

578
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 I want to understand why you did that.

579
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 That's step one, okay?

580
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 And if they listen to you, you've won them over, praise God.

581
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 If they don't, then you go, and you invite somebody back in.

582
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 And so when you go to step one, you've now stepped in the ring,

583
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 not to fight, but to work out the conflict.

584
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 So this ring right now represents the area of which we're going to resolve the conflict.

585
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 Now, what I don't do is I don't carry the conflict outside the ring.

586
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 I don't go and circle up people, okay?

587
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 I don't conspire against you.

588
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 No, if we're going to fight, quote unquote, we're going to fight in the ring.

589
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 And so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to go and grab somebody else,

590
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 and I'm going to bring them in the ring with you.

591
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 And if there's other people, the only people who are going to be in the ring

592
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 is people who are part of the problem or a part of the solution.

593
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 Nobody else. I don't need to vet. I don't need to get wise counsel.

594
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 I don't need to think about it. I don't need to have prayer requests, okay?

595
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 I'm going to bring anybody who I think is a part of the solution into this room,

596
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 and we're going to work through it.

597
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 So now I'm leaving. Hey, you didn't listen.

598
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 So I'm leaving, and I'm going to go find some others.

599
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 Hey, listen, so-and-so and I are in a conflict.

600
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 Would you please come with me as I go back to them?

601
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 I'm now at stage two of Matthew 18 principle.

602
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 Would you please go with me and just kind of mediate and observe?

603
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 And if there's anything in me that I'm missing, would you show me that?

604
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 Hey, would you come?

605
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 Now you bring one or two people with you back into the circle,

606
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 and you tell them, "Hey, I want to tell you again.

607
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 When you purchased that necklace, it hurt me.

608
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 Here's why. Here's my part in it.

609
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 I'm eager to come to you.

610
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 I want to keep short accounts. I want to overlook a small offense,

611
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 but this I've just been sitting on. It hasn't sit well with me.

612
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 I want to tell you again."

613
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 And now somebody's watching.

614
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 And if they say, "Hey, man, get out of here. I don't want to work it out."

615
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 Now, you leave, and you get to church.

616
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 Someone in a position of authority in the church, you say,

617
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 "Hey, would you guys come with me and mediate this conversation?

618
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 I'm now at step three of Matthew 18 principle, and I need to tell them now."

619
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 And this is why we talked about last week, it's so important to be under the authority of the church.

620
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 So now your brother or sister who has sinned against you,

621
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 you bring the church into that conversation.

622
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 You step into the place where you're going to resolve the conflict with the church,

623
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 and you say, "Hey, I want to present this to you again. You have hurt me."

624
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 And I mean you do this every time.

625
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 And you've got to be sitting out there like, "Does this really happen?"

626
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 Eighty percent of what our staff does is that.

627
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 So you want to know, you know, if you're tithing to church,

628
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 if it's going to good resources as it pays our salaries,

629
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 80% of what we do as a staff is resolve conflict.

630
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 Is that time well spent? You better believe it is.

631
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 Because the scripture says, "Work hard at preserving unity of the spirit and the bond of peace."

632
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 And so 80% of what we do as a staff is resolve conflict,

633
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 which means 100% of what we do as a staff is make disciples.

634
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 Because we're showing you how to yield to the spirit.

635
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 When you are angry as a follower of Jesus Christ, you have a greater force within you.

636
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 That is God. God is going with you.

637
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 And God will help you not to give in to that anger or display that anger,

638
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 but to bring that anger under His control so that He can do something righteous.

639
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 This, if you apply it to your life, it will save your relationships.

640
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 It will change your life. It will save your marriage.

641
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 It will change the way you parent and everything moving forward.

642
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 It's simple, and you do this every time.

643
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 Every time it's necessary.

644
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 And so then, step four.

645
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 If they refuse to listen to the church now, you treat them as you would a pagan,

646
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 which is just a word for a non-believer, someone who is not a Christian.

647
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 You treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector.

648
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 Now, some of you are like, "Oh yeah, now here we go.

649
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 Like a pagan." No, no, no, no.

650
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 How do we treat pagans?

651
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 We love them. How did Jesus treat pagans and tax collectors?

652
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 He loved them. We treat them wisely.

653
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 We understand that they are not controlled by the same spirit that we are,

654
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 and so we may not partner with them in business.

655
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 We may not be in a position where we let them hurt us again,

656
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 so we treat them wisely.

657
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 And then thirdly, and most importantly, we share the gospel with them.

658
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 We assume they do not know our God, and so we tell them,

659
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 "Hey, do you know the God who has resolved all conflict?

660
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 Do you know how God resolved conflict?

661
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 Did He hold what you did against Him? Have you done anything against God?"

662
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 Let me ask again, because I-- "Have you done anything against God?"

663
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 Oh my goodness. Nod your head up and down.

664
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 Have you done anything against God?

665
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 Friends, you have done a lot against God.

666
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 If you don't think so, then you've got self-righteousness against God, okay?

667
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
 You've got grave sins against God. Do you know how He handled those?

668
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 He said, "I'll pay for them. I no longer hold your sins against you.

669
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 This is how I resolve conflict.

670
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 My Son dies and washes away all of your sins.

671
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 I show you that I can defeat death so that you can be with me forever.

672
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 I will do anything. I will go to great lengths to close the chasm of conflict between us,

673
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 including sending my only Son to die for your sins

674
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 so that you can be with me forever. This is the gospel.

675
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 And that is what you represent as you move towards somebody who has hurt you.

676
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 Hey, I'm not going to let you keep hurting me, okay?

677
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 But I want you to know my God. Can I tell you what He's done for you?"

678
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 And at step four, you share the gospel.

679
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 Peace is so powerful, man.

680
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 Can you imagine being able to move and insert peace into any situation?

681
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 It's so counterintuitive to respond towards peace when you're angry.

682
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 But the fruit of the Spirit is peace. It's what the Spirit produces inside of us.

683
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 And so in summary, a new perspective is to see conflict as an opportunity.

684
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 This starts with you owning your part, being eager, owning your part, and overlooking small offenses.

685
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 And thirdly, the path that you pursue is outlined here in Matthew 18.

686
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 So follow it, tell it, preach it, live according to it.

687
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 In this, man, I've seen wives sit before a woman who slept with their husband and forgive them.

688
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 Yielded to the Spirit. I've seen husbands talk to wives who cheated on them and forgive them, and vice versa.

689
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 I've seen crazy situations. I've seen those who were abused sexually sit in front of their abuser and say,

690
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 "I forgive you by the power of God that lives in me. I am no longer at conflict with you.

691
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 I will no longer carry this burden, this weight with me throughout my life.

692
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 This dark cloud will no longer exist over me. I forgive you."

693
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
 But I will tell you that some of the most amazing conflict resolutions I've seen

694
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 are simply roommates that just got into it and hated each other.

695
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 I'm talking just young adults or friends that just got sideways and one just exploded in anger

696
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,000
 and caused a deep hurt, which caused them to cause another deep hurt, deep hurt, deep hurt, back and forth.

697
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 And now there's just this huge chasm, and they come together, and one person yielded to the Spirit of God

698
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 who responds bigger and says, "I no longer want to hurt you.

699
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 In the same way that God forgave my hurts in Christ, I want to forgive you.

700
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 This is what I believe my part is in this.

701
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:38,000
 Will you please forgive me first and foremost before we go any further for my part in this?"

702
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 And I have seen God do incredible things when people respond to conflict in how they were trained.

703
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
 I want you to watch a video. We'll end with this.

704
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,000
 It's a video a friend showed me this week of an explosion that was caused by someone else.

705
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 And I want you to see how someone responded.

706
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 And so watch closely. Watch their first response and then their second response.

707
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 And I want you to listen to what is said about them, if you would. Watch this.

708
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 I want you to hear that.

709
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 I want you to hear that.

710
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
 He started out at first, he responded as a victim.

711
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
 He ran from the explosion.

712
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
 He didn't want anything to do with the explosion.

713
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
 When you experience the explosion of conflict, you feel like a victim.

714
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,000
 Man, something has been done to me. I've been hurt. I'm a victim.

715
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
 But then it says, "His training kicked in."

716
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
 And so then, after you realize, "Hey, I'm not a victim.

717
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
 Man, I am a child of God. I'm a peacemaker.

718
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
 I'm blessed by God who I'm going to be with forever

719
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
 because of his purchasing me through the blood of Jesus Christ.

720
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,000
 I now, him with me, we have the power to go and bring peace to this situation."

721
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
 Your training kicks in and you run back to that situation.

722
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
 And you say, "You know what? I want to bring resolve to this explosion.

723
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 I want to save you and save me and save our relationship from this explosion."

724
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
 Let me ask you a question. Anybody watch that and think, "Man, what an idiot.

725
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
 Some drunk guy hit the thing."

726
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
 Anybody think he was drunk? I'll confess to you.

727
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
 I watched that the first time. I'm like, "Dude, he must have been a drunk guy."

728
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 And then you find out it's a 70-year-old man in diabetic shock, and you feel stupid.

729
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 And it's just like conflict. We assume we know everything.

730
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
 "Oh, I assume I know why that explosion caused it."

731
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,000
 And then you go there and you're like, "Oh, man. Oh, you thought I said that?

732
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:48,000
 Oh, my goodness. I'm so sorry. Will you please forgive me?

733
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 That is not what I meant. That's not what I meant to say.

734
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
 That's not how I meant to represent myself. This is what I meant."

735
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
 We think we know everything. We think we're so smart.

736
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,000
 Hey, God wants you to work hard at pursuing peace.

737
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
 Can I tell you something?

738
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
 As we sing this song, and the Shanes and the band are going to come up,

739
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,000
 there are people in your life that you need to forgive.

740
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,000
 And as we worship together, you need to know who those people are.

741
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
 And then some of you, man, some of you, you need to leave quietly during this song,

742
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
 and you need to go and pursue peace.

743
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:30,000
 As someone has something against you, you need to run to them before the sun sets.

744
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
 And you need to go and beg their forgiveness.

745
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
 You know that they have a grievance against you.

746
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 You might need to purchase a plane ticket.

747
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
 You might need to go get a bus fare or something,

748
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 but you need to go and be reconciled to your brother.

749
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
 My prayer for the rest of us, and really all of us,

750
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
 is that we would live according to these principles.

751
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
 That peace would mark our life.

752
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
 You would no longer take pride in being bad or angry.

753
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
 You would now be controlled by the Spirit of God.

754
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
 Because if you are given to anger, it is a mark that the Spirit may not be--

755
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
 it is a mark that the Spirit's not in you.

756
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 I'll just say it like that. It's like Jesus says it.

757
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
 Okay?

758
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
 It's something worthy of thinking about.

759
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
 Let me pray.

760
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,000
 Father, we love you, and just thank you that you love us enough to tell us these truths.

761
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
 Tell us how we can be with you forever,

762
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
 through your grace, your pursuit of us.

763
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
 As we have a conflict against you,

764
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
 you ran after us and you chased us because you love us.

765
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,000
 That's why I pray my friends would know right now how they are loved by you.

766
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
 And Lord, some of us, we're scared to death,

767
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,000
 because we feel right now that there's someone we're supposed to pursue reconciliation with,

768
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
 and we're supposed to mend this relationship,

769
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
 and we're like, "How can we do that?"

770
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
 Would you remind them that you will go with them?

771
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
 That you're going to go with them into that explosion.

772
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
 That you're going to protect them from that explosion.

773
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,000
 You're going to give them the words to say in the midst of that explosion.

774
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
 Father, thank you that you are always with us.

775
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,000
 You say that you will never leave us, and you will not forsake us.

776
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
 Father, thank you that you have closed the chasm between you and us.

777
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
 In Jesus' name.

778
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
 I think for a lot of us this evening, the only thing that you need to hear,

779
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
 or I'll say the biggest thing you need to hear,

780
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
 is that God has closed the gap between you and him.

781
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
 He's closed the chasm.

782
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
 And he did that with the death and the resurrection of his son.

783
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
 You've got to be here asking, "Why did Jesus have to die?"

784
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
 Maybe you're wrestling with who God is.

785
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
 Start with Jesus.

786
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
 2014 years ago, something happened to reset time.

787
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
 It started over.

788
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
 Why did he have to die?

789
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:45,000
 He had to die so that you and God could be in relationship again.

790
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
 Because your sin was between you and God.

791
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
 And that sin went on Jesus.

792
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
 Jesus died.

793
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
 He paid the penalty.

794
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
 He paid the consequence.

795
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
 He paid the price for that sin.

796
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
 So that you can be God's again.

797
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
 So that you can be his child.

798
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
 So that you can be with him forever.

799
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
 You're not going to be with him forever because you're good.

800
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
 You're not going to be with him forever because you read the Bible or you prayed a lot.

801
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
 Or you were in a small group or a member of a church.

802
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:14,000
 You're going to be with him forever because Jesus Christ died for you and raised from the dead.

803
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
 You need to know that.

804
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
 If you don't know that, we'd love to wrestle with that truth with you.

805
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
 Or if you have questions about that, we'd love to talk to you.

806
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
 Every single week, praise God, someone has questions about that.

807
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,000
 And it is our greatest joy and honor to talk with you about those questions.

808
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
 So please come up here.

809
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
 We'd love to do that.

810
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
 Okay.

811
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:43,000
