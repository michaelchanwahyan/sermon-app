[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   [Music]
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   >> Porsch, how we doing?
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   We doing okay?
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Hey, it's so good to see you.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   As always, welcome.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Thanks for entrusting us with your evening.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   We're glad that you would be in this room.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Real quick, we want to do a special shout out to some friends we have in the room.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Some friends that may have gone to launch retreat with us.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   Did you go to launch?
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   If you're at launch, let me hear from you.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   Man, how great was launch?
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   It was awesome, right?
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   It was amazing.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   If you weren't there, it was an amazing weekend.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   But listen, you're not missing out because we brought a little bit of that launch love home to share with you.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   We're really excited for where God is taking us this evening.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   I also want to just recognize a few Porsch Live locations that are tuning in with us from all over the nation.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Special shout out to Porsch Live Fort Worth, Porsch Live Midland, and Porsch Live Scottsdale.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Would you all say hello, Porsch Live, with me, please?
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Hey, we have got a very special guest in the room with us this evening.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   He's a minister up at Harris Creek.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   He's a co-host of the Becoming Something podcast.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   And he's a dear friend of ours.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   I'm really excited to welcome Mr. Nate Hilgenkamp back to the stage.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Would you all help me with that right now?
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Love you, bro.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   So good to be here.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Well, I am originally from Minneapolis, Minnesota.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Wow, let's go.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   We've got Christians from Minnesota.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   It's a miracle.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   And a few weeks back I went to visit my parents with my wife and my two daughters.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   I've got two girls, a 3-year-old and an 11-month-old.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   And we were there.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   We woke up one morning.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   We had a few hours until we needed to be at the next place where we were going.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   And whenever you have two young kids, you learn that playgrounds are the best place to waste time.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   So we started thinking, hey, where can we go?
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   And we realized that my elementary school was, like, within walking distance.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   And I was like, hey, let's just get in the stroller and let's take them to the playground.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Now, thankfully, I hadn't been there in about 20 years.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   So I show up at this playground.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   And I'm just, like, hit with so much of what I remember 20 years ago.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   But then I look at another part of the playground, and it's totally different.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Like this playground is just cut in half.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   And half of it is what I grew up with.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   And the other half is completely brand new.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   And they looked so different.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   In fact, let me show you a picture that I took of the playground that I grew up playing on.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Here's what it looks like.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   And I had to, like, do some Photoshop up there because there was another kid in it.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   So, anyway, be impressed.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   So I just remember looking at this thing going, I cannot believe this is what I played on.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Like, looking at it, I can just remember my fingers getting stuck in those wheels over and over again.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Like, I cannot believe I still have 10 of them.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   You can't even really see it, but as you go down the slide, there's just this, like, chain hanging there.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Like, it's a perfect place for you to just choke on right before you go down the slide.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Elsewhere, like, there's not bars in the right places.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Like, it is a playground if you're trying to build it in a way in which kids are going to get hurt.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   But back then in the '90s, they're like, whatever.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Getting hurt is good for them.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   And looking over at the other half of the playground, and I didn't take a picture of it because I just felt creepy taking pictures of a playground with kids around.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   So you're just going to have to take my word for it.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   It looked very different in that it looked incredibly safe.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   It's like they had thought through all the what ifs.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Like, what if the kid falls that way?
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   What if the kid falls this way?
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Like, what if he can't do this?
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   What if she can't do that?
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   It's like they had thought through everything so that whenever a kid would enter that playground, you would know that they're not getting hurt.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Which as a parent, I really appreciate that.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Because I don't want my kids getting hurt.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   But as I looked at these two different playgrounds, I just think it was a picture for where we've been over these last 25 or so years.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Because as culture has grown over these past 25 years, we've grown in our desire for safety.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Which is great when it comes to building a playground.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   It's not great when it comes to building a life.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   And here's what I've realized doing young adult ministry.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   I've got to be with young adults for a while now.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Here's what I've realized.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   You guys are really anxious about this time of your life.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Because this time in your life is so important.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   This time of your life launches you, if you will, into the next season of your life.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   So you want to make sure that everything in your life goes according to plan in this season.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   You want to make sure that your life feels safe now.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   But because of that, you're just paralyzed by what ifs.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Like I've heard what ifs like, "What if I never get married?"
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Or, "What if I get married, but I get married to the wrong person?"
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Or, "What if I really want to move to a different city, but I never have the guts to move to a different city?"
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Or, "What if I do move to a different city, and I move there and it's the wrong decision?"
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Or, "What if I take a different job and it is the wrong job?"
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Or, "What if I stay in this job and hate this job?"
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Or, "What if" - this is what I just heard a couple weeks ago -
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   "What if my friends invite me to hang out a few weeks in a row, and I say no to them because I've got stuff going on?"
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   And then, "What if they just stop asking me to hang out?"
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   And I'm like, "You guys! You're exhausting!"
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Because you're crippled by all these what ifs, because you're trying to make sure that your life is exactly how you want it.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   You're trying to make sure that your life is safe.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Here's what I want you to know. Safety is a facade.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Like, the only thing you can plan for in life is that sometimes you're going to get hurt.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Sometimes life is going to feel unsteady.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   So tonight, rather than putting forth an effort to make sure you have a safe life,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   I want to propose a better option as putting forth an effort to have a courageously faithful life.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Your goal is not a safe life, but a courageously faithful life.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   And sometimes it won't feel safe.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Sometimes it will feel like you're climbing the monkey bars, and you're looking down going,
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   "If I fall, it's going to really hurt."
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   But getting up and climbing is better than not climbing at all,
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   because we're not after safe, we're after courageous faithfulness.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   So tonight, how do we move away from a life of safe and into a life of courageous faithfulness?
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   We're going to look at a random part of Scripture. I mean, random, random.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Like, I'm going to mention this guy's name, and I bet, I bet, probably none of you have even really heard of him before.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   I've never heard a message preached on this.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   I've never really noticed him in Scripture before until a few weeks ago when I was reading the book of 2 Samuel,
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   and something about his life just gripped me.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Because we're going to look at about a guy named Ahimaz. Ahimaz.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Can you say his name with me? One, two, three. Ahimaz.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Yeah, and we see him in 2 Samuel 15 and 18.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   So if you have a Bible, open up to 2 Samuel 15, and then we're going to jump over to 18 in just a minute.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   And to give you some set up on where we're at in Scripture,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   at this point in Israel's history, there have been two kings.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   Israel originally had no king, but they said, "God, we want to be like the rest of the people around us, so give us a king."
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   So God selected a man named Saul, and he was anointed as king over Israel.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   But as he became king, and as he was king, his heart drifted from God,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   so God anointed another man by the name of David.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   And Saul became jealous of David. He began to fight David, to try to kill David.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   And eventually there's this moment in Scripture where Saul's armies are fighting against David's armies,
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   and David's armies win. Saul is defeated, and then David becomes the king over Israel.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Now, he rules largely with wisdom. He largely does a great job leading God's people.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   But then he gets old, and he has a son named Absalom.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   And Absalom was an evil son, and he started to think, "You know, I think I could do a better job ruling these people than my father is."
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   So he starts to slowly but slyly convince the people of Israel that he would be a better king than his father.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   He would go around telling people, "Hey, he's gotten old. We need someone who's strong. We need someone who's courageous.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   We need to move forward, and he's just taking us backwards, so you need to start following me."
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   And one by one, it says that the hearts of the people turn from David to Absalom.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   And then in a moment, there's a coup, where David and his army are driven out of Jerusalem,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   and Absalom and his army begin to take over.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   They come into the city and begin to act like they're truly in charge.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Now, as David and his army are running away from the city, he actually taps on a few people, a few of his followers, and tells them to stay.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   He says, "I need you here. I need you to stay in Jerusalem underneath this false king to spy on them.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   I need you to tell me everything that's going on so that I can come back."
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   And he has convinced a few people to stay, and we're going to pick up and read in 2 Samuel 15, verse 35,
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   when he's specifically speaking to a man named Hushai, and he's trying to convince him to stay.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   He's already convinced two other people, Zadok and Abiathar, and he says this, 2 Samuel 15, verse 35.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   "Won't the priests Zadok and Abiathar be there with you?
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Tell them anything you hear in the king's palace, and their two sons, Ahamaz," that's our guy, "son of Zadok and Jonathan, son of Abiathar, are there with them.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   Send them to me with anything you hear."
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   So Hushai, David's confidant, arrived at Jerusalem as Absalom was entering the city.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   Okay, what can we learn about Ahamaz from this text?
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Well, first, he lived in a land that has been overthrown by an enemy.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   The true king has been driven out.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   The good king has been exiled, and this false and evil king just rolls into town and starts to take over.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   Now think about how terrifying that would be if you were one of David's followers.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   The best description I can think of is, imagine you're in Europe in the 1940s, and you just see Hitler and his Nazi regime overtake your city.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   Meanwhile, you're going, "This isn't their land. He is not the king, and yet he does have the power.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   He's not supposed to be here," and it would be terrifying.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   And this is what is going on in Jerusalem in this time.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   For David's followers, he's going, "You're not supposed to be here.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   The good king should be in charge, but evil has come into the city and is now in charge."
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   And in the midst of this, it would be tremendous terror.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Ahamaz would be absolutely terrified about what was going on.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   He would want to run from the city because evil was now in charge.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   But in the middle of that, he gets a message.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   He gets a message from the true king, and David says, "Hey, Ahamaz, I need you to stay.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   I know you want to run, but don't go anywhere because I've got a job for you.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   I need you to stay here. I need you to spy on this false king.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   I need you to learn everything about this false regime, and then I need you to run as fast as you can to where I am.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   And I need you to tell me everything that you've learned, and I need you to go back, learn all you can, and do it over again.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   And I need you to do that because although it looks like there is a man who has taken my power and my position, he won't have it long.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   Although it looks like the true king is dead, the true king is just planning his comeback.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Now, here's why I've grown to love this passage.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   That right there is where we are because we find ourselves in a very similar position in our world today.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   It can seem like the true king has been overthrown.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   It can seem like evil is winning, but this is actually how the New Testament describes the world that we live in today.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   Take a look at 2 Corinthians 4.4.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   Satan, who is the god of this world, little g, god of this world, has blinded the minds of those who don't believe.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   They are unable to see the glorious light of the good news.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   They don't understand this message about the glory of Christ, who is the exact likeness of God.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   Now, Satan here is called the god of this world.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   That doesn't mean he's the king over this world, but he does have tremendous power in this world.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   Why? Because just like Absalom, he has slyly deceived the majority of people in this world.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   He's convinced them to follow a false king.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   And if he's the god of this world, that means he has tremendous influence on the ideals, opinions, goals, hopes, and views of the majority of people.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   And if that's the case, evil will feel like it's winning.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   But in the midst of that, here's what you've got to know as a follower of Jesus.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   Jesus has tapped you on the shoulder and said, "Although sometimes it's uncomfortable living here, I need you to stay.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   I need you to be here.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   You can't run because I've got a mission for you.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   I need you to learn all you possibly can about this world, and I need you to go to me, and we're going to talk about it,
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   and I'm going to send you back with a new mission because here's what you need to know.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   Although it seems like someone has taken my position and power, he won't have it for long.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   Because while it may seem like the true king is dead, he's just planning his comeback.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   And this is where we are if we're following Jesus today.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   So if you want to live a life of courageous faithfulness, you have to start with this.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   This is true of Ahamas. This is true of us.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   Number one, the king has given us a job within enemy territory.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   This has a couple of implications on your life.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   The first is this.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   Imagine how the purpose of Ahamas' life has just shifted.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   Now, evil has come in to reign over his city, and his response, along with everyone else who followed the true king, was to run.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   He was going to have to abandon all he ever knew and run away from it.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   But the king says, "Hey, I need you to be a spy on my behalf."
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   It just changes everything for him.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   It means when he goes to the market, he's on mission.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   That means when he goes to his job, he's on mission.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   That means when he's talking with his neighbors, he's on mission,
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   because the king has given him a job to do within enemy territory.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   He's learning all he can about this land so he can participate in the overthrow of this land.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   Now, the same is true for you.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   When you've been tapped on the king to work for him, like when you heard him say, "Follow me," the purpose of your life shifts.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   Like, you're not just at work to get money.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   You are there as a spy and an overthrower.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   You are not just randomly in the city of Dallas.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   You are here to overthrow this city.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   You are not just randomly placed with roommates.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   You are there as an ambassador of the king, as a person of light in the midst of darkness.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   Your purpose has changed because you've been given a job by the king.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   Secondly, I just want you to imagine what it would be like for Ahamas to carry a message to the king.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   Like, he and those other few people who stayed in Jerusalem would gather intelligence,
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   and then he, under the cover of night, would run as fast as he possibly can to where King David would be.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   Imagine what it would feel like to be in the king's presence.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   After spending all day in enemy territory, after spending all day on guard,
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   finally you're with the king and it would be like, "Oh my goodness, what a relief. I'm where I want to be."
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   Is that what it's like for you when you're with your king?
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   Because this is how it should feel like for us.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   We should be eager to run into his presence.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   We should, throughout our day, make space to sit with him because
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   in the presence of the king is the only place in which we're truly safe.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   All throughout our day, we're in the midst of enemy territory.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   We've got an enemy who's prowling around us like a roaring lion, trying to take you out.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   And then you get to be with the king and it's like, "Oh, I'm safe."
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   Now, I know we've learned to call these times quiet times.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   You know, spend a quiet time. Like, go sit in time out. Just go be quiet.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   Think about what it would be like for Ahamas to spend time with the king.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   Like, he would run as fast as he can. He'd get to the king.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   And then I just imagine him unloading everything going on in his life.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   And then he'd sit back and then he'd listen to the king.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   Like, there wouldn't be a whole lot of quiet about it. It would be a very loud time.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   He'd be communicating to the king and then he'd receive communication from the king.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   And this is what it should be like when you're spending time with the king.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   You're not just sitting there quietly, but you are speaking to him and then you're receiving orders from him
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   so that you can go out and do the mission that he's called you to do.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   And those times are not a burden. Those are the times in which you live for.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   So, let me ask you this. Do you live like you've been called?
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   Do you live like you've been put on mission or are you just trying to get by,
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   hoping it'll be Friday already so you can party, get drunk, have sex and do it all over again?
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   I just want to tell you this. There's a better way to live than that.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   There's a more exciting way to live than that.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   Because point number one, the king has given us a job within enemy territory.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   Now, the next time we see Ahamaz is in 2 Samuel chapter 18.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   He's faithfully been doing his job, running back and forth from Jerusalem to King David.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   But eventually there's a major battle between Absalom, the false king, and his army,
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   and David, the true king, and his army.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   And whoever would win this battle would have the power.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   So David's army ultimately wins and kills Absalom.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   Now, for David's safety, David actually wasn't there. He wasn't at the battle.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   So, once the battle is completed, someone has to go tell David the news,
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   which would be Ahamaz's job.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   So, Ahamaz goes to Joab, who is the commander of David's army, and he says this.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   Verse 19.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   "Now Ahamaz, son of Zadok, said, 'Let me run and take the news to the king
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   that the Lord has vindicated him by delivering him from the hands of his enemies.'
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   'You are not the one to take the news today,' Joab told him.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   'You may take the news another time, but you must not do so today,
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   because the king's son is dead.'
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   Then Joab said to a Cushite, 'Go tell the king what you have seen.'
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   The Cushite bowed down before Joab and ran off."
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   So, just to bring clarity to what's happening here,
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   Ahamaz goes to the commanding officer and says, "I've got a job to do.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   My job is to communicate to the king. I need to run to the king."
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   But then Joab, the commanding officer, says,
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   "No, you're not the one to take the news today."
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   Now, why would he do that?
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   That doesn't make a whole lot of sense. This is Ahamaz's job.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   Why would you not send him?
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   Well, he's not sending him because he really likes Ahamaz.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   And the last time a king died under David's watch,
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   something happened to the messenger.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   In 2 Kings 1, as I said earlier,
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   there was a battle between Saul's army and David's army.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   And when David's army won, the person that killed Saul
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   ran from that battle and ran to David and said,
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   "David, I've got good news. I've killed the king.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   You are now in charge."
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   And David's response was,
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   "How dare you put your hand on the Lord's anointed?"
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   And he killed the messenger.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   It feels extremely harsh, but that's what happened.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   So now, once again, another time a king has been put to death,
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   Joab's going, "Ahamaz, you ain't going this time.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   I don't want you to die. This mission's incredibly dangerous.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   I don't know how David's going to respond.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   I don't want you risking your life, so stay here,
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   and I'll send someone else," which is kind of Joab.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   The only issue was the king told Ahamaz he had a job to do,
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   and Joab was trying to tell him not to do it.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   And this is the second thing we can learn from this passage.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   Point number two, there will be excuses not to do your job.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   There will be excuses not to do your job.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   Here, Joab is truly being a friend to Ahamaz.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   He's saying, "Hey, I know the king gave you a job to do,
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   but it's too dangerous to do, so don't run.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   Let someone else do it."
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   But what seems kind is actually an opportunity to abandon the king's call.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   What you need to know in your life is that you've been called by God
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   to run hard and fast.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   He's offered you an opportunity to partner with him
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   in a supernatural mission of overthrowing this world.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   There will be many, many opportunities for you to step aside from your job.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   Good-meaning people will tell you, "Oh, don't run today."
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   Life circumstances will tell you, "I probably shouldn't run in this season."
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   Your own thoughts and your feelings and emotions should say,
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   "Ah, maybe I shouldn't run today."
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   There will be very, very good excuses for you not to do the job the king has given you
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   because life is hard, and this mission is hard.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   I think that this is sometimes what it can look like.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   In honor of the Olympics, I brought my pink balance beam here today.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   Admittedly, I've seen this illustration done before.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   But let's just imagine this.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   You start following Jesus, and you're like, "I'm going to be brave and courageous,
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   and I'm just going to do whatever it takes to follow him.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   So I'm going to get up here, and I'm going to do this amazing routine
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   that's going to impress God, and it's going to be awesome."
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   So you take a step forward in faith.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   And just to give some illustrations from my life, like early on when I started following Jesus,
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   I'm like, "I'm going to be courageously faithful.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   I'm going to share the gospel."
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   So I find a friend who doesn't know Jesus, and I share the gospel with him,
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   and that really just totally broke our relationship.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   He said, "Absolutely not. What you said is hateful and hurtful,
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   and I've really gone years without talking to him."
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   And in that moment, I'm like, "That didn't feel very safe.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   I didn't like that very much.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   So I'm just going to get a little bit more safe."
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   So you lean down a little bit.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   And then later on, I still do go into ministry
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   and start working at a church in Waco, Texas, doing college ministry.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   And I'm believing again. I'm like, "God, you're going to do big things.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   Let's do big things for the kingdom."
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   So we rent out an event space in Waco, and we're going to do a worship night.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   And I'm like, "Lord, you're going to save all of Baylor University.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   You're going to bring them here. We're going to have revival."
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   And we do the worship night, and there's about 13 people that show up.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   It could hold like 300.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   And I just remember laying in bed that night going,
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   "He didn't make me to do this job. I can't do this.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   Somebody else would have gotten more people there.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   This doesn't feel very safe.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   I just want to get a little bit more safe."
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   So you stop stepping out as much, and then you're still kind of trying to follow God.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   But then a couple weeks ago, I preached a message at Harris Creek, my church in Waco.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   And I'm trying to help people follow God.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   But then I opened up my email on Monday, and it says, "Yesterday's message."
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   And I'm like, "Oh, this is going to be awesome."
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   Like, I just saved this guy.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   [laughter]
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   And it's a long email.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   I didn't save him.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   In fact, he thought I was deceiving other people.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   And I was like, "Man, I'm just trying to do this mission that God gave me,
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   but this doesn't feel very safe, so I'm just going to stop stepping out at all."
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   And then eventually your life just looks like this.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   You're like, "I just want to hang on and make sure I don't do anything that's going to hurt me."
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   And then you just get to this spot where you're like, "Okay, what's the safest thing I could possibly do?
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   Okay, I'm going to get married, and we're going to have 2.5 kids,
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   and we're going to have a house with a yard,
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   and my kids are going to wear helmets all the time because life is really, really dangerous.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   And we're still going to go to church, and we're going to give to the church.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   We're going to give like 3%, so I feel good, but I don't even notice the money's gone.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   And we're going to pray for missionaries.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   We won't live like missionaries because that's dangerous.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   That could hurt us, but we're just going to live the safest life possible."
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   And then life goes on, and you're like, "Okay, God, my one hope in life
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   is that I would grow to be really old and then just die in my sleep."
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   Like, "I don't want to feel any pain. I don't want it to be hard.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   I don't want to have to go to a hospital. I don't like hospitals.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   So can it just please be like this?"
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   I just lay down, and then all of a sudden, just slowly wake up in glory and go like this.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   [laughter]
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   Yeah. Yeah.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   [applause]
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   You shouldn't be clapping because that's a horrible routine.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   Imagine if a couple weeks ago you turn on the Olympics, and Simone Biles gets up here,
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   and she just goes like this, lays there for a minute, gets off, and goes like this.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   What would the judge do with a routine like that?
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   She'd get a zero because she did nothing.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   Here's what you need to know. That's the routine the majority of Christians are living.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   What's the judge supposed to do with a safe life like that?
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   He's going, "I made you for more. You have the support of the king.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   You have a mission from the king. Let's go! Who cares if you fall off?
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   I made you for more."
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   [applause]
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   Maybe you're thinking, "God is not a judge. I've heard that a thousand times. God's not a judge."
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   [laughter]
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   2 Corinthians 5.10, "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   so that each of us may receive what is due us for the things we have done while in the body,
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   whether good or bad."
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   I want to be so clear. Salvation is a free gift of grace by faith in Jesus Christ.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   But Scripture does say that once you are saved, there is another judgment in heaven
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   because he's given you a mission.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   For that to be your life, how is he going to respond?
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   You might get to him and say, "But Jesus, I was afraid of falling off.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   But Jesus, other people said I looked kind of silly.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   But Jesus, I was afraid of getting hurt."
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   And he'd say, "But I gave you talents and you hid them in the sand.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   What am I supposed to do with that?
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   I gave you a job and you didn't do it because you wanted to be safe.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   You had my back the whole time. Why don't you trust me?"
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   So, here's what you need to know. There will be good reason not to run.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   You just have to decide now, am I going to listen to the call of the king or the excuses of this world?
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   So, if you want to be courageously faithful, you've got to know this.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   Point number two, there will be excuses not to do your job.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   So, let's see what happens next. Getting back in the text, Joab says,
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   "Hey, don't run today, Ahamas. It's not safe. It's too dangerous."
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   And this happens next, verse 22.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   "Ahamas, son of Zadok, again said to Joab, 'Come what may, please let me run behind the Cushite.'
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   But Joab replied, 'My son, why do you want to go?
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   You don't have any news that will bring you a reward.'
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   He said, 'Come what may, I want to run.'
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   So, Joab said, 'Run.'
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   Then Ahamas ran by way of the plain and outran the Cushite."
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   Now, this is the part of the story that just stopped me in my tracks.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   This is the part of the story that just lodged in my heart.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   "Come what may, I want to run.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   Sure, it's dangerous, but I want to run.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   I hear what you say, Joab, but I want to run.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   I might not even get there first, but I want to run."
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   And then Joab says, though, "But you don't even have news that will bring you a reward."
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   And Ahamas has got to be thinking, "You're crazy.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   I don't run to get a reward.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   I run as the reward.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   Working for the king is the reward.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   Faithfulness to the king is the reward.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   And man cannot convince me out of what God has called me."
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   So, point number three, third thing you need to learn if you want to live a courageously faithful life,
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   the courageously faithful run in the midst of opposition.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   And I love this moment from Ahamas because he throws all the what-ifs to the side.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   He isn't stuck thinking, "Well, what if I run to the king, and he's mad at the news I bring,
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   but what if I don't run to the king, and he's mad that I didn't run to him,
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   but what if I run and Joab gets mad at me because he told me not to run?
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   Like, what if, what if, what if?"
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   He just throws that all to the side, and he says, "No, I've got extreme clarity with what I'm supposed to do with my life.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   The king has called me to run, so I'm going to run."
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   And this is what I want my life's motto to be.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   "Come what may, I want to run.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   Sure, I may get tired, but I want to run.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   Other people may not understand, but I want to run.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   I may not have the strength to make it there, but I want to run.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   I may not have any news that brings me a reward, but I want to run."
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   Now, why can this be our response?
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   Why can we so courageously run to the king?
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   It's because the king has so compassionately ran to us.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   You see, there's a story in Scripture where Jesus tells a parable in Luke chapter 15.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   There were two sons. He's a rich dad.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   This one son, the younger son, goes to his dad and says, "Dad, I really wish you were dead.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   I want your money. I want your stuff more than I want you."
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   And this dad says, "Sure. Take what I got."
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   So he takes what he gave him.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   And this son runs as far away as he can.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   He spends it on drinking, on partying, on gambling, on sex, thinking it would fill his heart.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   It did not fill his heart.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   And after he had spent everything his father had given him, he found himself in the midst of the pigs.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   He was hired to work with the pigs, eating the pigs' food.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   And as he's eating the pigs' food, he thinks, "I need to go back to my dad.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   I'm going to go back to him and say, 'Dad, if you'd just accept me as a slave, I'd be better off than where I am now.'"
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   And as he's on his journey back, we read this, Luke chapter 15.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   So he got up, went to his father.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   He ran to his son, threw his arms around him, and kissed him.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   "If this is true, you cannot keep me from running to him because my sins did not keep him from running to me."
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   You see, while I was still a long way off, while I had taken everything that he had given me and spent it all,
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   while I threw myself into a pit, he saw me in that state, he saw you in that state,
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   and Jesus so loved you that he ran from heaven to enter into earth to live 33 perfect years,
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   and then he died brutally on a cross, and then three days later, he rose again.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   And he ran to you so that you can run to him.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   Hebrews 12 says this, "Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses,
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles,
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   and let us run with perseverance, the race marked out for us,
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him,
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God."
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   Ports, I think we've got three people in the room tonight, three different types of people.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   The first group of people is the people who are running hard.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   You're just running hard in the wrong direction.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   You're running hard after things you think will satisfy.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   You're running hard after pornography, relationships, alcohol, drugs, money, status, success,
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   a certain type of body.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   You're running hard after things that will not satisfy.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   And I just implore you tonight, turn around and start running the other way.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   You're going to see your father's already been running after you.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   Second group of people in the room tonight, you are believers in Jesus,
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   and you are really content with just that.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   Like you're a believer, you're not a follower.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   You're not moving in a direction.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   You are comfortably seated in your seat, just kind of allowing the life to go on,
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   hoping you don't get hurt.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   I want to implore you, get up and follow your king because he's moving.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   And then the third group of people in this room tonight,
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   you're the people who are courageously, faithfully following after Jesus.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   And I just want to tell you, it's going to be worth it.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   It's going to be worth it.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   [Applause]
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   Like you're going to enter into glory and he's going to say,
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   "Man, I gave you five talents and you gave me ten in return.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   Here's more.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   Come and share in your father's happiness.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   If you're tired now, if you're exhausted now, if you're feeling hurt now,
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   it's all going to be worth it because you were made to run."
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   So, in summary, if you want to be courageously faithful,
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   you've got to know these three things.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   Point number one, you've been called by the king to run.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   Point number two, there will be legitimate excuses not to run.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   And point number three, the courageously faithful run in the midst of opposition.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   I want to close with something that ironically I actually learned
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   while writing this message.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   Have you guys ever heard about a guy named Alex Arnold?
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   Alex Arnold.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   Anyone see the documentary Free Solo?
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   Yeah, this guy's crazy.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   I think we've got a picture of him.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   So he's a free climber, which means he climbs massive mountains
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   with no harness, with no rope.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   It's unbelievable.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   Free Solo is all about him climbing like Half Dome in Yosemite.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   It's this massive rock formation that you stand at the bottom and you're like,
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   "I can't ever possibly imagine climbing this with a rope,
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   let alone without a rope," and yet this is what he does.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   He's known for doing this all over the place.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   If you look at this picture, one misstep and he'd die.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   It's crazy.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   So scientists are like, "We've got to study this guy."
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   Like, how in the world is he able to do these things?
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   So they put him under some machine.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   If you're a doctor, you'd know what it is.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   But it's some machine that, like, measures your brain.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   And they showed him a bunch of different things,
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   and your brain is supposed to light up in different areas.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   And after they ran this machine with him underneath it,
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   everything began to make sense because as they looked at his test results,
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   they realized that his amygdala just flat out doesn't work.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   Why does that matter?
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   Because the amygdala is the fear center of your brain.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   Whenever you're doing something dangerous,
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   whenever something scary is happening,
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   your amygdala is lighting up, telling the rest of your body,
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   "You need to get out of here."
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   For Alex, it's telling him nothing.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   Like, he can do all those things because he has no fear.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   As followers of Jesus, this is who we are.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   1 John 4:18, "There is no fear in love,
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   but perfect love drives out fear."
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   Because fear has to do with punishment.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   The one who fears is not made perfect in love.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   As Christians, our fear centers don't work anymore
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   because perfect love has driven it out.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   The enemy is going to tell you things like,
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   "What if you don't get married?"
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   "It's okay. I'm headed to the best wedding ever,
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   the wedding feast of the Lamb. I'm going to be okay."
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   The enemy is going to tell you,
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   "What if you're in Dallas by mistake?
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   What if you're in Boise by mistake?"
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   "Oh, no, I've been placed here.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   The king has placed me here."
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   "What if you're going to be all alone
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   for the rest of your life?
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   What if you're in this city and have no community?"
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   "Oh, I'm not alone.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   I know my God is with me and for me wherever I go."
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   "What if you don't make enough money at your job?"
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   "Oh, I'm not about money."
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   "What if you don't like your job?"
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   "Oh, this is just what I do on the side."
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   "Yeah, my true job is an ambassador
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   of the kingdom of heaven.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   This is just my second job."
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   Listen, there's nothing the enemy can tell you
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   that should drive fear to your heart.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   Because perfect love has driven out fear.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   Because Jesus is alive and with you and for you.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   And he's tapped you on the shoulder and he said,
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   "You've got a call from the king.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   You've got the support of the king.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   Now run, do your job."
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   And as followers of Jesus, we get to partner with him
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   in the overthrow of this land.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   From the kingdom of darkness to the kingdom of light.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   This is what we've been called to.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   There may be a little g God of this world
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   who seems like he's got a position and power now.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   He won't have it for long.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   It may feel like the true king is dead.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   He ain't dead.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   He's just planning his comeback.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   So as followers of Jesus,
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   may we have the courage of Ahamas to say,
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   "Come what may, I've got a job to do.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   So I'm gonna do it."
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   Let me pray that we would.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   Heavenly father, I just pray that you drive fear
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   out of this room tonight.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   I know that so many young adults in this room
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   are watching online.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   They're just paralyzed with all these what ifs.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   What if this doesn't happen?
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   What if this does happen?
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   What if this goes wrong?
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   What if this never goes right?
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   Father, I pray that they would know
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   that they don't have to wonder about all the what ifs
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   because they know even if the tomb is still empty,
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   even if Jesus is still alive,
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   even if those things never happen,
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   I know where I'm going
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   because I know who I am and whose I am.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   So father, I pray that we'd leave this room tonight
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   sent out running with a mission
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   and a purpose from the king.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   And father, I pray that we'd run hard and fast after you.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   Not confident in our own abilities or our gifts,
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   but just confident in the fact that we can run hard and fast
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   in the job that you've given us
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   because you first ran hard and fast after us.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   And father, would you use us for your name and your glory.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   And as people see us running hard after you,
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   may they follow in our footsteps,
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   running hard after their king.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   And God, we do pray as we are in the midst of a land
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   that is under the influence of an enemy,
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   that is under the influence of an evil king,
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   I pray that you'd overthrow it,
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   that Jesus, you'd come and you'd come quickly
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   and we could see your return,
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   that we could see the true king coming back.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   And God, we're confident in the fact
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   that even though this is not home,
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   one day we will get to experience home
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   where you will be the king,
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   where you will be the one we get to gaze upon
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   all the days of our life.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   And God, I pray that we do that even now
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   because of the fact that Jesus is alive and with us and for us.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   It's in his name we pray, amen.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.580]   (gentle music)
