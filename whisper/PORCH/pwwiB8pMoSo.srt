 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,480
 All right, how we doing, Porch, tonight?

3
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,800
 Porch, Houston, Porch, Austin, Porch, Cincinnati, Porch,

4
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,560
 Northwest Arkansas, and welcome, of course,

5
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,720
 to my friends tonight here at Porch Dallas.

6
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,840
 Let's do this.

7
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,000
 We are in night four of fortune telling,

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,800
 where if you haven't been tracking with us,

9
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,280
 we are not telling you your fortune.

10
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,240
 We cannot do that.

11
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,280
 But we are looking at words from the past,

12
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,360
 a.k.a. what we've said is God's word, the only reliable words,

13
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,040
 and what they have to say about your fortune or your future.

14
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,400
 Because there is only one person,

15
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,240
 one being who knows what your future holds,

16
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,080
 and his name is God.

17
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,080
 And that's who we're pointing you to tonight.

18
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,200
 So we sit around and we ask, hey,

19
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,480
 what do we think people would want to know right now?

20
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,040
 So before I get to tonight's question,

21
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,800
 like I do every week, just a little bit of public shaming,

22
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,480
 it was summer of 2013.

23
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,440
 There I was with my best friends, my bros,

24
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,080
 staying in our college town,

25
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,240
 which if you've ever stayed in your college town

26
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,600
 during the summer, it is just such a dream.

27
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,520
 The place is empty, becomes a ghost town.

28
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,560
 I went to SFA, Axum Jacks,

29
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,600
 and Nacogdoches doesn't have much to offer,

30
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,440
 but if you're with the right people, it's kind of a good time.

31
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,680
 So I'm in Nacogdoches, Texas.

32
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,640
 We are sitting there and a family from church said,

33
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,020
 hey, y'all can live up at our second story,

34
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,200
 make it a bachelor pad.

35
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,320
 There was a ping pong table.

36
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,480
 The mom was like, I'll cook for y'all every single night,

37
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,000
 an East Texas home cooked meal.

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,640
 We're like, score, this is amazing, rent-free,

39
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,720
 best summer ever, until it wasn't.

40
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,360
 It was Memorial Day, the first official day of summer.

41
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,680
 We all decide, let's go out to the lake, Lake Nacogdoches.

42
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,260
 And it was there and the nasty knack

43
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,660
 that we go tubing for a few hours.

44
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,280
 We get back to the lake house and this guy,

45
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,200
 I mean, he is such a character.

46
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,040
 He's like, I built me my own zip line,

47
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,160
 y'all see it up there?

48
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,320
 And I'm like, oh, that's nice.

49
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,040
 I want nothing to do with that.

50
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,600
 And he was like, y'all should give it a try.

51
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,880
 And they're like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

52
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,280
 And I should let you know that my friends this summer

53
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,480
 had to all be in town

54
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,960
 because they were all football players at SFA.

55
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,440
 I was the video guy for the team, that was my job.

56
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,200
 And so I'm not like them,

57
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,640
 but they're all like, yeah, this is awesome.

58
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,480
 But I want to tell you, this is like redneck one-on-one

59
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,960
 zip line, this is not strap in,

60
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,760
 like click, check, check, check, sending them,

61
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,320
 it's not that, it is handlebars on a cable.

62
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,800
 And at the bottom are three tennis balls

63
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,640
 and you go up about a 15 foot bank,

64
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,780
 shallow water, ground underneath,

65
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,140
 and then you climb a ladder.

66
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,680
 And when you get to the top of the ladder,

67
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,840
 the top step that it says, do not get on the top step,

68
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,320
 you get on that top step and then you grab the handlebars

69
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,040
 and then you are expected to hold on for dear life

70
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,040
 until you make contact with the tennis balls at the end.

71
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,400
 And then it propels you and sends you

72
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,960
 into the deep end of the water.

73
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,160
 Okay?

74
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,080
 So I'm sitting here and I'm like, that ain't me,

75
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,920
 I'm not doing that.

76
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,840
 I'm in the boat still and I'm like, you guys go.

77
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,240
 So the first guy goes, he's like, he's insane.

78
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,320
 He's like an Olympic trial athlete.

79
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,640
 And he gets up there and does like the thing

80
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,600
 where he's like, all right, knees up,

81
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,640
 like cowabunga dude at the end,

82
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,400
 back flips, lands it perfectly.

83
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,000
 Everyone's like, there's 10, you know,

84
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,720
 the whole of the car just say 10 on it.

85
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,920
 And then everyone looks around, they're like, that's awesome.

86
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,760
 Then they're like, JD should do it.

87
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,240
 And all these guys are like, yeah, JD, get up there.

88
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,440
 And I'm like, oh my gosh, I have to prove myself.

89
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,280
 And so I'm getting up there, I'm sweating.

90
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,200
 Again, my arms are weak 'cause the three hours of tubing,

91
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,200
 just want to keep affirming that, that my arms were weak.

92
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,600
 And so, 'cause of the tubing.

93
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:03,600
 So I get up there, the climb is already terrifying enough.

94
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,800
 And then I grab, you know, they get this like stick

95
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,720
 and they bring the bars back up to you.

96
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,140
 And the whole time the cable is like not working.

97
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,000
 And I grab it and I'm like, yeah.

98
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,440
 And I'm looking down and I'm like,

99
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,240
 hey, I don't think I should do it.

100
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,120
 And they're all like, come on, you can do it, JD.

101
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,800
 The worst nightmare for a guy like me.

102
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,920
 And so they're all going, all eyes are on me.

103
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,780
 And in the middle of all the chanting,

104
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,520
 I hear the mom of the house scream,

105
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,640
 hey JD, I thought God hasn't given us a spirit of fear.

106
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,840
 And I'm like, Geronimo.

107
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,120
 And I go off, but it wasn't like one of those cool,

108
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,440
 like go off, it was like one of those,

109
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,840
 like, you know, like you go off.

110
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,360
 And let's just say I was not prepared, my arms lock.

111
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,840
 I let go, I fall 22 feet, land in a foot of water.

112
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,520
 Because remember, you're supposed to go out to the deep end.

113
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,280
 I go unconscious, the water wakes me up.

114
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,520
 And suddenly I am hearing screaming all around me.

115
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,440
 I'm like, what's going on?

116
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,480
 It's like a bomb went off.

117
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,740
 I looked down and my toes should be facing up like this.

118
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,160
 They were facing over there.

119
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,480
 And I'm like, is that my, you know, whatever.

120
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:16,480
 So that happens on the first day

121
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,680
 of what was supposed to be the best summer of my life.

122
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,200
 I know, it's sad.

123
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,440
 You don't always get your colored summers.

124
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,460
 And that day went from a very high to a very low.

125
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,560
 That was me.

126
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,880
 And that guy right there,

127
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,360
 he was faking it till he was making it.

128
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,320
 You can take that off, you can get off.

129
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,600
 'Cause that was a low, low.

130
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,560
 And what an unexpected tragedy that was.

131
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,520
 But I think a lot of us are like that guy.

132
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,200
 I think a lot of us go through life

133
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,640
 and something hits us unexpectedly.

134
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,200
 And we're walking in here tonight

135
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,960
 and there's so many different things represented.

136
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,040
 We have so many different backgrounds and stories

137
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,200
 and jobs and gifts and talents

138
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,760
 and all the things that uniquely make you.

139
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,320
 But one thing we all share in common

140
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,680
 is every person is walking in here tonight

141
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,940
 had experienced an unexpected tragedy.

142
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,240
 Having experienced something that hurt them,

143
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,800
 something that has seemed broken or off.

144
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,120
 You have had something in your life take place

145
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,980
 that man, that was so sad.

146
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,760
 And it was this storm in your life

147
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,080
 that you did not know what to do with.

148
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,340
 And I know all of you have experienced unexpected storms

149
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,480
 because look at last week.

150
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,440
 I mean, talk about an unexpected storm.

151
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,920
 And I think a lot of us are like that guy.

152
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,960
 We're walking here tonight and we're like, thumbs up.

153
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,160
 Foot is facing the other way.

154
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,820
 We're like, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm really fine.

155
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,040
 Although we're not fine.

156
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,820
 Because when things come in life that we don't expect

157
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,180
 and when we lose control, we start to freak out.

158
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,420
 We do not know what to do.

159
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,200
 We are not necessarily prepared.

160
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,500
 And I would be naive to think that a lot of you,

161
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,540
 even just with, I mean, literally what happened last week

162
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,980
 as I was sitting in this like,

163
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,380
 watching what started off as a fun snow day

164
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,780
 turned to so much devastation.

165
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,820
 And tonight, I bet some of you are still experiencing

166
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,700
 the ramifications of what took place.

167
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,560
 Some of you still may not be back in your home

168
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,080
 or back in your office or back in your work.

169
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,700
 And you weren't ready for that.

170
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,740
 Texas sure as heck wasn't ready for that.

171
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:20,600
 And so that's why tonight we're answering the question,

172
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,820
 will this storm ever cease?

173
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,920
 Will this storm ever cease?

174
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,440
 Because last week I was sitting there alone asking,

175
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,960
 God, what do you want me to speak to your people tonight?

176
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,420
 And I was going down one path,

177
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,620
 but as I was sitting in the middle of this house

178
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,360
 with no water, my power is out of my house,

179
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,060
 I'm staying at a friend's house, I'm sitting there.

180
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,160
 I was like, man, what an unexpected storm.

181
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:48,080
 And I bet a lot of people coming out of 2020,

182
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,560
 coming into 2021, COVID still going on,

183
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,060
 mask still being worn, the Fort Worth pile up.

184
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,140
 I mean, talk about unexpected.

185
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,700
 That was just a normal day for those people.

186
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,820
 And as I sat there and watched the tragedy of those videos

187
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,600
 of trucks just piling and piling,

188
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,440
 those people were just going to work.

189
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,620
 And I bet they're asking,

190
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,540
 what do I do when the storm comes like this?

191
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,380
 That family was going,

192
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,460
 what do I do when this unexpected tragedy hits?

193
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,560
 What do we do?

194
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,740
 When pipes are bursting, when COVID cases are rising,

195
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,540
 will this storm ever cease?

196
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,660
 And so tonight I wanna look at God's word

197
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,400
 and see what it has to say to inform us

198
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,820
 about our storms in life.

199
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,900
 Because the reality is, this is important.

200
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,740
 This is why every single one of you

201
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,060
 need to lean in tonight.

202
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:39,780
 Take it from me, take it from God's word,

203
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,020
 take it from people here.

204
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,420
 You are either walking into a storm,

205
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:46,580
 you're walking through a storm,

206
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,600
 or someone is coming out of a storm.

207
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,120
 But storms will be a part of your life.

208
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,940
 How do I know that?

209
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:58,100
 God's word says in John 16, 33,

210
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:02,380
 in this world, you will have trouble.

211
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,160
 Second Timothy 3, 12 says,

212
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,840
 "Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life

213
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,400
 in Christ Jesus will be persecuted."

214
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:16,400
 Key word there, will, not maybe, not if, will.

215
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,240
 Will be persecuted.

216
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,040
 They will have trouble.

217
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,360
 Why?

218
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,920
 If God is the all knowing God, the sovereign God,

219
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,040
 the God who's in control,

220
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,280
 why does he allow storms to come in our life?

221
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,360
 Sin, the moment that it entered into our world

222
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,680
 in the beginning of the Bible,

223
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,560
 sin came, destruction followed,

224
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,120
 brokenness came.

225
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,240
 The storms in your life,

226
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,220
 the things that we see are a result of man,

227
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,000
 what we call man's depravity,

228
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,400
 or the fall of man.

229
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,320
 And ever since that original sin

230
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,560
 in the Garden of Eden at the beginning of your Bible,

231
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,840
 we have just watched more and more and more storms come

232
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,660
 because God's like,

233
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,400
 "This is what happens when you don't choose me.

234
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,840
 This is what happens when you choose yourself,

235
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,120
 when you choose your flesh,

236
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,060
 you're gonna experience trouble."

237
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:07,920
 And more and more storms are gonna come.

238
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,480
 So just to start off right off the bat,

239
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,460
 what, will this storm ever cease?

240
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,060
 If right now each of you could come to me and go,

241
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,080
 "Hey, here's the storm I'm walking through currently,

242
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,920
 when do you think it will end?

243
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,080
 I experienced a breakup,

244
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,760
 when will the heartbreak stop?

245
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,160
 Or, hey, my friend got cancer and then ended up dying,

246
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,720
 like when will that pain go away?

247
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,340
 When will this storm cease?"

248
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,140
 And I just wanna start off the bat giving you the answer.

249
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,240
 The answer is,

250
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,000
 I'm not gonna give you an emotionally satisfying answer

251
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,240
 because I don't know.

252
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:46,320
 I don't know, I'm searching God's word

253
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,200
 and I don't know on this earth when your storm will cease.

254
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,760
 Tonight, I'm not giving you a yes or no answer.

255
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,800
 I can tell you that Revelation 21 verse four

256
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,920
 talks about the hope we have in Jesus and his return

257
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,600
 when he comes back to claim his church, you and I,

258
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,840
 where he says, "On that day when Jesus returns,

259
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,040
 there'll be no more weeping, no more mourning,

260
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,560
 no more pain, no more sickness,

261
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,400
 and we will be in heaven, we will be in perfection."

262
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,260
 And that is our hope, that is what we are striving for,

263
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,660
 that is what we are looking to,

264
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,080
 that is how we get through the storms that we currently face.

265
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,760
 But I don't know on earth when your storm will end.

266
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,880
 And God's word does not say,

267
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,520
 "Hey, this is when your storm will end."

268
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,520
 But what it is full of,

269
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:36,440
 full of is guidance, wisdom principles,

270
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,720
 and a lot of ways that shows you God's heart for you

271
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,040
 in the midst of your storm

272
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,200
 and how you can get through your storm.

273
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,480
 So tonight I'm redirecting the question,

274
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,360
 will this storm ever cease?

275
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,760
 And I know you want the answer.

276
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,240
 I know some of you tonight are like,

277
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,400
 "Man, I just wanna know, this has to end,

278
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,440
 this has to let up.

279
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,480
 Will this pandemic ever end?

280
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,920
 I wanna see the light at the end of the tunnel."

281
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,200
 And I'm redirecting that question

282
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,880
 to not when will the storm end,

283
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,960
 but rather how can we weather the storm?

284
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:16,160
 When the storms in life come, how can we weather the storm?

285
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,040
 And I wanna do that through looking at a story

286
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,120
 in the book of Matthew,

287
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,360
 a story that I have read many times,

288
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,320
 and maybe you have, you've heard about,

289
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,760
 about a disciple who experienced a storm.

290
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,760
 In chapter 14, we're gonna see the heart of Jesus for you

291
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,600
 in the midst of your storm, starting in verse 22.

292
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,440
 Here we go.

293
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,040
 "Immediately he made the disciples get into the boat

294
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,400
 and go before him to the other side,

295
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,760
 while he," being Jesus, "dismissed the crowds."

296
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,960
 He had just fed the 5,000 people

297
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,200
 with the fish and the loaves.

298
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,880
 "And after he dismissed the crowds,

299
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,400
 he went up to the mountain by himself to pray."

300
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:01,160
 So Jesus is up on this mountain, praying by himself to God,

301
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,280
 and he sends the disciples.

302
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,120
 Normally he goes with them,

303
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,160
 but he sends them off to cross the sea on a ship.

304
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,280
 "And when evening came, he was there alone,

305
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,400
 but the boat by this time was a long way from the land,

306
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,000
 beaten by the waves, for the wind was against them.

307
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,960
 And in the fourth watch of the night,"

308
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,060
 which is about somewhere between three and 6 a.m.,

309
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,400
 very dark, very early,

310
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,040
 "he came to them walking on the sea," casual.

311
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,880
 "But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea,

312
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,720
 they were terrified and they said, 'It is a ghost!'

313
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,040
 And they cried out in fear.

314
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,440
 But immediately Jesus spoke to them saying,

315
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,440
 'Take heart, it is I. Do not be afraid.'"

316
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,480
 And Peter, and I love Peter.

317
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,360
 Every interaction with Peter in the books of the Bible,

318
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,400
 I'm just like, I love Peter, he's my guy.

319
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,080
 "But Peter answered him, 'Lord, if it is you,

320
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,160
 command me to come to you on the water.'

321
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,740
 And he said, 'Come.'

322
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,660
 So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water

323
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,560
 and came to Jesus.

324
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,720
 But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and began to sink.

325
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,240
 He cried out, 'Lord, save me!'

326
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,440
 And Jesus immediately reached out his hand

327
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,140
 and took hold of him saying to him,

328
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,680
 'Oh, you of little faith, why did you doubt?'

329
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,720
 And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.

330
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,600
 And those in the boat worshiped him saying,

331
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,200
 'Truly you are the son of God.'"

332
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,680
 So number one, how do we weather the storm?

333
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,560
 Know who is in control of the storm.

334
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,840
 Know who is in control of the storm.

335
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,200
 I want you to look at this part of the story.

336
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,920
 We're gonna just try to dissect it and go piece by piece.

337
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,400
 But when the disciples, in verse 26,

338
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,140
 "When the disciples saw him walking on the sea,

339
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:40,000
 they were terrified and said, 'It is a ghost.'"

340
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 At this point, they don't know,

341
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,880
 they can't see through the fog who's walking towards them.

342
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,640
 They just see a figure like you and I,

343
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,720
 if I saw someone walking on the sea, I'd be like,

344
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,500
 hold up, y'all see that?

345
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,120
 There's this figure walking towards them on the sea

346
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,360
 and they say, "It is a ghost."

347
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,600
 And they cried out in fear,

348
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,480
 but immediately Jesus spoke to them saying,

349
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,800
 "Take heart, it is I, do not be afraid."

350
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,300
 And Peter answered him,

351
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,560
 "Lord, if it is you,

352
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,480
 command me to come to you on the water."

353
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,000
 And he said, "Come."

354
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,200
 So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water

355
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,520
 and came to Jesus.

356
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,560
 I mean, can you imagine this moment?

357
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,040
 Winds are picking up, waves are crashing.

358
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,220
 They cannot see ahead of them.

359
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,100
 It is three to six in the morning

360
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,900
 and suddenly a man is walking on water

361
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:20,860
 towards them.

362
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:26,200
 And Jesus says, "Hey, it's I, do not be afraid."

363
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,680
 First off, I want you to notice something.

364
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,160
 He did not say, "It is I, Jesus, do not be afraid."

365
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,800
 He just said, "It is I, do not be afraid."

366
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,080
 I would be like, "Excuse me, who are you?

367
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,000
 'Cause I can't see you."

368
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,480
 And they're kind of just like, Peter's just assumed.

369
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,960
 He's like, "Lord, if it's you, command me to come out."

370
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,840
 And I'm like, "Peter, I would need a little more than that.

371
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,980
 I'm about to jump into the sea like that.

372
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,640
 I need a little more assurance, it's Jesus."

373
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,740
 But that's the point I wanted to tell you.

374
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,620
 Why was Peter so confident?

375
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:57,060
 How did Peter know it was Jesus?

376
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,220
 'Cause Jesus never explicitly says,

377
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,360
 "It is I, Jesus, do not be afraid."

378
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:09,400
 It's because Peter knew Jesus.

379
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:14,100
 Peter had been with Jesus.

380
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,580
 Peter had seen Jesus move in his life.

381
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,740
 Peter had seen Jesus perform miracles.

382
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,560
 Peter had just seen Jesus feed 5,000 people.

383
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,520
 Peter knew the power that Jesus possessed.

384
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,620
 Peter saw Jesus as Lord.

385
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,980
 Peter had a right view of Jesus.

386
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,340
 Peter saw Jesus as in control.

387
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,220
 How do I know that?

388
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,780
 Look what he says.

389
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:39,680
 "Lord, if it is you, command me."

390
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:45,220
 Don't ask me, "Command me to come to you on the water."

391
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,660
 And the Lord simply said, "Come."

392
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:51,640
 And we see Peter get out of the boat.

393
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:56,480
 What courage that must have taken.

394
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,140
 We've all jumped into a body of water before.

395
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,940
 We know what it feels like to jump into a pool

396
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,180
 and fill the water, go all around us

397
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,100
 and form around our body,

398
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,780
 'cause that's what water does, it's not solid.

399
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,900
 Imagine what it must have been like.

400
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,580
 Like, was Peter like this?

401
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,700
 Did he jump?

402
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,820
 Did the disciples hold his arm?

403
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:13,780
 Did he lean?

404
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,720
 Like, I think I would have been more like one of these,

405
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,120
 you know, like feeling it.

406
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:24,100
 But something, something gave him the courage

407
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:27,740
 to step out of that boat and onto those waves.

408
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,780
 And there's only one answer.

409
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:34,420
 He knew who was in control of those waves.

410
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,980
 He knew Jesus.

411
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,940
 And Jesus didn't even have to say clearly, "It is I,"

412
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,340
 because Peter knew the sound of his voice.

413
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,680
 Because Peter had been with him,

414
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,080
 he recognized him.

415
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,380
 He trusted him.

416
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,080
 I was just thinking during worship,

417
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,820
 it was like when my dad would lose me and my brother,

418
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,260
 like say we're at a fair or, that sounds like a bad dad.

419
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,240
 When my dad would like, you know,

420
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,780
 let us go off in the distance,

421
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,900
 and when we were getting too far,

422
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,220
 he had this like, I don't know if it's like

423
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,380
 an East Texas thing, but like,

424
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,300
 he would like whistle with both his fingers in his mouth.

425
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,420
 I can't do it.

426
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:09,220
 But it was so loud in the midst of all of these people,

427
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,860
 I would somehow hear it immediately stop like a lab

428
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,720
 and turn around.

429
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,700
 And he loved it.

430
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,780
 He was like, you know,

431
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,180
 he loved it.

432
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:22,580
 Because he loved kind of having this thing with his sons

433
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,780
 or it was like our thing, like,

434
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,660
 hey, if you're getting too far off,

435
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,120
 hear the sound of my whistle, come back.

436
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,660
 I didn't have to question.

437
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,380
 I didn't think, oh, there's some other dad out there

438
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,620
 who knows how to whistle like that.

439
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,580
 I'm like, that's my dad.

440
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,100
 That is my dad's whistle.

441
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:39,220
 And I better turn around and get back to him.

442
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,420
 'Cause I knew my dad.

443
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,720
 I knew his call.

444
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:48,980
 The same way Peter knew who was in control.

445
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,240
 He knew his Jesus.

446
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,320
 He knew his friend.

447
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,600
 He knew his Lord.

448
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,520
 And when you know Jesus,

449
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,880
 when you see Jesus as in control of the storm around you,

450
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,400
 you start to have a different response

451
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,820
 to the storms in your life.

452
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,880
 Because no longer are the storms

453
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,040
 dictating your view of Jesus.

454
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,700
 Jesus is dictating your view of your storms.

455
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,380
 And when Jesus dictates the view of your storms,

456
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,460
 your response to the storms in your life

457
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,600
 start to look a lot different.

458
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,580
 No more are you sitting back on your heels going,

459
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,940
 I hope the next thing doesn't hit.

460
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,580
 Oh my gosh, what if something else happens?

461
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,600
 What if this pandemic just keeps on going and going?

462
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,140
 What if another snow storm hits?

463
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,100
 Oh my gosh, what if I get cancer?

464
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,140
 Or what if something happens to me?

465
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,260
 Or what if, what if, what if?

466
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,240
 You don't have to live like that

467
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,580
 because you know who's in control of the storm.

468
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:37,300
 You don't have to sit back in the boat and hide and say,

469
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,260
 oh my gosh, I'm afraid, I'm afraid.

470
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,420
 It's a ghost, it's a ghost.

471
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,300
 So much is happening.

472
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,780
 Why is there a ghost walking on the water?

473
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,860
 What is going on?

474
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:44,860
 It is too early for this.

475
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,680
 You're not like that.

476
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,980
 You're like, Lord, if it's you, command me out.

477
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,900
 And if it's really you, I'm coming.

478
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:57,300
 Peter was willing to step out of the boat

479
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,700
 because he knew who was in control of the storm.

480
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,140
 Psalm 34, 19 says,

481
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,500
 "Many are the afflictions of the righteous,

482
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,540
 "but the Lord delivers him out of them all."

483
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,300
 Many are the afflictions, many are the storms,

484
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,980
 many are the persecuting things,

485
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,620
 many are the sufferings that we face,

486
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,740
 the trials that we face.

487
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,660
 They are many.

488
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,180
 This world is very, very broken.

489
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,260
 I don't need to remind you of that.

490
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,580
 You can see it everywhere,

491
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,540
 but the Lord delivers him out of them all.

492
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,140
 Peter was like, sink or swim,

493
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,900
 if it's you, Lord, and you call me out,

494
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,580
 I'm going because I know you're in control.

495
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:34,140
 How?

496
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,820
 How could he know?

497
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:42,860
 How, I mean, how can he know that he knows

498
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,780
 that he knows that Jesus will show up?

499
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,780
 That he'll actually be able to walk on water?

500
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,860
 How can we know that in the storms of life,

501
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,740
 Jesus will actually show up?

502
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:56,780
 Maybe because something happened to you

503
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:00,580
 and you prayed and prayed and prayed,

504
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:03,220
 like, God, would you take away that sickness?

505
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,940
 Or God, would you heal them from the cancer?

506
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,620
 Or God, would you show up in this way?

507
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,740
 And you prayed and prayed and prayed

508
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,100
 and he didn't seem to show up in your life,

509
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,020
 so you don't know how to trust him anymore.

510
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:16,420
 Or maybe you went through something really, really hard,

511
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,180
 right after you surrendered your life to Christ,

512
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,340
 and started doing the whole God thing,

513
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,780
 maybe you went through an extreme breakup

514
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,860
 or you lost a lot of friends,

515
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,700
 and you're like, man,

516
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,260
 if this is what looking like to follow Jesus,

517
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,420
 I don't want any part of it.

518
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,340
 Jesus doesn't show up.

519
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,180
 He leaves you there.

520
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,540
 He drowns you.

521
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,240
 I'm not stepping out of that boat.

522
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,980
 How did Peter know?

523
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,740
 (pages rustling)

524
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:42,780
 The answer is Peter had faith.

525
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,740
 I wanna talk for a second about faith.

526
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,900
 'Cause I think there are so many questions

527
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,220
 that hold us back from seeing

528
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:53,040
 that Jesus is in control of the storm.

529
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,180
 We want to take control

530
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,420
 because we don't actually know the Jesus who's in control.

531
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,420
 And what about this?

532
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,900
 And what if I don't make enough money?

533
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,140
 I have to pick the right job

534
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,180
 and I have to find the right person.

535
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,980
 I have to find the one because this and that,

536
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,100
 and then I have to get the house,

537
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,360
 and then I wanna have security,

538
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,900
 and then this and that, and the 401k.

539
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,860
 And what if, what if, what if,

540
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,700
 take control, K through 12?

541
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,140
 'Cause I don't really actually know

542
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,740
 that the Jesus that's in control.

543
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:19,300
 I don't know what it's like to have faith.

544
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,880
 Therefore I operate in fear.

545
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,380
 So what is faith?

546
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,920
 Because I think faith is the answer

547
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,780
 that allowed Peter to step out of that boat.

548
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,620
 And here's what Hebrews says, Hebrews 11, one.

549
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:35,300
 "Now faith is confidence in what we hope for

550
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:39,580
 and assurance about what we do not see."

551
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:44,100
 Peter could not clearly see Jesus.

552
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,640
 Therefore it required this thing called faith

553
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,660
 to step out of the boat and respond to the call on his life.

554
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,700
 In the same way, when the waves are crashing in your life,

555
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,300
 when the unexpected takes place,

556
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,020
 when the storm takes place in your life,

557
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,860
 you may not be able to clearly see what Jesus is doing,

558
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,900
 but that's where faith gets to intersect with your reality.

559
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,980
 And a person of great faith is a person of great action.

560
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,100
 They say, "I'm coming out because I have faith

561
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,620
 that you are who you say you are."

562
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,640
 And Jesus, if it's you, you,

563
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,980
 the one who's in control of this storm,

564
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,620
 if it's you calling me out of this boat,

565
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,180
 I will come every single time

566
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:19,700
 because faith is the assurance of what we hope for.

567
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,580
 We place all of our hope in you, Jesus,

568
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,740
 the one who's in control.

569
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,920
 And it's the assurance of the things that we do not see.

570
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:30,040
 Therefore, I do not focus on the things that I can see.

571
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,100
 The storm raging around me, my circumstances,

572
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,780
 all of those hard things that you're going through,

573
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,000
 we can't focus on that.

574
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,820
 We have to focus and place our faith and hope in Jesus

575
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,680
 'cause he's the only one who can get us through.

576
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,280
 If you try to step out of that boat

577
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,840
 and onto your storm with anything else,

578
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,020
 you are sure to sink.

579
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,780
 You can't do it.

580
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,320
 No money can do it for you.

581
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,680
 No job can do it for you.

582
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,300
 No person can do it for you.

583
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,140
 You will sink eventually.

584
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:59,420
 The only thing that can allow you to walk on water

585
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,060
 in the midst of your storm

586
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:04,540
 is to know the one who's in control and it's Jesus.

587
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,780
 And I want to wrap up this point with saying,

588
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,080
 I think a lot of us,

589
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,140
 what holds us back, we get to the boat,

590
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,460
 we see the storm and we see, we're like, okay,

591
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,380
 is that Jesus?

592
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,940
 Is that Jesus in the middle of the storm?

593
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,860
 Can I really trust him?

594
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,580
 Can I really step out and be with Jesus

595
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,980
 in this really hard thing?

596
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,760
 'Cause it's really, really hard.

597
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,700
 Is he really gonna show up?

598
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:30,540
 And I think a lot of us are actually afraid to ask Jesus,

599
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,600
 hey, if it's you,

600
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,660
 command me to come out of the boat and walk to you

601
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:36,420
 because we are afraid that he might actually say, come.

602
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:41,340
 He might actually ask you to do it.

603
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:44,540
 A lot of us want the storm.

604
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:47,280
 We don't want Jesus to tell us to come to him in the storm.

605
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,260
 We want Jesus to just to get rid of the storm.

606
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,080
 And that tells me,

607
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,720
 if you just want Jesus to get rid of the storm,

608
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,220
 you don't wanna be with Jesus in the storm,

609
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,560
 you have a wrong view of the storm

610
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,200
 because Jesus is in control of it

611
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,640
 and wants to use it in your life.

612
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,080
 He uses storms for a greater purpose.

613
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,000
 He uses that really hard thing for a greater purpose.

614
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,560
 He's just wanting you to come.

615
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,520
 You have to get out of the boat

616
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,400
 if you're gonna see the way

617
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,240
 that he wants to use that storm in your life.

618
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,240
 If you wanna walk on water in faith,

619
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,080
 you have to be willing to get out of the boat of comfort,

620
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,500
 the boat of fear, the boat of anxiety.

621
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,480
 You have to step out and say, if it's you, tell me to come.

622
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,440
 And when he says, come, you have to go.

623
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,960
 If you wanna see a great work,

624
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,640
 if you wanna see Jesus move in your life,

625
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,880
 you have to be willing to get out of the boat.

626
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,440
 And I think a lot of us are afraid.

627
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,720
 He might call you to give up that addiction in faith.

628
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,840
 He might call you to break up with that person in faith.

629
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,640
 He might call you to stay in that storm

630
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,520
 and that really hard thing

631
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,900
 to have a greater dependency on him in faith.

632
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:56,680
 He might call you to move somewhere or to quit that job

633
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,000
 or to join a church and become a member.

634
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,320
 He might call you to do that thing.

635
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,580
 So a lot of us sit back and we're like,

636
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,560
 I think I'm okay in the boat.

637
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,460
 Even if that's Jesus, I don't want him

638
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:09,520
 because you're afraid of the cost.

639
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,240
 You're afraid of what he'll do with you in that storm.

640
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,680
 You're afraid that he might actually say, come,

641
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,760
 step into the storm and I am with you

642
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,020
 because we don't actually know the Jesus who's in control.

643
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:26,540
 But if you would trust,

644
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:29,520
 if you would put your faith in that Jesus

645
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,080
 and say, sink or swim, I'm coming, watch what he will do.

646
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,760
 You will walk on the water.

647
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,680
 You will see him move.

648
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,280
 Your pain will start to turn to a greater purpose.

649
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,800
 He works all things for good

650
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,260
 for those who are called according to his purpose.

651
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,840
 That's what he does, that's who he is,

652
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,280
 but he needs you to move in faith,

653
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,800
 to trust him, to see that he is in control

654
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,060
 and watch what he'll do.

655
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:58,100
 Thank you.

656
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:01,600
 Which leads me to point two.

657
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,940
 When you step out in faith,

658
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,100
 when you start to walk on water,

659
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,720
 it does not mean that the storm will cease.

660
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,420
 It does not mean that the storms of life will stop.

661
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,640
 He does not promise you that.

662
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,000
 "The storms did not stop for Peter,"

663
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,280
 'cause what we see next in the chapter.

664
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,640
 "How to weather the storm," number two,

665
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,600
 "Keep your eyes on Jesus, not on the storm."

666
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,640
 Keep your eyes on Jesus.

667
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,300
 Don't just see Jesus and then come,

668
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,940
 but keep your eyes on Jesus

669
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,480
 and do not focus on the storm.

670
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,760
 Verse 30, "But when he saw the wind,

671
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,280
 he was afraid and beginning to sink,

672
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,320
 he cried out, 'Lord, save me!'

673
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,560
 And Jesus immediately reached out his hand

674
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,360
 and took hold of him, saying to him,

675
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,240
 'Oh, you of little faith, why did you doubt?'

676
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,080
 Or, 'Why did you fear?'"

677
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,840
 And I want you to notice something key here.

678
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,920
 It says, "But when he saw the wind,

679
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:52,800
 he was then afraid, and then he began to sink."

680
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,280
 Part of the reason why you feel like

681
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,320
 your storms are overbearing

682
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,440
 and that you'll never see the end

683
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,720
 and you feel like you're drowning in the pit of despair

684
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,880
 and that you are enslaved to something

685
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,060
 and you have no control, you see no light,

686
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,280
 you are just drowning further and sinking deeper

687
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,400
 and deeper and deeper,

688
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,720
 is because at some point, you forgot who was in control

689
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,760
 and you got back in the driver's seat of your life.

690
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,280
 And like I said, it never works.

691
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,060
 And at some point, something happened to you.

692
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:27,240
 That old person popped back up in your DMs,

693
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,560
 took your eyes off Jesus,

694
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:32,860
 looked at them, sinks.

695
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:37,480
 At some point, you lost your job unexpectedly.

696
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,480
 What was once a thriving and abiding relationship with Jesus

697
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,280
 suddenly, I don't think Jesus is very good.

698
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,080
 Eyes off Jesus, you begin to sink.

699
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,580
 It doesn't happen overnight.

700
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:51,720
 But at some point, you stopped seeing Jesus as in control

701
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,240
 and you took your eyes off Jesus

702
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,320
 and you gave control to something else in your life

703
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,500
 and the result is that you have been drowning ever since.

704
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,280
 You can't just have this aha moment of faith

705
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,200
 and one day pray a sinner's prayer and be like,

706
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,440
 "Okay, I'm stepping out in faith."

707
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,400
 And then walk and walk and then just fall off

708
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,600
 and go back into your world, you will sink.

709
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:16,420
 And so how do we remain in this posture with Jesus?

710
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:20,940
 John 15, five would say, do this.

711
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:25,680
 I am the vine, you are the branches.

712
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,720
 Whoever abides in me and I in him,

713
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,820
 he it is that bears much fruit.

714
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:34,280
 For apart from me, you can do nothing.

715
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,240
 Apart from me, you can do nothing.

716
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,680
 I remember when I first became a Christian

717
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,080
 after my freshman year of college,

718
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,560
 I was on this mountain high, stepping out of the boat,

719
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,400
 walking on water experience

720
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,360
 and then some waves started to go in my life

721
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,400
 and I was like, "Wait, wait, wait,

722
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,880
 I thought following God meant #blessed,

723
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,000
 love, peace, mercy, freedom, all this crap.

724
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,960
 Why is this still happening?

725
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,240
 'Cause boom, God called me to change my major,

726
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,320
 lost my scholarship.

727
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,600
 Boom, girlfriend of two years, we got to break up.

728
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,200
 Boom, dad gets terminal cancer.

729
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,680
 Boom, boom, boom, storm, wave, wave, wave.

730
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,160
 And at some point I began to think,

731
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,480
 "You know what, God, you're clearly not in control

732
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,600
 of my life, therefore I'm taking back the reins

733
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,440
 of my own life."

734
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,900
 And I began to sink and drown and drown and drown.

735
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:20,000
 'Cause at some point I believed

736
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,520
 that he was no longer in control,

737
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,640
 but you have to keep the faith.

738
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,120
 The same faith that called you out of the boat

739
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,320
 is the same faith that keeps you above the water

740
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,680
 because that faith is fixed on Jesus.

741
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,520
 It does not look to the left or to the right,

742
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,040
 it looks at Jesus.

743
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,040
 And so how do we do that?

744
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,300
 It looks like daily abiding.

745
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:46,300
 If you abide in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit.

746
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,380
 But apart from me, when you look away from me,

747
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,040
 you can do nothing, you're sure to sink.

748
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,480
 And so guys, we say this all the time, but I forget it.

749
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:01,320
 Abiding daily with Christ, waking up, praying.

750
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,240
 Don't go to social media and scroll, scroll, scroll

751
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,480
 and start to fill your mind with comparison

752
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,320
 and all that junk.

753
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,480
 Wake up, pray, begin to open up God's word

754
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,560
 and daily read it, learn from it,

755
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,920
 be around God's people, abiding and talking

756
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,960
 about the things of God.

757
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,520
 Ask yourself right now, just do a self-examination.

758
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,980
 Where are my eyes?

759
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,960
 Where am I abiding?

760
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,600
 Am I walked in?

761
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,320
 Am I on mission?

762
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,640
 Am I doing the things of Christ?

763
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,360
 Does my life bear the fruit and the aroma of Christ?

764
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:36,920
 Or does it look like you're drowning?

765
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,520
 Do you feel like you're sinking?

766
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:43,880
 At what point, at what point did you believe

767
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,560
 that he was no longer in control?

768
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:49,160
 At what point did you believe that you no longer needed him?

769
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,080
 Because I think a lot of times we start to walk on water,

770
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,980
 we start to feel ourself like Beyonce.

771
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:58,600
 We're walking out, we're like, look at me.

772
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,960
 A man of faith, I've got this.

773
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,280
 And then boom, boom, boom, unexpected pregnancy, boom.

774
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,920
 Lost my job, boom.

775
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,460
 Parents divorce, boom.

776
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:12,080
 That ex popped back up, boom.

777
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,200
 That person broke up with me.

778
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,600
 Storm, storm, storm.

779
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,640
 Oh gosh, this isn't what I signed up for.

780
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:22,100
 Back to my old ways, sink, sink, sink.

781
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,480
 And you might need to be here tonight to hear this.

782
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,200
 You have been drowning and trying to hold yourself

783
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,000
 above water for far too long.

784
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,980
 And it's time to remember the same Jesus

785
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,840
 who called you out of the boat

786
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,560
 and into a relationship with him

787
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,760
 is the same Jesus who was with you in the storm

788
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,100
 and he wants you back.

789
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,760
 But you gotta abide with him.

790
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,740
 You gotta keep your eyes fixed on him.

791
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:53,560
 When following Christ, we are called to gaze at Jesus

792
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,940
 and glance at our storms.

793
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,260
 You don't have to act like they're not there.

794
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,020
 You can look at him and say, Jesus, I'm trusting you.

795
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,340
 You see the waves and the winds picking up,

796
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,260
 I'm trusting you.

797
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:07,020
 But where we get in trouble is when the storms come in life,

798
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,640
 we start to gaze at our storms and glance at Jesus.

799
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:13,140
 Okay, yeah, I'll read a Devo every now and then,

800
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,140
 but let me go focus on this over here at my own agenda now.

801
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:15,980
 I'm in control again.

802
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,440
 Okay, yeah, I'll pray or I'll go to the porch

803
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,160
 every now and then.

804
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,000
 That's not it.

805
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,340
 You gotta keep your eyes on Jesus.

806
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,980
 That's how you weather the storm.

807
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,200
 And I'll wrap up with this.

808
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:32,400
 The beauty of this story is that we are the Peter.

809
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:37,540
 We are the men and women who at one point,

810
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,660
 and maybe this isn't you tonight,

811
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,500
 but at one point, you might've been the disciples

812
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,440
 who stayed back on the ship,

813
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,300
 but at one point, a lot of us in here tonight

814
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,060
 said I'm making that step of faith.

815
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:49,980
 But the reality is, is every single one of us tonight

816
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,940
 at one point have taken our eyes off Jesus.

817
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:55,060
 And you will again take your eyes off Jesus

818
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:57,780
 and you will sink and you will get it wrong

819
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:00,340
 because you're sinful.

820
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:03,540
 I'm gonna get it wrong because I'm sinful.

821
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,780
 But the story does not end here.

822
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:07,940
 Let's finish the story.

823
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:13,440
 But when Peter saw the wind,

824
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,820
 he was afraid and began to sink.

825
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,860
 He cried out, "Lord, save me."

826
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,860
 And Jesus immediately reached out his hand

827
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:23,100
 and took hold of him saying,

828
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,940
 "Oh, you of little faith, why did you doubt?"

829
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,500
 And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.

830
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,020
 And those in the boat worshiped him saying,

831
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:34,300
 "Truly, you are the son of God."

832
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:38,660
 The beauty of this story is that it's yours and I's story.

833
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:42,200
 This is the story of our savior.

834
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,900
 This is the story of what we call the good news, the gospel.

835
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,820
 I want you to think about this moment.

836
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:51,760
 Peter comes and is walking on water.

837
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,860
 The winds begin to rise, like I said,

838
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:57,220
 and he looks over, begins to sink.

839
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,640
 And I think a lot of us,

840
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,300
 when we don't read our Bible anymore,

841
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,260
 we go back to that ex who's no good for us.

842
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,540
 And when we make that mistake again,

843
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,140
 or we go back to our pornography,

844
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,580
 or we have that really bad night

845
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,020
 that we said we'd never do again,

846
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,300
 and we'll begin to sink,

847
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,620
 we think that God is like, "Told you so.

848
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,660
 What did I tell you?

849
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:18,020
 Yeah, stay down, learn your lesson."

850
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:22,420
 "I told you, man, you got to keep your eyes on me.

851
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,020
 Don't you remember I'm the one in control.

852
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:24,860
 What are you doing?"

853
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,840
 That's how we think God is.

854
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,380
 But that's not what we see here.

855
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,940
 That's not the heart of our savior.

856
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:29,940
 That's not the heart of Jesus.

857
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,140
 What does he do?

858
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:35,180
 The moment Peter begins to sink, he says, "Lord, save me."

859
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,420
 And it says, immediately,

860
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,680
 Jesus reached out his hand and picked him up.

861
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,880
 And he saved him.

862
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:47,120
 Peter didn't have to walk on shifty ground or solid ground.

863
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:50,460
 He got to be held in the arms of Jesus.

864
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,780
 Jesus was the one walking.

865
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,980
 Peter needed to be carried back to the boat.

866
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,340
 And that's our story.

867
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:02,600
 We were all born in this world on this ship,

868
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:06,660
 floating on the sea of sin.

869
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:10,680
 Sin everywhere,

870
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:15,260
 coming to us like a storm, crashing against us.

871
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:20,840
 And then Jesus comes down from heaven onto earth.

872
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,940
 And a lot of us are like, "What is that?"

873
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:25,380
 The disciples were like, "It's a ghost."

874
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,220
 We're like, "Who is this?

875
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,600
 What's this relationship with Jesus?

876
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,560
 Who's this person that's powerful enough

877
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:33,440
 to walk on the storms, walk on sin, defeat sin?"

878
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,440
 Because that's what Jesus did.

879
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,000
 He came down on earth and he died on the cross.

880
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,960
 We've talked about this before.

881
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,500
 He paid for the sins of the world.

882
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,000
 He lived a perfect life, making him the perfect sacrifice

883
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,120
 in a way that you and I never could

884
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,180
 because our sin deserved death.

885
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:48,880
 But Jesus came and died so that we could live.

886
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,120
 We bring our nothing and get everything because of Jesus.

887
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,800
 But we're the Peter.

888
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,000
 Jesus invites us to come, come in your sin.

889
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,440
 Come join me, I'm with you.

890
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,560
 This is why I'm here.

891
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,060
 And we begin to walk and step out

892
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,580
 into relationship with him.

893
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:10,860
 And we look at Jesus and we're like, "This is amazing."

894
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,560
 But then that habit creeps back up,

895
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,800
 that sin creeps back up.

896
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,740
 And even though Jesus was so faithful,

897
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,400
 and even though there were such sweet moments,

898
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,480
 and even though we remember kind of how good it felt

899
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,740
 to take that step and to feel the solid ground

900
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,200
 that was following Jesus in the midst

901
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,180
 of such a stormy life.

902
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,900
 You remember that high experience at that camp.

903
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,720
 You remember what it was like to trust Jesus.

904
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,860
 You remember what it's like to be a part

905
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,460
 of that Bible study, that thing.

906
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,940
 And if you haven't,

907
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:40,120
 beginning that step is the best decision you could ever make.

908
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,060
 But here's the reality, we're gonna get it wrong

909
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,460
 and eventually your sin is gonna come

910
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,320
 and you're gonna take your eyes off Jesus.

911
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,700
 But the beauty of the cross, the beauty that Jesus died,

912
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,600
 and then three days later rose again, made him,

913
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:57,460
 made his blood, the atonement, the payment for our sin.

914
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:00,780
 So that way, when we sin,

915
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,500
 and we're heading towards death and drowning,

916
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,540
 we get to say, "Jesus saved me."

917
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:08,340
 And he is there every time to pick us up.

918
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:12,580
 And tonight he's asking us the same question he asked Peter.

919
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,780
 "Oh, you of little faith, why did you doubt?

920
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:17,980
 "You've seen me move.

921
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:20,680
 "Don't you remember when I called you out of the boat?

922
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,200
 "Don't you remember when I showed up in your life

923
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,260
 "and I was faithful?

924
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,480
 "Why are you running?

925
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,300
 "Why are you settling and drowning?

926
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,360
 "Quit trying to take control.

927
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,980
 "You know you don't have control."

928
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:36,260
 And he's picked you up and he's carried you back.

929
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,940
 And the beauty of this story

930
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,660
 is that it's not about the storm.

931
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,500
 It's not about the faith of Peter

932
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,540
 or the fear that led Peter to drown.

933
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,880
 It's about the goodness of Jesus.

934
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:52,840
 Because Jesus is the hero of this story.

935
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:57,020
 Peter sunk, Jesus saved.

936
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:00,380
 He picked him up and he carried him back.

937
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,180
 And if you would let your story be that story tonight,

938
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:05,980
 I'm honestly the guy who gets it wrong.

939
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,860
 I'm the girl who's gonna make mistakes.

940
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,380
 I'm the control freak.

941
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,340
 I'm the one that takes my eyes off Jesus.

942
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,580
 But listen, that's the point.

943
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,340
 Jesus is there to pick me up every time

944
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,140
 and carry me back to the boat.

945
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,580
 If you would let that be your story

946
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,420
 and stop trying to convince the world that you're fine

947
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,700
 when you're drowning and you know it,

948
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,860
 the world's gonna look at that and be like, "What is that?"

949
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:28,940
 The same way the disciples looked at Peter

950
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,220
 as Jesus brought him back to the boat,

951
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:35,260
 sat him down and calmed the storm.

952
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,340
 And what did they do?

953
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:40,580
 They fell on their knees and they worshiped.

954
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:46,300
 And they said, "Truly, you are the son of God."

955
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:51,340
 When Jesus came into the scene,

956
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:54,820
 we hear him referred to as, "Behold, the son of God

957
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:58,140
 who takes away the sins of the world."

958
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:02,380
 When the disciples saw Jesus

959
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,940
 who was in control of the storm

960
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:09,100
 and the Jesus who was willing to pick up Peter

961
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,780
 though he took his eyes off of him

962
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:15,520
 and carry him back to safety and cause the storm to cease,

963
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,260
 their response was to worship.

964
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:22,780
 And tonight, may our response be the same.

965
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:26,820
 In your storms of life, your response can be the same,

966
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,340
 not because you stepped out of the boat,

967
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,940
 but because Jesus is there to save you

968
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,040
 when you get it wrong.

969
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,740
 That's why we worship.

970
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,460
 That's why we gather to remind each other

971
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,780
 that we need Jesus.

972
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:41,420
 When will the storm cease?

973
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,320
 I don't know.

974
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:48,220
 But I do know that Jesus is in control of the storm

975
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,260
 and he is with you in the storm

976
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:53,300
 and he is working your storm out for a greater good

977
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,180
 and for a purpose unique to you,

978
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,220
 for your story to declare to the world,

979
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:00,460
 "Don't look at me, look at Jesus carrying me, saving me."

980
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,760
 And the response to that should be to worship.

981
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,820
 Let's pray.

982
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:07,060
 (gentle music)

983
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:10,180
 Father, we worship you for being

984
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:14,260
 the one who's in control.

985
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:18,180
 And when we think we have control and we begin to sink,

986
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,840
 you are the one who picks us up every time.

987
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:25,920
 May that character of you,

988
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,140
 that you don't leave us to drown on our own,

989
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:31,380
 but you pick us up and you carry us back

990
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:34,660
 although we're imperfect and although we're unworthy,

991
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,740
 you say, "Hey, that's why I'm here.

992
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,220
 "That's why I've called you,

993
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,480
 "so you can greater see your need for me,

994
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,580
 "so you can greater understand your need for me

995
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,260
 "to pick you up time and time again.

996
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,640
 "And I'm always gonna be here with you in the storm.

997
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,500
 "You don't have to worry when the storm will end

998
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,940
 "because whether the storm ends or whether it begins,

999
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:53,660
 "I am the same, I am with you, I am here.

1000
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:56,260
 "I am the Jesus who is in control."

1001
00:41:56,260 --> 00:42:01,280
 And may that understanding of the control that you possess

1002
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,680
 lead to such a faith in this room that we say,

1003
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,900
 "I don't wanna stay in the boat.

1004
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,860
 "I just wanna be where Jesus is."

1005
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,580
 And we step out of the boat

1006
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:14,180
 and we'd be people, men and women of faith.

1007
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:18,260
 It says, "Jesus, whatever it looks like, I'm ready.

1008
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:20,580
 "If you say come, I'm going, I'm jumping in.

1009
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:26,660
 "But when I sink, I know, I know, I have faith

1010
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:29,060
 "that you will pick me up every single time."

1011
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:37,620
 Thank you for being that kind of Lord for us tonight

1012
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:38,980
 and every night.

1013
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:40,720
 It's your name that I pray, amen.

1014
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:50,720
